[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.247
TOM SMITH: OK, I'm thrilled to
welcome Atul Gawande to Google

00:00:09.247 --> 00:00:10.830
during the week that
marks a paperback

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.290
publication of his number
one New York Times best

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.450
seller, "Being Mortal: Medicine
and What Matters in the End."

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.670
Dr. Gawande is a
surgeon at the Brigham

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.820
and Women's Hospital in Boston,
a staff writer for The New

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.280
Yorker, and a professor
at Harvard Medical

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.840
School and the Harvard T.H.
Chan School of Public Health.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.850
He's won the Lewis
Thomas Prize for writing

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.280
about science, a MacArthur
Fellowship, and two

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.880
national magazine awards.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.120
In his work in public health,
he is executive director

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.660
of Ariadne labs.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.860
A Joint Center for
health systems innovation

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.460
and chairman of Lifebox,
a nonprofit organization

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.030
making surgery safer globally.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.530
And honestly, I'm
a little surprised

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.510
it doesn't say, like, Olympic
gold medalist or five time

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.060
Grammy winner.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.910
Please join me in giving
Dr. Gawande a warm welcome.

00:01:12.802 --> 00:01:15.010
ATUL GAWANDE: Thank you for
taking time on your lunch

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.660
to come talk about death.

00:01:19.457 --> 00:01:21.040
I'm looking forward
to a conversation.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.020
I'll probably talk for
about 15, 20 minutes

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.710
about the basic thinking
behind the book,

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.750
and then we'll go from there.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.080
So why would I write
about death and dying?

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.290
And the core of it was that
I'm a surgeon, but also

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.650
in public health and became
interested as I was going

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.670
through my training and then
in practice about the fact

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.940
that I was slowly becoming
confident in learning

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.880
how to deal with problems
where we had fixable problems.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.650
We had solutions that we
could offer to many things

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.100
where the human
body could go wrong.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.860
And yet, we are all mortal.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.800
And what I never learned was how
do we deal with the unfixables?

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.480
How do we deal with the
reality of mortality?

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.220
And the thing I found that
came up again and again as I

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.030
entered into practice
and continue to practice

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.720
is that we have a substantial
number of people who come

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.110
in who have incurable problems.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.742
They are the problems of
the frailty of old age.

00:02:31.742 --> 00:02:32.950
They have terminal illnesses.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.590
They have chronic illnesses
that are just getting worse.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.110
And then the puzzle
becomes, well,

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.620
how far do we go in
fighting the consequences

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.370
of an incurable cancer?

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.160
Of an organ failure?

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.000
Of old age?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.940
For example, a piano
teacher comes in.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.830
She has an advanced
cancer in her pelvis.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.750
It's spread to her liver
despite two different lines

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.080
of chemotherapy
that we've tried.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.850
Now what do you
want to have happen?

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.780
What do we all want to
have happen at this point?

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.100
Should we do something?

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.420
Part of the discussion
with her was, well,

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.340
there are no
conventional options.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.850
So there are experiments
we can try, however.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.060
We can try an experimental bone
marrow transplant and high dose

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.090
chemotherapy.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.010
There's something
we can come up with.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.420
Or alternatively, should
we keep her comfortable?

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.300
What she heard as we're having
this discussion is should we

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.760
fight or should we give up?

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.610
Now, what I knew was
instinctively that

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.170
didn't feel like the right
question to be asking,

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.530
but I didn't know how to
think about it differently.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.547
This is the way we
always think about it.

00:03:58.547 --> 00:04:00.130
And so I ended up
writing the book out

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.740
of a desire to try to figure
out what is the way out of that?

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.000
Getting to a better question
and not just a better answer.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.830
Along the way, I
ended up interviewing

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.740
more than 200 people.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.850
More than 200 families,
patients about their experiences

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.500
with very old age,
with terminal illness,

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.650
with incurable conditions.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.610
And what I found was
that the discussion

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.070
about how we deal with mortality
was not what I expected.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.380
It wasn't really about
dying, it was about living.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.770
That the goal was
to be able to have

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.780
not a good death, but
a good life all the way

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.640
to the very end.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.370
And that's where
gradually the key lesson

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.650
emerged from this,
which is that people

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.546
have priorities in their
life besides just surviving.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.170
They have reasons
they want to be alive.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.020
What those reasons are,
what those priorities are,

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.820
you have to ask.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:11.840
Especially when people have
a serious illness or frailty,

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.110
advancing frailty of old
age, you have to ask.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.470
Otherwise our priorities, well,
our priorities for their care

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.690
can be out of alignment
with their priorities

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.570
for what matters to them, and
that's when you get suffering.

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.230
I interviewed people in
old age homes, for example,

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.750
and they'd tell me about
how miserable they were.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.390
And they'd tell me about--

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.630
the most common thing you'd hear
from people in old age homes

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.952
would be, when do
I get to go home?

00:05:45.952 --> 00:05:48.160
Try to probe, like, why does
this not feel like home?

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.720
What is it about this
that is not home?

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.520
And they said, well, I
couldn't have my own furniture

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.100
because, you know,
it's not safe.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.590
You can't have a drink
because it's not safe.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:09.900
You wake up at a set
time, get in the pill line

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.030
where the prescribed close
when they have you do that.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.796
And they choose who you
might have as a roommate,

00:06:18.796 --> 00:06:20.670
you don't have any choice
about those things.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:21.794
You don't have any privacy.

00:06:21.794 --> 00:06:23.820
What does that
sound like to you?

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:24.840
Prison.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.800
Exactly.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.490
And that's what they thought.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.323
They were in prison.

00:06:27.323 --> 00:06:29.040
I interviewed an
85-year-old woman

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.060
who had Alzheimer's disease and
she had a medically ordered,

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:38.610
pureed only diet, and she would
be caught stealing cookies

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:39.990
from her neighbors.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.030
And so they'd
confiscate the cookies

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.700
and then they'd write her up.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.467
Send notes home to their
adult kids, you know.

00:06:47.467 --> 00:06:49.800
And you just want to say, let
her have the damn cookies.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.890
But what we were
not figuring out

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:57.470
was that we weren't
identifying what

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.850
were her priorities besides just
surviving, besides just living

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.500
longer, besides just not
choking on cookies, for example.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.230
And she was telling you
what those priorities

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.230
were by the very fact that
she was stealing cookies.

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.990
That her joy-- here's
this one joy she's got--

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:20.700
was food and the sheer pleasure
of getting to enjoy that.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.800
And why couldn't
that matter to us?

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:30.260
And you see that same problem
in medicine in general.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.990
You know, here's this
woman with a piano

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.360
teacher with advanced
cancer and her pelvis that

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.010
had spread in the
hospital, in pain,

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.650
and we had no
imagination that there

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:48.230
might be something about
her life worth living for.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:51.000
We say, so our
conversation becomes,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.530
should we try something
or should we not?

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:58.350
And then I've seen
the result. We always

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.480
have something to try.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.720
We always have an
operation I can do.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:08.090
And I've taken people to the
operating room out of hope

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:11.360
that we would find
something only to have them

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.860
in the Intensive Care Unit
never to wake up again.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.380
Declining over a couple
of weeks, never getting

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:21.020
to say I'm sorry, never
getting to say I love you,

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.074
never say anything
to say thank you,

00:08:23.074 --> 00:08:24.490
never getting to
set their legacy.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:31.100
And that's when
I realized that--

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.600
well, I'd been
realizing all the way

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.058
that something was
wrong with that,

00:08:34.058 --> 00:08:38.210
but that there might
be a way out of this.

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:42.530
There was a study done of
advanced lung cancer patients

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:43.909
stage four.

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:47.840
This is we don't have a
treatment, a cure for.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.830
We have treatments, but
we don't have a cure.

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:52.460
The average survival is 11
months for the patients.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.620
Half of the patients
were randomized

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.410
to receiving the
usual oncology care,

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:01.040
and the other half received the
usual oncology care and a visit

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.660
with palliative care clinicians.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.954
Palliative care clinicians
focus on making sure

00:09:04.954 --> 00:09:06.620
that you are getting
the treatments that

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.690
improve the quality
of your life,

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:11.240
and it starts with first
identifying what does quality

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.170
of life mean to you?

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:15.020
Asking those questions about
what your priorities are.

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:16.520
And the result was
that those people

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:21.620
who got the oncologist and the
palliative care consultation

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.690
had a very different
outcome from the ones who

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:25.267
just got the oncology care.

00:09:25.267 --> 00:09:26.850
As a cancer surgeon,
people would say,

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:28.820
should I see the palliative
care clinician now?

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.490
And I'm now embarrassed
to say I used to answer,

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:34.070
no, no, no, no, it's
not time for that now.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:35.990
As if, you know, we
still have options.

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:37.910
As if focusing on
quality of care

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.830
was opposed to quantity of care.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.790
And so the result
was that the group

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:49.250
who got the early palliative
care ended up choosing--

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:53.360
they were 90% less likely to be
on chemotherapy at the last two

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.250
weeks of life because
they stopped it sooner.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:00.310
They were 50% less likely
to receive chemotherapy

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.590
in the last three
months of life.

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:05.110
They had more time at home.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:08.140
They spent less time in
the hospital by a third.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.030
They were less likely
to die in the hospital.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:13.240
They started
Hospice care sooner.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.880
They had less suffering
by multiple measures,

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.060
including less
depression and anxiety.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:23.380
They had one third
lower costs, including

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.670
hospitalization chemotherapy.

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:31.680
And the kicker was
they lived 25% longer.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:36.030
If it was a drug, this would
be a multibillion dollar

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:37.590
blockbuster and the
FDA would, like,

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:39.840
put it on expedited approval.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.440
But instead, it was just
having these conversations.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.790
We can't scale everybody having
a palliative care clinician.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:51.220
And in fact, it doesn't
make sense to say,

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.880
I've got my specialist looking
after my quality of life

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.350
and I've got my
specialist looking

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:57.180
after my quality of life.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:00.500
What you really want is
to put them together.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.230
So then how do you do that?

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:08.310
And what I found was that when
I would ask palliative care

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:10.050
doctors who do
this kind of work,

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:11.850
what exactly--
you're in this trial.

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:13.510
What were you doing differently?

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:16.230
How do I scale what you do?

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:18.870
What is your checklist
that I should

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:21.360
be following the next
time I have a patient that

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.890
has this question?

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:29.015
And the first thing they pointed
out was that I talk too much.

00:11:29.015 --> 00:11:30.390
They said, you
know, your problem

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:33.390
is you're an explainaholic.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:37.080
When you have someone
who has a potentially

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:41.850
difficult or unfixable problem,
a serious illness, a terminal

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:45.674
illness, then you
want to ask questions

00:11:45.674 --> 00:11:47.590
that help you learn what
their priorities are.

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:49.006
And that means you
have to listen.

00:11:49.006 --> 00:11:51.690
You have to listen at
least half of the time.

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:53.440
And that means asking questions.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.420
What kind of questions?

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:57.690
Well, start with, what's
your understanding

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:02.520
of where you are right now,
what your situation really is?

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.840
What are your fears
for the future?

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.930
What are your hopes
for the future?

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.060
What are you
willing to sacrifice

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:15.420
and not willing to sacrifice
for the sake of more time?

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:20.310
What's the minimum quality of
life you would find acceptable?

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:22.720
And that gives you
a very different way

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:28.960
of thinking that I'm not just
there to be a retailer giving

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.389
you the facts of your
options, your pros, your cons,

00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:33.430
your risk, your benefits.

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:35.763
Do you want the red shoes or
do you want the blue shoes?

00:12:35.763 --> 00:12:37.850
Tell me what you want now.

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:40.550
It's to say, what
are your goals?

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:43.190
And then how do I serve
as a counselor who

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:46.280
can match what I know
about the options

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.610
to what your goals might be.

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:52.390
I asked the questions to that
piano teacher, for example.

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:54.260
I wrote about it in the book.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.020
And I said, so what's your
understanding of where

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.760
you are with your health?

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:04.610
And she said, I'm going to die.

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:05.320
I know it.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.280
I've been here in the
hospital for two weeks

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.940
just getting worse every day.

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:14.070
People are giving me blood
transfusions and treatments,

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:15.102
but I'm going to die.

00:13:15.102 --> 00:13:16.560
And her husband
later said that was

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:20.910
the first time she'd heard
her just name it, just say it.

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:23.420
This is our situation.

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.262
Then I went to the
second question

00:13:25.262 --> 00:13:26.720
the palliative care
doctor gave me.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:33.050
I said, so what are
your goals then?

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:37.410
And she said, I don't know.

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:40.940
I can't imagine having
any goals at this point.

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:42.720
The palliative care
doctors didn't tell me

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.820
what to do with that one.

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:47.800
So I just went to
the next question.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.720
So I said, then
what are your fears?

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.510
What are your fears for the
future with your health?

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:55.284
And then she gave me a litany.

00:13:55.284 --> 00:13:56.700
She feared being
in more pain, She

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:03.240
feared that she already
was becoming incontinent

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.560
and that she would lose even
more of her dignity lying

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:06.060
there.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.790
She feared she would
never get to go home.

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:10.320
There were people
she wanted to see,

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.861
and she feared she
wouldn't see them.

00:14:14.129 --> 00:14:16.670
Now I understood something about
what really mattered to her.

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:24.470
Along the way I'd
also spent time

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:28.820
interviewing people like Hospice
nurses and traveling with them,

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:33.360
or nursing home directors, or
home health aides and others.

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:37.820
And one of the Hospice
nurses had said to me

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:44.690
that medicine's goal is to
sacrifice your life and time

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:47.970
now for the sake of time later.

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:55.970
Her goal was to give you as
good a possible day today

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:59.180
using the same
medical capabilities,

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.790
regardless of what it
might mean for the future.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:04.370
So the opposite of
sacrificing your time today.

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:07.700
She wanted to give you
the best possible day now

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.270
and then to see what happened.

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:16.970
And so I said to the
teacher, her name was Peggy,

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:20.600
I said, well, I'd met
this nurse and she

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:24.320
said that the goal
of Hospice was

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.680
to see if you can have the
best possible day you can.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:33.120
I said, is that something that
we could try fighting for?

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.120
This isn't about do you
fight or do you give up,

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.620
this is what are
we fighting for?

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.170
And what if what we fought for
was that you could have one

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:41.020
good day?

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:44.620
Seemed like a long time
since you'd had a good day.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:46.300
She said, yes.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.660
It's been a very long time.

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:52.420
That, she felt like,
was worth fighting for.

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:57.730
48 hours later she
went home on Hospice.

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:00.010
And I knew her, I
didn't tell you this,

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:02.710
but I knew her because she
was also my daughter's piano

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:09.360
teacher and was seeing me
for advice about what to do.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.767
And so when she
went home, I also

00:16:10.767 --> 00:16:12.600
had to tell my daughter
that she wouldn't be

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.500
getting piano lessons anymore.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:19.690
And she asked why, and I had
to explain that Peg was dying.

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:21.460
My daughter was 13 then.

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:23.040
She wanted to go
see her and I said I

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.730
didn't think that was possible.

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:32.060
But then a few days later,
I got a call from Peg

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:38.170
and she wanted to know if it was
OK with me and OK with my wife

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:41.470
whether she could start teaching
my daughter, Hunter, piano

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:44.110
again.

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:45.970
That blew my mind.

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:49.510
Here was this woman laid
out, bedridden, incontinent,

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:52.420
in pain, and now she was
calling about the idea

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:53.920
that she could start
teaching again?

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:58.667
I got to talk to her
Hospice nurse sometime later

00:16:58.667 --> 00:16:59.750
and I said, what happened?

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:01.380
What did you do?

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:03.620
She says, well, she got
home and we spent some time,

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.450
and we talked, and we
said, you know, what

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:06.943
would a good day be for you?

00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:08.359
And on the first
couple of days it

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:10.680
was just get the
pain under control.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.369
And so she increased
the pain dosages.

00:17:13.369 --> 00:17:16.288
They got a bed put
in in the dining room

00:17:16.288 --> 00:17:18.829
so she didn't have to go up the
stairs or go to the bathroom.

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:19.910
They got a bedside commode.

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:22.035
They figured out how to
get her bathed and dressed,

00:17:22.035 --> 00:17:24.359
and just get a
life under control.

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:26.690
And as those
challenges got solved,

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:30.380
her anxieties fell and
she lifted her sights.

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:31.820
She didn't have children.

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:35.060
She was a teacher and she wanted
to teach again in the time

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:36.980
that she had.

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:40.850
My daughter ended up getting
lessons for the next four weeks

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:41.480
with her.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.700
She lived for six more weeks.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:48.640
In the last week, they then
had two recitals for her.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:54.429
One of the students
that she'd had

00:17:54.429 --> 00:17:56.470
in the past who flew in
from all over the country

00:17:56.470 --> 00:18:01.120
to play for her, and then the
other of her current students

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.300
from elementary
school to high school.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.150
And we sat in her living room
and listened to these children

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:08.910
play.

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:14.790
And then afterwards, Peg
took them aside one by one

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:20.190
and she had a little
something for them.

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:23.580
And what she had set aside
for my daughter, Hunter,

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.560
was a book of music
that she wanted

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:29.100
her to learn and to keep.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.560
And then one more gift which
was she put her arm around her

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:37.230
and said, you're special and I
don't want you to forget that.

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:44.930
And she wanted all the
children to know that.

00:18:47.696 --> 00:18:52.880
That gap was
extraordinary to me.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:57.230
We never imagined to ourselves
that there was that life worth

00:18:57.230 --> 00:19:03.660
living, and that medicine
was actually in our neglect

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:06.170
and in our unwillingness to
ask those questions about what

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:07.610
matters to people.

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:12.190
That we were actually
sacrificing those abilities.

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:14.600
And that furthermore, it's
not just at the very end

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.100
that we need to ask
these questions,

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.700
we need ask these questions
from the minute people

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.630
start needing our help.

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:25.410
When you have a parent
who's frail enough where

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:28.440
a question comes up of whether
they can live at home or not

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:33.600
anymore, or where they
have other illnesses that

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:37.950
aren't going to go
away, being able to ask,

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:39.610
what are your priorities?

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:42.080
What really matters?

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.190
Her priority was
she wanted to teach.

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:47.230
Another person I
spoke to, they said,

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:48.980
if I can eat chocolate
ice cream and watch

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.860
football on television, that
would be good enough for me.

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:55.040
I'd be willing go
through a lot for that.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.260
If I can't have that, let me go.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:58.910
It's like the best
living will ever.

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:04.972
And I tell the story of my
dad, who had a brain tumor.

00:20:04.972 --> 00:20:07.430
And I said, chocolate ice cream
and football on television?

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:08.870
What do you think?

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:11.289
Not good enough for him.

00:20:11.289 --> 00:20:12.830
For him, it was
sitting at the dinner

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:14.540
table with family and friends.

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.130
He was an extremely
social person,

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:20.900
and it was food and talk
that was life for him.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:24.760
And his tumor would eventually
take that away, and we knew it.

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.670
And being able to know
and have that discussion,

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:32.680
and to have that clarity that
there can be goals besides just

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:37.990
living longer, and that we can
fight to be able to have people

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:38.652
have those.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:49.390
The striking thing to me, and
where I'd love to open it up

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:52.420
is that in medicine
and in society

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:57.220
we fail to recognize that just
fixing problems and making

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:01.880
them go away is not the only
way we can provide help.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.090
That in very
difficult situations,

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:08.680
a serious illness, a
disaster of any kind,

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:13.460
being able to say for a
minute, what is the goal?

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.340
What are we fighting for now?

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.800
What are we willing
to lose along the way,

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.820
and what are we not willing
to lose, is transformative.

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:24.580
And somehow, we haven't
had those conversations.

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.470
We have to have them earlier.

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:28.060
We have to have the more.

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.640
We have to do it better.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.430
We've had a 50 year experiment
in the medical world of not

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:36.430
taking that approach of having
a very narrow focus on defeating

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:40.600
disease without thinking about
the larger idea of well-being.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:44.170
That well-being is bigger than
just health, independence,

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:46.309
and survival.

00:21:46.309 --> 00:21:48.350
We want to be healthy, we
want to be independent,

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:51.190
we want to survive for
reasons, and that we can still

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:56.770
serve those even when health and
independence aren't possible.

00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:58.870
By failing to
recognize that, we had

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:00.730
50 years of
medicalizing mortality,

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:04.690
and the result has been
suffering, incredible cost.

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:09.430
But we are capable of taking
a wider view, of becoming

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:11.650
consistent and more
systematic about being

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:12.860
clear about our goals.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.520
Whether it's in our senior
retirement communities,

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:20.240
nursing homes, medical
practices, or elsewhere.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:23.740
It is not actually
that much to change.

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:25.720
In the three years since
we released the book,

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.120
we've gone from thinking
that these conversations were

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:32.160
death panels about whether
you fight or give up.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:36.250
As if the choices are we should
be getting people all give up.

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:38.590
But instead to be about
what are we fighting

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:42.210
for for you along the way?

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:44.440
And so it's not
that much to change,

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.770
and yet it's everything.

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:49.245
Thank you.

00:22:49.245 --> 00:22:53.205
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:57.767 --> 00:22:58.850
TOM SMITH: Thanks so much.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:06.650
In the circles I run in,
discussion of your book

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:09.890
is really like
cocktail party talk.

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:10.620
Many of us--

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:12.495
ATUL GAWANDE: Do you
sit there talking about,

00:23:12.495 --> 00:23:15.110
would you want the
chocolate ice cream?

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:19.400
TOM SMITH: Well, certainly
many of us in my social circle

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:25.550
and demographic have had parents
who've faced aging and terminal

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:30.530
illness, and your book has
provided many great models

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:33.805
for us to help us refine
our thinking about this.

00:23:33.805 --> 00:23:35.180
So I've got a
bunch of questions.

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:35.900
ATUL GAWANDE: OK.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:38.520
TOM SMITH: I'm going to try
not to monopolize your time

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.450
to give the audience a
chance to ask a few, too.

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:44.510
One simple but profound
point that your book makes

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:47.930
is that aging is really
a recent phenomenon.

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:52.760
For most of human history,
people didn't really get old.

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:58.550
And medicine really pushed
out the frontiers faster

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:03.980
than society and policy has
been able to keep up with.

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:07.430
We've been trying to
adapt, and some of the--

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:09.140
you write about
some of the people

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:10.820
who have been real
innovators in trying

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:13.820
to address some of
the issues that you

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:16.890
discuss today and discuss
at length in your book.

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:19.490
You write about Karen
Wilson, the visionary who

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:22.040
pioneered the concept
of assisted living,

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.894
and I was really surprised to
hear what the origins were.

00:24:25.894 --> 00:24:28.310
So can you tell us what she
originally had in mind and how

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:29.540
that all played out?

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:30.331
ATUL GAWANDE: Yeah.

00:24:30.331 --> 00:24:32.360
Let me try to put it a
little bit in context.

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.510
So 1900, so a century
ago, the average survival

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:39.110
of the United States
was your life expectancy

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:41.220
was in your mid 40s.

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:42.800
And that was a typical life.

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:46.089
You'd have seven
kids, and you would

00:24:46.089 --> 00:24:48.380
have them as early as possible
so they could be helping

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:50.450
take care of you when you
were 45 because at that point,

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:52.866
you were getting pretty old
and it's hard to even function

00:24:52.866 --> 00:24:53.960
or work in the same way.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.270
That said, you had 5%
or 10% who would live,

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:59.900
you know, about 70 years or
so, but it was very small part

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:01.890
of the population.

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:05.450
And where that
dramatically changed-- so

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:07.580
in the course of
this century, we

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:09.920
have added on average
more than 35 years

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.760
to people's life expectancy.

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.140
And that is a dramatic shift.

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:16.040
Now, we also have
made it so that you

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.500
have phenomenally better
health along the way,

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:21.290
but you still likely have
eight years of dependency.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.370
And we don't like
thinking about that.

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:31.770
Now, the further thing is
that as you get older--

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:33.771
a psychologist at Stanford
named Laura Carlson--

00:25:33.771 --> 00:25:35.394
I devoted a whole
chapter because she's

00:25:35.394 --> 00:25:36.390
completely fascinating.

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:42.780
She's followed people
for 30 years as they age.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:47.334
And as people age, she found,
yes, your health goes down.

00:25:47.334 --> 00:25:50.520
Yes, you start losing functions.

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:53.130
Sorry, that's just what happens.

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:56.610
But they also become happier.

00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:58.900
They are more likely
to be fulfilled.

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.440
They become more likely to
have love in their life.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:04.080
They become less likely to
have anxiety and depression.

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:09.760
They become less focused
on acquiring stuff.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:13.761
You know, getting more toys,
bigger house, all the status

00:26:13.761 --> 00:26:14.260
symbols.

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:17.350
They become less focused on
building their social network.

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:19.450
They become more
focused on deeper, more

00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:21.880
intimate relationships with
a smaller, tighter group

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:26.190
of people and spending
real time with people.

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:33.760
And so the recognition that what
we build for that phase of life

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.870
is a health system that
assumes your goal is health

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:40.540
and survival, that without
health and independence,

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:43.840
that surely life sucks.

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.240
But the truth of the
matter is that even

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:49.690
as your health and
your functions decline,

00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:52.540
you can have an even
more fulfilling life

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:53.710
as time goes on.

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:58.090
Karen Wilson's mother
had a stroke at age 50

00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:02.170
and became paralyzed on
one half of her body,

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:04.600
but she was otherwise there.

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.660
You know, wheelchair bound,
she needed help and assistance

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:09.190
in daily life.

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:11.200
But you can imagine
in your 50s then,

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.230
you're in a nursing
home needing assistance

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:17.350
and no one thinks you have
a life worth living anymore.

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:20.200
That the only thing
worthwhile is just

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:23.650
being fed, and getting the
right medicines, and being safe.

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:30.610
And the people who make
decisions about where someone

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:34.180
will live in old age is
usually not the old age person

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:34.690
themselves.

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:37.180
It's usually the adult
children of that person,

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:39.220
and they're usually
pushing them to go

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.841
do these visits
because they feel

00:27:41.841 --> 00:27:43.090
like they're not safe at home.

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:45.256
And so their number one
question when they go around

00:27:45.256 --> 00:27:47.430
is will my father,
will my mother be safe?

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:52.570
Not will they be lonely?

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:53.412
Will they be happy?

00:27:53.412 --> 00:27:54.370
Will they be satisfied?

00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:55.371
Will they be fulfilled?

00:27:55.371 --> 00:27:56.620
Are they going to be helpless?

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:58.370
Are they going to have
things they can do?

00:27:58.370 --> 00:27:59.290
Can they still grow?

00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:01.690
Can they learn stuff?

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:06.190
And Karen's mother
was young enough

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:08.770
and bull headed
enough to say, I want

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:13.900
a place where I have a lock
on the door, where I can cook

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:16.505
my own food, do my own thing.

00:28:16.505 --> 00:28:18.130
You mean, in the
refrigerator you could

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:21.910
have whatever food you want?

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:25.060
You know, like, that's totally
against the regulations.

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:28.170
A diabetic could have a
soda in their refrigerator?

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:31.540
And the revolution
of assisted living

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:34.000
was the idea that
you would genuinely

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.860
have control over your life.

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:39.670
That people would be coming into
your home, it's your apartment,

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:45.340
and helping you have the
independence of making choices

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:46.300
for yourself.

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:48.710
And that was originally
the way that she built it.

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:52.060
It spread, it was very popular.

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:57.910
And then as it became a
Wall Street phenomenon where

00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:01.870
then the two things
happened-- number one,

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:04.270
we started applying the
rules of nursing homes

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:06.130
to it where the
focus became again

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:10.810
on more the safety than on
the filling notion of it.

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:13.234
And second, the whole
training system behind it

00:29:13.234 --> 00:29:14.650
came out of the
nursing home world

00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:17.350
and so they lost
that sense of being

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:21.430
about enabling people's
privacy, autonomy, capability

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:23.050
along the way.

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:24.760
I do profile a
bunch of innovators

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:26.650
who have made pockets work.

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:29.380
One guy named Bill Thomas who
calls himself a nursing home

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:32.650
abolitionist and
builds places where

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:36.040
you can have your
own pets, you live

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:38.380
in small groups of
10 to 12 people,

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:43.240
and they make them all no
more expensive than what

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:45.850
Medicaid will pay for.

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:49.300
And they've built these places
in every state in the country

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:50.500
now.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:56.507
But the innovation-- let me
just add another point here.

00:29:56.507 --> 00:29:57.340
I know I'm going on.

00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:01.176
But one thing that is
very interesting to me

00:30:01.176 --> 00:30:02.800
is some of the most
exciting innovation

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:06.700
that I see going on in this
particular space of recognizing

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.610
the fact that people are going
to get to live on average 85

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:12.640
years or longer in
their lives, but we

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:18.980
don't build products or capacity
innovations for that community.

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:22.180
And I think it's partly because
the innovation cycle, you know,

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:27.040
is that engineers often build
for the problems they know,

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.720
and they see, and they have.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:32.560
On my board of my
Public Health Institute

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:35.410
is David Ebersman, who
is the CFO of Facebook.

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:37.570
And he would explain
to me, you know,

00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:41.680
whenever they had any game
released on the Facebook

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:44.770
website site, Mark
Zuckerberg, they

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:48.292
would get emails at 2:00
in the morning on Saturday.

00:30:48.292 --> 00:30:49.500
What the hell with this game?

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:50.770
This sucks.

00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:52.660
Like, I tried to play
it and this goes wrong,

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:54.590
and this goes wrong.

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:56.290
It is constant
iteration about stuff

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:59.160
that you know and
are deeply part of.

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:01.420
Whereas going into the
space of this world

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:03.220
where you might have
a 75-year-old trying

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:06.460
to figure out how to
navigate the world,

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:08.680
we don't think about how
it's designed for that.

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:12.520
Five years after the
book ends, my mother

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.320
has lived without my
father now for five years.

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:17.410
She turned 80, she
had a car wreck,

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:19.900
I'm trying to figure out how
to get the keys away from her.

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:20.800
That is freedom for her.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.633
That's like one of the
most important things

00:31:22.633 --> 00:31:26.210
that she does not
lose that control.

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:29.230
I had her visit the places
in the book that were

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:30.480
some of the pioneering places.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.105
She Actually picked
one of them to move

00:31:32.105 --> 00:31:35.379
into as a senior
retirement community.

00:31:35.379 --> 00:31:37.420
And one of the first things
she did there was she

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:40.750
taught a class to the
other senior citizens

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:45.280
about how to access
Lyft, because that

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:46.960
became her freedom.

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:51.370
It is not designed for
the 85-year-old people

00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:53.234
in this institution.

00:31:53.234 --> 00:31:55.150
You know, my mom just
happens to be incredibly

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:58.180
savvy at being able to
navigate on a very small screen

00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:02.530
how to pull up Uber and access
it, and get them to recognize

00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:06.310
which of the buildings
in this 250 unit complex

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:08.860
is the one that you
need to come to find me,

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.770
and et cetera, et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:13.427
Because you don't
have an engineer who

00:32:13.427 --> 00:32:15.010
is iterating over
and over again like,

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:17.500
yeah, I ran into this
problem 50 times this week.

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:18.910
I've got to fix this.

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:22.270
So getting into that innovation
cycle where you are in that

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:25.420
world and you understand
what's needed for expanding

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:28.210
the freedoms and autonomy-- just
a side point while I've got you

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:28.790
here--

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:35.519
is worth gold if you understand
how to go after these problems.

00:32:35.519 --> 00:32:37.810
TOM SMITH: There are a number
of people in the audience

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:40.185
and I know a number of people
on the live stream who will

00:32:40.185 --> 00:32:42.760
resonate with this being the--

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:46.034
we have an employee group
called the Greyglers, who are--

00:32:46.034 --> 00:32:47.200
ATUL GAWANDE: The Grigglers?

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:47.875
TOM SMITH: Grey.

00:32:47.875 --> 00:32:49.140
ATUL GAWANDE: Oh, the Greyglers.

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:49.410
TOM SMITH: Greyglers, yes.

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:50.201
ATUL GAWANDE: Yeah.

00:32:50.201 --> 00:32:51.270
OK.

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:53.940
TOM SMITH: And who
are fierce advocates

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:59.725
for making technology
accessible to aging people

00:32:59.725 --> 00:33:00.600
because we know some.

00:33:03.239 --> 00:33:05.030
You mentioned the car
keys for your mother.

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:07.960
That's a real symbol
for so many people.

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:11.460
It was a struggle with
my father even after he

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.550
was functionally blind.

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:16.860
And what we ended up with
was that he kept the car

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:22.860
keys in the drawer
by his desk, but we

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:24.620
didn't have the car anymore.

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:26.640
It worked out well.

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:34.380
You write that the
practice of geriatrics

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:37.620
can really increase the chances
that patients stay independent,

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:39.430
do not become
depressed, et cetera.

00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:42.510
But Medicare doesn't reimburse
for many of these services,

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:45.960
although they will happily pay
for a pacemaker or whatever.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.750
So how should insurers,
or more broadly,

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:52.950
society think about
these services in a way

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:55.030
so that more people can
get the benefit of them?

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:57.280
ATUL GAWANDE: I think it's
really important, actually,

00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:00.630
and I wrote a follow up article
in the New Yorker this January

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:05.610
about this general phenomenon.

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:09.850
What we're recognizing is that
we built the health system

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:11.790
especially in the
1950s and 1960s

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:14.429
when the major value of
scientific discoveries

00:34:14.429 --> 00:34:17.639
in health care was that
they could rescue you.

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:19.860
Penicillin is the
classic case, right?

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:22.739
You've got the pneumonia,
now I can cure it.

00:34:22.739 --> 00:34:27.449
Or a surgical procedure where
we can take out the cancer

00:34:27.449 --> 00:34:29.580
or something like that.

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:31.650
As we develop
computational capability

00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:33.449
in the '60s and the
'70s, you started

00:34:33.449 --> 00:34:35.550
to be able to look at
what's going to happen

00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:37.560
to people ahead of you.

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.469
There's a famous study called
the Framingham Heart Study that

00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:43.800
followed the population of
Framingham, Massachusetts

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:46.357
over many years of time,
and then could really

00:34:46.357 --> 00:34:47.940
look at the predictors
of what's going

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:51.000
to happen in the most crude
ways, much cruder than anything

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.600
that you know how to do now.

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:55.679
And that's where we figured out
that high blood pressure, which

00:34:55.679 --> 00:34:57.930
we didn't even
know was a disease,

00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:00.420
was, in fact, one of
the biggest causes

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:05.980
of cardiovascular disease,
including heart attack, stroke,

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:07.647
and dementia.

00:35:07.647 --> 00:35:10.105
And that if you could control
it with very cheap drugs that

00:35:10.105 --> 00:35:12.660
were available, you
had remarkable effects

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:14.250
on people's lives.

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:15.960
Well, fast forward
to where we are now.

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:19.540
Add in genomics, add in
the ability to look at--

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:22.290
zip code is even more powerful
than your genetic code

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:25.200
in predicting what kinds
of illnesses and conditions

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.690
you may be facing.

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:28.440
Being able to look at
your buying patterns

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:31.545
to see what the indications are
about your pattern of living

00:35:31.545 --> 00:35:32.670
and other things like that.

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:34.980
Being able to have
wearables that now contract

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:36.870
not just your pulse,
but your sleep

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:41.340
habits, your eating habits,
and other things like that.

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.680
Build those in and
then make it so we

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.990
begin to integrate
that information back

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:49.140
into our understanding.

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:51.330
A clinician and a
patient working together

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:53.790
around the goals they
consider they've identified

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:55.800
as your most important goals.

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.890
That's what a geriatrician
is doing in analog.

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:00.990
A geriatrician is
following people

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:03.270
over a long period of time.

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:06.720
Not doing any procedures,
but acting ahead of problems.

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:10.200
Problems like, is this person
going to be at risk of falling?

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:12.210
Having a geriatrician
reduces the likelihood

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:15.900
that someone who's
elderly has a serious fall

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.070
that results in a fracture.

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:20.070
Increases the likelihood they
can live at home independently.

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:21.400
Those kinds of things.

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:25.440
Well, that analog
capability we under-resource

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:30.480
because we've built a system for
rescue, not for, as I call it,

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.230
incremental care.

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:35.460
Not for prediction, maintenance,
and systematic care.

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:38.350
That ability is
only exploding now.

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:40.830
In fact, I've argued
that our evidences

00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:45.570
that our ability to act
predictively and incrementally

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:49.410
has now exceeded the value
of our rescue capability,

00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:51.450
and that will only increase.

00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:54.480
We sell insurance
on a yearly basis.

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:58.050
It's built for rescue payment.

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:01.530
We are instead
acting now on things

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:05.410
that will take five, six, ten
years to make a difference.

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:08.010
And so insurers
typically only have you

00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:10.740
for a little bit of time
before they bounce you

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:12.070
to something else.

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:14.260
And so that whole
market has to change.

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:17.610
We have to move from a insurance
model to a subscription,

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:19.860
or really I'd argue
almost a mortgage model

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:23.070
where you're in for 30 years
and you make investments

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:25.770
now together that pay
off down the road.

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:27.930
And how much you're
able to keep on working

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:32.010
and be productive for
society and contribute

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:33.480
in all kinds of different ways.

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.430
So there's pretty
fundamental things

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:38.770
that I think are seeded in
computational capability

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:41.730
that right now doctors
do in very analog ways,

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:46.135
and it's reflected in how we
take care of people in aging.

00:37:46.135 --> 00:37:48.010
TOM SMITH: I'm going to
ask another question.

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:49.426
But if we have
audience questions,

00:37:49.426 --> 00:37:54.390
feel free to line up at the
microphones in either aisle.

00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:58.620
You mentioned the zip
code being important.

00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:02.070
So that leads me to ask about
socioeconomic factors in terms

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:06.270
of access to care,
the kinds of care

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:09.510
that people seek,
things they care about.

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:11.310
Is there a significant
interaction

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:16.170
of various socioeconomic
factors with the topics

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:17.580
you discuss in your book?

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:23.130
ATUL GAWANDE: Yes, there
are very significant ones.

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:30.270
On the one level, let's start
with the very narrow subject of

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:33.660
do you have a relationship
with the clinician

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:36.000
where you've had a discussion
and have discussions

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.740
about what your priorities are?

00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:40.320
It is much more
likely among college

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:45.990
educated women and
people who are better off

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:50.760
socioeconomically that they will
have those conversations, have

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:53.640
a relationship, a trusting
relationship with a clinician,

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:56.490
and that the result is that they
get better care along the way.

00:38:56.490 --> 00:39:01.940
The least likely are high
school education only male

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:04.590
and especially minority.

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:07.245
But give me a high
school educated male

00:39:07.245 --> 00:39:11.520
and they're the least likely to
have longstanding relationships

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:13.530
in health care, and
especially with someone

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:16.770
who would have these
conversations to have

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:21.960
the goals set and to be able to
have that before crisis comes.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:26.940
You go a little bit farther,
and this is my now public health

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:30.305
hat on, I'd done
an analysis that

00:39:30.305 --> 00:39:31.680
got some press a
couple of months

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:38.490
ago while the ACA was under
attack and under an effort

00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:39.910
to repeal it.

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:43.050
And what we found was looking
at the last 10 years of data

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:46.612
around people who'd
gained Medicaid--

00:39:46.612 --> 00:39:48.570
so there have been Medicaid
expansions and then

00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:50.100
the ACA expansion.

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:53.450
And the interesting thing
is that the biggest benefit

00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:57.434
first for people's health wasn't
that they got emergency care.

00:39:57.434 --> 00:39:59.850
They were getting emergency
care, it just bankrupted them.

00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:02.160
So the most immediate
effect was that they receive

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.260
financial protection,
and debt went down

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:06.090
bankruptcies went down.

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:09.230
Then as people get a regular
source of care over time

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:11.750
and get access to
needed medication,

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:14.090
they are much more
consistently getting care.

00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:16.190
And it took about
five years, but you

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:19.350
start to see mortality
reduction at five years.

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:21.650
It's about a 6%
reduction in mortality,

00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:24.740
and then it's about a
1% increase in mortality

00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:25.790
after that.

00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:28.640
And the biggest gains are in
the chronic disease arenas.

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:32.180
So it's gains in
hypertension, and diabetes,

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:37.440
and heart disease,
HIV, and cancer care.

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:39.290
So people with those
kinds of conditions

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:40.998
are the ones that fare
the best, and it's

00:40:40.998 --> 00:40:44.164
a reflection of the fact that
it's consistent care over time

00:40:44.164 --> 00:40:45.830
and that the people
who are getting that

00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:48.260
are really at the highest
socioeconomic ends.

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:52.100
We have about a greater
than 15 year difference

00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:55.280
in life expectancy between
the top 10% earners

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:57.050
and the bottom 10% earners.

00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:59.890
But we see between cities
like San Francisco and Boston,

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:05.420
it's only a six year difference
between the bottom and the top.

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:08.670
Go to Las Vegas and it's
a 25 year difference.

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:11.630
So those socioeconomic
factors are

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:12.840
very important and powerful.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:15.530
And I think the way they play
out are in the likelihood

00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:18.510
that you have consistent,
regular source of care,

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:19.772
the needed medication.

00:41:19.772 --> 00:41:21.230
Because I think
that's the evidence

00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:25.530
of what is ultimately lifesaving
and improves quality of life.

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:26.901
TOM SMITH: Thanks.

00:41:26.901 --> 00:41:28.400
We've got a number
of people who are

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.490
interested in asking questions,
so if we can start over here

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:32.364
please.

00:41:32.364 --> 00:41:33.030
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:34.260
Thanks for being here.

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:35.932
My aunt passed
away this morning.

00:41:35.932 --> 00:41:36.890
ATUL GAWANDE: Oh, gosh.

00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:37.615
Sorry.

00:41:37.615 --> 00:41:39.740
AUDIENCE: Well, actually,
everyone was quite happy.

00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:42.020
She'd been a vegetable
for about four years--

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:43.010
ATUL GAWANDE: OK.

00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:45.020
AUDIENCE: --because
of Alzheimer's.

00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:48.710
I was wondering what the
state in the medical community

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:51.380
was right now about
not treating people.

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:53.390
The place she was
in was just so good

00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:55.520
at making sure she didn't
catch the pneumonia,

00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:58.640
and was well-fed, and didn't
get the bedsores by flipping her

00:41:58.640 --> 00:41:59.930
over correctly.

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:03.110
Which sounds good in some
sense, but for her it

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:06.040
led to a much longer life than
she would have rather had.

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:08.540
So I was wondering if you could
comment on the state of what

00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:09.590
things are now.

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:11.048
ATUL GAWANDE: Did
you feel that you

00:42:11.048 --> 00:42:14.450
knew that she had
expressed what she

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:17.561
would be willing to go through
and not willing to go through?

00:42:17.561 --> 00:42:19.310
AUDIENCE: Well, she
was very religious so,

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:21.560
like, a doctor assisted
suicide would have been out

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:22.970
of the question for her.

00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:24.980
So she wanted some
sort of system

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:28.177
where she would catch a
disease like pneumonia and die.

00:42:28.177 --> 00:42:29.010
ATUL GAWANDE: Right.

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:31.370
AUDIENCE: But they weren't
letting that happen.

00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:37.744
ATUL GAWANDE: So I think that's
really crucial that when--

00:42:37.744 --> 00:42:39.160
the first thing
that has to happen

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:40.826
is people have to
have the conversation.

00:42:40.826 --> 00:42:43.600
And it's amazing, actually,
that she as she was

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:46.330
progressing with
Alzheimer's, that you all

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:48.460
had a conversation
enough to know

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:52.420
that those were the kinds
of decisions she would make.

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:56.500
Then the second question is,
can people follow through

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:58.360
on what she's asked?

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:01.610
Do we actually listen
and then follow through?

00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:05.140
The first world is
the clinical world,

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:08.320
and a lot of the
time people are very

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:14.230
uncomfortable being willing to
listen to say, look, it is--

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:18.520
sometimes people call
pneumonia man's best friend

00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:21.992
because it is
painless and it is not

00:43:21.992 --> 00:43:23.950
uncommon in Alzheimer's
disease that you either

00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:28.470
get a urinary tract
infection or pneumonia.

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:32.810
And then people may say--
my father was one of them,

00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:35.470
he got a pneumonia
towards the end.

00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:38.900
My mother did not
follow through on--

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:40.530
I told the painful
part of our story,

00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:43.910
which is that then when he
could no longer make decisions,

00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:47.180
my mother reversed
Hospice, called 911

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:50.960
when he got
difficulty breathing,

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:54.470
came to the hospital,
they resuscitated him,

00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:57.350
gave him antibiotics,
and he signed himself

00:43:57.350 --> 00:43:59.480
out at 5 AM in the hospital
saying, goddamn it,

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:00.660
this is not what I wanted.

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:03.064
I woke up and here
I am, and now they

00:44:03.064 --> 00:44:04.730
won't give me pain
medicine because they

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:05.813
say it stops me breathing.

00:44:05.813 --> 00:44:07.640
So he was in terrible pain.

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:11.810
And he'd had an easy way out,
and now that wasn't happening.

00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:15.039
So then he said, now,
you, Atul, are the one.

00:44:15.039 --> 00:44:16.080
You have to listen to me.

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:19.580
This is what I want to say
that we really are going to do.

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:23.000
And even his own
colleagues in the hospital

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.540
wouldn't follow through and
listen to what he had to say.

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:30.247
There was no, like,
lawsuit at risk here,

00:44:30.247 --> 00:44:32.330
they just couldn't wrap
their head around the fact

00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:34.020
that he had priorities.

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:36.020
And those priorities were
about the kind of life

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:37.436
that he wanted to
be able to live,

00:44:37.436 --> 00:44:40.910
and if he couldn't live
it, then let him go.

00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:44.370
And so one barrier are
the clinical places.

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:49.160
And they can be very
safe, take wonderful care,

00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:52.670
really be caring
people, but not listen

00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:56.710
to what she has indicated
is the quality of life.

00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:59.007
They would be the kind of
place that also would say,

00:44:59.007 --> 00:45:00.590
you know, if she was
stealing cookies,

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:01.940
wouldn't let her have
the cookies because it

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:03.350
wouldn't be safe, right?

00:45:03.350 --> 00:45:08.960
And being able to recognize
that you have a right

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:12.200
to express what your
goals are and have people

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:13.377
follow those goals.

00:45:13.377 --> 00:45:14.460
And so this is a movement.

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:16.990
And it's important that we
really drive it as a movement.

00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:19.280
Medicare-- I testified
before the Senate

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:22.640
last year on this,
and Medicare, sorry,

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:25.730
nursing home regulations
for the first time

00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:29.210
became included that
you would have a right

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:32.500
to decide what your
sleep schedule is,

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:36.860
that you should have a right
to decide when you want to eat,

00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:41.240
and that you would have
a right to have privacy,

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:43.280
and within certain
limits, some choice

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:45.410
about who your roommate is.

00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:48.734
And, you know, that's
like the beginning.

00:45:48.734 --> 00:45:50.150
Like, that's the
most meager level

00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:52.629
of rights you can imagine,
but it's the start

00:45:52.629 --> 00:45:53.670
of being able to do that.

00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:55.730
The last thing is that
the families sometimes

00:45:55.730 --> 00:46:01.370
are the ones that can
violate it as well.

00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:04.550
One of my colleagues has
called it the seagull syndrome.

00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:08.930
The family member who lives
farthest away flies into town

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:10.240
and craps all over the plan.

00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:15.141
And so you have to come to--

00:46:15.141 --> 00:46:17.015
we have to be able to
name, what is the plan?

00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:23.840
who will make decisions
when you can't, and what

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:28.430
are your instructions for them
about what really matters?

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:29.360
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:30.860
TOM SMITH: Well,
let's see if we can

00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:31.880
get through another question.

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:33.755
ATUL GAWANDE: Sorry, my
answers are all long.

00:46:33.755 --> 00:46:36.092
I'll try to be pithier.

00:46:36.092 --> 00:46:37.670
AUDIENCE: Hi,
thanks for the talk.

00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:40.250
Didn't expect to cry
at work today, but--

00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:41.984
ATUL GAWANDE: Sorry.

00:46:41.984 --> 00:46:44.150
AUDIENCE: In the cancer
study you mentioned earlier,

00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:46.566
you said that the people who
also received palliative care

00:46:46.566 --> 00:46:48.380
lived 25% longer.

00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:50.090
Seems like one
explanation could be

00:46:50.090 --> 00:46:53.090
that they had something
to fight for, to live for,

00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:56.000
and their body's natural
defenses may be stepped up?

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.784
Is their any research
into this topic?

00:46:59.784 --> 00:47:01.700
ATUL GAWANDE: Yeah, it's
hard to know exactly,

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:06.440
but my suspicion is that we
know, for example, getting

00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:11.780
chemotherapy or surgery
that is non-beneficial

00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:13.230
only makes you worse.

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:15.170
They're toxic.

00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:17.090
Surgeries is easy to imagine.

00:47:17.090 --> 00:47:19.600
Almost 10% of the
population has an operation,

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.400
a last ditch operation in
their last week of life.

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:23.960
You've got all of
the complications,

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:25.850
you have all of the
setbacks from that,

00:47:25.850 --> 00:47:28.490
you haven't had time to heal
to actually benefit from it.

00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:30.660
And chemotherapy can
be that way as well.

00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:32.300
But we have a hard
time, it feels

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:33.800
like giving up to
say I'm not going

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:35.570
to go for the chemotherapy.

00:47:35.570 --> 00:47:38.960
But if the chemotherapy
is sacrificing, making

00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:42.030
you lose what was worth
living for in the first place,

00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:45.540
then that can be harm
in and of itself.

00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:49.760
So we know at least some
of it is just taking away

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:54.310
the toxicity of therapies
that are harmful to most

00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:57.260
even if they benefit some few.

00:47:57.260 --> 00:48:01.130
The second component
may well be that story.

00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:04.460
In the nursing home
I wrote about where

00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:06.530
Bill Thomas, the nursing
home abolitionist,

00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:09.020
was the medical
director, he got a start

00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:11.690
by deciding he was going
to let people have pets.

00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:13.810
And of course,
everybody freaked out.

00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:16.370
The staff, the director,
the regulators.

00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:17.370
You know, it's not safe.

00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:19.710
You can't let a pet-- suppose
someone has allergies.

00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:21.847
Who's going to
clean up the poop?

00:48:21.847 --> 00:48:23.180
All of those kinds of questions.

00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:25.070
But he got it through.

00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:27.170
People got to have
their own pets.

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:30.140
And suddenly getting
to have something

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:33.440
that you cared for, something
that gave you love, life

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:36.840
as part of what you're doing,
something to look forward to,

00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:40.280
whatever it was about it,
the use of anti-psychotics

00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:45.800
and anti-depressants fell by a
third and survival increased.

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:47.600
So there's something to both.

00:48:50.528 --> 00:48:51.510
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:53.660
It seemed like
reframing the question

00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:55.630
and addressing the
problem in a different way

00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:57.180
was crucial to this book.

00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:59.640
What other areas of
medicine or society at large

00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:03.384
do you think really need to
have the problem reframed?

00:49:03.384 --> 00:49:04.800
ATUL GAWANDE: More
and more I find

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:10.840
that having had that problem
reframed in that way to say,

00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:14.670
which is basically,
now what's the goal?

00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:16.980
Knowing that the
goal has to be bigger

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:19.445
than the survival question.

00:49:19.445 --> 00:49:21.570
I find I run into this all
the time and that people

00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:22.950
who run into it frequently.

00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:26.670
That basically bad situations,
handling bad situations

00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:33.480
are often where organizations
and individuals hit the wall.

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:36.709
You made a plan,
it was to achieve

00:49:36.709 --> 00:49:38.250
X, goal you forget
the goal, and then

00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:40.110
you start plowing
ahead on the plan.

00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:42.720
But when it doesn't
work out, things

00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:45.780
aren't really what you hoped
they would be, we don't often

00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:49.920
reset and really ask, what
is the goal along the way?

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:52.805
What are we actually
trying to accomplish?

00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:59.410
And then how do we align what
we're doing with that goal?

00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:06.630
So that can be as
simple as any situation

00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:10.230
where you require
the help of others.

00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:13.047
That coordination is always
about setting the goal.

00:50:13.047 --> 00:50:14.880
In retrospect, I'd
written my previous book,

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:19.110
for example, about surgical
care and the use of checklists,

00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:23.070
and trying that out in
surgery in applying, you know,

00:50:23.070 --> 00:50:25.440
the ways that people had
handled safety in aviation

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:26.690
and everything else.

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:28.530
And what we were
slowly learning about--

00:50:28.530 --> 00:50:32.730
so in that book I talk about how
we designed a checklist where

00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:37.980
you would run through
19 key steps out of data

00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:41.010
showing us where the
biggest failures in surgery

00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:43.230
were that could be averted.

00:50:43.230 --> 00:50:48.300
That this two minute checklist
before every operation

00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:52.840
reduce deaths 47% across
eight cities in the world.

00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:53.926
We now have replicated it.

00:50:53.926 --> 00:50:55.050
We rolled it out in France.

00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:57.510
It was a 35%
reduction in mortality

00:50:57.510 --> 00:51:04.470
across France, 21% in Scotland,
22% in South Carolina.

00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:07.990
And then we've slowly picked
apart what has made it work.

00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:11.190
And we're getting bigger
benefit than just, you know,

00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:13.080
it's like make sure
you have an antibiotic

00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:16.705
and make sure that you
identified the right patient.

00:51:16.705 --> 00:51:18.960
That you're operating
on the right person,

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:20.850
doing the right operation.

00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:24.000
The biggest values comes
from the team actually

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.220
stopping and figuring
out, all right,

00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:29.420
what is the goal here today?

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:32.600
You know, it's the nurse, the
anesthesiologist, the surgeon

00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:34.400
saying, just for a minute--

00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:40.490
the surgeon reviews what's the
goal of the operation, what's

00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:42.890
the plan they're planning
to go through it with.

00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:44.481
The anesthesiologist
reviews what

00:51:44.481 --> 00:51:46.730
are the medical issues of
the patient and the concerns

00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:49.620
that the team should be aware
of that's in their mind.

00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:52.430
The nurse reviews what's
the equipment situation,

00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:55.040
infection control, any
questions that they have.

00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:56.610
And only then, you proceed.

00:51:56.610 --> 00:51:59.150
And that's where the biggest
benefit is turning out

00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:02.030
to come from, is the
ability to be coordinated

00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:06.890
around a complex
goal and then having

00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:11.600
feedback points along the way to
say, has the situation changed?

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:14.010
Do we have to reorient
in other ways?

00:52:14.010 --> 00:52:16.730
So they reset again at
the end of the operation.

00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:19.490
Now what's the goal for the
next 24 hours of recovery

00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:21.200
and have we made sure
all of the orders

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:23.330
and all of the
plans are lined up

00:52:23.330 --> 00:52:25.220
and the communication
is set that way?

00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:27.080
It sounds so kindergarten.

00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:31.490
Like you would think, you mean,
you didn't do this already?

00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:34.790
And the answer is, we don't.

00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:39.720
And unless you make it a kind of
systematic part of what you do,

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:43.649
you really do end up with
suffering in whatever

00:52:43.649 --> 00:52:44.690
form you're dealing with.

00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:49.669
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:49.669 --> 00:52:51.460
You touched on this
topic a couple of times

00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:53.720
peripherally already
but in your book,

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:57.340
you have a couple of examples
of people who ended up

00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:00.640
having to go to assisted living
facilities because of the very

00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:02.700
real health hazards they face.

00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:06.670
And so where do you draw the
line between allowing them

00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:10.339
autonomy and like where
they're at real risk,

00:53:10.339 --> 00:53:12.130
especially for patients
who might not fully

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:14.660
comprehend their situation?

00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:17.260
ATUL GAWANDE: Yeah.

00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:18.740
It's a hard question, right?

00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:22.610
So do you allow
autonomy for people

00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:24.860
to make mistakes in their life?

00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:30.770
And the answer is that
just because you now

00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:32.540
are in a wheelchair
shouldn't mean

00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:36.410
you lose all ability to
have that set of rights

00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:38.420
in that discussion.

00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:43.730
Someone with Alzheimer's is not
able to make those choices with

00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:46.022
full appreciation of the
situation they're in depending

00:53:46.022 --> 00:53:48.021
on what stage they're in,
if they're in advanced

00:53:48.021 --> 00:53:48.680
Alzheimer's.

00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:50.660
That said, the family
is able to do that.

00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:53.480
And opening up the door
to being able to say,

00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:56.420
well, just like the
person who talked

00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:58.940
about earlier, the family--

00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:01.469
about 70% of us
will come to the end

00:54:01.469 --> 00:54:03.260
of life with a decision
maker, someone else

00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:05.150
having to make decisions for us.

00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:09.470
And that person is ill
equipped if they've never

00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:12.080
had that discussion about
what really matters to you.

00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:16.880
But then at that
point, they have

00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:20.440
to be able to know,
with that person,

00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:22.190
for example, that said
chocolate ice cream

00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:24.500
and football on television was
what really mattered to them,

00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:26.708
the person I heard it from
was his health care proxy,

00:54:26.708 --> 00:54:28.250
his daughter

00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:30.950
And she talked about how
important and meaningful

00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:32.180
that was for her.

00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:35.840
Because then when he
turned out to have

00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:39.530
a bleed in his spinal
cord where they said,

00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:42.330
well, we can take him back
to the operating room now

00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:44.540
but he will likely
be quadriplegic,

00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:46.544
she could ask the
question, well,

00:54:46.544 --> 00:54:48.710
will he be able to eat
chocolate ice cream and watch

00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:50.510
football on television?

00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:52.040
And they said, oh, yeah.

00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:54.627
This is not at the level where
that would be sacrificed.

00:54:54.627 --> 00:54:56.210
And she said it was
an enormous relief

00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:59.330
to be able to know that
I can make this decision

00:54:59.330 --> 00:55:02.330
and understand what
he really cared about,

00:55:02.330 --> 00:55:05.750
and to fight for him to make
sure that the team followed

00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:07.400
through on what he
really knew about,

00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:09.890
and that they could hold
the whole family together

00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:11.130
as they did that.

00:55:11.130 --> 00:55:16.280
So I think that
that ability to even

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:19.350
if people can't make
decisions for themselves,

00:55:19.350 --> 00:55:22.460
you can know by
talking before crisis

00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:24.680
comes and be better
equipped to be

00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:27.110
able to offer the
right direction when

00:55:27.110 --> 00:55:27.860
that moment comes.

00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:31.419
AUDIENCE: So hi.

00:55:31.419 --> 00:55:32.960
First of all, thank
you for the book.

00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:34.610
My own father also
died of cancer,

00:55:34.610 --> 00:55:37.370
and it was a hard
and necessary read.

00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:39.830
And I think it's interesting
that your book came out

00:55:39.830 --> 00:55:41.810
about three years
ago now and there

00:55:41.810 --> 00:55:44.240
seemed to be these various
sprouts of a larger

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:46.940
discussion about end
of life care coming up

00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:49.609
not only from you, but
from various other sources.

00:55:49.609 --> 00:55:51.650
One thing I found interesting
is that in the book

00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:53.870
you touch only very
briefly on the subject

00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:56.460
of physician-assisted
suicide, et cetera,

00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:59.839
and it's been three
years since I read it

00:55:59.839 --> 00:56:01.880
so I don't want to
mischaracterize your position,

00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:06.170
but you seem to largely sort
of not so much rule it out,

00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:08.390
but your position seemed
to be that there were more

00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:09.800
important topics to discuss.

00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:12.140
But at the same time, these
other sprouts coming up.

00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:15.980
California recently passed
its assisted suicide law.

00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:18.020
My friend, Hope
[? Faulk ?] was part

00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:20.030
of that process of doing that.

00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:22.910
I'm curious, like, where is
your thinking now about this?

00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:25.100
Is this something that we
need to be talking about?

00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:27.950
ATUL GAWANDE: Well, so
the main concern I have

00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:32.540
is that the difference I
have with the people who

00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:37.760
have been in favor of assisted
death is that the goal to me

00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:40.160
is not a good death,
the goal is a good life

00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:41.630
all the way to the very end.

00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:46.040
And we have neglected
that process so deeply.

00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:48.500
And it starts not just in
the last weeks of life,

00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:53.030
it goes years ahead of that.

00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:55.740
For example, at the
extreme, in India,

00:56:55.740 --> 00:57:00.980
there is a bill that may
well pass for assisted death.

00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:04.850
Now, India is also a place
where you cannot get narcotics

00:57:04.850 --> 00:57:08.750
at home for, say, cancer pain.

00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:10.430
Or even after, like,
orthopedic surgery,

00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:15.000
you can't get that
kind of pain relief.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:20.500
And so if you're in severe
pain and we don't treat it

00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:21.920
and you're offered
assisted death,

00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:24.835
I would absolutely
take that option.

00:57:24.835 --> 00:57:26.210
That would be the
merciful thing.

00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:29.000
But not when we have
the treatment available.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:33.710
And so my great fear is
like the piano teacher

00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:37.310
lying incontinent in
pain in a hospital,

00:57:37.310 --> 00:57:39.445
life doesn't seem
to be worth living.

00:57:39.445 --> 00:57:40.820
If you'd said,
well, you might be

00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:44.330
able to actually get home
and teach for the time

00:57:44.330 --> 00:57:48.855
that you have, she would not
have said that assisted death.

00:57:48.855 --> 00:57:51.080
So knowing that she
wasn't depressed--

00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:53.955
in other words, the rules are
know that you're not depressed,

00:57:53.955 --> 00:57:57.377
that you have a judgment from
two independent clinicians,

00:57:57.377 --> 00:57:59.210
and that you're making
this with sound mind.

00:57:59.210 --> 00:58:01.910
It doesn't address the
question that we don't actually

00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:04.730
take good care of people
towards the end of life.

00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:11.740
And as we try to take this
nationwide, in general,

00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:14.360
I'm not that alarmed by
assisted death in the sense

00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:17.450
that it's less than 1% of the
population that choose it.

00:58:17.450 --> 00:58:20.510
And then when people
get the medication

00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:24.224
to be able to take their
own life, less than half

00:58:24.224 --> 00:58:24.890
actually use it.

00:58:24.890 --> 00:58:27.230
It's often just a comfort
to know it's there

00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:29.070
as an option for them.

00:58:29.070 --> 00:58:36.330
So I have complex views on it
because I'm not totally 100%

00:58:36.330 --> 00:58:36.830
anti.

00:58:36.830 --> 00:58:40.220
I have lots of reasons why I
think that we're not valuing

00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:41.524
life adequately, however.

00:58:41.524 --> 00:58:43.940
AUDIENCE: I would worry if
anyone thought this was simple.

00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:45.140
ATUL GAWANDE: Right.

00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:46.585
Thank you.

00:58:46.585 --> 00:58:47.960
TOM SMITH: And
the last question.

00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:49.610
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks
for being here.

00:58:49.610 --> 00:58:53.150
I'm curious about what
your vision for our country

00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:55.100
is in terms of health
care education.

00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:58.924
Whether you think there needs
to be a restructuring in the way

00:58:58.924 --> 00:59:01.340
that health care providers are
thinking about end of life,

00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:04.330
or if more of the onus is
on common day people, right?

00:59:04.330 --> 00:59:06.080
To be thinking a little
bit more carefully

00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:08.792
about what they want towards
the end of their life.

00:59:08.792 --> 00:59:11.000
And in further as you were
researching for this book,

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.970
I'm wondering if you
noted different trends

00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:17.120
within this country that maybe
changed the way we thought

00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:21.500
about death, and also if you
noted maybe other cultures

00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:23.380
or other countries that
maybe have healthier

00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:27.080
or have had healthier
views on end of life.

00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:29.240
ATUL GAWANDE: Well, in
general, what I would--

00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:30.920
this is a complex
question so let

00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:35.790
me try to answer it succinctly.

00:59:35.790 --> 00:59:37.880
I think that people
often differentiate

00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:40.340
between Eastern and Western
attitudes towards death.

00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:44.060
But when I write a lot
about the situation in India

00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:48.740
and now I've seen it in
China and in parts of Africa,

00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:52.250
and what we see is that
as economies improve,

00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:54.890
people move away from
extended families,

00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:57.230
they move into cities, they
become more independent.

00:59:57.230 --> 01:00:01.790
Economics gives young people
freedom and old people

01:00:01.790 --> 01:00:03.950
build up more wealth.

01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:07.870
What they choose at
that point is that often

01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:09.980
that dying in those
places too also

01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:11.780
becomes rapidly medicalized.

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:18.110
70%, 80% of dying in big cities
like in Beijing or in Delhi

01:00:18.110 --> 01:00:19.850
is now in hospitals,
and families

01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:23.330
going through this whole cycle
of bankrupting themselves

01:00:23.330 --> 01:00:28.010
over care that no one is really
having a discussion about it

01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:30.080
providing very little of value.

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:31.985
In fact, increasing suffering.

01:00:34.570 --> 01:00:37.700
So my larger view of
it is that we actually

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:40.790
are coming out the other
side in US health care.

01:00:40.790 --> 01:00:43.160
We have now gone from
less than 20% of people

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:45.605
being on Hospice when they
come to the end of life to now

01:00:45.605 --> 01:00:48.480
it's 50% are there.

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:49.940
It's become something that--

01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:52.830
I didn't see a single death
when I was growing up.

01:00:52.830 --> 01:00:57.530
My kids have all had their
friends in the neighborhood

01:00:57.530 --> 01:01:00.740
where someone has died at home
and they were part of that.

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:04.250
They saw that process
unfold over time

01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:06.990
and saw it be part of our
culture again in a way.

01:01:06.990 --> 01:01:08.549
And I think that's
a very good thing,

01:01:08.549 --> 01:01:10.340
and it's becoming a
less threatening thing.

01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:12.860
And we've come a long way from
three years ago when the book

01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:15.830
came out and it was about death
panels discussions at that

01:01:15.830 --> 01:01:20.090
time, to where now
there's not only my book,

01:01:20.090 --> 01:01:22.670
but Paul Kalanithi's
"When Breath Becomes Air,"

01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:24.500
and you have Oliver
Sacks' "Gratitude,"

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:29.960
published after he died, and
a wealth of other discussions

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:32.960
that are opening out and
recognizing that we can be

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:36.290
thinking about how to live
a good life across the whole

01:01:36.290 --> 01:01:37.520
lifespan.

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:42.380
And then the last thing about
education is that along the way

01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:45.260
we have formed a
coalition in Massachusetts

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:48.890
that we're testing out the
proposition of it clearly

01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:50.630
can't be just the
public campaign,

01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:55.220
but you need ways that we are
all having these conversations

01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:56.330
more generally.

01:01:56.330 --> 01:02:00.710
But when people come into
contact in the clinical world,

01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:02.907
less than 15% have
this conversation

01:02:02.907 --> 01:02:04.490
with their clinician
even when they've

01:02:04.490 --> 01:02:07.700
had a hospitalization
in the last year.

01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:10.400
And if they're going to have
it, the vast majority of time

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:11.360
they have to start it.

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.040
The clinicians are unwilling to.

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:15.020
Clinicians aren't trained to.

01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:16.520
Very uncomfortable.

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:20.020
And so we have gotten agreement
with all four medical schools

01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:22.300
in the state of Massachusetts
to now incorporate

01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:27.340
the training into the curriculum
and start that process.

01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:29.770
We're trying to get
the nursing schools now

01:02:29.770 --> 01:02:31.480
to incorporate it as well.

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:33.940
So I think we're
starting to create

01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:38.890
the pathway that these
communication skills become

01:02:38.890 --> 01:02:44.230
more widespread, but it's
still an uphill left.

01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:48.160
It's still a small percentage
where the clinicians really are

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:51.640
comfortable and understand
what I had to go out and write

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:54.385
a book to learn about.

01:02:54.385 --> 01:02:56.510
TOM SMITH: So thank you so
much for taking time out

01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:57.770
of your jam packed schedule.

01:02:57.770 --> 01:03:01.340
And the hard core fans that are
still here should join me in--

01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:02.340
ATUL GAWANDE: Thank you.

01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:03.215
TOM SMITH: Thank you.

01:03:03.215 --> 01:03:05.990
[APPLAUSE]
