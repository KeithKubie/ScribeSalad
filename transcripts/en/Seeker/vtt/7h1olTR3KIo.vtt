00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.650
It's in our schools, it's in our homes, it's
at our coffee shops, and it's on our minds

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.650
constantly.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:06.650
Homework.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:07.650
And it's DEADLY.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:19.880
Just kidding, it's fine, but is there such
a thing as too much?

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.860
Homework is something we've all been assigned;
even Harry Potter had tons of homework!

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.529
But, sadly, for us science muggles, Hermione
won't be able help us out; which is actually

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:30.550
better, it turns out.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.710
In the early 1900s, homework was part and
parcel to creating a "disciplined mind," then

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.570
in the 1940s, it was seen as superfluous,
until the 1950s when the Soviets kicked off

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.230
the Space Race with the launch of Sputnik.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.289
As homework's relevance ebbs and flows, new
research from the American Psychological Association

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.300
has planted a flag right in the middle -- finding
the benefits of homework are real, unless

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.609
it's over-assigned.

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.360
Surveying and studying 77-hundred students,
the APA determined students spent between

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.920
one and two hours on homework for all their
subjects.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.390
If the teacher assigned a moderate amount
of homework systematically, with strategy,

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.780
the students did better on assessments in
math and science.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.479
They also did better if they did the work
on their own, so BACK OFF HER-MI-OH-NINNY.

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.400
Researchers looking at the number of minutes
spent related to gains made in scholastic

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.500
abilities found anything over 70 minutes per
day wasn't efficient.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.460
"HOW is more important than HOW MUCH," they
said.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.700
The strategy of homework, it turns out, can
be much more difficult than it sounds.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.610
Homework in Elementary school has no evidence
of any benefit,, whereas junior high and high

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.390
school do see increasing gains, but even then
they've found autonomy in learning is better;

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.680
when parents get too involved the student
suffers.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.360
It's not just the students and parents, though,
a 2012 study of 18,000 10th-grade students

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.530
found (quote) "homework should be purposeful,
and that purpose must be understood by both

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.520
the teachers and the studentsâ€¦ more is not
better."

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.360
I loved school, but I wasn't the best student
when it came to homework; I didn't always

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.261
understand WHY I we were doing it, it just
seemed like busywork -- which these researchers

00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:17.980
say is part of the problem.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.780
On top of that, everyone learns differently.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.990
Standardized tests and letter grades aren't
the best for everyone, true.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.910
And for people with ADHD, like me, it can
be very difficult to sit for hours at a time.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.410
Research shows studying also benefits from
changing locations, and trying out different

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.330
strategies for different topics.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.910
Even sleep can help us learn!

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.900
Psychological Science in the Public Interest
ranked 10 different forms and tactics for

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:45.900
learning.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.630
The best were practice testing, and distributed
practice.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.370
Distributed practice involves revisiting topics
10-20 percent of the time you want to recall

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.370
it.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.860
Want to remember something for a week?

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.160
Study the topic once every 12-24 hours apart.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.180
Practice tests involve testing your OWN knowledge.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.080
Sure you can have a pre-created test, but
a better way is to make your own practice

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.540
questions while studying, and come back to
them days later.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.150
Flashcards are an example of practice testing.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.860
The worst ways to recall long-term critical
thinking information?

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:22.010
Summarization, highlighting, mnemonics, re-reading
and imagery for text learning.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.480
These aren't hard and fast rules of course
-- Each has a benefit for a different TYPE

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.480
of learning.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.790
Our brains are made of meat, remember, we're
better at remembering some things than others

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.920
because of our evolution.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.720
We needed to learn game paths, safe havens,
or which bush had the best berries.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.770
Simply assigning reams of rote memorization
or repetitive problem solving isn't going

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.130
to work for every one of those brains.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.790
Experiences, or revisiting topics days or
even a week later can help recall.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.000
Homework is an important part of an overall
learning strategy; just like knowing yourself,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.180
and how you learn.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.460
How do YOU learn?

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:05.120
Have you thought about it?
