00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.730
In the last video, we were able
to find the equation for

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.480
the regression line for these
four data points.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.460
What I want to do in this video
is figure out the r

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.760
squared for these data points.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.670
Figure out how good this
line fits the data.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.040
Or even better, figure out the
percentage-- which is really

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.640
the same thing-- of the
variation of these data

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.220
points, especially the variation
in y, that is due

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.760
to, or that can be explained
by variation in x.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.911
And to do that, I'm actually
going to get

00:00:27.911 --> 00:00:29.010
a spreadsheet out.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.120
I've actually tried to do this
with a calculator and it's

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.830
much harder.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.710
So hopefully this doesn't
confuse you too much to use a

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.280
spreadsheet.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.650
And I'm a make a couple
of columns here.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.440
And spreadsheets actually have
functions that'll do all of

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.280
this automatically, but I really
want to do it so that

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.360
you could do it by hand
if you had to.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.040
So I'm going to make a couple
of columns here.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.780
This is going to
be my x column.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.360
This is going to
be my y column.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.550
This is going to be the column--
I'll call this y

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.220
star-- this'll be the y value
that our line predicts based

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.930
on our x value.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:08.930
This is going to be the
error with the line.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.750
Let me caught it the squared
error with the line.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.510
I don't want us to take
up too much space.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:41.760
And then the next one, I'm
going to have the squared

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:56.040
variation for that y value
from the mean y.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.940
And I think these columns by
themselves will be enough for

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:00.680
us to do everything.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.220
So let's first put all
the data points in.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.590
So we had negative 2
comma negative 3.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.620
That was one data point.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.740
Negative 1 comma negative 1.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.889
And we had 1 comma 2.

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:14.010
Then we have 4 comma 3.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.145
Now, what does our
line predict?

00:02:19.145 --> 00:02:21.360
Well our line says, you give
me an x value, I'm going to

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.530
tell you what y value
I'll predict.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.920
So when x is equal to negative
2, the y value on the line is

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.230
going to be the slope.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.060
So this is going to be equal
to 41 divided by

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.910
42 times our x value.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.600
And I just selected that cell.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.470
And just a little bit of a
primer on spreadsheets, I'm

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.020
selecting the cell D2.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.680
I was able to just move my
cursor over and select that.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.200
But that tells me the x value.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.670
Minus 5/21.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.110
Minus 5 divided by 21.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.080
Just like that.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.800
So just to be clear of what
we're even doing.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.650
This y star here, I
got negative 2.19.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.260
That tells us at this
point right over

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:17.170
here is negative 2.19.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.476
So when we figure out the error,
we're going to figure

00:03:18.476 --> 00:03:25.600
out the distance between
negative 3, that's our y

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.860
value, and negative 2.19.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.430
So let's do that.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.970
So the error is just going to
be equal to our y value.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.220
That's cell E2.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.370
Minus the value that our
line would predict.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.520
So just that value is
the actual error.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.770
But we want to square it.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.090
And then, the next thing
we want to do

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.480
is the squared distance.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.730
so this is equal to the squared
distance of our y

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.315
value from the y's mean.

00:04:05.315 --> 00:04:07.680
So what's the mean of the y's?

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.170
Mean of the y's is 1/4.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.290
So minus 0.25, is the
same thing is 1/4.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.260
And we also want
to square that.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.720
Now, this is what's fun
about spreadsheets.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.150
I can apply those formulas
to every row now.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.330
And notice, what it did
when I did that.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.430
Now all of a sudden, this is the
y value that my line would

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.590
predict, it's now using
this x value and

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.230
sticking it over here.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.120
It's now figuring out the square
distance from the line

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.170
using what the line would
predict and using the

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.630
y value, this one.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.010
And then does the same
thing over here.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.090
It's figures out the squared
distance of this y

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.060
value from the mean.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.650
So what is the total squared
error with the line?

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.620
So let me just sum this up.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.040
The total squared error
with the line is 2.73.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:05.920
And then the total variation
from the mean, squared

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.560
distances from the mean
of the y, are 22.75.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.790
So let me be very clear
what this is.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.350
So let me write these
numbers down.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.230
I'll write it up here so we
can keep looking at this

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.890
actual graph.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.400
So are squared error versus our
line, our total squared

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.600
error, we just computed
to be 2.74.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.860
I rounded a little bit.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.240
And what that is, is you take
each of these data points'

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.500
vertical distance to the line.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.050
So this distance squared, plus
this distance squared, plus

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.740
this distance squared, plus
this distance squared.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.030
That's all we just calculated
on Excel.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:52.450
And that total squared variation
to the line is 2.74.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.680
Or total squared error
with the line.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.380
And then the other number we
figured out was the total

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.190
distance from the mean.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.780
So the mean here is
y is equal to 1/4.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.980
So that's going to be
right over here.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:09.590
This is 1/2.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:10.840
So right over here.

00:06:14.505 --> 00:06:17.070
So this is our mean y value.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.630
Or the central tendency
for our y values.

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.590
And so what we calculated next
was the total error, the

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.730
squared error, from the
means of our y values.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.850
That's what we calculated over
here in the spreadsheet.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.320
You see in the formula.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.690
It is this number, E2, minus
0.25, which is the mean of our

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.150
y's squared.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:44.300
That's exactly what
we calculated.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.170
We calculated for each
of the y values.

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:47.210
And then we summed
them all up.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.820
It's 22.75.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:58.470
It is equal to 22.75.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.600
So this is essentially
the error that the

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.570
line does not explain.

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.060
This is the total error,
this is the total

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.330
variation of the numbers.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.760
So if you wanted to know the
percentage of the total

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.700
variation that is not explained
by the line, you

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.680
could take this number divided
by this number.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:23.090
So 2.74 over 22.75.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:39.440
This tells us the percentage
of total variation not

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.050
explained by the line or
by the variation in x.

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.000
And so what is this number
going to be?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.590
I can just use Excel for this.

00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:02.500
So I'm just going to divide this
number divided by this

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.290
number right over there.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:07.430
I get 0.12.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:16.000
So this is equal to 0.12.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.300
Or another way to think about
it is 12% of the total

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.870
variation is not explained
by the variation in x.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:26.510
The total squared distance
between each of the points or

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.260
their kind of spread, their
variation, is not explain by

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.170
the variation in x.

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.240
So if you want the amount that
is explained by the variance

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.579
in x, you just subtract
that from 1.

00:08:34.579 --> 00:08:36.490
So let me write it
right over here.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:40.669
So we have our r squared, which
is the percent of the

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:42.820
total variation that is
explained by x, is going to be

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:46.350
1 the minus that 0.12 that
we just calculated.

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:55.610
Which is going to be 0.88.

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:58.180
So our r squared here is 0.88.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.630
It's very, very close to 1.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:02.170
The highest number
it can be is 1.

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:05.610
So what this tells us, or a way
to interpret this, is that

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:18.210
88% of the total variation of
these y values is explained by

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:20.610
the line or by the
variation in x.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:26.040
And you can see that it looks
like a pretty good fit.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.610
Each of these aren't too far.

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:33.790
Each of these points are
definitely much closer to the

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:35.510
line than they are
to the mean line.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.830
In fact, all of them are closer
to our actual line than

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:43.630
to the mean.
