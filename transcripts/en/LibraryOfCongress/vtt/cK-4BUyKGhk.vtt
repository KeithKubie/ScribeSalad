00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.340
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson:
I'm Betsy Peterson,

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.150
the director of the
American Folklife Center,

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.560
and on behalf of the staff and
everyone in the Library really,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.110
I'd like to welcome you
to the latest presentation

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.670
of our Benjamin Botkin
lecture series.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.700
The Botkin series allows
us to highlight the work

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.110
of leading scholars in the
disciplines of folklore,

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.010
ethnomusicology, oral history, and
other cultural heritage studies.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.760
And it also allows us to
enhance our own collections here.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.110
All of the lectures that are done
here are videotaped and become part

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.640
of our archival collections and
are later posted as webcasts

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.290
on the Library's website.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.410
So they're available
for future generations

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.280
and patrons throughout the world.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.840
So now, if you have a
cellphone turned on,

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.670
please turn it off if you would.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.830
The American Folklife Center also,
we're delighted when researchers,

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.110 position:56%
of course, make use of our archives.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.330 position:56%
And many do, and many have published
wonderful books and recordings

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.920
out of the work that they've
done here at the archive.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.560
But we especially like it
when it brings new insights

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.230
into our materials and when
folks design innovative projects

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.090
and programs based on our holdings.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.070
And the archive, it
really is the heart

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.230
of the American Folklife Center.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.630
It's the largest ethnographic
archive in the world.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.200
And although the word
American is in the title

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.210
of the American Folklife Center,

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.680
that is sometimes a
bit of a misnomer.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.640
We have collections from over 140
countries throughout the world.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.540
And in particularly in relation to
our lecture today about Alan Lomax,

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.430
it's also we tend to think
sometimes of Alan Lomax

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.510
as primarily doing work
in the United States,

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.100
and certainly his field recording
trips throughout the south are

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.930
legendary and well-known to many
folks and have been published.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.520
People have written about, and
many recordings are available.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.240
But Alan Lomax also did extensive
field work elsewhere in Spain,

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.210
in Italy, in Ireland,
Scotland, and the Caribbean.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.810
And his 1936 to 37
collecting trip to Haiti

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.920
and his recent reexamination,
reinterpretation and repatriation

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.220
by today's speaker is the
subject of today's talk.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.430
And we're really thrilled
to have our speaker today.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.300
And it's my honor to introduce the
distinguished ethnomusicologist,

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.600
Gage Averill.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.930
Gage is currently dean
of the faulty of arts

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.960
at the University of
British Columbia.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:17.130
Formerly, he was vice-principal and
dean of the University of Toronto

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.280
at Mississauga, I hope I said
that right, the dean of music

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.150
at the University of Toronto,

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.730
and the chair of NYU's
department of music.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.480 position:56%
An ethnomusicologist who specializes
in popular music of the Caribbean

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.330
and North American vernacular
music, Gage has served as president

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.620
of the Society for Ethnomusicology.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.910 position:56%
His 2003 book Barbershop Singing won
best book prizes from the Society

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.060
for Ethnomusicology and the
Society for American Music.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.450
His 1997 book on Haitian
popular music and power,

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.440
A Day for the Hunter,
A Day for the Prey,

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.740
was awarded the best book prize
in ethnic and folk research

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.490
by the Association of
Recorded Sound Collections.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.800
And his impressive, right
here, ten CD box set of music,

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.830
film and accompanying books,

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.380
is based on material
in the AFC archive.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.110
And it's entitled Alan
Lomax and Haiti, 1936 to 37.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.160
And it was named as an
outstanding project in 2010

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.640 position:56%
by the Clinton Global Initiative
and received two Grammy nominations.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.780 position:56%
In addition to his Haitian research,
Professor Averill has also written

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.440 position:56%
on cultural industries, applied
musicology, Trinidadian steel bands,

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.970
music of the African Diaspora,
world music ensembles,

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.940
Alan Lomax's Choreometrics
Projects and music and militarism.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.270
We are delighted to have him
with us today, coming all the way

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.310
from British Columbia, to talk

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.160
about repatriating the Alan
Lomax Haitian recordings

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.590
in post-quake Haiti.

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.510
So please give a warm
welcome to Dr. Gage Averill.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.170
[ Applause ]

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.470
&gt;&gt; Gage Averill: Thank you, Betsy.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.770
I really appreciate that.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.070
Thank you everyone for coming

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.290
out on a pretty cold
day here in Washington.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.510
With your forbearance, I
might just start with a song.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:36.540
[ Singing ]

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:42.180 position:56%
Now that's a song to a fairly lesser
known Haitian deity called Wangol,

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.960
sometimes understood
to be King of Angola.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.190
The song just says Wangol,
when are you coming back to us.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.740
When will you see us again?

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.830
When will you see us again?

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.220
The country is changing.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.310
When are you coming back to us?

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.630
And as of, with that theme
I just thought about singing

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.360
that on the way over on
the mall this morning.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.180 position:56%
In part, because the theme of return

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.110
of coming home is woven throughout
this talk for a very good reason.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.720
For me, it feels a little bit like
coming home because this odyssey

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.850
with the Alan Lomax recordings
began for me here ten years ago

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:23.650 position:56%
when we visited the Library of
Congress and this extraordinary AFC,

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.330
the resource that we have
here for the US and the globe.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:32.050
So I wanted to thank not just Betsy
but Nancy Gross who invited me,

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.780
Todd Harvey and the staff
and the folks who are helping

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.180
with this presentation today
with my own coming home here.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.960
Haiti has long been
a precarious country.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.190
Its sovereignty was twice
compromised in the last century

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.680
by the United States
occupations, episodes.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.550
And I don't want to focus
on the negative here,

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:59.200
but episodes of political violence
and upheaval, grinding poverty,

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.090
environmental degradation and mass
immigration and natural disasters,

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.270
have taken their toll, not
just on the welfare of Haitians

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:12.000
and the lives of Haitians but
also on the ability of Haiti

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.670
to maintain something like cultural
memory and its cultural heritage.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:20.800
During the 29 years of
the Duvalier dictatorship,

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.050
which many of you will be
aware, generations of Haitians

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.340
in the artistic class, in the
intellectual classes, scholars

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.660
and others, left Haiti
to escape oppression.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.450
And with them went a great
deal of the country's memory,

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:40.130
great deal of its talent,
its experience.

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:47.660 position:56%
Following the exiles of the Duvalier
clan, public vengeance took the form

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.690
in many cases [foreign language]
or pulling up of the influence

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:55.190
of the former dictatorship.

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:57.600
And that involves some mass
violence and destruction

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.180
of institutions and homes.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:04.610 position:56%
Included in that were the [foreign
language] or the Bureau of Ethnology

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.700
in Haiti, which was
the main repository

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.860
of Haitian folklore collections.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.260
And also the [foreign language],

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:18.070
make sure I'm not speaking
Spanish, the National Library.

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:23.140
And so, and of course, many of
the most important collections

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.310
in Haiti are private collections.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.710
They're in people's homes where
they're exposed to the elements.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:33.680
They're exposed to, of course,
the death of the owners, theft,

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.910
natural disasters, etcetera.

00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:42.460
And so it's against this background
of precarious cultural reserves

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.370
and repositories that I want to
think today, to think through

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:49.750
and reflect on the role
of the Haitian archives

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:55.990
that Alan Lomax recorded in the
1930s about the hurdles we faced

00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:00.250
in moving these into publication.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:06.380 position:56%
But also then in trying to make sure
they reside in Haiti, for Haitians,

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:13.240
for generations to come,
just as Betsy so nicely put,

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.050
the purpose of our
talk today, my talk.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:22.170
And this, when I say my talk, I
don't want to suggest in any way

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.400
that this is an individual effort.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:30.650
These archives reside here, and
there's so much that you have heard

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:34.290
of the Library of Congress
has gone into preserving them.

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:38.580
We have Haitian partners, Haitians
I've worked with who I'll talk

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.910
about throughout this talk.

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:47.350
Partners and universities
and funders.

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:50.050
This has been a team
effort all along.

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:53.020
So I'm giving the talk today,
and you'll see pictures

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:56.400
that look self-aggrandizing,
but in no way am I thinking

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.190
that this is an individual effort.

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:05.450
Let's listen to a recording
made by Alan Lomax in 1936.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.510
You'll see the words on the slide.

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:19.040
[ Singing ]

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.330
The gentleman singing,
[inaudible], is here,

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:25.510 position:56%
pictured standing against his house.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:31.260
[ Singing ]

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:35.260
His name is Gustaf Tanese
[phonetic] standing in his doorway.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.470
On his recording, as I pointed
out, he's singing the call line,

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:41.940
the response from the congregation,
he's playing a sacred rattle.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:47.890
And this was recorded
by Alan Lomax in 1937.

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:51.990
And secretively, well let me
take a look at the lyrics,

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:55.130
because this will explain this.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:59.660
The lyrics are [foreign language],
the god of iron and warrior god

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:03.130 position:56%
in Haiti who helps to protect Haiti.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:07.810
[Foreign language] a version
of [foreign language] who works

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:09.120
with poisons and other things.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.750
We've been at sea so long.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.910 position:56%
It's not just now that we're at sea.

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:16.450
I'm so near, but I can't get there.

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:19.360
And this seems to capture
the sense, figurative sense

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:24.510
of this collection being at sea
so long, seven years out of Haiti.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:27.770
During a period of which
so much has been lost.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:36.180
It was the recordings about 1,500
of them stored on aluminum discs.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:41.060
Six films, accompanying ephemera,
so-called gathering dust.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.750
Of course, there's no
dust down in the Library.

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:47.130
So all from Alan Lomax's
five-month expedition.

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:52.430
The recordings had been held here,
and Todd, I always credit you.

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:56.070
I'm assuming I'm correct in this
that you helped to locate these

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:59.740
to determine their importance
and then helped everything

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.040
that happened after that.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.820
Am I giving you enough
credit or too much?

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.120
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] has always been no.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.420
&gt;&gt; Gage Averill: Okay.

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:09.510
They were, but I have to
say, as a scholar of Haiti,

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:10.810
I did not know about
them at the time.

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:14.480 position:56%
I think I could say that was true of
almost everyone that I worked with.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.500
It really took the efforts of
the Library staff to make sure

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.700
that these then went
to the next stage.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:24.410
I was fortunate of being
asked then by Anna Lomax Wood,

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:28.070
who is the president of the
Association for Cultural Equity

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:31.450
in New York, which guards her
father's legacy or guards,

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:34.540
helps to propagate her father's
legacy, Alan Lomax's legacy.

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.920
I was asked to curate
annotate these,

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.540
and was incredibly
fortunate that I was.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:44.230
I knew this was an extraordinary
project for scholars of Haiti,

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:47.410
but I just didn't really know
what this was going to mean

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:50.190 position:56%
for average, for musicians in Haiti.

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:51.520
For music in Haiti.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.450
To have these sounds
back circulating

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:57.140
after such a long period of time.

00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:02.110 position:56%
In 2003, not long after I was asked
by Anna to do this, I was asked also

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:05.510
by the University of Chicago
to introduce Katherine Dunham

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:09.260
at a speaking event at
the University of Chicago.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:14.730
Ms. Dunham was a world-famous
dancer-choreographer.

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:16.870
She did ethnography in
Haiti and elsewhere.

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:19.310
A very, very important
cultural figure.

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:21.020
I'm assuming most of you know her.

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:23.190
She had spent a year
in Haiti in 1935

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:28.150
and 1936 preceding Alan
by about six months.

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:32.280
And although she had participated
in a Vodou peristyle at a temple,

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.310
the same one that Alan recorded,
I didn't make, strangely enough,

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:36.610
I didn't make that connection.

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.620
Wasn't preparing to talk about it.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:41.310
And got up on, you know, in front
of a, a little bit like this,

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:42.750
and was looking through my laptop.

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:47.780
And I realized, I've got probably
200 recordings here recorded

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:49.500
in [inaudible], at the peristyle

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.670
that she writes about,
with all of her friends.

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:57.450
Madam, you know, the mambo,
[inaudible], mambo is a priestess,

00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:58.750
[foreign language], excuse me.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:03.430
Her friend, Cecile Esperonce
[phonetic], her husband,

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:08.480
who was an American expat
who had become a sort

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.670
of well-known Vodou priest.

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:15.550
So I really thought I had the
soundtrack to her book on Haiti.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:18.370
So I walked, she was
sitting backstage,

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.140
and she was in a wheelchair
at the time.

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:24.740
I said, excuse me, Miss Dunham,
I have recordings from Haiti

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:29.490
at Baudette [phonetic] with
Cecile and Tailene [phonetic],

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:32.290
and she looked at me
like, you know, scary,

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:34.860
a ghost, there were recordings.

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:38.060
And I said, yeah I've got, would
you mind if I played one or two.

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:39.930
She said, of course not, go ahead.

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:45.080
And I played this one that
I'll play for you now.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:50.120
It's called [foreign language]
which means, Theolene [phonetic],

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.790
we're going to guard
the temple for you.

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:58.510
It's a song for her by her
constituents, by her congregation.

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:21.090
[ Music ]

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:26.820
Near the end of a ceremony, very,
very excited part of the ceremony.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:33.150
So she got up after that to speak.

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:35.870
She was able to get out of her
wheelchair, and she was going

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:37.170
to deliver her address standing up.

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:40.000
She turned to me, and
she started crying.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.120
And she said, young man, you've
got a govee [phonetic] in there.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.170
You've got a digital govee.

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:49.050
And I was a little bit stunned.

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:53.960
A govee for those who don't know,
is a pot, clay pot, usually,

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:57.650
that you find around a
temple, around a peristyle.

00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:04.420
Sometimes you find them at
home just around a little area

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.640
in the home that's used
for religious purposes.

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:11.850
And they store a part of the
soul that ancestors that leave.

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:17.010
The rest of the soul goes [foreign
language] or under the water

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:18.720
to join [foreign language]
and the ancestors.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.910
But it is possible to
preserve this part.

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:25.140
And so when you have
Katherine Dunham,

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:29.290 position:56%
a person of that what Haitians would
call [foreign language] a person

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:37.240
of great spiritual and experiential
depth saying that to you, you know,

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:41.110
it causes you to, at
least me, to perk up.

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:44.610
It reminded me that these
recordings are not just recordings.

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:49.350
These are the voices of people
who may have left no other traces

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:53.490
of their passions and their
work, their experiences,

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:56.300
other than tales told
by family members.

00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:00.610
I think it's safe to
say that that experience

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:08.060
with Katherine Dunham produced
a greater level of concern,

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:14.250
obligation, to make sure that
this work that we all did lived up

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:17.050
and honored the spirit
of those ancestors.

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:23.640
Not just for cultural memory,
not just help the society,

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:28.450 position:56%
but also in those places where there
are direct personal idiosyncratic

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:30.450
familial linkages.

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:33.320
Those kinds of things
became more important to me,

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.490
the individual connections
over time.

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:39.470 position:56%
We are, of course, talking about the
work by Alan and Elizabeth Lomax,

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:45.720
and I'll talk a little bit later
about their Haitian interlocutor,

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:50.570
who is also very, very important
in this gathering process.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:55.650
I don't think I need to tell
you too much about Alan Lomax,

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:58.730
a towering figure in American
music for over six decades.

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:02.870
Began work with his
father, John Avery Lomax.

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:05.860
And I understand we
have some relatives

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:08.240
in the crowd today, so welcome.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.540
A special welcome to you.

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:10.840
I hope to meet you afterwards.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:17.410
And there were at work in '34
on what would be a collection

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:20.710
of American folk songs, the
American ballads and folk songs.

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:26.240 position:56%
And producing another volume working
alongside musicologist Charles

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:31.130
Seeger and his composer
partner, Ruth Crawford Seeger,

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:32.760
on a book called Our
Singing Country.

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:36.830
He was also, Alan Lomax was
also at the time deeply involved

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:40.120
in the election campaign,
well in the election campaign

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.740
for Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who
was seen as a bit of a patron saint

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.870
of folklore at that time.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:48.600
And in the midst of all this, he
was just getting his degree from,

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:52.820
undergraduate degree from the
University of Texas in philosophy.

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:57.160
He takes off for Haiti, which
is an odd choice at the time.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.460
Difficult place to get to.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.040
Difficult place to move around.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.440
I pondered on that for a little
bit, but you have to think

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:06.070
about Alan's own developmental arc.

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:09.770
He had been, as Betsy
had talked about,

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:12.960
recording through the south
sometimes with his friend,

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:17.560
Zora Neale Hurston, and
later on had also worked

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:23.260
with Professor Barnicle from NYU.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:28.840
They had done some
work in the Bahamas.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:33.400
And Alan had an implicit
kind of model

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.260
of the sounds he was recording.

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:41.650
Understanding them is linked
deeply to African prototypes,

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:44.730
not just some growing
on this new turf.

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:50.530
And I think it's fair to say
that his interest in Haiti was

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:57.570
in part an interest in tracing
African-American musics to a place

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:04.000
where the history of slavery and
oppression of African peoples

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.130 position:56%
in the new world was less, was more
attenuated, was more distant, right.

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:10.120
Haiti was the black republic.

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:18.360 position:56%
It had cast off colonial chains in
1804 and lived as a country governed

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.910
by decedents of Africans.

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:26.440
And I really think he felt he
could find something more historic,

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:31.740
more authentic, less corrupted
by the process of slavery.

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:35.710
He was not alone in interest
in Haiti at the time.

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:42.460 position:56%
During the American occupation from
1915 to 34, a series of journalists,

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:47.330
travel writers and military
personnel had written books

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:48.980
or other works on Haiti.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:54.100
Melville Herskovits,
an anthropologist I'm

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.860
about to talk about, said Haiti
has fared badly at the hands

00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:59.160
of its literary interpreters.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.700
And he meant this group here.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:04.870
The initial and most important
work was probably the one

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:08.500
by William Seabrook who was an
occultist and travel writer.

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:12.330
And he wrote The Magic
Island in 1929.

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:16.090
Former captain, John
Craig, wrote Black Bagdad.

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:22.450
Marine Sergeant Faustin Wirkus
wrote The White King of La Gonave.

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:26.650
And most notoriously, let's say,
Richard Loederer's Vodou Fire

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:31.420
in Haiti in that it really sprung
free of just about any relationship

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:36.410
to reality, fueled this
appetite in the North America

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:39.750 position:56%
for stories about Vodou and zombies.

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:42.630
So you'll see the film
that was made in 1937 based

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:45.620
on Magic Island featuring
Bela Lugosi

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:52.440
as a Haitian plantation owner,
it was the original zombie movie.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:57.220
This stuff grew out of this
encounter with the American marines

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:00.510
in Haiti through this period.

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:05.190
And influences the
ethnographers who come later.

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:07.780
They're seriously wanting to
undermine this literature,

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:10.690
undermine the sensationalism
and the racism of it.

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:12.880
But on the other hand,
this is what they had read,

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.900
what many of them had
read about Haiti.

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:18.580
Lomax had a number of
ethnographic contemporaries,

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:20.040
so he wasn't alone in that.

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:24.250
Most important, I think, for
generating an understanding

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:29.110
of Haiti was Jean Price-Mars, and
Price is the English pronunciation.

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:35.770
He had an English-speaking
family, whom you see on the left.

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:39.970
And Jean was writing during the
occupation and began a series

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:42.530
of articles eventually
collected into a book that began

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:47.340
to castigate the elite in
Haiti for losing sovereignty.

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:49.440
Like if this elite
knew what it was doing,

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.610
we wouldn't have Americans
running the country.

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:55.110
Essentially, the argument
there, along with an argument

00:22:55.110 --> 00:23:00.260
about turning Haiti's attention
to Africa and to peasant culture,

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:03.590
which was more African,
away from a sense

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:08.140
that everything European was good
and everything African wasn't.

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:13.240
And he was essentially a kind
of an intellectual generator

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.600
of the folklore movement in Haiti.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.340
And corresponded with
Melville Herskovits.

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:23.570
This correspondent helped Melville
Herskovits fashion his theory

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:29.260
of African retentions in the new
World, African-American culture.

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.730
And Melville Herskovits
and his wife, Francis,

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:37.260
came to Haiti in 1934, just
after the marines left.

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:42.700
He spent a year, not less
than a year in Haiti.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:45.030
And wrote a book called
Life in a Haitian Valley

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:48.060
about his time in Mirebalais.

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:52.350
He shared those chapters,
a couple of those chapters

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:55.180
in Progress, with a
young Alan Lomax.

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:58.550
And he also shared them and his
contacts, his contacts, of course,

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:02.880
with Alan, shared some of his
contacts and his work with a number

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.590
of other people who had
growing interest in Haiti,

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:09.680
including Zora Neale Hurston,
Catherine Dunham, both of whom went

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:15.100
to Haiti very soon thereafter, a
novelist by the name of Courlander,

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:19.730
Harold Courlander, and his own
graduate student George Simpson.

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:22.580
Within a couple years, all of
these people were in Haiti,

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:28.690 position:56%
many of them at the same time, doing
their own work on Haitian culture.

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:32.250
Alan speaks really only of, when
he writes about his contacts

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:33.900
with Herskovits, he speaks only

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:36.270
about Zora Neale Hurston,
who is his friend.

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:40.240
And probably the person most
important for his arrival in Haiti.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:44.440
Zora is a leading black
author, I think,

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.580
is arguably the leading
black author of a generation.

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:51.140
Her interest in Haiti stretched
back at least 1932 when she wrote

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:55.350
that sergeant I talked about
earlier, Faustin Wirkus.

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:58.850
She was fascinated by his
book and proposed the two

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:01.700
of them do a comparative
study of conjure

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.640 position:56%
or magic practices in the Caribbean.

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:07.220
She wanted, she told her advisor
that she wanted to get a grant

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:10.500
from the Guggenheim Foundation to
study throughout the Caribbean,

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:13.030
spend a couple of weeks in Haiti.

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:16.280
She eventually left her graduate
program to work with Alan

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:21.420
and Mary Elizabeth Barnicle in the
south, on folksong collecting trips

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:24.270
but did go to Haiti in '35 and '36.

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:27.100
Haiti and Jamaica.

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:30.260
And she wrote a letter
to Harold Spivacke,

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:34.330
the chief of the music division
here at the Library of Congress,

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:38.440
promoting a visit by Alan Lomax,
saying there's more material here

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:40.250
than you could ever imagine.

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:43.760
She talked about the kinds of
songs he might record and noted

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:48.140
that after saying that the Haitians
say that Seabrook is an awful liar,

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:51.290
remember the story Magic
Island by William Seabrook.

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:54.720
She admonished low backs, not to
mention the general term folklore,

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.360
or magic practices, in his letters
of introduction because Seabrook

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.530 position:56%
and those who have followed him have
disgusted the Haitian government

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:03.820
with Vodou hunters.

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:08.670 position:56%
So Alan did spend a good part of
his first few weeks in Haiti working

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:11.150
and staying in the
same hotel as Zora.

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:12.530
He recorded her there as one

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:15.170
of his first recordings
to try out is materials.

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:18.510
I just thought it would be
lovely to have her voice.

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:32.330
[ Singing ]

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:36.120 position:56%
The expedition that resulted in
getting their start on December 10th

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:41.060
in 1936 when he got on the SS
Pistorius, it's a Columbian line,

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:43.730
sailed to part of Spain,

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:47.580
part of Port-au-Prince,
what country am I in?

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:49.750
Not Trinidad.

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:55.560
Haiti. You'll see Alan's map
here as part of the ephemera.

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.380
This is it, had a two-sided map.

00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:59.920
The other side is a much
more detailed map of Haiti

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:02.590
with his writing all over it.

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:08.330
And that's a picture of the
port in Port-au-Prince, Haiti,

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:12.010
and just about three or four
years before Alan got there.

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:16.150
He brought his contacts from
Herskovits and Zora Neale Hurston.

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:20.110
During this period, it wasn't
always an easy time for Alan Lomax.

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:23.920
He expressed frustration
with getting the discs.

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:30.540
He ran out of discs in his
first month at one ceremony.

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:34.550 position:56%
He also, I'm sorry to say this of
the Library, but he complained often

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:38.170
about the late payments from
the Library of Congress.

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:42.140
And the need to, speaking with
my Library colleagues here,

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.550
the need to fill out
detailed expense reports

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:48.400 position:56%
for payments as little as two cents.

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:51.600
But soon after he arrived,
he engaged Revolie Polinice.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.220
This is the gentleman
who I talked about early

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:56.460 position:56%
who was foundational to this effort.

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.730
And Polinice translated.

00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:01.970
He helped carry equipment
and baggage

00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:03.270
and negotiated with the singers.

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:06.030
Alan had some French,
but it was not much.

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:10.160
And his Creole was largely
nonexistent at the start.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:13.650
Revolie had many family members who
were involved in musical ensembles,

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:18.160
so he connected Alan up
very easily at the start.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.170
And he sometimes cooked
and cleaned and assisted

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:22.470
in the recording process.

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:27.380
So he's written into this entire
work with Alan and Elizabeth.

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:31.150
Elizabeth arrived in February, a
couple months later, after Alan.

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:33.490
So what does this collection
look like?

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:38.190
You've seen his map, these cahiers,
these French schoolbooks were used

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:44.220
by Alan to write his recordings,
to keep track of the recordings.

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:47.700
I think, along with probably
the folks here at the Library,

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.850
I may be one of the world's experts
on reading Alan's handwriting.

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:56.200 position:56%
Not easy. All the L's look like M's,
look like N's, look like vowels.

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.980
And then this is the
handwritten journal.

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:01.340
So he kept a journal.

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:04.730
At least it was a rich journal
for a few months of his voyage

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:07.300
and then got fairly thin later on.

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:12.170
Within that you'll see, and in
other pieces of paper attached

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:15.690
in this collection, you'll
see drawings of various kinds,

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:21.360
diagrams of rituals, in this
case, two versions from a Rada

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:24.600
and a Petro ceremony, two
different types of Vodou ceremonies

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.980
in Haiti of the drums used.

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:32.390
Here we see a drawing of how
he recorded a Vodou ceremony

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:34.350
at the bottom of this page.

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:36.560
He typed up some of
his notes later on.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:40.030
Not all of them, but a few of them.

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:45.160
And the miscellany, we
had receipts on the right

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:50.450
for individual musicians,
and then a list

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:53.120
of various people he was paying.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:57.910
And you can see, I can't see this
here, but maybe a little closer,

00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:00.300
20 cents for [inaudible] priest.

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:01.600
Leila's mother.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.110
Leila got 40 cents, and
Leila's mother got 20 cents,

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:07.380
50 cents for the cha-cha, the
person playing the rattle.

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:09.160
These were the musicians
he was engaging.

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:12.970
He was keep track of
the high finance

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:15.190
of fame in Haiti at the time.

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:16.490
We have his telegrams.

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:17.790
We had his maps.

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:20.460
Now I love this map
because I was confused

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:23.500
about the recordings made
in the first few weeks.

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.650
I didn't get a lot of the
names of those ensembles.

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:28.180
They didn't make sense to me.

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:32.670
Until this map appeared, and
I saw, [foreign languages].

00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:37.080
These were place names that
became part of the ensemble names.

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:44.490
And it explained where these,
not only what they were,

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:47.000 position:56%
but where these ensembles were from.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:53.080
And of course, the core of this
were the recordings, which were 10

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:58.160
and 12-inch aluminum discs,
untreated aluminum discs,

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:02.600
generally in these
cardboard containers here

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:06.130
with notes on a few of them.

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:12.070
That was what we had down in the
boughs of the Library of Congress.

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:14.900
The difference, well
let's go back to that.

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:17.550
The difference really in
Alan Lomax's ethnography

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:22.060
and everyone else's is that
Alan was primarily concerned

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:28.560
with the sonic history or
the sonic life of Haiti.

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.800
Everyone else was, if
they made recordings,

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:34.030
and a few did, they were ancillary.

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:36.140
They were writing it,
writing a book.

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:39.260
Alan was trying to
preserve the sound

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.490
of Haitian music and Haitian life.

00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:44.200
And it is a very different
collection

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.500 position:56%
than anything else that's out there.

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:46.800
It's a larger collection

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:50.530
than anything else that's
ever been released on Haiti.

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:55.430 position:56%
He had recorded these on a turntable
cutting unit that he picked

00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:56.730
up in Stanford, Connecticut

00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:58.850
from Lincoln Thompson
Sound Specialties Company.

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:02.130
Each side of these discs
could record maybe,

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:05.020
can be stretched a little
bit about eight minutes.

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:10.830
Some of the early tracks and
later tracks had different speeds.

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:13.770
I was talking with someone here a
little earlier about the difficulty

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:17.170
of working with these
variable speeds.

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:18.470
Lots of surface noise.

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:21.420
Very little bass on his recordings.

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:24.420
But on the other hand,
aluminum is just

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:26.900
as good now as it was back then.

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:29.970
They had hardly any wear and tear.

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:32.650
And we were able to recover much
of this, just to give you a sense

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:34.610
of the sound of these recordings.

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:37.480
I wanted to play a few examples,

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.900
because it's extraordinarily
diverse.

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:42.580
What Alan Lomax found
in Haiti, 1936,

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:46.940
has never been replicated
in its extent sense.

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:50.780
He spent his first couple weeks
making his way around the city,

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:55.760
being introduced to important,
so-called important elite Haitians.

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:58.240
And he recorded what he could.

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:02.260
He didn't always much
like that class in Haiti.

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:04.720
He complained about elites

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.390
and lighter-skinned
Haitians in his notes.

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:13.210
But he was taken to here, Haiti's
premier pianist, Ludovic Lamothe,

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:17.500
and as I understand, there were no
other recordings of Lamothe extent.

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:20.030
So this is it.

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:21.750
And Ludovic Lamothe
had been inspired,

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:25.440
although he was largely
a Chopinesque composer,

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:31.380 position:56%
he was inspired by the indigenous
movement, and wanted to do art music

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:36.040
that had the feeling of Haitian
carnival, of Haitian Vodou.

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:41.100
And so we're going to hear a song
dedicated to a Haitian god, local,

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:44.780 position:56%
god of agriculture and other things.

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:50.540
Which was on a rhythm
of, carnival rhythm.

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:56.530
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] is entitled Nibo,
[inaudible], a carnival dance,

00:33:56.530 --> 00:34:02.320
played by the author
himself, Mr. Ludovic Lamothe,

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:11.510
one of our foremost [inaudible]
Port-au-Prince, December 20, 1936.

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:59.040
[ Music ]

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.780
&gt;&gt; Gage Averill: Just some
delightful recordings, whether

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:03.080
or not Alan loved them,
I personally did.

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:08.790
He also went to an elite club
where both the president of Haiti

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:12.500
and the president of the
neighboring Dominican Republic were

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:13.800
being honored.

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:19.770
It was on the state visit to Haiti
of Generalissimo Rafael Trujillo,

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:21.850
the leader of Dominican Republic.

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:23.540
And he recorded a jazz band.

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:26.330
And this is stuff I had written
about, but never had recordings

00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:28.990 position:56%
of these groups in the 1930s or 40s.

00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:32.300
A group called [foreign
language] jazz, surprise jazz.

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:35.590 position:56%
And a jazz band in Haiti means, you
know, a dance band patterned on sort

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:38.200
of an African-American
prototype, but with,

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:39.500
largely with [foreign language],

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:44.400
the Haitian national
rhythm and creole lyrics.

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.480
So we're going to hear a song,
it's called a [foreign language],

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:51.540
is a tribute song to the
president of Haiti, Stenio Vincent,

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:55.290
who has won popular acclaim
among black Haitians by kicking

00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:56.860
out the Middle Easterners.

00:35:56.860 --> 00:36:02.210
And I didn't pick this for the
politics in Washington right now.

00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:07.420
But he basically beat up
on the Lebanese and others

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:11.360
who were running the stalls
along the markets in Haiti.

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.800
Kicked them out so that
Haitians could have jobs.

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:18.360
And it's called Mesi Papa
Vensan, thank you Papa Vincent

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:22.140
for giving us, you know, say,
for giving us back the tree

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:24.420
and [foreign language]
little things.

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:28.400
When Vincent was no longer
popular, Haitians would walk

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:31.470 position:56%
through the streets say thank you
Papa Vincent for giving us the holes

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:33.070
in our shoes and, you know.

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:37.510
But at this point he
was still popular.

00:36:37.510 --> 00:37:08.040
[ Music ]

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.310
He also recorded, and Nancy,
because you were asking earlier

00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:13.170
about these troubadour groups.

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:14.470
I'm going to give you an example.

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:16.930
This is the kind of music
that came to Haiti from Cuba,

00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:20.110
and it's called troubadour

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:22.540
or troubadoop [phonetic]
music in Haiti.

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:25.700
This is a band playing another
political song [foreign language].

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:29.410
There was a politician,
local politician

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:32.400
in this area called Masoco
[phonetic] whose name

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.100
sounded Dominican.

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:36.720
And this song is trying
to assure people

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:39.070
that he is really a local guy.

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:43.220
He gives everybody
sandwiches and gasoline.

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:49.350
He's a good guy, so vote for him.

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:52.510
And [foreign language].

00:37:52.510 --> 00:38:04.060
[ Music ]

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:09.190
Anyone who's heard song from
Eastern Cuba in the 1920s,

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:11.560
you'll notice this style.

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:14.030
It's terrifically Cuban.

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:16.050
[ Singing ]

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:19.820
Later on they bring
[inaudible] as well.

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:21.620
Little [inaudible].

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:36.040
[ Singing ]

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.920
So you're getting a sense of
how diverse this reparatory is.

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:43.090
I'm going to play a boy scout song

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:44.820
from [foreign language]
that he recorded.

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:47.570
This is a picture of boy scouts
here coming out of a church.

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:50.430
And this is a French, well
it's really a Belgian song

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:52.060
that Belgian kids will know.

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:55.160
And kids in Haiti have
grown up on French music

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:57.260
because who's running the schools

00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:01.380
but the Catholic Church,
French priests.

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:05.510
So this [foreign language],
a very popular song.

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:28.380
[ Singing ]

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:31.870
Play all of these all day, but
we have other things to do.

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:35.070
Rara bands, Alan was very impressed
with the Rara bands which came

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:37.150
out of the temples
typically in Haiti.

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:39.680
And then took procession
on to the street

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:43.470
for a popular during the
period leading up to Easter.

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:48.540
They have a kind of sacred, but
also a celebratory role in Haiti.

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:50.010
And he recorded many of these.

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:51.510
This is one called
[foreign language].

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:56.510
You'll hear the tubes that
are played [inaudible].

00:39:56.510 --> 00:40:13.210
[ Singing ]

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:15.140
Also recording individual singers.

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:18.410
Sometimes out, singing
songs out of context.

00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:21.640
One of my favorites, and I
devoted an entire album to her

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:23.410
because I thought it would
be very nice to bore in

00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:24.870
and just listen to someone.

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:29.010 position:56%
Give them the kind of attention
that the media might give to a star.

00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:33.370
This is an extraordinary singer
that he contracted, couldn't figure

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:35.660
out how to just have her
there all the time singing.

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:38.440
So hired her to clan house.

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:43.740
And she spent about two weeks
with Elizabeth and Alan,

00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:47.270
and while she was there, they
recorded hundreds of songs of hers.

00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:50.090
Her name is Francelia, I
don't have a last name.

00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:53.500
And this is her singing a
song [foreign language],

00:40:53.500 --> 00:41:02.330
they're using a Vodou
charm, magic charm,

00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:06.510
to keep me from getting married.

00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:36.470
[ Singing ]

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:41.450
And finally, well not finally,
I have two more to play for you.

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:42.880
This is an extraordinary group.

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:48.140
Gave me the most difficult time
of this, this box set really

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:53.240 position:56%
because they're singing in an
archaic French with Creole mixed in.

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:56.350 position:56%
Some contemporary mixed in, old men.

00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:59.420
And they're singing
in a kind of old,

00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:02.210
very old French style,
a romasse [phonetic].

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:05.820
And these are the songs about,
you know, knights and damsels

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:08.220
in distress that came
out of the late medieval

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:12.650
or early modern period, about
the 16th, 17th century in France.

00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:19.470
So this is a preserved repertory,
and it was sung at nevin [phonetic]

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:25.170
which are nine-day wake ceremonies
for the people who've passed on.

00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:26.470
These guys, old guys would go

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:30.370 position:56%
around from town-to-town singing
these songs, these old French songs,

00:42:30.370 --> 00:42:34.780
at wakes, with an extraordinarily
sound,

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:36.580
unlike anything else
I know in Haiti.

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:42.160
[ Singing ]

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:43.960
Very nasalized.

00:42:43.960 --> 00:43:04.730
[ Singing ]

00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:12.810
And I, seriously, I consulted
French Creole linguists

00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:16.360
and couldn't get half
of those recordings.

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:21.120
And finally, you know, Alan loved
a lot of sounds he encountered

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:25.070
in Haiti, but for him, the
ultimate goal was Vodou ceremonies.

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:27.700
Despite what he told
the Haitian government.

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:31.440
And this is from the
first Vodou ceremony,

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.180
full Vodou ceremony ever recorded.

00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:34.480
And Alan did it.

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:36.850
It wasn't recorded in its entirety,

00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:40.060
but every song was
recorded, parts of every song.

00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:43.270
And this is a, for the
deity that opens the gates

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:47.120
to the ceremony invites the
other gods in, [foreign language]

00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:51.270
or papa [foreign language],
and it's a song talking

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:56.510
about his difficulty
walking [foreign language].

00:43:56.510 --> 00:44:19.070
[ Singing ]

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:24.020
And they also shot, late in
the trip, Elizabeth shot films.

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:25.950
And we were talking
about the films earlier,

00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:29.320
because better copies have
surfaced in the meantime.

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:32.590
And we have very good color film
for about half of those films.

00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:35.650
I'll just show a couple minutes,
or less than a couple minutes,

00:44:35.650 --> 00:44:37.350
of black and white films.

00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:40.870
But this was shot in
1936 and '37 soundlessly.

00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:42.950
The only thing we have are
some directions from Alan

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:45.710
about what types of music
might be played alongside.

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:50.400
But I thought you'd
like to see just a taste

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:53.170 position:56%
of Elizabeth's filmography in Haiti.

00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:55.970
This is Francelia whom you
saw, or you heard earlier.

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:06.980
And these are Vodou drummers

00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:09.250
that he's brought outside
the peristyle to shoot them.

00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:10.550
It's a setup.

00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:17.870
But it was, they were having a
ceremony for him inside previously.

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:24.340
And the dancers come out to dance.

00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:29.930
The initiates or [foreign
language] of the temple.

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:36.670
Later he, preceding my
Darrin by a couple decades,

00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:38.530
uses this slow-mo technique.

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:46.370 position:56%
Whoop, we missed it, on the drums
and the ceremony, to get maybe a bit

00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:54.450
of a prurient look into the
motions of a Vodou ceremony.

00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:58.740
And he also recorded contra dances.

00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:04.250
This is the figures drawn on
the floor of a Vodou temple,

00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:09.480
individuals [foreign language],
what do we call that in English?

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:10.780
&gt;&gt; Altar.

00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:12.840
&gt;&gt; Gage Averill: Altar, thank you.

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:15.270
And the gentleman we saw
earlier at the beginning.

00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:17.860
And Alan Lomax is off
sitting on a chair talking

00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:19.930
with a [foreign language] priest.

00:46:19.930 --> 00:46:22.520
You can see Alan to the right.

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:24.170
It's a little bit dark.

00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:27.730
I hope you can see that.

00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:31.310
So that was the materials.

00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:33.360
The box set started here.

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:40.060
And it took, well from
conception, a couple decades.

00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:41.740 position:56%
But we were here about ten years ago

00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:44.290
to make the transfer,
the digital transfer.

00:46:44.290 --> 00:46:47.300
Working with the staff
to select styluses

00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:51.040
and get the best sound we could.

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:54.590
With a full set of
digital files transferred,

00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:57.110
I got to work on sorting through
the collection and trying to come

00:46:57.110 --> 00:47:01.820
up with thematized albums, working
with my friend and colleague,

00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:05.510
as well as the whole team here,

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:09.480
Louie Carl [inaudible] was
the person I just mentioned.

00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:14.500
We, especially together,
worked on the translations.

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:16.620
And sometimes interpretations.

00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:20.970
So, for example, we get
a song about a figure.

00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:22.750
Sounded like maybe
somebody important

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:24.050
that I'd never heard about.

00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:25.350
Louie Carl hadn't heard.

00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:27.550
We get on a conference
call sometimes

00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:30.320
to his family in [inaudible] Haiti.

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:33.480
If his auntie didn't
know what was going on,

00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:36.040
she'd run down to a Vodou
priest down the street.

00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:38.710
They'd bring people in,
sit around the phone.

00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:40.520
We'd be playing music
through the phone.

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:43.060
It was kind of another team

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:45.860
to put together the
interpretation on this set.

00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:48.400
Kind of a delightful process.

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:54.120
Alan's niece, Ellen
Harold, worked on his notes.

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:57.330
So I did one book about the
recordings and the process.

00:47:57.330 --> 00:48:00.510
She did another capture,
bring his notes together.

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:05.740
By September, we had an edited
version ready for formatting.

00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:07.040
Pressing and production.

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:09.950
And then in December we launched
the box set, starting with parties

00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:13.190
in Brooklyn and plan for Miami.

00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:17.380
You'll see here, let's see, in one
of these shots, me, Ellen Harold,

00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:24.320
Alan, Alan's daughter, Anna Lomax
Wood, and Louie Cal [inaudible],

00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:26.210 position:56%
just a, you were there, weren't you?

00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:27.600
No, you weren't, okay.

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:31.970
There were representatives
from the Library there as well.

00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:34.850
We had a few of these.

00:48:34.850 --> 00:48:36.800
And the patriation
plan looked like this.

00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:38.390
I'm not actually going to go
into too many details about it,

00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:40.890
but we wanted to get best
of recordings for radio.

00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:46.180 position:56%
We wanted to go to the locales which
Lomax had worked and find people,

00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:48.510
relatives of those
who had been recorded.

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:50.310 position:56%
We want to engage cultural activists

00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:53.180
and think how can this
set be of use in Haiti.

00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:55.580
We had a film crew
that we were working

00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:58.880
with to demonstrate all
of this and capture it.

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:01.990
Wanted to get the box set to
libraries and cultural centers,

00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:06.060
place listening devices
around Haiti.

00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:08.900
Translate the box set into French
and Creole, make lesson plans

00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:11.500
in French and Creole for school.

00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:14.940
And now working with
Teach for Haiti.

00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:17.330
And then eventually create a
digital version of the box set

00:49:17.330 --> 00:49:21.020
and eventually the
whole, the collection.

00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:25.760
So I was going to go to
Haiti on December 9th, 2010,

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:27.060
to do a broadcast

00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:33.250
of the Port-au-Prince jazz
festival and start this process.

00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:35.940 position:56%
But, as you, you know, it's typical,
we were talking about this, Nancy,

00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:37.260
things always break down in Haiti.

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:39.560
The local radio station
had problem technique,

00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:41.720
and I put off my trip
for a little bit.

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:44.610
Three days later, we
all know what happened.

00:49:44.610 --> 00:49:47.220
I was supposed to be
in Haiti at this time,

00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:50.320
but the [foreign language], the
massive earthquake hit Haiti,

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:53.840
about a 7.1 in Central Haiti.

00:49:53.840 --> 00:50:01.240
This is the place I used to stay,
right next to the cathedral.

00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:03.300
That's the cathedral you see there.

00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:04.730
Cathedral Centrinity [phonetic].

00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:07.280
And I would stay at
the Trinity School.

00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:13.130
The van I used to drive in
is the van on the right.

00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:15.490
This was the largest
concentration of fatalities.

00:50:15.490 --> 00:50:18.040
It happened in Port-au-Prince,
but of course,

00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:21.050
it extended up to San Mark
and to the north and out

00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:24.740
in the Plateau Central down along
the South Talaogon [phonetic]

00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:27.610
that I've talked about,
which was the center.

00:50:27.610 --> 00:50:30.850
And into Jacmel and
into the south of Haiti.

00:50:30.850 --> 00:50:33.190
Destroyed where the Presidential
Palace, which you'll see

00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:36.740
in a second, the National
Cathedral, National Assembly,

00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:39.220
the Hotel that served as
the base for the MINUSTAH,

00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:43.450
which is the UN stabilization
mission and army barracks.

00:50:43.450 --> 00:50:47.370
And with MINUSTAH and the army
out, effectively out of commission.

00:50:47.370 --> 00:50:49.690
It was up to Haitians to respond

00:50:49.690 --> 00:50:53.080
to the first weeks
after the earthquake.

00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:58.430
I don't want to make this just
an earthquake talk, but you know,

00:50:58.430 --> 00:51:02.570
iconic architecture, cultural
institutions were in rubble.

00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:05.210
Art centers, galleries destroyed.

00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:06.910 position:56%
Artworks, if they weren't destroyed,

00:51:06.910 --> 00:51:09.110
were exposed to the
elements and theft.

00:51:09.110 --> 00:51:11.710
There were aftershocks.

00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:13.170
Concert venues were destroyed.

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:17.740
Not an exaggeration to say much
of the material culture of Haiti

00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:20.200
in ruins or threatened at the time.

00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:22.080
But there's also the human capital.

00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:25.500
There were artists
living in tent cities.

00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:27.640
The tent cities sprang
up over Haiti.

00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:30.420
You can see on the right a
little improvised tent city.

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:35.890
On the left, those shacks were
the main highway in Haiti.

00:51:35.890 --> 00:51:37.980
Those doors of those shacks are

00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:42.910
over the curb entering
on to the main highway.

00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:46.710
You can't find a worse place to
try to live or sleep with children.

00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:52.750
But this is what was, what Haiti
looked like in the aftermath.

00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:56.850
Stirrings of reconstruction
here with the university,

00:51:56.850 --> 00:51:58.580
Quisqueya University,
which is being built

00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:02.110
on the ruins up on the hillsides.

00:52:02.110 --> 00:52:07.330
So we went to Haiti, well before we
got to Haiti, there was an effort

00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:12.010
to get our team out
talking about this project.

00:52:12.010 --> 00:52:17.170
I had thought, quite seriously,
that, you know, nothing was going

00:52:17.170 --> 00:52:20.030
to go on with this
project for years.

00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:25.040
We just assume there are other
fish to fry right now in Haiti.

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:26.930
And there was grief
and shock and need

00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:29.080
to mobilize the global community.

00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:33.000
But the Green Foundation, which had
signed on to support the effort,

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:34.300
came back and said, you know,

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:36.940
they were working with
Clinton Foundation.

00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:38.830
Actually, you know,
not quite so much.

00:52:38.830 --> 00:52:41.240
Right now we need this project.

00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:45.480
We need this project as
part of what's going on.

00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:49.450
And so we were put to work.

00:52:49.450 --> 00:52:52.320
They felt that kind of a
antidote to Haiti as a basket case

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:54.330
and as a recipient
nation was needed.

00:52:54.330 --> 00:52:56.550
They wanted something that
talked about Haiti's strengths

00:52:56.550 --> 00:53:00.810
and its cultural resources and
its history in positive terms.

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:05.270
So we started to reconceive what
this repatriation plan was going

00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:07.400
to look like.

00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:09.590
We had stories that
we were all involved

00:53:09.590 --> 00:53:12.980
in this kind of coverage of it.

00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:16.290 position:56%
We were asked to choose, I was asked
to choose music for the box set

00:53:16.290 --> 00:53:19.390
so they could do these PSAs
with stars, Naomi Watts

00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:22.020
and Ben Stiller and
people reading them.

00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:25.100
Money was being devoted from this.

00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:28.580
Box sets were being given
away at fundraisers.

00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:33.220
So we started, we flew to Haiti
to carry this on in March.

00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:37.380
It was unlike any flight
to Haiti I've ever been on.

00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:40.620
Usually, it's Haitians
coming back, you know.

00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:46.970
Grannies in Sunday best bringing
boxes of tires for a family.

00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:50.870
This was all North Americans going
down in tee shirts that say Haiti,

00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:55.740
you know, reconstruction,
2010, Baptist church.

00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:58.570 position:56%
It was quite different experiencing.

00:53:58.570 --> 00:54:01.820
You get there, what's usually
a [foreign language], you know,

00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:04.730
you can't get through the traffic,
was just ridiculous, you know.

00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:06.230
The army wasn't out.

00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:10.550
There were cars from all these
relief efforts filling the streets.

00:54:10.550 --> 00:54:15.060
We began the process the next
night after getting in Haiti

00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:18.570
at the Café [foreign language]
which is a cultural center

00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:23.930
which had remained standing, and
its popular performance venue.

00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:26.490 position:56%
The audience, which included
government administers, ambassadors,

00:54:26.490 --> 00:54:30.570
shop owners, musicians,
intellectuals, activists,

00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:32.110
was introduced to the project.

00:54:32.110 --> 00:54:35.010
We had a Vodou jazz band playing.

00:54:35.010 --> 00:54:37.230
We had a panel seen here.

00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:40.920
We've got [foreign name]
cultural activist on the left.

00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:47.470
Joel Widmaier, well-known musician,
radio personality, me, Anna Lomax

00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:51.500
and then our sound engineer for
the project there up on the stage,

00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:54.400
engaging with the audience.

00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:57.190
And I took questions.

00:54:57.190 --> 00:55:00.210
Someone who was there, a
radio DJ out in Leogane,

00:55:00.210 --> 00:55:06.060
decided to organize a Vodou
ceremony with both the Rada,

00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:11.740
you'll see women dressed in
white here, a Rada Vodou society,

00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:15.080
and the Kongo society dressed
in red, coming together

00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:19.170
to welcome these ancestors and
ancestral voices back to Haiti.

00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:24.130
This took place recently,
just after that, in Leogane,

00:55:24.130 --> 00:55:26.470
which had been the
epicenter of the quake.

00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:30.040
Under, you'll see the Mapou
tree, Mapou is the most sacred

00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:33.740
of all trees in Haiti,
conduit of spiritual energy.

00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:37.500
The drums are up against it, but
the ceremony is taking place.

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:44.990
I just saw that the poster had the
shot, one of these shots on it.

00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:48.250
I played, using a power source
from a, you know, battery,

00:55:48.250 --> 00:55:50.480
built Delco as they
call them in Haiti.

00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:54.230 position:56%
I played songs from the box set
that had been recorded in this area,

00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:59.590
starting with what I expected to
be very well known Vodou pieces.

00:55:59.590 --> 00:56:04.390
And then just started throwing in
these idiosyncratic older songs

00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:08.010
from smaller Vodou
societies in the region.

00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:10.420
And it was really quite amazing,
some of the old [inaudible],

00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:14.800
the [foreign language] in
the audience are nodding.

00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:17.280
And you can see the
words starting to form.

00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:20.260
And many of these songs
people hadn't heard in,

00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:22.590
you know, 50, 60 years.

00:56:22.590 --> 00:56:27.020
And the ceremony captured that.

00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:29.940
I went out to speak with a very
well-known oongar [phonetic]

00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:34.040
or priest the next day, Max
Beauvoir, and his daughter, Rachel,

00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:39.850
who was, Rachel Beauvoir-Dominique,
who is an ethnographer.

00:56:39.850 --> 00:56:41.590
And the two of them told
me how they had sat,

00:56:41.590 --> 00:56:43.500
a friend gave them this
collection over the summer.

00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:46.620
They sat for three
days listening to it,

00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:48.200
in some cases, critiquing my notes.

00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:52.100
Let me tell you, there
are mistakes in my notes.

00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:56.650
And this is exactly what
we want to happen, right.

00:56:56.650 --> 00:56:58.710
But in other words, talking
about how to get this back,

00:56:58.710 --> 00:57:04.610
some of these songs back into
daily practice in temples in Haiti.

00:57:04.610 --> 00:57:07.810
I also began to work
with an ensemble

00:57:07.810 --> 00:57:16.460
of Vodou popular band called
Lakou Mizik, musical courtyard,

00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:21.440 position:56%
musical place of familial gathering.

00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:24.760
Which has now recorded
songs by Francelia,

00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:26.990
the artist we listened to earlier.

00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:31.400 position:56%
And we're working on getting them
other song techs to begin recording.

00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:33.580
We were away from Haiti
in May on this effort

00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:35.090
but then came back in June.

00:57:35.090 --> 00:57:36.390
The Green Foundation worked

00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:42.350
with a group called Fast
Forward Haiti Cinema

00:57:42.350 --> 00:57:46.060
to record what was happening.

00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:48.170
And then to insert
the Lomax materials

00:57:48.170 --> 00:57:51.310
into this project they had
called [foreign language]

00:57:51.310 --> 00:57:53.600
or Cinema Under the Stars.

00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:58.040
And they took the stage to tent
cities, to [foreign language],

00:57:58.040 --> 00:58:03.620
the most difficult
places to live in Haiti.

00:58:03.620 --> 00:58:11.230
And then we took it
altogether again out to Leogane

00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:13.610
to show cultural materials.

00:58:13.610 --> 00:58:14.910
There was music.

00:58:14.910 --> 00:58:17.910
But then the Lomax
materials were included.

00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:20.200
And the night of the
concert in the cow field

00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:21.910
in Leogane was quite extraordinary.

00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:24.760
You're seeing it down here
in the bottom with some

00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:26.060
of the musicians playing.

00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:29.820
As part of the show, the films
shot by Alan and Elizabeth

00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:35.250
that we saw earlier were aired for
lots of people living in Leogane.

00:58:35.250 --> 00:58:39.190
This was the first time they
had ever seen the locality

00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:42.110
in film, right.

00:58:42.110 --> 00:58:44.410
Films were always from
abroad or, you know,

00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:48.100
occasionally a Haitian film,
but never about Leogane.

00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:52.370
And we started to show Alan's
color film of a rara brigade,

00:58:52.370 --> 00:58:57.340
and a woman in the second
row put her hands up

00:58:57.340 --> 00:59:01.150
and started, that's my grandpa.

00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:02.450
[Foreign language].

00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:03.750
And people started applauded.

00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:06.450
And I'm emphasizing these
moments because they meant a lot

00:59:06.450 --> 00:59:08.510
to me during this process.

00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:10.410
You see how people connect

00:59:10.410 --> 00:59:14.550
with what's otherwise,
it's an archive, right.

00:59:14.550 --> 00:59:16.650
We woke up in December
to the announcement,

00:59:16.650 --> 00:59:18.630
sorry for the self-aggrandizing
picture there,

00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:23.070
that the box set had been nominated

00:59:23.070 --> 00:59:26.940
for some Grammys, including
the notes.

00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:29.880
This is a family story.

00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:31.470
Sorry to tell you this.

00:59:31.470 --> 00:59:33.690
I went in at 5:00 in
the morning when I heard

00:59:33.690 --> 00:59:35.810
and I shook my daughter,
who is seven.

00:59:35.810 --> 00:59:39.530
I said Peony, you know, guess
what, your dad has been nominated

00:59:39.530 --> 00:59:42.450
for a Grammy for, guess
who we're up against.

00:59:42.450 --> 00:59:44.420
She said who?

00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:45.720
Sleepy head.

00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:47.020
I said, the Beetles.

00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:49.810
And she said, my Beetles?

00:59:49.810 --> 00:59:52.210
And I said, yeah, your Beetles.

00:59:52.210 --> 00:59:56.400
And I said their box set is our
principal competitor for, you know.

00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:58.730
She said, my box set?

00:59:58.730 --> 01:00:02.140
And I said, yeah, the block box
set that we listen to all the time.

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:04.130
She rolled over and
said, that's okay, Daddy,

01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:05.620
at least you were nominated.

01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:09.120
Out of the mouths of babes.

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:12.790
But this was actually one of the,
other than, you know, hoopla,

01:00:12.790 --> 01:00:14.250
it was a moment of good news.

01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:17.890
Now it was not a good
news period for Haiti.

01:00:17.890 --> 01:00:21.040
That reconstruction you might
have heard about, not so much.

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:23.480
A lot of the governments backed
off from their commitments.

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:27.230 position:56%
When they did commit, the money gets
frittered away on drivers and things

01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:32.150
or spent on national
products abroad.

01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:37.010 position:56%
Clearing debris was still being done
largely by two Haitian companies,

01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:39.340
a water company and
a telecom company,

01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:42.900
who were getting their employees
out on the street, right,

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:44.370
yellow shirts and red shirts.

01:00:44.370 --> 01:00:45.780
Where was everybody else.

01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:49.900
People were still living
in improvised housing.

01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:53.540
So this was nice to have
a moment to celebrate.

01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:59.460
We also had a show at the New
Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival

01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:01.770
to test out Haitian products.

01:01:01.770 --> 01:01:06.140
We're trying to move them into,
you know, Macy's, places like that.

01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:13.190
And we had Haitian performers, a
couple of talks, which I talked.

01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:16.460
And a big tent devoted to Haiti
to try to make the connection

01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:22.770
between post-Katrina New Orleans
and post-earthquake Haiti.

01:01:22.770 --> 01:01:25.830
Many people have made
that connection,

01:01:25.830 --> 01:01:30.450
lots of similar problems
dealing with the aftermath

01:01:30.450 --> 01:01:33.170
of the difficulties there.

01:01:33.170 --> 01:01:37.820
And the, you know, someone close
to the repatriation effort.

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:41.040
He's somebody who owned
a mango plantation.

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:44.160
Got into this story, and he started
going around with us and trying

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:47.110
to find, his job was
to find descendants

01:01:47.110 --> 01:01:49.580
of the people Alan Lomax recorded.

01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:54.210
And He located the woman with the
blue hat here, who is the daughter

01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:55.820
of the gentleman we
saw in the first slide.

01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:57.650
Do you remember the guy
up against his door?

01:01:57.650 --> 01:01:59.260
This is the same building,
by the way.

01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:01.410
The door is still there.

01:02:01.410 --> 01:02:06.830
And this is Madame
Tanise [phonetic].

01:02:06.830 --> 01:02:09.170
So she, we presented
her with a box set.

01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:10.490
I have to say, some
of this was set up.

01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:12.630
We had a film crew at
the time and they wanted,

01:02:12.630 --> 01:02:14.270
you know, the big meeting.

01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:16.300 position:56%
But we presented her with a box set.

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:18.190
Showed her films of her father,

01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:22.210
recordings of her father
and his friends.

01:02:22.210 --> 01:02:25.360
She was weeping in part, Anna Lomax
was there because the daughter

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:28.180
of this man she had heard about
who came many, many years ago

01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:32.860
to record her dad, was here
meeting the daughter of her father.

01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:34.870
And said it felt like sisters.

01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:37.400
And there was a lot
of crying going on,

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:40.730
not just the two of
them in that group.

01:02:40.730 --> 01:02:42.870
She had a stall on the street.

01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:44.170
Fed the entire crew for free.

01:02:44.170 --> 01:02:50.170
Would not take payment for, you
know, anyone like Haitian food.

01:02:50.170 --> 01:02:54.520
But it was griot, fried pork,
some pikliz, the vegetable relish,

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:55.990
and [foreign language],
fried [inaudible].

01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:58.050
Pretty tasty.

01:02:58.050 --> 01:03:01.120
So the publication and, you know,

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:02.630
I talked earlier about
the partnership.

01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:06.300
But just to dramatize, just to
a few of these, with the Library

01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:08.760
of Congress, Association
for Cultural Equity.

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:11.000
Alan Lomax's archives in New York.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.420
The Green Family Foundation, which
is supporting the repatriation.

01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:16.680
The Digital Library
of the Caribbean,

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:18.450
especially all the
Haitian collections there

01:03:18.450 --> 01:03:20.080
at the Florida International
University.

01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:24.380 position:56%
Teach for Haiti, a project in Haiti.

01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:26.960
Many other Haitian partners.

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:33.380
The Audio School down in Jacmel.

01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:35.660
This is the group that's
working together.

01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:38.560
The publication and repatriation
project has been a team effort,

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:41.510
as I emphasized at the start.

01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:44.600
You know, we're all working to try

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:47.360
to bring these cultural
archives back into circulation,

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:52.100
hoping to see, whatever might come,
countless future possibilities

01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:55.070
for epiphanies, for
growth, for discoveries,

01:03:55.070 --> 01:03:57.590
for teaching and learning.

01:03:57.590 --> 01:04:01.500
There's no way of predicting
what will come of this, right,

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:03.270
when these resources are available.

01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:06.180
But we, I think all of us are
taking comfort in the sense

01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:11.730
that new opportunities are emerging
from people who are touched by

01:04:11.730 --> 01:04:16.880
or inspired on a personal level
by this set of recordings.

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:19.800
The repatriation of Lomax's
recordings brought me face-to-face

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:21.100
with these.

01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:22.790
And again, I've emphasized
a few of them.

01:04:22.790 --> 01:04:26.670
But Katherine Dunham,
remembering lost friends.

01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:31.950
Older Vodou initiates remembering
these songs from their childhood.

01:04:31.950 --> 01:04:36.270
We heard the daughter of
Tanese, Gustaf Tanese,

01:04:36.270 --> 01:04:38.880
encountering the daughter of his,

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:42.030
the person who recorded
them those years later.

01:04:42.030 --> 01:04:45.430
Priests adding layers of
interpretation to our notes.

01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:49.560
All these experiences become
part of this odyssey, right,

01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:54.290
this odyssey of something
starts here in the stacks.

01:04:54.290 --> 01:04:58.480
And then ripples out
in ways in the world.

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:02.650
It may be imagined by
me, and maybe now by you,

01:05:02.650 --> 01:05:10.030
as this spiritual digital
govee returning to the sources,

01:05:10.030 --> 01:05:12.030
those rich, really
powerful recordings

01:05:12.030 --> 01:05:15.270
that Alan Lomax walked away
with so many years ago in Haiti.

01:05:15.270 --> 01:05:17.460
So thank you for your
time and attention.

01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:22.220
If we have time for a couple
of questions, I'm available.

01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:28.640
[ Applause ]

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:31.390
Is it okay to take
a question or two?

01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:32.690
&gt;&gt; Yes.

01:05:32.690 --> 01:05:33.990
&gt;&gt; Gage Averill: Oh great.

01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:35.290
Thanks.

01:05:35.290 --> 01:05:37.400
&gt;&gt; When you're trying to
get feedback, you know,

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:40.540
[inaudible], are you doing that?

01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:41.840
&gt;&gt; Gage Averill: Yes.

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:43.580
&gt;&gt; So how are you doing that?

01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:44.880
[Inaudible].

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:46.180
&gt;&gt; Gage Averill: Right
after I leave Washington,

01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:47.480
I'm going to the Lomax
archives in New York.

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:50.090
I was confessing to a
couple of people earlier

01:05:50.090 --> 01:05:51.590
about the difficulties
of this process.

01:05:51.590 --> 01:05:53.540 position:56%
We had lots of cooks in the kitchen.

01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:56.490
So I'm, you know, [inaudible].

01:05:56.490 --> 01:05:58.950
I'm trying to steer this forward.

01:05:58.950 --> 01:06:00.250
&gt;&gt; Stay on mike please.

01:06:00.250 --> 01:06:01.550
&gt;&gt; Gage Averill: Oh sure.

01:06:01.550 --> 01:06:03.250
I'm trying to steer this
forward as an ethnographer.

01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:07.180
We have a grantor, Green
Foundation, working on this.

01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:08.920
The Lomax Archives in New York.

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:14.370
But we are trying to, they
supposedly at the Lomax Archives,

01:06:14.370 --> 01:06:18.860
have a new program, which
I'm going to see on Monday.

01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:22.740
That program will allow us
to enter the entire metadata,

01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:27.230
all the information, about the
recordings, background information.

01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:31.000
And then load all of
that into a web presence.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.810
So I'm going to be introduced
to the technology on Monday.

01:06:35.810 --> 01:06:39.080 position:56%
My colleague, Louie Carl [inaudible]
and I who have been contracted

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:45.990
to help this next stage, which is
to get it up with a Wiki capacity

01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:49.150
so that Haitians, non-Haitians,
ethnographers,

01:06:49.150 --> 01:06:50.470
people who are interested
in knowing anything

01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:53.440
about this material can
come and add layers to this.

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:59.070 position:56%
So to me, that's the gold
standard, sorry, at the end of this,

01:06:59.070 --> 01:07:05.720
to actually get feedback and
to make this a living document.

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:07.900
I'm excited about this,
by the way, yeah.

01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:09.290
Thank you.

01:07:09.290 --> 01:07:11.340
&gt;&gt; What material is it
exactly that you want

01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:14.080 position:56%
to repatriate and where [inaudible].

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:15.380
&gt;&gt; Gage Averill: Good.

01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:21.790
Well, repatriation now, I thank you
for asking for this because just

01:07:21.790 --> 01:07:24.710
in the process of writing
an article for a volume

01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:26.830
on studies of repatriating music.

01:07:26.830 --> 01:07:30.980
And of course, when you're
dealing with many indigenous people

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:33.850
who want physical objects back.

01:07:33.850 --> 01:07:37.030
They want to repatriate it.

01:07:37.030 --> 01:07:40.220
This started out with bones
and ancestral remains.

01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:42.830
But also ceremonial regalia.

01:07:42.830 --> 01:07:46.310
It's important then to take the
objects and bring them back.

01:07:46.310 --> 01:07:49.450
In my pitch at the beginning, I
talked about precarious countries

01:07:49.450 --> 01:07:54.570
where it's actually helpful to
have safe copies reside in places

01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:59.480
like the Library of Congress where
we know there's like gigabytes,

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:02.450
tetra, backup storage,
you know, who knows where.

01:08:02.450 --> 01:08:04.170
Buried under mountains somewhere.

01:08:04.170 --> 01:08:07.630
This is a very, very safe
place for these to be.

01:08:07.630 --> 01:08:10.780
And when it's sound, our sense,

01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:12.300
the sense of the Haitian
partners we've worked

01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:16.760
with so far is those sounds and
digital versions of the objects

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:21.810
and the notes, can be repatriated,
meaning sent back into circulation,

01:08:21.810 --> 01:08:28.070
made accessible to anyone who
needs and wants to have them.

01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:33.180 position:56%
And become part of a cultural legacy
through education and other means.

01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:36.500
That's our take on repatriation.

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:40.740
It's making sure that the
materials in some form or other,

01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:45.880
by materials I mean recordings
and sounds, are accessible.

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:49.420
Rather than going down into
the Library of Congress

01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:51.230
and lifting boxes and
moving them to Haiti.

01:08:51.230 --> 01:08:54.480
Which I don't think
anyone sees as the goal.

01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:55.780
But thanks for asking.

01:08:55.780 --> 01:08:58.240
That's a very important
clarification.

01:08:58.240 --> 01:08:59.830
Yes.

01:08:59.830 --> 01:09:05.190
&gt;&gt; So you were mentioning that
you have [inaudible] additional

01:09:05.190 --> 01:09:09.410
memories, notes and experiences to
the information that you gathered.

01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:14.640
How then do you, I mean, it
potentially be an endless source

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:20.070
of recirculation of those materials
as more people know about them,

01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:22.920
more ethnographers hear about them.

01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:24.530
They have their own resources.

01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:28.210
How do you see that happening?

01:09:28.210 --> 01:09:32.170
Is it a dialogue that just is
open-ended and keeps going,

01:09:32.170 --> 01:09:34.160
or do you plan to do
something else [inaudible]?

01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:36.130
&gt;&gt; Gage Averill: That's
a brilliant question.

01:09:36.130 --> 01:09:40.300
I have seen as far as
the dialogue stage.

01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:48.340
I am in constant, constantly aware
of my limitations as a scholar

01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:52.640 position:56%
in a culture which I didn't grow up.

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:56.830 position:56%
And the limitations of my informants
and colleagues and others.

01:09:56.830 --> 01:10:00.430
So I think this dialogue will
enrich the project greatly.

01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:02.310
What happens after
that, I haven't thought.

01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:06.540
If you have some ideas I would love
to hear them because it is possible

01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:11.030
that you might sort of capture that
at another stage in the process.

01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:13.040
[ Inaudible ]

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.340
Okay, great.

01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:15.640
Yes.

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:18.510
&gt;&gt; What bones, like
spiritual regalia,

01:10:18.510 --> 01:10:24.920
that is repatriated or restored.

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:32.870
These artifacts have
a spiritual aspect.

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:41.970
Maybe I could ask you to go beyond
a little bit and just theorize

01:10:41.970 --> 01:10:46.850
for a moment about
the healing capacity

01:10:46.850 --> 01:10:53.750
or any other spiritual aspect that
might not be immediately visible.

01:10:53.750 --> 01:11:02.140
But the practical matter as
impacts the Haitian on the street.

01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:06.250
&gt;&gt; Gage Averill: You have asked
me to go beyond, haven't you?

01:11:06.250 --> 01:11:08.510
I would, you know, because
everyone would approach this

01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:09.810
certainly different.

01:11:09.810 --> 01:11:13.700
Haitians of different religious
backgrounds would have very

01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:18.160
different takes on the sounds that
have been recorded and their role.

01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:24.590
There is, even 70, 80 years after
the anti-superstitious campaigns

01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:29.590
in Haiti, there is a good
and various large swath

01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:33.050
of elite middle-class Haitians
and some poor [inaudible]

01:11:33.050 --> 01:11:37.150
around the country who want to
have nothing to do with sounds

01:11:37.150 --> 01:11:42.080
that might have had
an origin in Vodou.

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:44.990
The powerful presence of
evangelical churches in Haiti

01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:53.930
from the American occupation on,
which has grown considerably,

01:11:53.930 --> 01:11:58.840
in part has been fueled by Haitians
wanting, in some ways to kind

01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:02.700
of protect themselves from
a world of spiritual power

01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:04.780 position:56%
that they find potentially menacing.

01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:08.460
So I have friends who might
be Catholic or something

01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:13.350
who baptized your children [foreign
language], in order to protect them

01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:14.690
from the [foreign language].

01:12:14.690 --> 01:12:17.410
So I don't want to ever imagine

01:12:17.410 --> 01:12:24.980
that Haiti has a unified
spiritual background or belief set.

01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:30.050
The, I am certainly aware, and
you can read spirituality in this

01:12:30.050 --> 01:12:33.530
if you want, but of
the power of sound.

01:12:33.530 --> 01:12:38.970
And the power of voices in healing.

01:12:38.970 --> 01:12:44.790 position:56%
I think we learn more and more about
what, you know, various diseases,

01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:48.080
various conditions,
various emotional states,

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:51.520
how they can be improved
through music, through sound.

01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:53.890
I think it's important
for people spiritually,

01:12:53.890 --> 01:12:57.490
as well as intellectually, to have
a sense of where they come from.

01:12:57.490 --> 01:12:59.440
I think people seek this out.

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:00.740
Human seek this out.

01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:06.140
I just did my, you
know, ancestory.com,

01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:07.440
you know, thing the other day.

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:10.360 position:56%
We want to know who we're
connected to and where we come from.

01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:13.270
I think this is powerful
in that way.

01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:18.420 position:56%
Now, whether or not, and I think
it's open to interpretation, whether

01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:23.670
or not a disc, an aluminum disc,
which was there in a moment

01:13:23.670 --> 01:13:26.520
when people gathered around
and sang through an apparatus

01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:32.940
and had their voices engraved
in a spiral on the disc.

01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:37.000 position:56%
Whether or not that disc is embodied
with spiritual power, I think,

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.620
is open to, I think some people
would argue that it is in Haiti.

01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:45.980
Whether, now how do
we play without that.

01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:49.800
How do we engage with that,
and how do we honor that.

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:52.300
Sometimes archives tour.

01:13:52.300 --> 01:14:00.640
In my job as dean, I oversee
a museum called the MOA,

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:03.520
Museum of Anthropology at UBC.

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:07.730
One of the great collections of
first nations art and artifacts.

01:14:07.730 --> 01:14:10.170
With a reciprocal research
relationship

01:14:10.170 --> 01:14:14.000
with all the first nations
bands in the northwest.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.030
[Inaudible] are our neighbors

01:14:16.030 --> 01:14:20.420
on whose territory we
sit, unseated territory.

01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:23.290
Have allowed burial
boxes to be used there.

01:14:23.290 --> 01:14:27.800
Everything in that museum has
to have a sign off, right.

01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:31.950
We have exhibits that are
whited out and left there

01:14:31.950 --> 01:14:37.550
because [inaudible] would
prefer they not be viewed.

01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:40.370
And we want that statement
to be there.

01:14:40.370 --> 01:14:43.530
That museum, we bring
people to the museum.

01:14:43.530 --> 01:14:47.890
We have ceremonies there, dances.

01:14:47.890 --> 01:14:52.070
We repatriate remains.

01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:55.250
We did this recently to
South Sea islanders who came,

01:14:55.250 --> 01:14:59.360
Samoans who came, military
delegation of Samoans.

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:00.660
Wouldn't talk to the museum,

01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:02.540
wouldn't talk to me,
which is important.

01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:03.840
They would talk of the [inaudible]

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:09.050
who were their first nation's
hosts and repatriated remains.

01:15:09.050 --> 01:15:12.370
You can bring people
in and out of museums,

01:15:12.370 --> 01:15:14.880
and one way of bringing the museum
out or the collection out is

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:18.500
to tour things so that people
have that powerful sense of being

01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:20.620
in the presence, even if
it's material objects.

01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:22.120
So I've gone on.

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:23.470
I'm sort of spinning this.

01:15:23.470 --> 01:15:25.870
But I think it's a really
interesting question.

01:15:25.870 --> 01:15:31.250
And I would love to engage, you
know, with the archive culture

01:15:31.250 --> 01:15:34.330
and museum on those
next stage questions

01:15:34.330 --> 01:15:38.820
about how we go further
in the material side.

01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:41.120
Which may also be the
spiritual side.

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:42.480
Thank you.

01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:44.390
&gt;&gt; Great. Thank you
so much for coming.

01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:45.690
Gage Averill.

01:15:45.690 --> 01:15:48.740
&gt;&gt; Gage Averill: I can take
questions individually.

01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:50.160
Thank you so much.

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:51.460
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson: Thank you.

01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:55.170
I just want to point out that
there's a copy of the box seat

01:15:55.170 --> 01:15:57.150 position:56%
if people would like to take a look.

01:15:57.150 --> 01:15:58.450
I want to thank you for coming.

01:15:58.450 --> 01:16:01.600
Our next Botkin lecture
is on May 10th,

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:06.060
and we'll be featuring a discussion
with Mark Moss who is the singer

01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:11.300
of Sing Out Magazine, who is the
editor rather of Sing Out Magazine.

01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:15.000
Well certainly the editor
of Sing Out Magazine.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.370
And we're going to be talking
about folk music and journalism

01:16:18.370 --> 01:16:21.390
in the 20th and 21st century.

01:16:21.390 --> 01:16:23.820
Thank you again for coming.

01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:27.460
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
