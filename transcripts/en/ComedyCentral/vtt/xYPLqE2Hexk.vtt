&gt;&gt; Larry: YES!

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.905 align:start position:0% line:85%
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!

00:00:05.938 --> 00:00:09.809 align:start position:0% line:85%
WELCOME TO THE SHOW.

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:11.344 line:91%
I'M YOUR HOST, LARRY WILMORE,
THAT'S ME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:00:11.377 --> 00:00:13.079 line:85%
BIG NEWS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.

00:00:13.112 --> 00:00:16.849 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW WE ALL KNOW WE GAVE UP ON
HOPE A LONG TIME AGO, BUT

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:22.355 align:start position:0% line:91%
POTENTIAL CHANGE WITH CUBA MAY
BE ABOUT TO HAPPEN.

00:00:22.388 --> 00:00:24.757 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; REPRESENTATIVES MET IN HAVANA
TO DISCUSS REESTABLISHING

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.127 align:start position:0% line:91%
DIPLOMATIC TIES BETWEEN THE TWO
COUNTRIES.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.333 line:91%
AN AGREEMENT WOULD ULTIMATELY
LIFT TRADE AND TRAVEL EMBARGOS

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:37.904 size:84% position:42% line:85%
IN PLACE FOR SOME 50 YEARS.

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:45.745 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

00:00:45.778 --> 00:00:49.649 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THIS IS REALLY GOOD
NEWS.

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:56.322 align:start position:0% line:91%
THOSE AREN'T REALLY GOOD CIGARS,
THOUGH

00:00:56.355 --> 00:00:56.722 align:start position:0% line:85%
CUBA.

00:00:56.756 --> 00:00:57.923 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:00:57.957 --> 00:00:58.958 line:91%
TODAY, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A
GENERATION, THE U.S. AND CUBA

00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:00.159 align:start position:0% line:91%
ARE HOLDING HIGH-LEVEL
DIPLOMATIC TALKS IN PUBLIC.

00:01:00.192 --> 00:01:01.527 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND LIKE SEX IN A HATCHBACK,
THINGS ARE OFF TO A ROUGH START.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.196 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE HEAD OF CUBA'S TEAM,
FOREIGN MINISTERY OFFICIAL

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.631 align:start position:0% line:91%
JOSEFINA VIDAL , CRITICIZED THE
CUBAN ADJUSTMENT ACT, WHICH

00:01:05.664 --> 00:01:10.503 align:start position:0% line:91%
INCLUDES THE WET FOOT/DRY FOOT
POLICY.

00:01:10.536 --> 00:01:12.238 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT STATES THAT CUBANS
INTERCEPTED AT SEA BY U.S. LAW

00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:14.574 align:start position:0% line:91%
ENFORCEMENT ARE RETURNED TO
CUBA, WHILE THOSE WHO MAKE IT TO

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:17.410 align:start position:0% line:91%
U.S. SOIL CAN APPLY FOR
PERMANENT RESIDENCY AFTER ONE

00:01:17.443 --> 00:01:19.779 align:start position:0% line:85%
YEAR.

00:01:19.812 --> 00:01:22.648 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: SO IF YOU GET TO
LAND, YOU CAN STAY?

00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:25.051 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT IF YOU GET CAUGHT ON THE
WATER, YOU'RE OUT?

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:28.221 align:start position:0% line:91%
MAN, THAT'S SOME HIGH-STAKES
MARCO POLO.

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:29.922 align:start position:0% line:85%
MARCO!

00:01:29.955 --> 00:01:35.761 align:start position:0% line:91%
"YOU ARE UNDER ARREST!"
POLO.

00:01:35.794 --> 00:01:39.098 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW AMERICA IS EASING
RESTRICTIONS ON CUBAN TRAVEL,

00:01:39.131 --> 00:01:41.100 line:91%
AND COMMERCIAL AIRLINES LIKE
DELTA AND JETBLUE HAVE ALREADY

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:43.803 align:start position:0% line:91%
SHOWN INTEREST IN ROUTES TO
HAVANA.

00:01:43.836 --> 00:01:45.571 align:start position:0% line:91%
NO WORD YET IF SPIRIT AIRLINES
IS GOING TO GET IN ON THE

00:01:45.604 --> 00:01:48.374 align:start position:0% line:91%
ACTION, BUT IN ALL HONESTY,
SERIOUSLY, YOU WOULD BE

00:01:48.407 --> 00:01:57.049 size:81% position:41% line:85%
BETTER OFF ON A DAMN RAFT.

00:01:57.082 --> 00:01:58.885 align:start position:0% line:85%
SORRY SPIRIT.

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:00.920 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW, BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T HAD
RELATIONS WITH CUBA IN SO LONG,

00:02:00.953 --> 00:02:02.321 align:start position:0% line:91%
I THINK WE NEED TO DO A LITTLE
CATCHING UP.

00:02:02.354 --> 00:02:04.223 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO HERE TO TAKE US THROUGH THAT
IS OUR OWN RICKY VELEZ.

00:02:04.256 --> 00:02:08.327 align:start position:0% line:85%
RICKY, WELCOME.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.600 align:start position:0% line:91%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NOW, YOU'RE CUBAN, RIGHT RICKY?

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:16.569 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NAH, HALF PUERTO RICAN, HALF
IRISH.

00:02:16.602 --> 00:02:17.203 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: CLOSE ENOUGH.

00:02:17.236 --> 00:02:18.604 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALL RIGHT.

00:02:18.637 --> 00:02:20.973 align:start position:0% line:85%
BREAK IT DOWN FOR US.

00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:23.142 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; LARRY, I THINK IT'S REALLY
IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO

00:02:23.175 --> 00:02:26.078 size:81% position:41% line:91%
UNDERSTAND HOW SERIOUS OUR
RELATIONSHIP WITH CUBA IS.

00:02:26.111 --> 00:02:29.215 align:start position:0% line:91%
LET'S START WITH THE CUBAN
MISSILE CRISIS.

00:02:29.248 --> 00:02:33.819 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT WAS LIKE BACK IN THE '50s
OR '60s, I'M NOT SURE

00:02:33.852 --> 00:02:36.622 line:85%
MISSILES WERE FLYING AT CUBA.

00:02:36.655 --> 00:02:40.526 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND MAGNETO WAS DOWN THERE AND
WAS, LIKE, NO THANKS!

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:43.763 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
PROFESSOR X IS SHOT IN THE BACK.

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:45.464 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW HE'S GOT TO BE IN A
WHEELCHAIR. IT'S ALL MESSED UP

00:02:45.497 --> 00:02:51.971 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: RICKY -- THIS HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH CUBA.

00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:55.808 align:start position:0% line:91%
THIS SOUNDS LIKE X-MEN FIRST
CLASS.

00:02:55.841 --> 00:02:58.077 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; DO YOU WANT ME TO FILE MY
REPORT OR NOT, LARRY?

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.079 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OF COURSE.

00:03:00.112 --> 00:03:00.746 align:start position:0% line:85%
SURE.

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:02.515 align:start position:0% line:85%
GO AHEAD.

00:03:02.548 --> 00:03:05.151 line:91%
&gt;&gt; SO THEN AFTER THAT MISSILE
BUSINESS, AMERICA'S, LIKE,

00:03:05.184 --> 00:03:06.786 align:start position:0% line:91%
"WE'RE NOT TALKING TO YOU
ANYMORE, CUBA.

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:12.758 align:start position:0% line:91%
BYE, BITCH!"
THAT WAS THAT.

00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:13.359 align:start position:0% line:85%
BUT THAT'S THE '60s.

00:03:13.392 --> 00:03:14.527 align:start position:0% line:85%
NOW WE'RE IN THE '70s.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.430 line:91%
NEXT THING YOU KNOW, MICHAEL
CORELEONE  GOES DOWN THERE TO

00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:20.399 align:start position:0% line:91%
CONFRONT FREDO BECAUSE HE KNOWS
WHAT HE DID.

00:03:20.432 --> 00:03:22.501 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO MICHAEL SAYS, "YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO DIE IN A BOAT."

00:03:22.534 --> 00:03:23.836 align:start position:0% line:85%
BAM.

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:30.209 align:start position:0% line:85%
'80s.

00:03:30.242 --> 00:03:31.377 size:75% position:38% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WAIT A MINUTE.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.512 align:start position:0% line:91%
I THINK YOU'RE STILL TALKING
ABOUT MOVIES.

00:03:33.545 --> 00:03:34.146 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YEAH...

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:34.880 align:start position:0% line:85%
DOCUMENTARIES.

00:03:34.913 --> 00:03:36.382 align:start position:0% line:85%
CAN I FINISH?

00:03:36.415 --> 00:03:36.983 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: YES, PLEASE.

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:38.851 align:start position:0% line:85%
FINISH.

00:03:38.884 --> 00:03:42.421 align:start position:0% line:91%
I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR WHAT
HAPPENS.

00:03:42.454 --> 00:03:45.157 line:91%
&gt;&gt; SO THEN AL PACINO'S SO BUMMED
ABOUT SHOOTING HIS BROTHER, HE

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.693 line:91%
GETS ALL TONY MONTANA AND HE'S
LIKE "FIRST YOU GOTTA GET THE

00:03:47.726 --> 00:03:51.330 line:91%
MONEY, THEN YOU GOTTA GET THE
POWER, THEN YOU GOTTA GET THE

00:03:51.363 --> 00:03:53.266 align:start position:0% line:91%
WOMEN." SO THEN IT'S, LIKE, "SAY
HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND."

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.903 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND THEN HE'S LIKE "SAY HELLO TO
MY LITTLE FRIEND!" 

00:03:57.936 --> 00:03:58.837 align:start position:0% line:91%
(BULLETS FIRING) 
FLASH 30 YEARS FORWARD.

00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:03.876 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT'S WHERE WE ARE WITH CUBA
NOW. YOU KNOW.

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:06.078 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: RICKEY, THAT WASN'T
REMOTELY HELPFUL.

00:04:06.111 --> 00:04:07.546 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE WELCOME, LARRY.

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.181 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'M JUST TRYING TO KEEP IT
100 LIKE YOU, MAN

00:04:09.214 --> 00:04:12.952 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: RICKY VELEZ!

00:04:12.985 --> 00:04:18.858 align:start position:0% line:91%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU, RICKY!

00:04:18.891 --> 00:04:21.260 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE IF I CAN
TRY TO EXPLAIN IT

00:04:21.293 --> 00:04:24.230 size:84% position:42% line:85%
YOU KNOW WHO CUBA IS TO US?

00:04:24.263 --> 00:04:28.801 line:91%
YOU KNOW THAT UNCLE THAT YOUR
PARENTS HAD A FALLING OUT WITH,

00:04:28.834 --> 00:04:32.505 align:start position:0% line:91%
LIKE, 50 YEARS AGO, AND NOBODY
KNOWS WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?

00:04:32.538 --> 00:04:38.444 line:91%
RUMORS ARE MY DAD TRIED TO KILL
HIM A COUPLE OF TIMES, BUT HE'S

00:04:38.477 --> 00:04:46.319 align:start position:0% line:91%
GOT THIS REALLY COOL BEACH HOUSE
RIGHT DOWN THE STREET.

00:04:46.352 --> 00:04:47.887 line:91%
YOU SEE THESE OLD PICTURES OF
THE CRAZY PARTIES HE USED TO

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.355 align:start position:0% line:91%
HAVE WITH, LIKE, SINATRA AND
HEMINGWAY HANGING OUT.

00:04:49.388 --> 00:04:50.623 line:85%
HE'S GOT ALL THESE '59 CHEVYS.

00:04:50.656 --> 00:04:52.758 line:91%
AND YOU WERE JUST DYING TO VISIT
HIM, AND YOUR DAD'S, LIKE, "NO!"

00:04:52.791 --> 00:04:57.863 align:start position:0% line:91%
WELL, NOW HE'S SAYING, "WE'LL
SEE."

00:04:57.896 --> 00:05:03.035 line:85%
THAT'S WHERE WE ARE WITH CUBA.

00:05:03.068 --> 00:05:04.203 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE TRUTH IS, I DON'T REALLY
KNOW ABOUT CUBA.

00:05:04.236 --> 00:05:05.738 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHAT'S IT LIKE TO LIVE THERE
THESE DAYS?

00:05:05.771 --> 00:05:07.173 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THEY DON'T JUST GO TO A
GROCERY STORE.

00:05:07.206 --> 00:05:08.574 size:84% position:42% line:91%
THEY HAVE WHAT'S CALLED A
LIBERETTA WHERE THEY DO THE

00:05:08.607 --> 00:05:09.775 align:start position:0% line:85%
RATIONS.

00:05:09.808 --> 00:05:10.910 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO LET'S SAY YOU'RE A FAMILY OF
FIVE, YOU GET ONE CHICKEN A

00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:14.814 align:start position:0% line:85%
MONTH.

00:05:14.847 --> 00:05:15.614 line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: ONE CHICKEN A MONTH?

00:05:15.647 --> 00:05:17.216 align:start position:0% line:85%
MAN, THAT'S HORRIBLE!

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:22.788 line:85%
HERE WE USE A CHICKEN AS BREAD!

00:05:22.821 --> 00:05:31.497 align:start position:0% line:91%
(APPLAUSE)
WE ARE SUCH ASSHOLES.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.866 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
ACTUALLY, I WOULDN'T MIND

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:36.102 size:75% position:38% line:85%
DOUBLING DOWN RIGHT NOW.

00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:39.338 line:85%
MUST RESIST AMERICAN STOMACH.

00:05:39.371 --> 00:05:41.240 align:start position:0% line:91%
WELL, IT CAN'T GET MUCH WORSE
THAN THAT.

00:05:41.273 --> 00:05:43.576 line:91%
&gt;&gt; EVEN WHEN YOU GET INTERNET,
IT'S SO SLOW YOU USE IT TO HAVE

00:05:43.609 --> 00:05:47.079 align:start position:0% line:85%
MAIL.

00:05:47.112 --> 00:05:48.681 size:88% position:44% line:91%
MAYBE ONCE A MONTH OR ONCE A
WEEK, YOU GO TO Facebook TO

00:05:48.714 --> 00:05:49.382 align:start position:0% line:85%
SEE YOUR FRIENDS.

00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:50.182 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S OUR INTERNET.

00:05:50.215 --> 00:05:51.517 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: ONCE A MONTH?

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.152 size:81% position:41% line:85%
THAT PLACE IS A HELL HOLE.

00:05:53.185 --> 00:05:55.521 align:start position:0% line:85%
GOD, I'M SO ANGRY.

00:05:55.554 --> 00:05:59.191 line:85%
SHOW ME THAT DOUBLE DOWN AGAIN?

00:05:59.224 --> 00:05:59.825 align:start position:0% line:85%
MMM...

00:05:59.858 --> 00:06:03.429 align:start position:0% line:85%
THANKS, DOUBLE DOWN.

00:06:03.462 --> 00:06:04.597 line:85%
WELL, THIS IS REALLY TERRIBLE.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:05.931 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
ANYBODY WOULD BE AGAINST LIFTING

00:06:05.964 --> 00:06:07.233 align:start position:0% line:85%
THESE SANCTIONS.

00:06:07.266 --> 00:06:09.802 size:81% position:41% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT IN
EXCHANGE FOR ALL OF THESE

00:06:09.835 --> 00:06:13.406 line:91%
CONCESSIONS THAT THE WHITE HOUSE
HAS NOW MADE HAS SAID NOTHING OR

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:15.741 align:start position:0% line:91%
DONE NOTHING TO ADVANCE
DEMOCRACY, NO FREEDOM OF THE

00:06:15.774 --> 00:06:18.310 align:start position:0% line:91%
PRESS, NO FREEDOM OF
ORGANIZATION, THERE WILL BE NO

00:06:18.343 --> 00:06:20.379 align:start position:0% line:85%
ELECTION.

00:06:20.412 --> 00:06:22.915 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WELL, HE MAKES A
GOOD POINT.

00:06:22.948 --> 00:06:25.217 line:91%
WE DON'T LIKE DOING BUSINESS
WITH COUNTRIES THAT DON'T HAVE

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.252 size:78% position:39% line:85%
FREE SPEECH OR ELECTIONS.

00:06:26.285 --> 00:06:32.425 align:start position:0% line:91%
UNLESS THEY'RE MAKING OUR
iPhones.

00:06:32.458 --> 00:06:38.531 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)

00:06:38.564 --> 00:06:39.532 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:44.837 size:88% position:44% line:85%
OH, THE TRUTH, OH THE TRUTH.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:45.604 align:start position:0% line:85%
THIS IS CONFUSING.

00:06:45.637 --> 00:06:47.006 size:88% position:44% line:85%
BOTH SIDES HAVE GOOD POINTS.

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:48.607 align:start position:0% line:91%
LOOK, IF WE WANT TO USE OUR
MONEY TO HELP REVITALIZE A PLACE

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.075 line:91%
