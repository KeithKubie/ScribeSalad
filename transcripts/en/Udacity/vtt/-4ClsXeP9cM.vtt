In addition to statistics, many data scientists are well

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.070
versed in machine learning. You might be wondering what exactly

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.940
is machine learning. Well, machine learning is a branch of

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.200
artificial intelligence that's focused on constructing systems that learn from

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.660
large amounts of data to make predictions. Machine learning could

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.180
also be useful to predict which movies you might like

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.500
on Netflix. Or how many home runs a batter may

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.440
hit over the course of his career. These are all

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.530
potential applications of machine learning.
