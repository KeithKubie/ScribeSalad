00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.430
&gt;&gt; So we just gave you two concrete examples

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.910
of how you can improve the UX of your app.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.760
&gt;&gt; Exactly. The Sign-In and Check Out buttons to replace

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.200
forms are a really good idea. But, I know that

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.730
I've actually ended up creating my own sign-in and check

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.330
out forms. And I spent a lot of time optimizing them.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah, me too.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:19.650
&gt;&gt; I'm sure you've done the same.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.810
&gt;&gt; I, I've done the same thing. I've spent a lot of time trying to

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.660
design the perfect sign-in form, and I've tested

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.330
it with users and tried really hard to

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.540
optimize it.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.000
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So the, the solution as we've presented them to you

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.410
are actually just Band-Aids. There's an underlying cause actually there is an

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.300
underlying problem which results in us. Coming up with these forms, and

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.860
really focusing on the forms rather

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.300
than focusing on the applications themselves.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.400
&gt;&gt; If your first instinct was to optimize locally, and not to just

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.420
replace sign-in and check out with one of these solutions, what was your

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.380
thought process? Were you thinking too detailed? Were you thinking

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.070
too high level? Were you not thinking of the bigger picture?

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.000
Were you trying to reuse existing code? Or is it

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.910
something else? Or none of the above? Check all that apply.
