00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.350
These 4 letters of DNA represent the alphabet of your genetic

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.390
code, C, T, A, and G. But every time we use these

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.400
4 letters in our DNA, they really represent a specific chemical

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.800
structure coded here in the nitrogenous base. Put together

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.820
in sequence, many deoxynucleotides. These individual nitrogenous

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.960
bases are part of deoxynucleotides that build

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.290
up what we call deoxyribonucleic acid. Now,

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.270
that name can seem complicated, but it's

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.550
really intended just to describe the chemistry

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.000
of the molecule. You can see the chemistry actually here. I've written out The

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.700
organic chemistry structure of this same sequence

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.850
of deoxynucleotides, where you can see each

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.860
position there's an atom; nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous. These are elements

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.910
in the periodic table. This is chemistry that makes up our biology of who we

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.220
are. The name deoxyribonucleic acid is simply a useful term to describe this

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.030
chemistry. Take this individual nucleotide here,

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.670
that has a nitrogenous base adenine attached.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.610
Now there are four parts to the title deoxyribonucleic acid. First there's the

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:30.410
deoxy part. Next, there's the ribo- part, then there's the nucleic- part,

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.810
and then there's the acid part.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.950
Each of these four parts of deoxyribonucleic

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.750
acid describe a specific part of this chemistry.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.590
For example, this part of the molecule

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.030
here, called a phosphate group, can actually be

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.000
acidic under certain conditions. This part of

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.700
the molecule here is called a ribose sugar.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.030
I don't know if you know this or not, but sugars are also molecules. This part

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.180
of the sugar right here, is actually missing an oxygen atom. An then I tried

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.310
in the space structure we've already mentioned, contains

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.980
nitrogen. What I want you to tell me

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.320
is which number, from DNA or Deoxyribonucleic Acid

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.440
is shown here. Describes which part of the

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.820
chemistry of the deoxynucleotide. Now, this could be

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.030
a little tricky if you don't have a

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.720
chemistry background, but I've tried to lay it out in such a way

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.380
that makes it pretty straightforward for you to identify. So if you have

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.720
trouble, just go ahead and take a guess, and see if you can

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.410
get it right. Put a number into each text box that you see here.
