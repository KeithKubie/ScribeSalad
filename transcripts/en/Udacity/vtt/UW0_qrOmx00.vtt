00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.967
We've been together for a while now, and
I just want to take a step back and say,

00:00:04.967 --> 00:00:08.299
thanks for bearing with us,
this is a ton of information.

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:11.608
You've learned how to create
some really cool features using

00:00:11.608 --> 00:00:15.361
the Google Maps APIs, using a drawing
layer, making unique styles,

00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:17.844
showing users distances and
directions, and

00:00:17.844 --> 00:00:21.710
getting back detailed places
of interest information.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.350
&gt;&gt; You may be wondering what this is.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.391
Well, it's Google's gift to you,
and we'll show you.

00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:29.542
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:29.542 --> 00:00:32.963
[SOUND] It's the keys to the castle.

00:00:32.963 --> 00:00:35.903
You see,
now that you know how to use them,

00:00:35.903 --> 00:00:39.135
the Google Maps APIs
are yours to use for free.

00:00:39.135 --> 00:00:43.768
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; In the next few lessons, will go over

00:00:43.768 --> 00:00:48.220
some important practical details you
need to know while flexing your creative

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.620
muscles, and using location services,
and visualizations in your sites.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.500
&gt;&gt; So far, you've been using the API
keys you generated in the very beginning

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.270
of the course to access most of
the functionality we've covered.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.280
You've also already enabled
the APIs that you've used so far.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.680
&gt;&gt; We're going to go over the other
important things that you can and should

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.810
be doing within the Google Developers
Console, now that you're a pro.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.860
&gt;&gt; The first thing you should be
aware of is the ability to monitor

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.060
the usage of your API key.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.970
You should know that there is
an allotted number of what we call

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.850
map loads,
that you can use as a free user.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.360
Every time you load a Google map, using
the initialized function that we've seen

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.160
to create a map object,
you use one map look.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.790
You have more than enough quota to
experiment freely and develop apps.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.170
See the documentation linked in the
instructor notes for up-to-date amounts.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.386
You can see how many you use over
time within the developer's console.

00:01:45.386 --> 00:01:47.404
And we'll practice that soon.

00:01:47.404 --> 00:01:51.065
&gt;&gt; Next, in order to increase
the security of your API key,

00:01:51.065 --> 00:01:54.361
you can whitelist domains
which are able to use it.

00:01:54.361 --> 00:01:57.011
For example, after making my site,

00:01:57.011 --> 00:02:00.608
I could whitelist
EmilysNYCHouseHunter.com.

00:02:00.608 --> 00:02:04.320
And then, that will be the only site
that can make requests using that key.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.680
When making a request using that
API key, they'll go through.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.590
If any other domain,
like AjaysNYCHousHunter.com,

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.240
attempts to do so,
they would get an error.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.090
That way, nobody accidentally
starts to use my key,

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.190
using up all my map loads or
not so accidentally.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.990
It's always important
to protect yourself.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.480
Quota theft is not a common occurrence,
but we care about security here.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.340
&gt;&gt; Now, as I said, there is a fair
amount of quota given for free.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.490
Most websites and
applications will stay within this.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.360
However, if you consistently
generate a high amount of traffic,

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.450
you just limit supply.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.800
And you'll need to pay for extra usage.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.686
You can do this by enabling billing
within the developers console.

00:02:47.686 --> 00:02:51.990
You can also choose to put
an enforced cap on your usage

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.130
to make sure you don't
go over a certain limit.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.160
See the documentation in the instructor
notes for how to do this.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.110
&gt;&gt; The next thing to be aware of,
has to do with using the services.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.530
Both client and server side.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.870
In general, there are two types of
caps that we have on service usage.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.110
Queries per day,

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.240
also known as QPD, which is the total
number of requests made in one day.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.750
And queries per second,

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.900
or QPS, which as it sounds is the number
of requests made in one second.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.190
The developer documentation has
specifics on the limitations for

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.860
each web service.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.770
Remember how we talked about web
service response codes before?

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.950
&gt;&gt; Right, we wanted that okay response.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.240
If you ever see the over
query limit response code,

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.680
it means you've hit one of these QPD or
QPS limits.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.350
Now, try logging into the Google
developer's console and

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.410
viewing your projects usage so far.
