was initially done in mice and then it

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949
was initially done in mice and then it
 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.580
was initially done in mice and then it
was done in humans and that is touch the

was done in humans and that is touch the
 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.540
was done in humans and that is touch the
power of touch if you take a mouse and

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550
power of touch if you take a mouse and
 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.130
power of touch if you take a mouse and
you take it away from other mice and put

it gets more disease it takes longer to

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199
it gets more disease it takes longer to
 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.709
it gets more disease it takes longer to
get over infections you put it back so

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719
get over infections you put it back so
 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.840

interactions don't do well so you need
 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.660
interactions don't do well so you need
to figure out a way to get that touch

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670
to figure out a way to get that touch
 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.970
to figure out a way to get that touch
people who live with someone cohabitate

live longer than people who live alone
 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.310
live longer than people who live alone
so figure out a way to do it and figure

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320

affects you you need to figure out a way
to get away from that obviously you

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950
to get away from that obviously you
 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.740
to get away from that obviously you

many of those are family members but you
have to figure out a way so that those

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350
have to figure out a way so that those
 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.810

downtime everyday is actually what

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940
downtime everyday is actually what
 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.760
downtime everyday is actually what
allows what happened during the day to

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770
allows what happened during the day to
 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.220
allows what happened during the day to
sink in so if a child is at school all

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230
sink in so if a child is at school all
 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.660
sink in so if a child is at school all

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410
you know for me it's that drive home
 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.680
you know for me it's that drive home
that drive home I turn off my devices

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690
that drive home I turn off my devices
 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.600

downtime and it actually works at the
 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.530
downtime and it actually works at the
same time the brain needs quiet there

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540
same time the brain needs quiet there
 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.790

was a study done in Europe where they

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800
was a study done in Europe where they
 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.470
was a study done in Europe where they
looked at circles around an airport the

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480
looked at circles around an airport the
 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.480
looked at circles around an airport the
closer you were to it the higher the

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490
closer you were to it the higher the
 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.270
closer you were to it the higher the
rate of cognitive decline so figure out
