00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:16.900
Pope Pius II was born Enea Silvio Piccolomini
near Siena, Italy in 1405, one of 18 children.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.500
His family was part of the Italian aristocracy,
but they had fallen into poverty.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.279
Once the future Pope was old enough, he went
to university and then began work as a teacher,

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.900
before becoming a secretary to Cardinal Domenico
Capranica in 1431.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.800
He was later a follower of the Antipope Felix
V and was excommunicated for siding with a

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.340
man who went against the real Pope’s wishes.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.100
Back then, the future Pope Pius II was part
of a group that is today known as the Renaissance

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.100
humanists.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.710
He also fathered illegitimate children and
wrote erotic literature and obscene poetry.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.840
Shortly after one of his illegitimate children
died, he joined the court of the Emperor Frederick

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.469
III as an imperial poet and private secretary
to the Emperor in 1442.

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.390
Two years later, the future Pope wrote The
Tale of Two Lovers.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.170
Historians believe he might have written other
books and manuscripts with similar subject

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.090
matter, and in addition to the novel, a romantic
comedy has been attributed to him.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.060
Whatever the case, The Tale of Two Lovers
is about a man who falls in love with a married

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.060
woman.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.899
The two exchange letters, and their correspondence
makes up a bulk of the book, making it one

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.009
of the first examples of an epistolary novel.

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.790
As an example of the type of content within
the book, Pius wrote:

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.599
Now Sigismund, though advanced in years, was
quick to passion; he took great pleasure in

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:40.990
the company of women, and loved feminine caresses.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.880
Indeed he liked nothing better than the presence
of great ladies.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.880
So when he saw these, he leaped from his horse,
and they received him with outstretched hands.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.211
Then, turning to his companions, he said:
‘Have you ever seen women like these: For

00:01:54.211 --> 00:01:59.009
my part, I cannot say whether their faces
are human or angelic.

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.770
Surely they are from heaven.’

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.770
In his later years, Pius II looked back on
his past with some regret.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.030
Writing to a friend, he said,

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.160
I know what you will say: why, how strait-laced
Aeneas is; now he writes to me of chastity

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.880
from Vienna, but in Neustadt be spoke otherwise.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.010
I don’t deny it, dearest John, but time
slips away, day by day; we are older, the

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.000
day of our death draws near, and now we must
consider not how to live, but how to die…

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.549
For me, John, I have sinned enough, and too
much.

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.849
Now I know myself, and may it not be too late.

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.054
For now I am forty, and the day of salvation,
the time for repentance is at hand…

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:36.054
Pius II attempted to suppress the Tale of
Two Lovers, not wanting the transgressions

00:02:36.054 --> 00:02:37.054
of his pre-Pope days to catch up with him,
but the book proved to be too popular.

00:02:37.054 --> 00:02:38.054
However, he was a prolific writer, and many
of his other writings eclipsed the Tale of

00:02:38.054 --> 00:02:39.054
Two Lovers, at least in the eyes of the church.

00:02:39.054 --> 00:02:40.054
His Commentaries was published by a distant
relative long after his death, along with

00:02:40.054 --> 00:02:41.054
his autobiography written in the third person.

00:02:41.054 --> 00:02:42.054
In addition, he wrote about historical events
as well as political, religious, and ethical

00:02:42.054 --> 00:02:43.054
issues of his time, which have proven to be
invaluable resources about the time period

00:02:43.054 --> 00:02:44.054
in which he lived.

00:02:44.054 --> 00:02:46.409
If you’re wondering how someone with a background
frowned upon within the Catholic church made

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:52.450
it all the way to its highest office, Pius
II made his way from sinner to Pontificate

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.620
through a remarkably rapid set of promotions.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.040
These were partially the result of the fact
that he was well liked among his peers and

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.790
also genuinely excelled at tasks given to
him, despite his perhaps less than ideal morals

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.790
by the church’s standards.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.359
His rapid rise began after being made a representative
in Frankfurt.

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:18.980
After breaking off his friendship with the
Antipope in 1445, he was absolved of his excommunication.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.329
In 1446, he was ordained as a priest.

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:26.499
He then helped to resolve issues between the
German princes and the Pope, and for his efforts

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:28.600
was made a bishop in 1447.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.200
Thanks partially to a recommendation from
his former employer, Emperor Frederick III,

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.720
a little over a decade after the removal of
his excommunication, he was made a cardinal.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.829
This leads us to his next jump, to Pope.

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:47.719
According to Pius II himself, after the death
of his predecessor, the man who was the favourite

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:53.599
for the position of Pope was a cardinal named
Guillaume d’Estouteville who was of exceptional

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:54.599
character.

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.989
However, Pius II felt that he’d do a better
job than d’Estouteville in the position

00:03:58.989 --> 00:03:59.989
of Pope.

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.889
He also felt that it would be an easy enough
task to improve upon his own personal character

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:08.319
to match d’Estouteville’s, which would
be necessary if he was chosen.

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.450
He set about attempting to convince the other
cardinals of these things and was elected

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.850
unanimously in a second ballot, taking up
the position of Pope in 1458.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.160
While he was Pope, his attention was focused
on developing a crusade against the Turks,

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.750
who had invaded Constantinople.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.880
He even went so far as to implore King Mehmet
II to convert from Islam to Christianity.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.190
This effort ultimately failed.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.280
As morale waned with the crusaders, Pope Pius
II traveled to join them, but ended up falling

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.310
ill and dying shortly thereafter on August,
14, 1464.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.250
Because he spent most of his time as Pope
waging war against the Turks, little of note

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:59.690
was accomplished during 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:32.010
his papacy.
