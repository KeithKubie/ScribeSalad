00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.520
We already know how many glasses wiper sets were made in the first 4 days, which

00:00:04.532 --> 00:00:08.914
is this quantity down here, and we can also see in our given information, how

00:00:08.926 --> 00:00:13.535
much making these glasses wipers cost, which is this quantity over here. Now the

00:00:13.547 --> 00:00:18.075
only quantity of these 3 that we don't already have a number for, from our given

00:00:18.087 --> 00:00:22.185
information, is the cost per wiper set. So this is the thing that we need to

00:00:22.197 --> 00:00:26.400
represent with a variable, since we don't have any other number to replace it

00:00:26.412 --> 00:00:26.870
with yet.
