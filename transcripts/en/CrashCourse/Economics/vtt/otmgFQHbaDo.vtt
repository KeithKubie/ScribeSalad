00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:15.040
Today, we peer into a world where shadowy government stuges

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.160
manipulate the levers of fiscal policy from deep in their evil lairs.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.280
They pick economic winners, and losers.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.900
And control the business cycle, creating recessions and controling inflation

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.400
to serve ... their nefarious purposes.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.380
Nah, Fiscal Policy is a completely legitimate tool
used by non-shadowy government officials

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.380
to correct fluctuations in the economy.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:48.160
[Theme Music]

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:55.160
Okay, in previous videos we've discussed the business cycle and how the economy goes up and down and up and down and up and down overtime.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.320
This line represents the economy's potential GDP,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.340
the maximum sustainable amount that the economy will produce in the long run.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.940
But the business cycle shows that the economy isn't always at its potential.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.900
When actual output is below potential, economists call it a recessionary gap.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.280
Workers are unemployed and factories are sitting unused

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.120
Sometimes, actual output can briefly rise above potential.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.400
Economists call this an inflationary gap.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.740
Unemployment is super low and factories are working over time

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.420
but it's not sustainable.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.540
Eventually producers will bite up the price of scarce resources and higher cost will lead to more inflation rather than more output.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.040
Obviously real life fluctuations aren't as predictable as the business cycle might suggest,

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.580
but every modern industrialized economy sees times of boom and bust.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.620
You know, you get your empire strikes back and you get you're phantom menace.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.340
So look at the real GDP growth rate in the United States since 1920

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.140
see up and down overtime.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.220
In the mid 1980s, things flattened out

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.500
and we had been called the Great Moderation

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.580
it seemed like the days of deep recessions and high inflation were over.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.460
Then came the great recession, as
a result of the 2008 financial crisis.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.500
Back to the same old up and down,
up and down of the business cycle.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.640
Both recessionary and inflationary
gaps cause serious problems.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.040
High unemployment when the economy is bad?

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.720
That's bad, like really bad,

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.020
And not just for the economy -- for people.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.800
High employment rate have been
linked to higher suicide rates

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.300
more domestic violence, and social upheaval.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.760
High inflation can be just as bad.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.560
Rising costs wipe out savings,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.460
and have been the root of protests and riots throughout the world.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.240
Well, this seems like a fun episode.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.280
Stan, what's with all the doom and gloom?

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.760
Isn't there some way to smooth out these fluctuations?

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.180
I'm gonna answer my own question:
there might be.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.560
Many economists argue that policy makers should intervene in the macroeconomy in order to promote full employment or reduce inflation.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.480
Today, we are gonna look at one
of the ways to do this: fiscal policy.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.960
The idea of fiscal policy is really simple,

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.520
when the economy is going too slow, or too fast,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.680
the government can step on the gas or the brake by changing government spending, or taxes.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.560
In the United States, that's the job of
Congress and the President.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.120
When the economy falls into a deep recessionary gap,

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.620
the government can increase government spending, cut taxes, or do some of both,

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.880
that's called expansionary fiscal policy.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.640
The idea that government spending creates jobs and increases income for construction workers and teachers and other labours.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.320
In turn, theses workers spend more of their additional income, increasing consumer spending and boosting the entire economy.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.620
Cutting taxes follows a similar logic.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.380
A tax cut will increase disposable income
for consumers that will increase our

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.260
consumer spending and boost the entire economy.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.600
This is exactly what the U.S. did in 2009
during the depths of the Great Recession.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:43.260
The American recovery and reinvestment act was a stimulus build that added more than 8 hundred billion dollars to the economy.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.680
That stimulus was spilt 60-40 between new government spending and tax cuts

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.580
and the expansionary fiscal policy funded new roads and bridges and upgrades to the electric grid,

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.680
and those projects created jobs.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.920
But when the economy has an inflationary gap

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.760
the government can cut spending, or raise taxes or do some combination of the two.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.700
That's called contractionary fiscal policy,
and that's not half as fun.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.520
The idea is that higher taxes will lead consumer with less money to spend,

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.100
and lower government spending will mean fewer public
jobs, all that should reduce consumer spending

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.260
cooling off the economy and reducing inflation.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.800
We don't see contractionary fiscal policy very often in practice

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.860
because politicians rarely want to hit their
voters with a slower economy, it's a hard sell

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.460
and it could cost policy makers their job.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:33.480
U.S. President George H. W. Bush famously stated "Read my lips, no new taxes." While campaigning in 1988.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:39.220
A few years later, he agreed to raise taxes to reduce the debt and lost the election in 1992.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.060
So the big question here is:
Does fiscal policy actually work?

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:49.160
Does stimulating the economy with spending and tax cuts actually, you know, make the economy grow?

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.540
That is the most heated debate in modern economic, and it's been raging for decades.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:00.160
It's been  known to drive mild-mannered economists to use their loud voices on cable news shows.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.020
Let's learn about it in the Though Bubble.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.980
Classical theories assumed that the economy will fix itself in the long run, and that government intervention

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:13.020
will, at best, lead to unintended consequences and, at worst, cause massive inflation and debt.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.680
These theories dominated policy
decisions during the earliers of the

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.440
Great Depression, which saw little stimulus.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.200
Economists argue that unemployed workers would eventually accept lower wages,

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.000
since some pay is better than no pay,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.020
and resource prices would have eventually fall; since fewer people were using resources.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.700
Lower cost would lead to more production, more jobs and poof, the economy is back on track.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.380
At the time, many policy makers thought about a sick economy,

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.520
the way doctors a thousand years ago thought about a sick patient.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.000
The thinking was that problems resulted from accumulated imbalance,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
which could be cured by aggressive purging.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.160
In the case of doctors, that meant
bleeding their patients.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:58.280
In the case of a recession, that meant standing back and letting the economy bleed jobs and output until balance was restored.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.240
Then entered British economist John Maynard Keynes

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.180
One of the most influential and controversial economist of the 20th century.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.860
Keynes basically invented modern economics, and developed theories and models about spending in production.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.720
He's the one that suggested using expansionary fiscal policy to speed up the economy,

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.020
Keynes argued that government spending can make-up for a decrease in consumer spending.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.800
So even if the economy does self-correct in
the long run, there's no reason to wait it out

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.640
His justification: "In the long run we are all dead."

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:34.460
Well, Keynes died in 1946, but his theories live on,
and so does the debate. Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.860
So at first glance, Keynesian policy seem like the
perfect solution to fix a sluggish economy.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.740
If consumer spending falls, the government
can spend instead. What's the harm in that?

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.260
Well, the government needs to pay for all that spending.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.400
They can't just raise tax to cover because that would cause the decrease in consumer spending and defeat the purpose.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.420
So to stimulate the economy, the
government needs the deficit spend;

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.680
they need to spend more money than
they collect in tax revenue.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.260
Now to achieve this, the government needs
to borrow money, which will result in debt,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.080
and we are going to make a video about the national debt and different schools of economic thought. But for

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.780
now, it's fair enough to say that the people who don't like Keynesian policy, don't like it because it causes debt.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.560
More technical argument against deficit spending is that it leads to something called CROWDING OUT.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.800
If the government borrows a lot of money
that increases interest rates,

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.320
making it harder for business to borrow money and buy things like factories and tools.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.180
This weakens the economy while
increases government debt.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:25.560
But Keynesian economists maintain that crowding out is only a problem if the economy is operating at full

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.500
capacity, where all workers are employed and we're producing as much as we can. In that case,

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.880
since total output can't really rise, more government spending will result in less private spending.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.980
However, they argue that the situation is different when the economy is below capacity

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.520
with lots of unemployed workers and vacant factories.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.900
Now in that case, more government spending can raise overall output by putting idle resources back to work.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.800
In fact, Keynesians will argue that government stimulus when the economy is below capacity

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.440
can actually raise private spending.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.860
All those newly hired workers will start spending more money.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.960
So how can we figure out who's right?

00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:00.540
We can start by comparing the actual performance of economies that receive stimulus to those that didn't.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:05.260
As we mentioned, in 2009, the U.S. government launched a huge stimulus program

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:12.160
in response to the financial crisis. Despite that, employment and GDP both fell. That sounds like a

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:17.740
failure, but the majority of the economists think that the situation would have been far far worse without

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:22.700
that stimulus. And while the U.S. was implementing stimulus, most European countries were doing the

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.900
opposite -- they were pursuing a policy called AUSTERITY,

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.760
raising taxes and cutting government spending to reduce debt.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:34.700
Since 2011, when the U.S. and European policies really started to diverge,

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:39.060
the U.S. economy has grown at an average rate of 2.5 percent,

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.940
while the Euro-zone GDP actually shrank by one percent.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.920
U.S. unemployment fell to 5.5 percent,

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.100
while Euro-zone unemployment rose to 12 percent.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:53.140
Another thing to keep in mind is that stimulus
is complicated and it's hard to do well.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.920
One reason is because of this thing
called the MULTIPLIER EFFECT.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.100
The idea here is that the government spends 100 dollars and the highway construction worker who got the money

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:04.760
will save 50 and then spend 50 in a concert or something. And the musician who got that money will

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.440
save 25 dollars and spend the other 25 and so on.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:15.100
So because of this ripple effect, the initial increase in government spending of $100 might turn out to be $175 worth of actual spending in the economy.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.480
Economists would call this a multiplier of 1.75.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.600
But the question is, what's the real multiplier
of the United States' economy?

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.500
Economists have come up with a wide range of estimates for that multiplier, and it turns out that it

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:30.080
depends on different situations. When the economy's
already booming, the multiplier seems to be close to 1.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.900
If everyone is already working and the government wants to build a road, then they're gonna have to hire workers away from the private sector.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:40.680
Sure public sector output increases, but private sector output falls and GDP is unchanged, it's a wash.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:45.000
But when the economy's in recession with lots of unemployed workers and lot of unused capital,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.760
the multiplier is around 2.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:50.240
Due to that ripple effect, an increase of 100 dollars of government spending,

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.860
would lead to about 200 dollars of total spending,
which put some people back to work.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.640
Moreover, different policies have different multipliers.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.300
Spending on welfare and unemployment seem to give us the biggest bang for our buck,

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.440
since people who have low incomes would likely to spend virtually all of their additional income.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.720
Spending on infrastructure, and aid to state &amp; local governments, also seems to have a fairly high multiplier,

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:13.560
about 1.5. But general cuts to payroll and income taxes seem to have a multipler of about 1: if the government

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.800
cuts $100 in taxes, the economy's going to grow by about $100.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:22.120
More targeted tax cuts and tax credits have lower multipliers, since they tend to benefit those who have higher incomes

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.600
who often save rather than spend additional income.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.300
But what we want is something that will affect the economy rapidly, but also have a high multiplier.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.400
So tax cuts put money in people's hands quickly,

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.940
but that money might get saved rather than spent.

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:37.000
On the other hand, infrastructure projects like making roads and bridges have strong multipliers,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.900
but it may take months or even years to complete.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.920
So fiscal stimulus maybe an important tool,
at least when it comes to a recession,

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:46.240
but it doesn't mean that it's easy to do
or that all stimulus is created equal.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.240
So fiscal policy has its advantages and drawbacks

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:55.580
but in the end, maybe it's all about that thing you didn't have when you were in 6th grade -- Confidence.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:59.500
When people are miserable and unemployed,
they want to feel like help is on the way.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:05.140
Doing nothing doesn't create the kind of confidence that will get consumers and businesses spending again,

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:07.360
and it doesn't get politicians reelected.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.960
So it looks like Keyne's policies are here to stay

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.060
unless...

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:17.340
