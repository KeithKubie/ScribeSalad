00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.210
Are you proud of your first job?

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.280
If the answer is “no” then congratulations!

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.280
You’re normal!

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.200
While most of us have the luxury of being
embarrassed in private, an actor’s resume

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.890
is very public knowledge.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.070
And while some people get their big break
right away, most of us start at the bottom.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.519
Here are 10 Famous Actors With Embarrassing
Early Movie Roles.

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.720
Ben Affleck
Over the years, Hollywood has had a love-hate

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.160
relationship with Ben Affleck.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.370
And to be fair, he’s starred in a few box
office duds.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.530
But if you’ve been so distracted by the
hype, you might not remember one of his earliest

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.070
roles; 1992’s movie version of Buffy the
Vampire Slayer.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.059
Before he was Batfleck, the actor was cast
as “Basketball Player Number Ten”.

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.219
A pretty generic term for a future two time
Oscar-winner.

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.120
Over the course of his career, Affleck has
given audiences plenty to argue about.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.070
And depending on what side of the Batcave
you’re on, he’s either the best or worst

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.960
thing to ever happen to the Batfranchise.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.860
But as far as Buffy is concerned, the actor
has barely left an impression.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.830
Denzel Washington
Denzel Washington is a name synonymous with

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.830
greatness.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.060
Every script the actor touches turns to gold.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.870
He’s played some of the most interesting
characters to ever hit the big screen, and

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.370
has proven himself to be incredibly versatile.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:24.460
Wether playing gangsters, athletes, detectives,
or even Malcolm X - Washington can (and will)

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.460
deliver.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.750
Considering how celebrated the actor is, it’s
easy to forget that success is a process.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.320
And not every role is a home run.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.490
In 1990’s Heart Condition, Washington plays
a ghost working alongside a racist police

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.070
officer (Bob Hoskins) on the hunt for his
murderers.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.280
The thing binding the two characters together?

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.800
A heart transplant.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.800
Aww.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.630
Emma Stone
Over the last decade, Hollywood has seen an

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.400
influx of young, new talent.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.810
And one of the best performers to come from
the new-ish crowd is Emma Stone.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.310
Most audiences became aware of the actress
after seeing the 2007 Seth Rogen/Evan Goldberg

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.540
teenage train wreck Superbad.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.130
As Jonah Hill’s love interest, she steals
every scene she’s in.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.280
But a year earlier, Stone was doing a little
behind-the-scenes work at Disney.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.870
As the voice of a dog named Ivana, the actress
lent her talents to one episode of the show

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.819
The Suite Life of Zack and Cody.

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.260
We know, we know, that’s technically a show
and not a movie, but how could we possibly

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.499
resist telling you that story?

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:25.651
Tom Cruise
It’s hard to imagine what movies would be

00:02:25.651 --> 00:02:27.540
like without Tom Cruise in them.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.079
And if he would have stuck with his original
plan of becoming a priest, we might not have

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.599
met characters like Ethan Hunt, Les Grossman,
or Maverick.

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.870
The actor got his start on the big screen
in Franco Zeffirelli’s 1981 dud Endless

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:40.870
Love.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.249
But wait - isn’t that the name of an epic
song by Lionel Richie?

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:44.459
It sure is!

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.439
That tune was written for the movie, but that
seems to be where all the praise ends.

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:52.459
It’s widely regarded as the worst movie
on Cruise’s resume, and he’d probably

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.430
be happier if we could all just agree to stop
bringing it up.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.650
Emilia Clarke
As Game of Thrones’ Daenerys Targaryen,

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.319
Emilia Clarke has shown he can hold her own
around large beasts.

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.859
But before she became a Khaleesi, the mother
of dragons was actually practicing her skills

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.160
on dinosaurs.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.990
In a 2010 made for T.V. movie called Triassic
Attack, Clarke gets caught up in the middle

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.879
of a classic “haunted dinosaur bones”
situation.

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.780
The movie is exactly as tacky as you’d expect,
but it obviously didn’t hold the actress

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:20.780
back in any way.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.560
Since she’s now one of the most instantly
recognizable characters in entertainment today.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.599
Jon Hamm
Viewers will probably recognize Jon Hamm as

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:31.019
Mad Men’s Don Draper.

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.090
But, just in case you’ve been living under
a rock, he’s also made appearances in Unbreakable

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.870
Kimmy Schmidt, 30 Rock, and Bridesmaids.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.030
But before he put himself in front of the
camera, he actually worked behind it.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.260
At the end of the 90’s, he was working as
a set dresser- the person who organizes props

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.260
in a scene.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.019
The job itself is commonplace on every production,
but the environment where Hamm was doing set-dressing

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.200
is a little more interesting: in the world
of soft-core pornography.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.700
The actor has come a long way since leaving
his off-screen post.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.230
Winning two Golden Globes, and being nominated
for a pile of other awards.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.810
Daniel Craig &amp; Kate Winslet
Kate Winslet and Daniel Craig are two highly

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.090
trained performers who have both been acting
since childhood.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.659
Audiences will recognize Craig as the most
recent embodiment of James Bond, but he’s

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:18.400
actually been working steadily since the early
nineties.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.630
And Winslet blew everyone away for the first
time as Rose in 1997’s Titanic.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.730
Back in 1995, the two actors worked together
on A Kid in King Arthur’s Court.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.890
Bringing in just north of 13.4 million dollars
the movie was considered a failure, especially

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.600
by Disney standards.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.230
Considering the acclaim they’ve both achieved
since, it’s amazing they weren’t successful

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.040
sooner.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.560
Matthew McConaughey &amp; Renée Zellweger
Matthew McConaughey may have a few bad career

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.050
choices under his belt.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.810
But most of the skeptics had their minds blown
off after seeing his work on the first season

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.880
of HBO’s True Detective.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.640
And for a handful of years in the late 90’s
and early 2000’s, Renée Zellweger was everywhere

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.270
- but perhaps captured the most hearts with
her portrayal of Bridget Jones.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.540
Before the two actors were independently famous,
they worked together on one of the worst movies

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.580
ever made, 1994’s Texas Chainsaw Massacre:
The Next Generation.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.621
The movie almost wasn’t released, and both
actors threatened to sue Sony if they were

00:05:14.621 --> 00:05:16.380
featured too heavily in it’s marketing.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:27.290
It’s almost like they knew it would tarnish
their image.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:34.690

do you think of our list?
