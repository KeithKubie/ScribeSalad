we'll be making our own custom gun but
for<00:01:08.130><c> right</c><00:01:08.189><c> now</c><00:01:08.250><c> we're</c><00:01:08.520><c> just</c><00:01:08.640><c> modifying</c>

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 align:start position:0%
for right now we're just modifying

for right now we're just modifying
normal<00:01:09.479><c> firearms</c><00:01:09.900><c> and</c><00:01:10.100><c> basically</c><00:01:11.100><c> the</c><00:01:11.340><c> way</c>

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 align:start position:0%
normal firearms and basically the way
 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.010 align:start position:0%
normal firearms and basically the way
this<00:01:11.520><c> works</c><00:01:11.729><c> is</c><00:01:11.880><c> this</c><00:01:12.060><c> little</c><00:01:12.299><c> thing</c><00:01:12.330><c> inset</c>

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 align:start position:0%
this works is this little thing inset
 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.950 align:start position:0%
this works is this little thing inset
into<00:01:13.110><c> the</c><00:01:13.229><c> grip</c><00:01:13.409><c> here</c><00:01:13.710><c> I've</c><00:01:13.890><c> actually</c><00:01:14.189><c> got</c><00:01:14.580><c> one</c>

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
into the grip here I've actually got one
 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.550 align:start position:0%
into the grip here I've actually got one
is<00:01:16.100><c> a</c><00:01:17.100><c> fingerprint</c><00:01:17.970><c> sensor</c><00:01:18.259><c> so</c><00:01:19.259><c> that's</c><00:01:19.409><c> the</c>

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 align:start position:0%
is a fingerprint sensor so that's the
 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.410 align:start position:0%
is a fingerprint sensor so that's the
same<00:01:19.740><c> thing</c><00:01:19.890><c> that's</c><00:01:20.009><c> right</c><00:01:20.400><c> there</c><00:01:20.580><c> just</c><00:01:20.970><c> here</c>

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
same thing that's right there just here
 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.530 align:start position:0%
same thing that's right there just here
and<00:01:22.409><c> this</c><00:01:23.310><c> fingerprint</c><00:01:23.970><c> sensor</c><00:01:24.210><c> basically</c>

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 align:start position:0%
and this fingerprint sensor basically
 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.870 align:start position:0%
and this fingerprint sensor basically
goes<00:01:24.659><c> under</c><00:01:24.930><c> your</c><00:01:25.020><c> middle</c><00:01:25.229><c> finger</c><00:01:25.530><c> when</c><00:01:25.830><c> you</c>

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 align:start position:0%
goes under your middle finger when you
 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.550 align:start position:0%
goes under your middle finger when you
pick<00:01:26.880><c> up</c><00:01:27.000><c> a</c><00:01:27.090><c> firearm</c><00:01:27.240><c> so</c><00:01:27.689><c> your</c><00:01:28.110><c> hand</c><00:01:28.290><c> sort</c><00:01:28.470><c> of</c>

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
pick up a firearm so your hand sort of
 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.010 align:start position:0%
pick up a firearm so your hand sort of
would<00:01:28.650><c> curl</c><00:01:28.860><c> around</c><00:01:29.040><c> it</c><00:01:29.310><c> like</c><00:01:29.430><c> this</c><00:01:29.610><c> and</c>

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 align:start position:0%
would curl around it like this and
 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.969 align:start position:0%
would curl around it like this and
naturally<00:01:31.020><c> that</c><00:01:31.140><c> middle</c><00:01:31.409><c> finger</c><00:01:31.439><c> would</c><00:01:31.770><c> land</c>

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 align:start position:0%
naturally that middle finger would land
 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.190 align:start position:0%
naturally that middle finger would land
