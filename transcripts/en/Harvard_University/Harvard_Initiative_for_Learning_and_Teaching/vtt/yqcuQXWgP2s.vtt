00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.180
All right.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.971
So now we're going to
romp through a series

00:00:07.971 --> 00:00:08.890
of these projects.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:15.150
And as we do, I'm hoping that
when we look at the team--

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.120
the project teams-- that
members of those project teams

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.200
will stand up and turn around
so that everyone else can

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.710
see them.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.126
So that when we
have the reception

00:00:24.126 --> 00:00:27.630
they know who to
go and talk with.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.574
Oh, this was the
little exhibit to say,

00:00:30.574 --> 00:00:32.490
we're not going to talk
about enrollment view.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.580
Because we've already talked
about enrollment view.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.074
And then when we get to the
physics learning outcomes,

00:00:39.074 --> 00:00:40.740
we're going to have
a little deeper dive

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.720
with that particular project.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.810
But we're going to start
with common competencies

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.025
for a master's redesign.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.920
So Matt Miller, Becca Miller--

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.730
no relation, sitting on
opposite sides of the room

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.340
but working very closely
with their colleagues--

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.340
helped the School of
Education get to a place

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.630
where in May they
voted successfully

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.380
on a curricular reform
for the master's programs

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.680
at the school.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.740
And I think it
took a lot of work

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.880
and a lot of thinking
to get there.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.200
And I want us to just imagine
some of the challenges here.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.830
A masters student who
comes to the school

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.010
could choose one of
13 different tracks.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.720
There are about 700 that
come from master's programs.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.250
And you're just on
campus for one year.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.910
How do how do you think
about a professional school

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.380
and education and imagine
each of those different tracks

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.500
and educating them to have the
competencies to go out and do

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.690
what they need to do in
a bunch of different ways

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.320
and a bunch of different
kinds of professions?

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.240
So at the Ed School people--

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.150
the students, as I
understand it, they come in--

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.830
and it's not like undergraduates
coming into a core program

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.050
and learning what it is
that they want to do.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.310
They're professional students.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.500
They have some ideas about
what they want to do.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.410
But they come from all
different kinds of backgrounds.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.200
And some people want
to be data scientists.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.390
And some people want
to be policymakers.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.950
And some people want
to be educators.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.034
And some people want
to be superintendents.

00:02:25.034 --> 00:02:27.450
And there's different ways
that you might come in and want

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.630
to use a master's program.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.540
So part of the
curriculum redesign

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.300
was a set of
discussions about what

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.560
are the core competencies,
that faculty can agree on,

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.660
should cross all of these.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.010
But how can we now
using technology, using

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.309
what we understand
about pedagogy,

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:51.850
actually think through how to
deliver that in a personalized,

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.970
individualized way
for students who

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.650
come from different
backgrounds and need

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.960
to go into different places?

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.710
So it's a tough set of problems.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.450
And I'm focusing
on it a little bit,

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.220
because I think it's
a set of problems

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.130
that many of our
schools struggle with--

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.320
many of the professional
schools in particular.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.695
You have people
who are coming in

00:03:11.695 --> 00:03:13.630
and all of these
different backgrounds,

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.210
and they need to go out
into these different ways,

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.890
but you have to as
a school say what

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.330
are these core competencies?

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.630
And how might we deliver
education flexibly

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.670
in individualized ways
to be able to get them

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.730
through and learn from the
time while they're on campus,

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.610
which isn't very long?

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.140
So how do we allow
learners flexibility

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.600
as they're attained the same
professional competencies,

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.980
leverage technology and data to
support diverse adult learners,

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.480
prepare professionals for an
evolving career in education?

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.580
And the key constituents here
are master's degree students,

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.000
faculty, staff, and alumni.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.870
And you can see where
they see this process.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.910
Goals by next year.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.480
Launch a first foundational
course, how people learn.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.225
And this is, I think, a
really remarkable experiment--

00:04:09.225 --> 00:04:12.660
the how people learn course.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.740
Which I think is a collaboration
with other people in VPAL,

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:22.530
and is being built right now
as an individualized, flexible

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.160
program.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.990
And it relates to
all of our interests.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.580
And many people here
have an interest

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.030
in what are pre-matriculation
materials that

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.650
could be provided before
people even get on campus?

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.540
So in addition, they're
thinking about, as part

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.680
of a kind of curriculum mapping
project, learner profiles.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:50.082
How individual students can
identify where they want to go,

00:04:50.082 --> 00:04:51.540
what their course
progression looks

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.220
like, and the kinds
of things that they

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.150
may be taking on in competencies
as they go through the program.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.350
How that as a data source might
relate to other data sources

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.120
in the school allowing for
more visibility as you're

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.922
going rapidly through
a set of courses.

00:05:09.922 --> 00:05:11.630
Hopes for curriculum
mapping at Harvard--

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.910
collaborative exploration
and innovation

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:20.030
around personalized competency
based professional education.

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.170
So Nearest Neighbors,
also an Ed School project.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.670
Andrew Ho.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.180
This was Andrew's
brainchild, I believe, partly

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:39.530
as GSE faculty member--
partly as faculty chair

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.690
of the VPAL research committee.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.320
And some of the
questions are, who

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.530
are the students that
are in your class, what

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.240
other classes are they taking?

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.880
And what should I know from
the faculty members who

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.720
are teaching those
classes about what they're

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.590
doing in their classroom that I
can leverage and optimize when

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.000
I'm teaching in my classroom?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.670
How can we make it pretty
easy and quick for people

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.960
to learn from one another?

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.210
If you begin to nurture these
neighborhoods of instructors,

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.500
can we call--

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.640
can we create some coherency,
even more coherency, and maybe

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:22.320
some ways of teaching that make
better use of people's time?

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.730
So at the moment, this is
being used by HGSE faculty,

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:32.000
but next year, your school.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.940
So this, like some of the
other projects that Dustin

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.100
was talking about,
it wouldn't be

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.400
that hard to adapt and to
move into different schools

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.630
and different kinds of programs.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.310
So it's in a phase
of user testing.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.510
Can people read
the print on this?

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:54.170
Yes.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.670
All right.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:58.310
So you can see that the way
this visual works is you've

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.630
got the course in
the center, which

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.230
is read being your course.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.550
And you can see in
the previous semester

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.240
what percentage of your students
were in these other classes.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.130
And what percentage in
the current semester

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:14.540
were in these other classes.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.840
And you can also begin to use
these data to project forward--

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.440
to predict what percentage
might be in other classes.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:27.980
And by June, full integration
of this Nearest Neighbors

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:33.410
visual data set with VPAL
instructor tools, emails

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.770
to instructors answering
who's your nearest neighbor

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:40.430
and what do good neighbors
do for each other?

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.140
That sounds sort
of Mr Rogers like.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.110
Hopes for a curriculum
mapping at Harvard.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.450
Clear focus on the
question, whose question

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:51.260
are we answering?

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.250
Yes, I agree.

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:56.030
And how actionable
is the answer?

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:57.350
OK.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.630
Science advising.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:06.500
Logan-- Logan is director
of science education

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:10.590
and, as you can see there,
has other titles as well.

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:14.540
Is an amazing instructor.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.300
And the questions here are,
which structures and systems

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.610
will nurture and support
undergraduate research?

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:22.580
How do we meaningfully
connect undergraduate research

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.080
to the curricular experience?

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.210
Which skills and
competencies should we

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:30.110
be fostering and assessing from
students research experience?

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:35.000
Science concentration advisors
are a key constituency group--

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.090
undergraduate students
and research mentors.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:41.450
And from what I
understand, as you

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:46.280
began to think about this work
and this project and making

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.080
research experience
for undergraduates

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.600
more visible to
science advisors,

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.350
you maybe worked with Harvard
College institutional research,

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:58.250
got some data, and saw that 90%
of undergraduates in the life

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:01.430
sciences have done some
sort of research experience

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:03.190
during their time at Harvard.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:08.140
And in the largest undergraduate
biology concentrations,

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.931
70% of undergraduate
research is done not at FAS,

00:09:11.931 --> 00:09:14.180
but at the School of Public
Health, the medical school

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:15.259
and affiliated hospitals.

00:09:15.259 --> 00:09:16.800
The kinds of things
that you wouldn't

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.400
know unless you're making
these sorts of data

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.500
accessible and visible.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:26.480
And then into the awareness
of science advisors.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.330
So this, of course,
raises questions, as well,

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.150
about the oversight,
and if we're

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:35.810
capitalizing on
undergraduate research work

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:39.500
that's being already done
in the best possible way.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.610
Goals by June 2019.

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:47.990
A mix of top down and
bottom up data collection

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:51.560
or an undergraduate
research in science.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.540
Making data
accessible and useful

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:57.140
to inform advising about
research and courses.

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.390
And hopes for curriculum
mapping at Harvard-- students

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:03.050
make more informed decisions
about the research,

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:06.574
make more connections research,
and the rest of the curriculum.

00:10:06.574 --> 00:10:08.240
I don't know how we
do that, but I think

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.680
it's incredibly important.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.040
And we hear all the time
how important that is.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.720
How do these
research experiences

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:18.530
integrate with the
rest of the curriculum?

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:23.540
So I'm now going to
step down and let

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.400
us have a little
break from my droning

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.550

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:33.800
about this last in this category
of the curriculum mapping

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.350
projects.
