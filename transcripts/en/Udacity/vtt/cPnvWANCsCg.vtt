00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.765
Alright, so, you asked unfortunately what happens when the,

00:00:05.765 --> 00:00:07.800
the learner is now a part of this. Now

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.800
the learner doesn't have that advantage that the teacher

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.260
had of knowing what the actual answer was and

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.910
therefore being able to show specifically what's irrelevant and

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.550
show what's relevant. So, what could the learner do

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.140
to try to learn about this? So again, remember

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.700
that there are 3 to the k possible hypotheses, and

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.684
if it could use the 20 questions trick, it could do this in log base 2

00:00:29.684 --> 00:00:35.500
of 3 to the k, which is the same as K times log base 2 of 3.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.250
Which is you know, worse than what we had. It's this is, this is larger than

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.245
1. But it's still linear, it's still linear

00:00:42.245 --> 00:00:44.390
in K. So, but can we actually do that?

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.520
&gt;&gt; I'm going to say yes.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.250
&gt;&gt; I don't think we can, so can you help me figure out how that would go?

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.830
&gt;&gt; Oh, I was just going to assert it, then hope you would tell me.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.820
so, how would we do that? Well, we, we, the trick we did before is, we, we

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.390
tried to find a specific question we could

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.710
ask, such that we would eliminate half the hypotheses.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.460
&gt;&gt; Indeed. But it's not clear how you could even ask such a question. Yeah,

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.070
so, so just to do this as a thought exercise, I have a hypothesis in mind.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.640
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.572
&gt;&gt; And you can ask me anything you want, and I will tell you

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:17.230
true or false. But you're going to have a very painful time finding it.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but that's just because I'm human.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.280
Okay, so I need to find a question where,

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.070
of all the hypoth, so I have all the possible 3 to the K hypotheses. I want

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.330
to try to come up with something that's

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.250
going to eliminate a third of them which is

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.680
just going to be hard for me to do because I could write the program to do this.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.150
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure you could. I think, at the moment,

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.430
there's well, because I didn't choose my hypothesis at random. I chose

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.920
a specific hypothesis. Though I guess I could have chosen at random

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.970
from a subset, and you would have still had a hard time finding

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.115
it. But let's, just as an exercise. Throw out, give me a, give

00:01:51.115 --> 00:01:54.050
me a x1 to x5, and I'll tell you what the output is.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.130
&gt;&gt; Okay, 00001. Or actually, you know what? All zeros.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.780
&gt;&gt; Okay, all zeroes, the output is zero.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.030
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's what I should, that's not what

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.900
I should have done. I should have. No, no.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.025
&gt;&gt; That's okay, I won't count that one.

00:02:04.025 --> 00:02:07.570
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Can I just give you like, maybe 3

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.910
to the k of them and you'll not count any of them until I get it right?

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.470
&gt;&gt; Well, that's the problem, right? Well, not 3 to the

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.330
k, but if you, if you, you know, make 2 to

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.070
the k guesses, do, you'll be okay. But you'll also have

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.890
looked at all possible inputs. So that's not really that interesting.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.689
But in particular, the example that I'm thinking of, you're going

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:25.050
to have to guess almost this many just to get a

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.880
positive example. So almost everything that you throw in is giving

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.340
almost no information. Because saying no doesn't really tell you very much.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah that's what I was thinking. Well, what I was

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.990
thinking was I need to find one where the answer is yes.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.320
&gt;&gt; Exactly, and I made it so that it's going to take

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.820
you exponential time just to find one. Once you've found that one,

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.040
then you're, then you're home free but it's going to take you,

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.420
you know, you essentially have to

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.340
enumerate all possibilities before you find one.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.322
&gt;&gt; Okay, 0 0 0 0 1, okay? 0 0 0

00:02:53.322 --> 00:02:57.790
1 0. And you're going to tell me that 0, 0, 0,

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:58.620
&gt;&gt; There's only

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.970
one pattern that gives a one.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.630
&gt;&gt; Right. Exactly. And you're going to, because every single one

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.470
of them is relevant. And I'm going to have to look.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.330
&gt;&gt; Two of them are negated. This is the only pattern

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.972
that gives you a one. Now once you have found that

00:03:11.972 --> 00:03:14.042
and you know that that's the only one, now it's easy.

00:03:14.042 --> 00:03:16.933
You can just read off the equation. So, what's the equation?

00:03:16.933 --> 00:03:19.354
&gt;&gt; XN not two and X3 and X4 and not X5.

00:03:19.354 --> 00:03:21.314
&gt;&gt; And that is the, that's the equation and

00:03:21.314 --> 00:03:23.722
you are not, you're not, there's no as a learner

00:03:23.722 --> 00:03:26.096
you are not going to be able to find that, right?

00:03:26.096 --> 00:03:28.850
Because it's just a needle in a haystack until you hit it.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's, it's going to take me exponential time, but

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.540
it, but remember we're not worried

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.760
about time. We're worried about sample complexity.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.720
So remember the cheat that we have here. The cheat that we

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.070
have here is that I know all the hypotheses and what they say.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.520
&gt;&gt; It doesn't help you.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah it does, because the hypothesis, cause every hypoth, well no,

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.830
that's not true. I'm thinking the wrong thing. I'm sorry. I'm cheating,

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.180
you're right. I'm cheating. I'm, I'm acting as

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.640
if we have the example you had before.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.020
&gt;&gt; So this constrained-ness is really, it's very frustrating, right?

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.190
Because the question that you really want to be able to

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.490
ask, you can't really ask, right? You want to be

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.550
able to ask a question that, that takes the hypothesis class

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.677
and split it in half and. Well maybe you can,

00:04:06.677 --> 00:04:08.846
maybe you can nearly do that. But it's still going to

00:04:08.846 --> 00:04:10.710
be, oh no sorry, that would make it linear. I'm

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.860
sorry, let me say that again. You'd like to be able

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.230
to ask a question that, that splits this

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.110
hypothesis class in half, but unfortunately almost all of

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.200
your questions give very little information. Just knocks

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.580
out a couple of the possible hypotheses, and so

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.510
it ends up being 2 to the k kind of time, not time but samples before you

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.600
can get a handle on what the hypothesis

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.718
is. So, it is harder for the learner too.

00:04:33.718 --> 00:04:36.320
&gt;&gt; Right, so when the learner does it you have no reason

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.772
to believe one hypothesis over the other. You've got all of them.

00:04:38.772 --> 00:04:42.180
And so in order to figure it out, no it kind of

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.412
has to be that way because otherwise it is still linear. So,

00:04:46.412 --> 00:04:49.625
this is bothering me, because if what you said is true, then

00:04:49.625 --> 00:04:53.430
why does 20 questions work? Why do i ever get log, log 2.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.070
&gt;&gt; Right. So we'd like to be able to ask questions. So I, so

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.590
here, let's play this game now. You think of a, a formula. And I'm going to.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.940
&gt;&gt; Oh, wait, you. I know the, the answer is, is that the 20 questions

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.320
is still the optimal thing to do, given

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.820
that you know nothing. So that, that log base

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.500
2 is kind of an expected answer. But sometimes

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.010
you'll do much worse, and sometimes you'll do better.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.870
&gt;&gt; No, in this particular case, if I could ask you more general questions. I

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.750
can do this in, in with the, you know, linear in K. So the questions that

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.395
I'd like to ask you are things like, is X1 in the formula, yes or no?

00:05:24.395 --> 00:05:29.120
[LAUGH] Is X1 positive in the formula? Is X1 negative in the formula? I can just

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.520
fill in these boxes by asking the right questions.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.600
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.056
&gt;&gt; But, but those questions are not

00:05:34.056 --> 00:05:36.300
in our constrained set. And it's the constrained

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.150
set that matters here. And our constrained set

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.930
is, in this particular example just really harsh.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.290
&gt;&gt; So, and there's no way to approximate that, right? So

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.600
I can't say, okay, so the first question I want to ask

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:52.230
is x1 positive, negative, or absent? So, if I looked at all

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.280
the hyp, if I looked at all the hypotheses I could do

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.340
that by asking, now it's very hard to do, because

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.520
there's no direct way to ask that question. The only

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.760
way to ask that question is, I have to try.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.215
Well, I have to try all possible exponential cases to know.

00:06:04.215 --> 00:06:09.310
&gt;&gt; Yeah, 'because we're constrained to only ask queries that

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.560
are data points, right? So give me the label for

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.030
this data point. And that's not really the same as

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.260
is the hypothesis you're thinking of having this particular property.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.570
&gt;&gt; But as soon as I get a one,

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:20.200
I know something.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.760
&gt;&gt; Soon as you get a one, you're in a much happier place.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.300
So, in fact, if we didn't, if we had conjunctions of literals without negations

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.470
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.300
&gt;&gt; We'd be in a much better situation, because then you could, your first

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.708
question can be, you know, one one one one one one. You know the answer

00:06:33.708 --> 00:06:39.580
has to be one, or the formula's empty. So then you're, you're basically off and

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.650
running, but the fact that there can

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.860
be negation in there means that most queries

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.320
really give you useless information.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.140
&gt;&gt; So, so Michael, okay, so you've depressed me.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.310
You've basically said this is really hard to do, to

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.460
learn because I think that we've convinced ourselves, at

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.610
least you've convinced me that until I get a one,

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.590
until I, I, I get a positive result, I

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.150
can't really know anything. And eventually I will get one

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.080
if I can just do an exponential number of samples,

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.150
but then my sample complexity is exponential, and I'm sad.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.656
So what you're basically saying is, I'm sad

00:07:12.656 --> 00:07:15.460
sample complexity makes me a bad person, and there's

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.700
really nothing I can do to learn anything

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.320
or get anything good out of my learning process.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.970
&gt;&gt; That seems like a very sad way of saying it.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:23.920
&gt;&gt; Yes, is there a happy way of saying it?

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.670
&gt;&gt; There isn't a happy way of saying that. But

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.680
there is, there are other questions that have happier answers.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.630
&gt;&gt; Okay, like what?
