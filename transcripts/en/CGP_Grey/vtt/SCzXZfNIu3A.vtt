00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.130
10) The Great Wall of China is the only man-made
object visible from space.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.809
To see something on Earth from space, it would
have to be pretty big, which the great wall

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.150
of China all 5,000 miles of it certainly is.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.570
But, it’s only 30 feet across at its widest.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.489
Here’s a photo taken from the International
Space station, 200 miles above Earth.

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:22.330
Can you spot the great wall amid the mountain
tops?

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.330
Here, right?

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.790
No, that’s a river, the wall is actually
here.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.150
Even if you guessed the right lines buy pure
luck, this photo was taken with a zoom lens,

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.050
so from the window of the space station it
looks more like this – which pretty clearly

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.440
makes the Great Wall count as ‘not visible.’

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.140
As for the man-made part of this misconception
our glorious man-made cities blasting light

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.690
into the void certainly are visible.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.460
9) Cracking your knuckles causes arthritis.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.460
Socially obnoxious?

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.460
Yes.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.600
Gives you arthritis later in life as karmic
punishment?

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.620
No.
8) People Only Use 10% of their Brain

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.560
If you haven’t seen a medical drama in the
past oh, 30 years, you might not be aware

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.480
that doctors now have machines that can see
inside peoples’ brains and, contrary to

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.369
popular, belief 90% of the neurons don’t
sit all day around doing nothing.

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.860
While scientists don’t yet know exactly
what each part does, they do know that all

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.860
the bits matter.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.219
So if you think someone could scoop out 90%
of your brain and you’d still be just fine,

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:15.310
then perhaps you really do only use 10% of
it.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.979
7) Eskimos have Hundreds of words for snow
This one is technically correct, but misleading.

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.999
Some languages, such as German, like to make
compound words by running several smaller

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:26.659
ones together which is why German words are
sometimes absurdly long.

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.159
Inuit languages use compound words as well
so rather than say ‘yellow snow’ as you

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.810
would in English an Inuit speaker combines
the two words into one, but it’s not really

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.909
a new word, just a quirk of grammar.

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.749
So technically Eskimos do have 100s of ways
to describe snow… but then so does every

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:40.749
language.

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:44.360
6) You Need 8 Glasses of Water a Day
While doubtless some people would benefit

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.929
from drinking more water and drinking less
crap there is no scientific evidence that

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.279
8 glasses of water a day is the required amount
and some evidence that it might be too much.

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:54.069
And while we’re talking about water…

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:58.759
5) Tap Water is Bad but Bottled Water is Good
If you live in a paradise free from Government

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.460
regulations like, say, Somalia, then you might
have good reason to prefer bottled water over

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.460
tap.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.390
But modern, functioning countries have something
called health regulations which cover both

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.800
kinds of water.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.930
Also, water is extremely dense making transporting
it from those pristine mountain tops and glaciers

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.390
enormously expensive which is why bottled
water companies don’t bother.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.000
‘Bottled’ water is often just local tap
water with a fancy label and an enormous markup.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.470
4) Gum takes seven years to pass through your
digestive system.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.920
This is pretty easy to disprove yourself but
it’s understandable why most people don’t

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.290
try the experiment.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.800
3) Blood in Your Veins is Blue
The idea here is that the blood in veins is

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.370
blue and it only turns red when exposed to
the oxygen in the air.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.630
Thinking this isn’t unreasonable, after
all your veins look blue and medical diagrams

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.360
show arteries as red and veins as blue, but
it’s the same mistake as thinking that mountain

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.960
dew is green because it’s in a green bottle.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.320
Pour it out and you discover that Mountain
Dew is really piss yellow, which is probably

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.290
the reason it’s in a green bottle to begin
with.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.580
The next time you get blood withdrawn from
a veins take a look.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.580
What color it is?

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.580
Red.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.010
How much oxygen is inside a good syringe?

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.010
None.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.020
Unless you’re a Horseshoe crab or Plavalaguna
you’re blood isn’t blue.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.720
2) Fan Death
This misconception is a specialty of South

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.720
Korea.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.310
Here the belief is that if you spend too much
time with a rotating fan in a confined space,

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.500
it will use up all your oxygen and you’ll
asphyxiate to death.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.950
Exactly how the fan made of lifeless, anaerobic
plastic, competes for your oxygen is unclear,

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.860
but hilariously South Korean fan manufacturers
– who surely must know better – include

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.690
timers on fans to prevent them from running
too long.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.010
1) People Swallow 8 Spiders a Year While Sleeping
Supposedly while you’re in bed, helplessly

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.590
unconscious with your gob wide open, each
year eight spiders find their way into your

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.490
mouth and you reflexively swallow them.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.349
This is plainly ridiculous: spiders love warm,
moist places so eight is far too low an estimate.
