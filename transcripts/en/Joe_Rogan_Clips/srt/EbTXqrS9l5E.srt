1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,250
And I'm I,
I believe that to be the case.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,760
So your platform restricts speech.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,800
Our platform promotes speech unless
people violate our rules and in a specific

4
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:14,490
direction, in any direction. But uncle,
oh, I don't want to say his name.

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,500
The guy who calls for
death gets a suspension.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,490
The guy who insinuates
that gets a permanent ban.

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,230
You're misinterpreting what I'm
saying and I feel like you're doing it

8
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:24,510
deliberately.
It's not about one particular thing.

9
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:27,720
It's about a pattern in practice of
violating our pattern and practice of

10
00:00:27,721 --> 00:00:28,051
banding.

11
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:31,530
Only one faction of [inaudible] recently
published an article where they looked

12
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:36,531
at 22 high profile bandings from 2015 and
found 21 of them were only on one side

13
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:37,440
of the cultural debate,

14
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,590
but I don't look at the political spectrum
of people when I'm looking at their

15
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:43,920
tweets. You have a volume,
you're biased and you are,

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,860
you're targeting specific individuals
because your rules support this

17
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:49,260
perspective. No, I don't agree with that.

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,980
Can you be clear though in like what
rules support that for specifically?

19
00:00:52,981 --> 00:00:56,760
The easiest one is mis-gendering, right,
because that's so clearly ideological.

20
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,610
If you ask a conservative
what is mis-gendering,

21
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,630
they'll say if someone is biologically
male and you call them, you know,

22
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,720
she a biological man and you call
them mushy. That's mis-gender.

23
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,320
And as a conservative view, the, the,
the progressive view is inverted.

24
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,860
So now you actually have in your
policies a rule against the conservative

25
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:16,710
perspective.

26
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,940
I have a rule against the
abuse and harassment of
trans people on our platform.

27
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,190
That's what my role is.

28
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,900
We just give context in the
background as to why the why that is.

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,700
And I brought some,
some research.

30
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:30,210
So we obviously received
a lot of feedback.

31
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,640
So we don't make these roles in a vacuum.
And just to be clear,

32
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,510
we have a bunch of people all around the
world to give us contacts and the types

33
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:41,100
of behavior they're seeing, how that
translates into real world harm. And uh,

34
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,610
they give us feedback and they tell us
like you should consider different types

35
00:01:44,611 --> 00:01:48,300
of rules, different types of perspectives,
different. Like, for example,

36
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:52,020
when we try to enforce hateful conduct
in a are hateful conduct policy and your

37
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:52,854
particular country,

38
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,520
we are not going to know all the slur
words that are used to target people of a

39
00:01:56,521 --> 00:01:59,070
particular race or a particular religion.

40
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,810
So we're going to rely on building out
a team of experts all around the world

41
00:02:03,811 --> 00:02:07,950
who are going to help us enforce our
rules. So in the particular case of, um,

42
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,700
mis-gendering, I'm just trying to pull
up some of the studies that we looked at,

43
00:02:11,701 --> 00:02:12,740
but we looked at,
um,

44
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,700
the American Association of Pediatrics
and looked at the number of transgender

45
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:21,060
youths that were committing suicide.
It's an astronomical,

46
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:23,190
and I'm sorry I can't find it right
now in front of me. It's a really,

47
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:24,000
really high statistic.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,630
That's like 10 times with the normal
suicide rate is of normal teenagers.

49
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,470
And we looked at the causes of what that
was happening and a lot of it was not

50
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:33,210
just violence towards those individuals,

51
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:36,270
but it was bullying behavior and what was,
what,

52
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:39,030
why are those bullying behaviors
that were contributing to that?

53
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,480
And that's why we made this rule because
we thought and we believe that those

54
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:48,720
types of behaviors were happening on
our platform and we wanted to stop it.

55
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,190
Now there are exceptions to this
rule. We don't, and this is all,

56
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,960
this isn't about like public figures
and there's always going to be public

57
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:57,930
figures that you're going to want to
talk about and that's, that's fine.

58
00:02:57,931 --> 00:03:00,070
But this is about are
you doing something with

59
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,760
the intention of abusing and harassing
a trans person on the platform and are

60
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:08,270
they viewing it that way and reporting
it to us so that we take action. So,

61
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,030
so I will just state, I actually agree
with the rule on from my point of view,

62
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:16,960
I agree that bullying and harassing
Trans People's in higher, entirely wrong.

63
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:17,823
I disagree with it,

64
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,840
but I just want to make sure it's
clear to everybody who's listening.

65
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:21,520
My point is simply that,
you know,

66
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:26,260
Ben Shapiro went on a talk show and
absolutely refused and that's his shtick.

67
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:28,930
You know, and he's one of the
biggest podcasts in the world.

68
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,920
So if you have all of his millions upon
millions of followers who are looking at

69
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:33,581
this rule saying,

70
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:37,690
this goes against my view of the world
and it's literally 60 plus million in

71
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:40,850
this country, you do have a rule that's
ideologically bent and, and it's,

72
00:03:40,851 --> 00:03:43,330
it's true. You, you did the
research, you believe this.

73
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,750
Well then you have Ben Shapiro who did
his recent research and doesn't believe

74
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:51,690
it. Yeah. And I relied on
the American Association of
Pediatrics and uh, you know,

75
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,520
human rights council and other,
and I'm sure he has his sources too,

76
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:55,510
for when he gives his statements.

77
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,690
The point is a bundle of iots wonder
if they have that context. I mean,

78
00:03:59,691 --> 00:04:01,870
and that's,
and that's where we have also,

79
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,450
it's just explaining the why
behind a lot of eyeballs.

80
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,680
Soon reasons I would agree.
And I think it's fine.

81
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,750
You did research and you
found this to be true,

82
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,890
but we can't simply say maybe Ben Shapiro
and the other conservatives who feel

83
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:17,950
this way, don't know. We have
two W W we can't, you know,

84
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,260
the point I'm trying to make is
simply whether you believe it,

85
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,140
whether you justified or not is
not the point. The point is you do,

86
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,530
you do have this rule. That rule is at
odds with conservative superior. Well,

87
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:29,680
I think, I think that
you're, you're generalizing,

88
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:33,070
but I think it is really important. As
Jack said to the why behind these things,

89
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,130
the why is to protect people
from abuse and harassment.

90
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,850
I understand what you essentially created
a protected class. If this is the case,

91
00:04:40,851 --> 00:04:44,510
because despite these
studies and what you know,

92
00:04:44,511 --> 00:04:49,511
the studies are showing there's a gigantic
suicide rate amongst trans people,

93
00:04:50,181 --> 00:04:55,010
period. It's a 40% it's,
it's outrageously large. Now,

94
00:04:55,011 --> 00:04:59,660
whether that is because of
gender dysphoria with us
because of the complications

95
00:04:59,661 --> 00:05:04,640
from sexual surgery, sexual transition
surgery, whether it's because of bullying,

96
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:08,450
whether it's because of this awful
feeling of being born in the wrong gender,

97
00:05:08,451 --> 00:05:10,670
whether that all that
is yet to be determined.

98
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:15,440
The fact that they've shown that there's
a large amount of trans people that are

99
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:20,060
committing suicide.
I don't necessarily think that that makes,

100
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:24,530
that makes sense in terms of
people from someone's perspective,

101
00:05:24,531 --> 00:05:28,940
like a Ben Shapiro saying that
if you are biologically female,

102
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,600
if you are born with
a double x chromosome,

103
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:37,080
you will never be x,
y if he says that that's,

104
00:05:37,081 --> 00:05:42,081
that's a violation of your policy and
this is you're creating a protected class,

105
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:47,300
it'd be to be fair,
targeted or, or targeting.

106
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,340
So conduct that opinion.

107
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,650
So what if he said [inaudible]
entitled to express that opinion.

108
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,150
If he's doing in a manner that's
targeted at an individual repeatedly,

109
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,990
repeatedly, repeatedly,
and saying, okay, but what

110
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,090
about the intent? What's going on
with Martina Navratilova right now?

111
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:05,360
Martina Navratilova Rollover. Why? Why
can I say her last name now? But yeah,

112
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:08,060
I don't even have a truck.
I don't think I've ever said it.

113
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:12,470
Martina Novotal to lovo is it
tall over Trello? Trello's anyway,

114
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,040
epic World Class Legend Tennis Player,
right?

115
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,650
Who happens to be a lesbian is,
um,

116
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:23,770
being harassed because she says that
she doesn't believe that trans women,

117
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,820
meaning someone who was biologically male,

118
00:06:25,821 --> 00:06:30,080
who transitions to a female should
be able to compete in sports against

119
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,990
biological females.
This is something that I agree with.

120
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:36,500
This is something I have personally
experienced a tremendous amount of

121
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:40,670
harassment because I stood up when there
was a woman who was a trans woman who

122
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:44,930
was fighting biological females in
mixed martial arts fights and destroying

123
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:46,220
these women.
And I was saying,

124
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:50,780
what did you just watch this and tell
me this doesn't look crazy to you? Um,

125
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,930
well, I go, go, go ahead. Well,

126
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:58,990
my point is you should be able to
express yourself in if you say that you

127
00:07:00,051 --> 00:07:02,240
believe someone is biologically male,

128
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,450
even though they identify as a female,

129
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,440
that's a perspective that should be valid.
I mean that this is someone's,

130
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,700
someone's, this is, first of
all, it's biologically correct.

131
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,350
So we have a problem in that.

132
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:20,590
If your standards and your policies
are not biologically accurate,

133
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:26,420
then you're dealing with an ideological,
I'd, you know, an ideological policy.

134
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:31,580
And just because, I mean, I don't,
I don't want to target trans people.

135
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:35,180
I don't want to harass him. I certainly,
I'll call anybody whatever they want.

136
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:35,601
I mean,

137
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:38,600
if you want to change your name to a
woman's name and identify as a woman,

138
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:42,560
I'm 100% cool with that.
But by saying,

139
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:46,010
I don't think that you should
be able to compete as a woman,

140
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:50,360
this opens me up for harassment
and I never recorded any of it.

141
00:07:50,361 --> 00:07:51,680
I just don't pay attention to it.
But yeah,

142
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,140
in going into like Megan
Murphy for instance, right?

143
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,450
You can call that target harassment if
Megan Murphy who is a, for those that are,

144
00:07:58,451 --> 00:07:58,981
don't,
don't know,

145
00:07:58,981 --> 00:08:03,390
she's a radical feminist who refuses
to use the transgender pronouns.

146
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,500
If she's in an argument with a trans
person over whether or not they should be

147
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:11,970
allowed in sports or in biologically
female spaces and she refuses to use their

148
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:15,480
pronoun because of her ideology,
you'll bend them. Again,

149
00:08:15,481 --> 00:08:18,210
it depends on the context on the platform.
And it's also,

150
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,670
I want not banned permanently
like you get. Yeah,

151
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,670
well she was banned permanently.
But listen,

152
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,570
she was warned you about what happened
because he explained it to me.

153
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,430
What did she actually do?

154
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,120
My understanding,

155
00:08:31,121 --> 00:08:33,880
and I don't have the tweet by tweet
the way that I did for the others,

156
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:37,090
but my understanding is that she
was warned multiple times for um,

157
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,660
mis-gendering an individual that
she was in an argument with.

158
00:08:40,661 --> 00:08:45,070
And this individual is actually bringing
a lawsuit against her in Canada as well.

159
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:48,850
So you have an argument
between two people. Again,

160
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,910
I have a rule that enforces only one side
of the ideology and you've banned only

161
00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:56,100
one of those people. We have a rule
that attempts to address what we

162
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,820
have perceived to be instances
of abuse and harassment

163
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,130
ideology, right? If she's
saying a man is never a woman,

164
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,100
if that's what she's saying.
And then biologically she's correct.

165
00:09:08,101 --> 00:09:11,010
We obviously have a debate here.
This is not a clear cut.

166
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:15,760
This is not something like you could say
water is wet, you know, this is dry. It's,

167
00:09:15,761 --> 00:09:17,610
and this is not like
something you can prove.

168
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,770
This is something where you have to
acknowledge that there's an understanding

169
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,210
that if someone has a trans person,

170
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:29,420
we all agree to consider them a woman and
to think of them as a woman to talk to

171
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:34,320
them and address them with their preferred
name and their preferred pronouns.

172
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:38,190
But biologically this is not accurate.
So we have, we have a divide here.

173
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,910
We have a divide between the conservative
estimation of what's happening and

174
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:45,420
then the definition.
That's the liberal definition of it.

175
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,400
I think that's right Joe.

176
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,590
And I think what I'm trying to say is
that it's not that you can't have those

177
00:09:49,591 --> 00:09:50,424
viewpoints,

178
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,060
it's that if you're taking
those viewpoints and you're
targeting at them at a

179
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:58,050
specific person in a way that reflects
your intent to abuse and harass them,

180
00:09:58,051 --> 00:09:59,880
what if it's in the context
of the conversation?

181
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:02,730
What if she's saying that I don't think
that trans women should be allowed in

182
00:10:02,731 --> 00:10:05,340
these female spaces to
make decisions for women.

183
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,590
And then this person's arguing and she
says, a woman is biologically female.

184
00:10:10,591 --> 00:10:14,370
You are never going to be a woman. She
responded with men aren't women though.

185
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,070
And that was her first
in the series of events.

186
00:10:17,071 --> 00:10:19,010
That's what got her the
suspension and the warning. Um,

187
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,220
that was one of many tweets that part of
providing context and that was actually

188
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:27,290
the second, second actually strike is my
understanding. But why is that a strike?

189
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:31,410
Yeah, why is that a, strike that. But
again, like it's the context of I don't,

190
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,670
I don't have all the trees in front of me.

191
00:10:32,671 --> 00:10:36,690
They were like 10 or 12 tweets going back
and forth and my understanding is that

192
00:10:36,691 --> 00:10:40,350
in that context of all of those,
she was mis-gendering a particular person.

193
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,850
Not that she was holding a was above
her statement, wasn't it? I don't know.

194
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,140
It was. So you don't, you're having,

195
00:10:46,141 --> 00:10:48,750
you're having an individual who was
debating a high profile individual in her

196
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:50,970
community and she's expressing her,

197
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,190
her ideology of versus hers and you have
opted to ban one of those ideologies.

198
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,840
It's within the context of
this conversation. This is,

199
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,460
this is what is being debated.

200
00:10:59,461 --> 00:11:03,420
Whether or not someone is in fact
a woman when they were born a male.

201
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,330
I understand that this is controversial.
I do.

202
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,480
I especially to a radical feminists,
someone who I understand why,

203
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,840
why people would not agree with the rule,
but that being said,

204
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:17,670
it is a rule on our platform and once
you're warned about the rule to repeatedly

205
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,330
post the same content is also going
to be a violation of our rules. Right?

206
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:22,560
But the rule,
it's,

207
00:11:22,561 --> 00:11:27,480
this seems like a good example of
an ideologically based rule. If,

208
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,320
if you're, if she's saying that
a man is never a woman though,

209
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,770
that is not in that context harassment.

210
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:39,900
That is a very specific opinion that
she has that happens to be biologically

211
00:11:39,901 --> 00:11:42,480
accurate. Now, I don't, you know,

212
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:47,340
I don't agree with targeting harassment
on anybody and I targeted harassment on

213
00:11:47,341 --> 00:11:51,570
trans people or, or straight people or
whatever. I don't, I don't agree with it.

214
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,370
I don't think you should do it. It's,
it's not something I want to do.

215
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:59,320
But in this context,
what she saying is not just

216
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,820
her, her expression, but it's accurate.

217
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,590
I think an important point is
if I tweet it to you, Joe, Joe,

218
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,400
you are not a hamster. That's clearly
not a violation of the rules. However,

219
00:12:10,401 --> 00:12:14,650
there are identify as a hamster. Well,
no, it wouldn't be clear cause I know a,

220
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:18,320
I know people who have specifically
begun using insults of animals to avoid

221
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,120
getting kicked off the platform
for breaking the rules.

222
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,810
Certain individuals who have been
suspended now use certain small woodland

223
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:27,230
creatures in place of slurs, so they're
not really insulting you and it's fine,

224
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,750
but there are people who
considers himself trans species.

225
00:12:29,751 --> 00:12:32,360
Now I'm not trying to belittle
the trans community by no means.

226
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:35,990
I'm just trying to point out that you
have a specific rule for one set of people

227
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,990
and they're there. They're so, there are
people who have general body dysphoria.

228
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,070
You don't have rules on that.

229
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,290
There are people who have
actually amputated their own arms.

230
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,020
You don't have rules on that.
You have a very specific rule set.

231
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,720
And in more importantly,

232
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:50,600
in the context of a targeted conversation,

233
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,720
I can say a whole bunch of things that
would never be considered a rural break.

234
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:56,420
But that one is,
which is ideologically driven.

235
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,440
Yeah. Thank you for that
feedback. I mean we're,

236
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:04,730
we're again always learning and I'm
trying to understand different people's

237
00:13:04,731 --> 00:13:06,620
perspectives and I'll,

238
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:11,570
all I'll say is that our intent is not
to police ideology or intent as to police

239
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,150
behaviors that we view as
abuse, movement, harassment.

240
00:13:14,151 --> 00:13:17,690
And I hear your point of view and it's
something that I'll definitely discuss

241
00:13:17,691 --> 00:13:18,260
with my team.

242
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,670
And, and even in this case
it was, it wasn't just um,

243
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:25,090
a going against this particular rule,

244
00:13:25,091 --> 00:13:29,710
but also things that were
more ban evasive as well,

245
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:33,110
including taking a screenshot of
the original tweet, reposting it,

246
00:13:33,111 --> 00:13:36,070
which is against our terms.
It sounds like it's more of the accident.

247
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,020
It sounded like a protest
against your role.

248
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,520
I understand you to band them for it,

249
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,820
but people can protest any
one of our rules. We can't,

250
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,460
we can't like let them do that.

251
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,540
No, no, no. I haven't purchased
any of that. Data is great.

252
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,541
I understand what you're saying,

253
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:49,210
but I just want to make sure I point out
she was clearly doing it as an effort

254
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:52,330
to push back on what she viewed as an
ideologically driven role. Well, this is

255
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,141
problem is,

256
00:13:53,141 --> 00:13:58,141
this is a real debate
in the LGBT community.

257
00:13:58,151 --> 00:14:01,960
This is a debate where there is a division
and there's a division between people

258
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:06,961
that think that Trans Women are invading
biological female spaces and making

259
00:14:07,301 --> 00:14:11,590
decisions that don't benefit these
biological females, cisgender,

260
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,680
whatever you want to call them. This
is an actual debate and it's a debate,

261
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:18,430
a debate amongst progressive people
amongst left wing people. I mean,

262
00:14:18,431 --> 00:14:21,100
it's a debate amongst
liberals. This is, I mean,

263
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:26,280
I would imagine the vast
majority of people in the
LBGT community are in fact on

264
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:30,190
the left.
And this is one example of that.

265
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:35,310
So you have a protected class that's
having an argument with a woman who feels

266
00:14:35,771 --> 00:14:40,600
like there's an ideological bent
to this conversation that is not,

267
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,610
not only not accurate,
but not fair.

268
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:46,470
And she feels like it's not fair for
biological women. The same as Martina.

269
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:49,520
Well, I'll, I'll, uh, take
this to its logical conclusion.

270
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:53,420
I got sent a screenshot from somebody and
maybe it's faked. I think it was real.

271
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,620
They were having an argument with someone
on Twitter and responded with, Dude,

272
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,180
comma, you don't know, blah, blah blah,

273
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,660
and they got a suspension and a lockout
have delete the tweet because the

274
00:15:02,661 --> 00:15:06,890
individual using a cartoon Avatar with
the eight with with the name apparently

275
00:15:06,891 --> 00:15:10,400
with Sam reported it and said that I'm
transgender and he's calling me dude and

276
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:12,590
the dude and the Twitter user
actually got a suspension for it.

277
00:15:12,591 --> 00:15:16,040
So I can understand mistakes happen.
But when you have a rule that's like that,

278
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,940
there's colloquial terms that are
like, man, come on. Don't say that

279
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,830
dude is like, we say like, oh,

280
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:24,250
like I asked you guys when you were going
to take a photo in front of this thing.

281
00:15:24,251 --> 00:15:29,250
I said, guys, but I included, you
know, thank you for not being offended.

282
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:33,910
You for it. Thank you.
Yeah, it's, it's tricky.

283
00:15:33,911 --> 00:15:37,960
But in this case of Megan Murphy, that's
her name, right? Yeah. Yeah, I did.

284
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,250
That doesn't make any sense to me.

285
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:43,360
That seems like she should be allowed to
express herself in this is this is not

286
00:15:43,361 --> 00:15:47,470
being, she's not being mean, but
I saying a man is never a woman.

287
00:15:47,471 --> 00:15:52,471
This is a perspective that that is
scientifically accurate and that's,

288
00:15:52,721 --> 00:15:53,830
that's part of the problem.

289
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,400
I th I, I, I just don't want it to
run into a beating a dead horse.

290
00:15:56,401 --> 00:15:57,350
So I think I want to,

291
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:01,910
let's say it's a really important thing
to go over all the nuances of this

292
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:06,410
particular subject because I think that
one in particular highlights this idea

293
00:16:06,411 --> 00:16:10,580
of where the problems lie
and having a protected class.

294
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:14,660
And I think that we should
be compassionate. We have
a lot of protected classes,

295
00:16:14,661 --> 00:16:19,310
gender, race, nationality, like these are
the protected class, not for white people.

296
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,890
When you say gender or race,
it's not all protected categories.

297
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:28,280
So you can't attack someone for their
belonging to a particular race or a

298
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:33,110
particular religion. But
you can mock white people ad
nauseum. It's not a problem.

299
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:36,020
It doesn't get, it doesn't get
removed. I'm not talking about mocking,

300
00:16:36,021 --> 00:16:38,180
I'm talking about abusing
and harassing some,

301
00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:42,350
but I mean if you mock a black person
in the same way it would be considered

302
00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:45,470
targeted racism. Um, again,

303
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:48,710
it's about targeted harassment
on the platform, but well,

304
00:16:48,711 --> 00:16:52,910
I mean can do what is targeted harassment.
I mean, but when you're okay, look,

305
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:57,510
if you have,
what is racism is racism own image.

306
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:02,150
There's this progressive perspective of
racism that it's only possible if you're

307
00:17:02,151 --> 00:17:05,630
from a more powerful class only
punching down. That's the only racism.

308
00:17:05,631 --> 00:17:07,010
I don't think that makes any sense.

309
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,000
I think racism is looking at
someone that is from whatever,

310
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:16,270
whatever race and deciding that they
are in fact less or less worthy or less

311
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,410
valuable,

312
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:23,470
whatever it is that that takes place
across the platform against white people.

313
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,760
Now I'm not saying white
people need to be protected.

314
00:17:25,761 --> 00:17:28,520
I know it's easier being a white
person in America. It's a fact,

315
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:33,970
but it's hypocritical to have a
policy that only distinguishes,

316
00:17:34,131 --> 00:17:36,590
you can make fun of white
people all day long.

317
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,530
But if you decide to make fun
of Asian folks or you know,

318
00:17:39,531 --> 00:17:42,080
fill in the blank that is racist,

319
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,390
but making fun of white people
isn't and it doesn't get removed.

320
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,660
There are tons of people like about
Sarah John from the New York Times.

321
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,010
That's a of, well I can
explain that one. Please

322
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,390
do.
There's that was uh,

323
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,420
my understanding is that you guys started
banning people officially under these

324
00:17:54,421 --> 00:17:57,930
policies around 2015 and those,
all the tweets you made was prior to that.

325
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,100
And so you didn't enforce the old

326
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,620
sorry, hateful conduct policy. Joe, just
to be clear is, is across the board,

327
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,070
meaning like it doesn't just protect
women and protects men and women and

328
00:18:07,071 --> 00:18:09,230
protects all races.
It doesn't matter.

329
00:18:09,231 --> 00:18:11,360
And this is how the law is set
up in the United States, right?

330
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,010
You can't discriminate against white men.

331
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,450
You can't discriminate against black
men. Like those are the laws, right?

332
00:18:17,451 --> 00:18:20,940
Like that's the structure. It
is. That doesn't, it doesn't
take into consideration.

333
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:25,880
Power one says something about white
people in mocks, white people on Twitter.

334
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:30,110
What do you do about that? If it's
targeted harassment targeted at a person.

335
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,790
So just white people in general.

336
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,850
If you say something about why people in
general that's on an issue that, well,

337
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,680
I mean we focus on targeted harassment,

338
00:18:36,681 --> 00:18:39,530
which is behavior that is targeted
against an individual who belongs to that

339
00:18:39,531 --> 00:18:40,364
class.
Okay.

340
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:43,790
Because if you try to police every
opinion that people have about different

341
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:47,000
races or religions, like obviously
that's a very different story.

342
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:51,350
So this is about if you target that to
somebody who belongs to that class and

343
00:18:51,351 --> 00:18:54,920
that's reported to us, that is a violation
of our rules. And so in this era,

344
00:18:54,921 --> 00:18:59,150
Jiang case, a lot, we
did see many tweets, uh,

345
00:18:59,151 --> 00:19:01,870
of that nature that we're focused on.
Uh,

346
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:06,940
people who are white or men and our rules
are in this area came into effect in

347
00:19:06,981 --> 00:19:09,320
2015 which was our hateful conduct policy.

348
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:14,240
And a lot of those tweets were from a
time period where those rules weren't an,

349
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,203
in her defense.

350
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,100
She was actually supposedly
responding to people that have,

351
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:22,650
you don't believe that I'll come on over
three years and she's tweeting blanket

352
00:19:22,651 --> 00:19:26,410
statements about white. Yeah, sure,
sure. But so, so I will say too,

353
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:29,550
obviously I've done it.
I at one point,

354
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,680
so in that case,

355
00:19:30,681 --> 00:19:33,590
there were tweets from before the rules
went into effect in tweets from after

356
00:19:33,591 --> 00:19:34,490
the rules went into effect.

357
00:19:34,491 --> 00:19:37,640
And we did take action on the tweets
from after the rules went into.

358
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:42,460
She's also pretty young, so I want
to point, uh, yeah, she's in her 20s.

359
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,910
Yeah. So we're talking about something
that might've happened eight years ago,

360
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:50,770
right? Right. It's a 20. It was like 2011
to 13. But I do want to point this out.

361
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,610
Um, before coming on, I've
obviously did at time,

362
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:56,560
I did a decent amount of research.
I searched for slurs against white people,

363
00:19:56,561 --> 00:20:00,310
black people, Latinos, and I found
copious, just, just tons and tons of them.

364
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,700
Now they don't go back.
Most of what I found in go back too far,

365
00:20:03,701 --> 00:20:05,600
because it does seem like
you guys are doing your best,

366
00:20:05,601 --> 00:20:08,980
but there is a lot and it targets white
people, black people, Jewish people.

367
00:20:08,981 --> 00:20:09,580
It's everybody,
right.
