00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.720
KR: Well, the usual way that people, um, discuss
it is to talk about perfect squares first.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.599
So, if you have studied the Pythagorean
Theorem

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.690
there's a formula that the square of the hypotenuse is the sum of the two squares of the

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.580
sides of a right triangle. So you might
ask if the, err,

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.720
the sides of a right triangle are whole
numbers

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.000
might it happen that the hypotenuse

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.269
is also a whole number. 
They're called Pythagorean triples and the Greeks

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.120
figured out all of the Pythagorean Triples. Okay,
so what happened next is

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.920
I think it must have been very natural
to look at the equation

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.790
A cubed plus B cubed equals C cubed and

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.469
A to the fourth plus B fourth equals C to the fourth.

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.079
And so on. So, this is now in the realm of
algebra

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.890
and you can plug in values for 'A' and 'B'
you'll see that, err,

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.640
these equations, infinite number of
equations, seem

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.920
not to have solutions. Well, so the
story is that

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.900
Fermat was reading the text of Diophantus,

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.100
who was the Greek mathematician best known
for this type of problem.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.600
And in the margin of his copy

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.310
of Diophantus, he wrote some marginal note
saying

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.280
that I can prove it for higher exponents
bigger than two there are no positive

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.380
integer solutions

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.400
and then famously he said but my solution

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.700
is too long to write in this margin.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.030
And in his copy of Diophantus which
was

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.720
inherited by Fermat's son Samuel de Fermat

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.920
there are many, many marginal notes and
Samuel published a revised version,

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.130
annotated version of Diophatus's

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.950
Book in which all his father's writings
are

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.940
reproduced. And the reason that Fermat's
Last Theorem was called Fermat's Last

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.240
Theorem, is that all the previously on examined
marginal notes

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.770
proved to be correct for they were, ermm

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.799
prove to be correct or incorrect mostly
correct by

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.530
mathematicians after the
seventeenth-century and there was this

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.750
only one assertion that remained it was the last
one was hit list.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.879
And you know again, I'm not an expert in

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.950
the history of mathematics but I think most
people

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.430
are convinced that when Fermat was
a mature mathematician he realized he

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.660
did have no proof

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.370
of this thing that he wrote in the marginal
note and in fact

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.900
later in his life he devoted a lot of
attention

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.310
to special cases of that type of equation.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.960
It's not just the cubes but it's the cubes
the fourth powers and the fifth powers

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:40.580
and so on.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.900
And Fermat himself later in his life

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.380
took care the fourth powers.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.680
Well, the cubes
certainly must've

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.260
bothered him because after all he knew
about squares and he knew about fourth

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.510
powers and cubes,

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.560
you know, right in the middle.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.840
BH: The theory is that
there is no solution.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.980
There's no whole number solution.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.100
KR: That's right.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.260
BH: Would it have been or wouldn't it have been more exciting or more

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.099
attractive to a mathematician

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.480
to prove him wrong and to find these three
numbers that you could plug in that would

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.340
do it? Would that have been more triumphant?

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.040
KR: Well, it would have been-

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.120
would have been very exciting and would
have made lots of news.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.400
And then the proof, so to speak, would
have been simply

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.620
on a single counter-example that would
have fit,

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:27.040
you know, very neatly in a newspaper
column, you known, there would have been

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.239
some story, you know.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.120
'Mathematician in Australia finds the
first counter-example to Fermat's Last

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.540
Theorem'.  Certainly was big news either
way.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.500
Ermm, the main thing about Fermat's Last
Theorem is that over the centuries it

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.700
gave rise to a tremendous amount

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.700
of new, and fruitful mathematics. That people
really develop new techniques to try to

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.220
solve that equation

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.390
that proved to be, you know,

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.000
infinitely versatile. BH: So a bit like going to
the moon and let[ting] them develop other

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.600
lots of other technologies along the way. This was for

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.900
going to the moon. KR: That's a-that's a fine
analogy. I mean,

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.380
you, when you formulate a problem in
mathematics no one knows

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.680
whether this problem will really be
helpful for mathematics as a general enterprise.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.350
And, you know, for whatever reason Fermat's equation

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.940
has led to tremendous amount of- of new mathematics

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.330
KR: So, when I was a graduate student. We're
talking, you know, roughly forty years ago or

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.819
forty-five years ago. Fermat's Last Theorem
was kinda

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:32.599
some curiosity. Everybody knew about
the problem but no one really had any

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:35.629
approach to it and there was no

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:40.200
kinda fundamental reason why the problem
was going to have a positive solution.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.000
And when I was a student there was a
tremendous interest in what are called

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.050
elliptic curves and it was realized

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.960
around nineteen sixty-eight, nineteen sixty-nine, nineteen seventy

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.560
by André Weil and Goro Shimura in
Princeton

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.220
who built on work of Yutaka Taniyama who was his

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.560
buddy in Tokyo in the nineteen-fifties.
Taniyama

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.820
had passed away and there was this
gradual understanding that elliptic

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.460
curves really were related

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.669
modular forms and again that was some
completely

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.140
are apparently inaccessible outstanding
conjecture

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.300
analysts thought to be incredibly hard
conjecture. And then

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.160
in the early nineteen-eighties a
mathematician came around, and I say that

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.780
literally because you know he was
sitting here in this office

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.460
his name is Gerhard Frey. At the time he
was at the University

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.480
of Saarland in Saarbrücken on

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.640
and he came-  BH: Is that a famous one? I don't know that one.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.140
KR: Well, um, I didn't know it either and came around
and he had

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.500
the scheme for relating Fermat's Last Theorem

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.520
and the modularity conjecture. Somehow he

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.280
realized for the first time that,

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.080
um, if- if he had a solution to Fermat's equation

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.380
this would give him an elliptic curve
which apparently

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.930
could never be modular. I was a little
skeptical

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.230
because I knew that some of the things
that he said

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:12.080
that he needed in his argument, um, were
very hard.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.360
Well, for me a really important thing was

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.100
in nineteen eighty-five Jean-Pierre Serre, who was

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:24.540
one of my mathematical heroes in Paris
sat down and kind of tried to

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.640
distill everything that had been said
about the Prey's idea

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.720
and he came out with a very clear

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.810
letter and this letter basically said if
you can prove this tiny little result

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.900
which he called epsilon because the number

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:43.540
in calculus, epsilon is a small number. He
said if you can prove this tiny little epsilon

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.940
then you can really show that on the
modularity conjecture, which he called

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.080
Weil at the time,

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.220
implies Fermat's Last Theorem. So, epsilon

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.340
became, for me, a holy grail because

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.000
not only was it something fairly well
encapsulated and very

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.650
clear, and this was the kind of thing that
I'd thought about before

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:08.310
without success but nonetheless while
thinking about yet another

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:13.090
problem, it occurred to me that I really
had some new information that I could

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.500
possibly bring to bear on this epsilon.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.920
When I first did was say to myself: "What's
the simplest possible case where I can

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.660
think about this? What's the simplest
possible prediction?"

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.450
I tried to settle that. I said "Well, you
know, if you have to start somewhere.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:30.900
can I-" Well, I know about this simplest
case

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.220
so I have this thing in my mind and I
thought about it,

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.310
off and on, during the academic year-

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:38.960
nineteen eighty-five and eighty-six.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.460
And during this year I was teaching calculus and I was busy with things, there are,

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.720
you know, colleagues come in and they want you to be
on committees. And finally, um,

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:53.990
my final grades were submitted in May nineteen eighty-six and I started thinking about this

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:57.250
problem again, first when I was on the east
coast for a while,

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:02.730
going to Europe on and I found myself
in Paris. And finally I found myself

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:06.410
at an empty desk and on the Max Planck
Institute in Bonn

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.870
where I can just sit and think and I
thought about this

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:14.140
yet again - BH: Is that what you do? Do you just sit at a desk with your head and your hands, and

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.930
think, think, think, I mean - what if I was a fly on the
wall

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:21.620
when you were trying to crack this problem. What would I have seen? What was it looked like?

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:25.170
Well, it's probably not have probably had
a pad of paper in front of me and a

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:25.980
pencil

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:31.320
or a pen we didn't really have computers
quite yet although they were starting to come,

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.780
and when you visit some institute you
don't have all your stuff with you don't

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.740
have lots of books you don't have all your
paraphernalia. So I was really just kind

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:39.550
of sitting there

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:42.550
like that, and I started writing, you know.
And I-

00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:46.800
If you look in my office you'll find
lots of old pads where I sit and write,

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.070
and, you know, a page might start what do we
know what are we trying to do

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:53.550
summarize the situation so far. "Let's-
 let's try this",

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:56.600
and to my astonishment,

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:01.760
I was finally able to-

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.860
to cracked that problem - the simplest case of that epsilon.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:10.860
BH: It's like inspiration
comes at preordained times.
Like you sit down and say, okay

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.160
for the next two hours before I make my friend Bob a hot dog,

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.040
I'm gonna have an inspiration and trying to solve the problem, and that's when it happens. It doesn't

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:23.040
happen on time, so you're lying on bed- 
Oh it can, I mean, if you
if you think about something very

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.170
intensively then you can just carry
around with you

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:30.030
and you know lots of my colleagues say
that while they're swimming

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:33.810
had some insight or you know lots of
people say in the middle of the night

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.260
they jumped up and they said my god you
know why don't I try a minus sign instead of

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.060
instead of a plus sign

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:41.680
and this- this can indeed happen,
you know.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.470
BH: Not for you though. You are an at-the-desk kind of guy?

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:46.649
I-I think in this particular situation I
was at the desk

00:09:46.649 --> 00:09:49.750
I knew for the first time that

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:52.940
I could do something that I hadn't done before

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.839
that no one had done before. This is a
special case is this so-called

00:09:56.839 --> 00:10:02.050
epsilon, And I kinda wrote and rewrote it just to make sure I was really right.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:06.820
And finally, using a very first
Macintosh that I had access to

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:10.040
I typed out a letter to Barry Mazur at Harvard,

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.620
and I sent him this letter explaining what I had done.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:16.550
And then I spent weeks and weeks trying to do

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:21.210
the general case. I couldn't see what to do and then fortunately,

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:24.850
there was an international congress of
mathematicians.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:28.180
They occur once every four years on the campus

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:31.750
of UC Berkeley. So I was right here.
I came back in August

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:35.459
for this International Congress and Barry Mazur was there.

00:10:35.459 --> 00:10:38.470
And on I spoke to him,

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:43.329
and I said Barry I sent you this letter
explaining how I did a special case, and

00:10:43.329 --> 00:10:46.829
I really wonder, you know, what I
have to do now in the general case.

00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:50.550
And he looked at me completely quizzically.
He said: "Well, you've already done the

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:51.399
general case."

00:10:51.399 --> 00:10:54.459
and basically, he-

00:10:54.459 --> 00:10:58.510
when he read my letter to seemed obvious to him that there was this extra little thing

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:03.399
you carry alone as a supplemental
object. And this extra thing which is

00:11:03.399 --> 00:11:06.520
do the bookkeeping. And,

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:10.790
so we sat down at this Caffe Strada
which is at the corner of the

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:13.910
Berkeley campus, and we had a Cappuccino and he

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:16.700
kinda said well you just carry this and run with you

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.420
and I was astonished you know it's like this

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:23.510
amazing moment were all the sudden I realized

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:28.000
that in principle at least there was
no obstacle to proving this

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.270
epsilon conjecture. I mean, it like, you
know, my god, you know, it's some

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:36.240
special thing, you know, an angel comes down
 and the light shines from the heavens

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:40.120
or something. So this was really quite a thing

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.360
and on since or my colleagues

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:48.130
were walking around the campus in this
big international congress I

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:51.130
kind of told, you know, a number of them
that

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:56.630
I have done this thing. You know of course
in beginning I was cautious I said well

00:11:56.630 --> 00:12:01.300
I think I've done this thing, and- but
people kept

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:05.170
running up to me. They said was it really
true you've done epsilon? I

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:08.300
lived in a world and think I still do
were

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:12.500
my colleagues are very generous with
attributions and praise and there isn't

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.730
too much of this kinda race to be the
first to publish and

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:20.560
people basically- I had little fear that
someone would try to scoop me

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.770
on the other hand what was a little
worrisome

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:28.850
was that I hadn't written down all the
details, you know, so I kinda written down

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:32.160
very closely the special case. But

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:36.060
I hadn't kind of worried about writing
thing more generally

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:39.760
so what happened was that during the
year

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.770
following that, nineteen 86-87

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:47.830
there was a special program on algebraic
geometry and arithmetic geometry

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:50.930
at the Mathematical Sciences Research
Institute in Berkeley,

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:54.520
the MSRI. So I was up there with my callings
and

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:58.580
I gave lectures every week I gave
another lecture I was kinda giving like

00:12:58.580 --> 00:12:59.560
a min course on

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.120
my proof and

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:05.540
when I wasn't lecturing I was furiously
typing

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:09.880
into the computer to try to expand and
revise

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:14.440
my manuscript in kinda more and more
details got put in.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:18.660
There were certainly people in the
audience who were appropriately

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:22.040
skeptical. They asked me hard questions and I
didn't always know the answer to our

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.120
questions you know

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.210
like "How do we really know that this
thing is in

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:30.770
such-and-such way", and I would say well
you know this was proved in the

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:32.080
1960s by Grothendieck but it

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.450
isn't quite written down in the place you
expect

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:40.250
then I have find the argument. Well epsilon is small. It was clearly a misnomer.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:43.410
And let me just get up and pull off a

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:47.940
reprint. Here's my article. It was published
in 1990

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.240
which really makes

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:55.180
are a lot of time between 1986 and 1990.

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:59.730
BH: How many pages?  It's like a book. Well it's a

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:03.880
more than a pamphlet. If you
open up this paper

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:08.250
on the very first or second page there's

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:11.600
Fermat's equation and an elliptic curve

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.610
but then they disappear. If you look at
the actual

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:20.120
article it's more about the
technicalities of the subject. It was a

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.940
big deal in mathematics. It got

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:25.790
write ups in the press,
including Science magazine

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:26.720
if I'm not mistaken.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.959
You know, whenever there's a serious
announcement,

00:14:29.959 --> 00:14:33.200
of a major theorem that gets a lot of
attention. And

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.300
people stop what they're doing to try to
see

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.455
what the basis of proof is.

00:14:38.455 --> 00:14:40.610
BH: who called this Ribet Theorem?

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:44.000
you know obviously it to make that name
that is above all

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.050
other whenever addition both well the

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:51.770
yeah that's right so you certainly there
there's a general

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:56.310
aversion to naming things after yourself
very often people

00:14:56.310 --> 00:15:00.779
give lectures and I'll say such-and-such
the room and princes the right name the

00:15:00.779 --> 00:15:01.380
person

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:05.520
who on proves it and if it's a fair
amount they prove themselves

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.920
in typically right there the first
initial their last name

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.930
or something like that for all say they
don't on

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:16.060
they have no attribution listeners
understand all this is the fear that the

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:16.800
persons

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:20.100
is providing in this lecture. - You've done
this thing

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:24.380
which is important if you have a bridge
between two things which

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:28.400
no other which also Granja. - Well that's
right so the

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.010
um what what I when I showed was that
this modularity

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:36.200
conjecture which was thought to be was
was felt to be true

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:40.000
but um wasn't expected to be provable

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.839
I show that that thing actually implies
there was less there

00:15:43.839 --> 00:15:47.150
I think the main takeaway from my
theorem was

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:50.180
that since the very conjecture

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:54.940
short on the OMA was likely to be true
that now you should think that for miles

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.430
last year it was likely to be true

00:15:56.430 --> 00:16:00.360
for example it probably wouldn't have
been a really

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:04.240
good idea to spend a lot of computing
power looking for a counterexample

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:07.980
farrell's less there well as anyone else
who's in the room

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:11.029
well I was the whole thing so any Wells
you know coursing

00:16:11.029 --> 00:16:15.080
came around a few times I guess but
basically he was holed up in his attic

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:18.790
and I didn't know that and I think most
people didn't know that

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:22.540
so he was on I mean it's his I'm

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:27.100
it's a statement that he was 
certainly intrigued by Fermat's last theorem

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:31.430
as a child and then as soon as he heard
about this

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:35.620
Ridge he decided to try to prove the
modularity theorem

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.720
because of its relation to the Fermat's last theorem.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.970
so was it is a sort of the situation that Andrew Wiles

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:46.080
wanted to prove Fermat's last theorem by any means possible he given him the means

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.850
that's what he says I mean if this is
surprising to me because

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:53.250
modularity theorem by itself is a
tremendous price

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:56.980
and you know it seems kind of strange
that you needed

00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:00.520
the motivation to Fermats to go and
try to prove it if you thought that

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.400
there was some way

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:05.200
side well anyway that's that's that's
that's what he says

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:09.650
yet we were all together meaning kinda
lots of people in the subject in a

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:11.420
conference in Cambridge England

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:17.080
in June 1993 and usually go to a
conference and you see the list speakers

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.080
and you know you speaker has an hour

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:23.100
and the thing and then set up so that
Andrew Wiles had three hours

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:27.020
I'm so here's the organizers he said I
have something I want to discuss it will

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.110
take me three hours and I like those
slots

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:32.330
I said okay from and then

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:35.850
in the first lecture you could see he
was proving

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:41.200
He was trying to prove the modularity
of some class elliptic curves but

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:44.370
the class elliptic curves at least in
the first lecture had

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:48.130
no intersection with the class that you
needed for Fermat's last theorem

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.620
within the second lecture got a lot
closer and

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:55.390
it became more and more parents have
people at the conference

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:58.570
third lecture he was going to be able to
do enough

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:03.020
to get fair was last year the crowd was
growing so love the mathematicians

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.020
you know brought their colleagues who
happen to be in Cambridge in

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:09.100
you know some other family members and

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:14.040
I think there was a little doubt that he
would announce approval for was left

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:14.930
there I'm so I

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:19.540
can i sat in the front row center and
brought my camera and snap the picture of him

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:23.010
I wasn't another moment when you know
those cuts time stop

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:26.960
and when I first realized what was going
to happen ..

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.740
and then you know when it actually did
happen there was this some

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:33.770
frends of activity I mean the director

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:37.390
love of the Isaac Newton Institute

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:40.950
where these lectures were held on

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:45.000
had ordered a case a Napa Valley brute
champagne

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.390
for the end the lecture is after the
lecture we came out into the

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:52.870
you know common area only is all the
champagne flutes were

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:56.180
produced in his bottle started popping

00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:00.740
you know this is kinda really an amazing
thing between that time when you-

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:05.400
originally published a paper and this
lecture it was a cold or write you a

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.320
nasty lol nah to work

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.660
not a word you know it i no idea what he
was doing

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:15.070
on you he whole who absolutely

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:18.360
he was so he was a a friend and a
colleague I first met him when he was a

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.000
graduate student in Cambridge

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.620
and in fact when I first came to
berkeley the first year that I was here

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:28.080
he was one of the first people that I
invited came to spend a week and gave a

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:28.950
lecture to

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:34.430
on do you that delight he kept a secret
that make a surprise I

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:38.320
to this day you battle by I'm using a
little collegiate

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.570
you're telling me when you thought you
open your running around telling

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:41.400
everyone

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.980
NEC said well it's very unusual behavior

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:49.410
and the you know you can say in
retrospect that it was really

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:53.890
um justified because he was afraid that
people would kind of jump all over it

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:55.490
because %uh the important so

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:59.250
the modularity conjecture and fair I was
last there

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:02.500
on button he did not on

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.630
tell me what he was doing he did from

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:09.740
confide in to this calling to princeton
as he was giving

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:13.200
is graduate course where he was working
out the ideas

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.860
that on were instrumental in this paper
I think it was only a few days later

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:19.080
that I got a copy of this manuscript

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.160
and the manuscript was very thick

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.320
nose like 300 pages from

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:28.690
single space you know typeset by

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:32.890
test mathematics typesetting program and

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:36.320
on we were supposed to

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.820
be the referee is on

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:43.140
looking at different parts of the paper
and I was assigned to a par

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:46.900
that be turn out to be problem-free arm

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.240
and I'm the cats look at a park but

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:54.929
turn out to have problems a problem was
there shattering

00:20:54.929 --> 00:20:58.460
for you a do you like that doesn't make
you think this is good

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:03.300
I like the reader a lot about it really
deflating up to I have

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:06.650
champagne mean finding the problem well

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:11.670
from want more of the aspects of the
whole thing is that I had gone out

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:13.140
pretty for a limb

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:16.910
from telling everybody that Andrew Wiles
improve this thing

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:20.040
on in the way that started was that

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.940
when the New York Times first heard
about his announcement may ask to speak

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.800
to him and returns me and said

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:29.390
and you know you speak to Gina Kolata so
I went

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:32.670
and on went upstairs and

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:35.870
spoke to her for a very long time
explaining the whole thing

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:40.010
and then I'm somehow the media kept
calling me

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:44.960
because it was understood from that
somehow I was is designated spokesperson

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:48.070
so I nice spent the entire summer

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:51.470
I'm lecturing about his theorem

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:52.390
and

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:55.960
I'm fielding phone calls from I'm the
press

00:21:55.960 --> 00:22:00.100
hello for was announcement cast

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:05.370
oh I think it was like two weeks what
happens in mathematics is if if you have

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:07.650
a proof that seems to really be

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:10.650
on seems to have a lot or

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:14.320
from internal logic

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:18.570
to it and there's something that's wrong
with the proof

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:21.940
your immediate reaction is to say well

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:25.760
you know this is just some technical
problem that I need to fix

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:29.310
and I think that are Andrew Wiles when
he

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:34.590
found out about the gap arm expected
that you would be able to repair insured

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:35.100
or

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:39.230
so it really took a while before there
was some

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:43.480
realization on his part that this was a
serious problem

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:46.600
couldn't be fixed on immediately just by
their

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:51.230
tools improper if you love the person
who was taking all the calls from the

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:51.860
press

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:55.790
whatever reason did that mean you will
you are contacting

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:59.870
and while get updates on the game
because my i don't know what to tell

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:00.650
them what

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:03.800
we call him but those you want to say it
was a

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.940
he gone right not especially Inc he kind
of went dark

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:10.530
he was working on on mathematics and

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:15.060
I wasn't wasn't getting a lot of
information out of him at that time

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.470
you know it was all poison about right i
mean

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:21.929
I'm wasn't clear whether or not this
will get repaired or not

00:23:21.929 --> 00:23:25.710
and then you know wonderfully it turned
out that there was

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:29.110
this so repair to the proof

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:33.640
from release in completely new insight
actually by Andrew Wiles and Richard

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:34.470
Taylor

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:37.500
who work together over the summer and
this will be the summer

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.929
1994 and they

00:23:40.929 --> 00:23:44.289
had a or preprint out

00:23:44.289 --> 00:23:48.590
in in the fall 1994 really explain their
new method in which is now

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:52.299
call Taylor Wiles method and that

00:23:52.299 --> 00:23:56.940
really I'm circumvented a lot or the
more complicated arguments in the

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:57.620
original

00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:01.870
preprint and the two articles were
published together

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:06.669
on the following summer which is a
summer 1995 in the annals of mathematics

00:24:06.669 --> 00:24:09.850
it was a relief but it was it was not
our

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:13.900
kinda joyous relief you know and Richard
Taylor came to me one day

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:17.610
again MSRI where I happen to be in

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:20.919
fall far 1994 any sand

00:24:20.919 --> 00:24:24.419
we have some good news for you and then

00:24:24.419 --> 00:24:29.140
on the next day and make up in this
paper so that was kinda very good

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:33.919
and you know I don't remember there
being

00:24:33.919 --> 00:24:37.730
a huge celebration on the moment

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:41.860
the releases that reprint been just
kinda gradually build people understand

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:43.120
that the proof is complete

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.950
and then there was a very large
instructional conference at Boston

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:48.130
University in summer

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:51.830
1995 different people got up and explain
the different

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:56.030
elements approve well it was a fabulous
pieces mathematics

00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:59.940
arm as impressed arm with by

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:04.280
what what I did and presses I am by my
my own were coming

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:07.309
I'm even much more impressed by what
they did

00:25:07.309 --> 00:25:10.620
on they had some really knew inside and

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:14.539
this inside has I'm percolated through

00:25:14.539 --> 00:25:18.300
our whole subject for the last twenty
years arm

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:22.250
one way to say what they did is they
showed

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:25.670
that somehow modularity is contagious

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:30.830
in the sense that if you have something
that hope has a little pieces that the

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:31.830
modular

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:37.360
you can parlay that into modularity over
forty first evolved Wiles was

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:40.880
obviously intensely driven to do this he
was

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:45.240
really motivated and he said you know
I'm gonna do this one way or another

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:48.910
and me brought in all sorts a

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:52.550
different techniques that hadn't been
related

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:55.640
on to the the problem before

00:25:55.640 --> 00:26:00.550
on what some what's amazing for example
there's a whole subject an algebraic

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:02.660
geometry call deformation theory

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:06.690
that was going on when I was a graduate
student that I didn't learn

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:10.100
I thought that was really far removed
from anything involving

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:13.320
elliptic curves and on in

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:16.770
the years before wells announcement
Harry Mazer

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:20.620
had developed this new technique of
deformation theory in gallery

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:23.030
presentations and it turned out to be
exactly what

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:26.210
Wiles needed the language in the
techniques the median

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:29.650
for his discussion on and so

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:33.570
you know something that seems to be far
away technically turn out to be crucial

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:37.800
well I think I'm you know just
informally everyone refer to it as the

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.380
Fermat's last theorem

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:43.210
but in fact when you when you look at
the article just like my article was

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:44.890
something internal to

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:49.640
on series modular forms and get our
presentations and Wiles article in my

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.300
article share

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.620
the trait that for was a question covers
exactly once in the article in the

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:55.160
beginning

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:59.450
and then you get down to the real stuff
on very happy with the

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:02.790
recognition that I've gotten and I

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:06.670
very proud of what I did and be I

00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:10.490
when students come and my classes they
may know about my

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:13.920
role for Fermat's last theorem. A lot of them have seen the

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:17.370
video that was broadcast on over and BBC

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:22.170
and a I think you know if you do
something very very very very famous and

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:23.710
you have an encore problem

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:27.080
where people saying you know what great
thing you're going to do next

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:31.280
and I try to be on more or less a normal
guy

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.660
and

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:38.010
not you know walk around with angels on
your shoulder

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:41.470
britt to rediscover what FAMAS proof
might it be

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:45.020
is that they have widely-helds that he
had done it already disclaim lot

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:49.290
was he telling the truth ? I think by the
time we get to 20th century it's quite

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:50.260
clear

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:52.800
that this is an incredibly complex problem.
