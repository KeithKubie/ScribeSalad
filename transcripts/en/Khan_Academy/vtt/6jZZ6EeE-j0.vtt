00:00:00.455 --> 00:00:02.335
- [Voiceover] The quadratic
expressions 4x squared,

00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:06.637
plus 12x, plus 9, and 4x squared minus 9,

00:00:06.637 --> 00:00:09.601
share a common binomial factor.

00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:11.967
What binomial factor do they share?

00:00:11.967 --> 00:00:13.067
And I encourage you to pause the video,

00:00:13.067 --> 00:00:15.400
see if you can figure it out.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.645
So, let's do this by taking
each of these expressions,

00:00:17.645 --> 00:00:19.457
and trying to factor them into binomials,

00:00:19.457 --> 00:00:21.878
and then see if they share
a common binomial factor.

00:00:21.878 --> 00:00:23.567
I guess they do share
one, it's to figure out

00:00:23.567 --> 00:00:26.101
which one they actually share.

00:00:26.101 --> 00:00:31.101
So, let's focus first on this
4x squared, plus 12x, plus 9.

00:00:32.951 --> 00:00:36.934
So, the first thing that
might jump out at you is,

00:00:36.934 --> 00:00:39.034
well let's see, I have a
4 here, this coefficient

00:00:39.034 --> 00:00:41.434
on the x squared term,
that's a perfect square.

00:00:41.434 --> 00:00:44.235
I could write the entire 4x squared term,

00:00:44.235 --> 00:00:49.235
I could rewrite that
as 2x to the 2nd power,

00:00:49.901 --> 00:00:54.735
then out here, I have
a constant term, the 9,

00:00:54.735 --> 00:00:56.454
that also is a perfect square.

00:00:56.454 --> 00:01:00.401
I could rewrite that as 3 squared.

00:01:00.401 --> 00:01:03.334
And you could say, "Well,
gee, does this fit the pattern

00:01:03.334 --> 00:01:05.701
of a perfect square polynomial?"

00:01:05.701 --> 00:01:07.034
In order for it to fit the pattern

00:01:07.034 --> 00:01:08.195
of a perfect square polynomial,

00:01:08.195 --> 00:01:10.801
the coefficient, here on the x term,

00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:15.801
would need to be 2 times the
product of this 2 and this 3,

00:01:18.491 --> 00:01:22.034
and it is, indeed, 2 times
the product of 2 and 3.

00:01:22.034 --> 00:01:27.034
It is 2 times 6, so we
could write this part,

00:01:27.168 --> 00:01:28.034
right over here,

00:01:28.034 --> 00:01:33.034
as 2 times 2, times that 2,
times 3, times that 3x, x.

00:01:41.077 --> 00:01:44.301
Then of course, we have to add
these three things together,

00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:45.801
so plus, plus.

00:01:45.801 --> 00:01:47.335
And so just like that,

00:01:47.335 --> 00:01:51.067
we can recognize, hey, this is
a perfect square polynomial,

00:01:51.067 --> 00:01:52.201
right over here.

00:01:52.201 --> 00:01:54.148
And if what I'm saying, right now,

00:01:54.148 --> 00:01:55.435
sounds like a little bit of voodoo,

00:01:55.435 --> 00:01:57.401
I encourage you to
watch some of the videos

00:01:57.401 --> 00:02:00.177
on perfect square trinomials,
perfect square polynomials,

00:02:00.177 --> 00:02:03.539
some of the last two
videos in this progression.

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.735
So this this thing can be rewritten

00:02:06.735 --> 00:02:11.735
as the same thing as 2x
plus 3, 2x plus 3, squared,

00:02:16.924 --> 00:02:18.954
2x plus 3, squared.

00:02:18.954 --> 00:02:21.401
Once again, because it's of the form,

00:02:21.401 --> 00:02:23.911
you have the entire 2x squared here,

00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:26.467
you have the 3 squared here,

00:02:26.467 --> 00:02:29.268
and then this middle term
is 2 times the product

00:02:29.268 --> 00:02:31.534
of these two terms right over here,

00:02:31.534 --> 00:02:34.434
and so it definitely fit the pattern.

00:02:34.434 --> 00:02:35.034
So, there you have it.

00:02:35.034 --> 00:02:37.601
We factored the first expression,

00:02:37.601 --> 00:02:39.971
and now let's try to factor
the second expression.

00:02:39.971 --> 00:02:41.235
And, immediately when you see this one,

00:02:41.235 --> 00:02:44.001
it looks like it's a
difference of squares,

00:02:44.001 --> 00:02:45.698
so this one right over there,

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:48.215
looks like a difference of squares to me.

00:02:48.215 --> 00:02:53.215
This, we can rewrite as 2x squared,

00:02:53.934 --> 00:02:58.934
minus, minus, look at that
nice color, minus 3 squared,

00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:02.434
so minus 3 squared.

00:03:02.434 --> 00:03:04.864
This is a difference of squares,
we've seen multiple times,

00:03:04.864 --> 00:03:06.281
how to factor difference of squares.

00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:08.367
If this, again, looks foreign to you,

00:03:08.367 --> 00:03:09.907
I encourage you to watch those videos,

00:03:09.907 --> 00:03:12.468
and we explain how that
works, and why it works.

00:03:12.468 --> 00:03:13.301
What is is going to be,

00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:14.235
when you have something in the form

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:16.368
A squared, minus B squared,

00:03:16.368 --> 00:03:20.655
it's going to be equal to
A plus B, times A minus B.

00:03:20.655 --> 00:03:22.801
So, this is going to be equal to,

00:03:22.801 --> 00:03:25.168
let me just put the two
binomials right over here,

00:03:25.168 --> 00:03:30.168
so this is going to be A
plus B, times A minus B.

00:03:30.334 --> 00:03:35.334
So, this is going to be 2x
plus 3, times 2x minus 3.

00:03:37.544 --> 00:03:41.274
So, 2x plus 3, times 2x minus 3.

00:03:41.284 --> 00:03:44.668
And so, what is their
common binomial factor?

00:03:44.668 --> 00:03:48.200
Well, they both involve,
when you factor them out,

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.069
they both have a binomial
factor of 2x plus 3.

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:54.328
This one right over here,
we could rewrite if we want.

00:03:54.328 --> 00:03:58.484
We could rewrite it as 2x
plus 3, times 2x plus 3.

00:03:58.484 --> 00:04:01.351
That might've been somewhat
obvious to you already.

00:04:01.351 --> 00:04:06.351
So, 2x, 2x, then you have plus 3, plus 3,

00:04:07.468 --> 00:04:08.767
these two are equivalent.

00:04:08.767 --> 00:04:13.767
And so you see, we see, that
we share in both of these,

00:04:15.098 --> 00:04:18.735
we share at least one,
or we share exactly one,

00:04:18.735 --> 00:04:22.234
2x plus 3, so that's the
binomial factor that they share:

00:04:22.234 --> 00:04:24.234
2x plus 3.
