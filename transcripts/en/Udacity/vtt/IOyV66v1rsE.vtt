00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:03.610
my name is Jane Chueh, and I'm a clinical professor at

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:09.292
the Stanford Medical School, Medical Center. clinically, I work as a high

00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:15.138
risk obstetrician which means we see high risk pregnancies, and I also do

00:00:15.138 --> 00:00:20.970
fetal ultrasounds on pregnancies in general, looking for fetal anomalies.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.090
&gt;&gt; What kind of, what makes a pregnancy at-risk or high risk?

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.660
&gt;&gt; well,

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.290
you know, every pregnancy deserves close scrutinization, right? And

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.660
so we look at every pregnancy as if there

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.770
could be something going on. And so we, at

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.430
every ultrasound, we do that, particularly at the five

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.120
month ultrasound, where we carefully go through the fetal

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.680
anatomy. And so sometimes, even if you're 20 years

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.960
old, things can happen that are unexpected and rare.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.370
we look at every fetus with that sort of light.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.560
There are other, other, you know, types of conditions that the mother can have

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.280
that predispose them to being high risk. And some of those are if you're

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.810
older, if you have diabetes, for example

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.480
or some sort of, underlying medical issue

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:13.170
like hypertension. So those things are, all play into our our pool of high risk.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.390
&gt;&gt; Sure. Now we've talked a lot in our

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.420
lesson up to this point about how important the ABO

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.980
blood type is for on our red blood cells. and I'm curious

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:30.040
to know how blood type affects, possibly these regular or high risk pregnancies.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.850
&gt;&gt; So every patient that we see, we do require, that

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.700
we know their blood type and RH type and I know

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.710
you are talking a lot about the ABO blood system. it's

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.760
important because at delivery there is a chance that they may bleed,

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.520
whether they have a vaginal delivery or whether they have

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.510
a c-section. sometimes they bleed, most of the time they

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.060
bleed very minimally, and so they don't require transfusion but

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.410
occasionally in rare cases, they have a lot of bleeding. and

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.480
it becomes a very complicated case where they require lots

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.520
of blood. if you need blood, then it's important to have

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.110
the type of blood that the person receives match to

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.810
their type. So we, we want to know what that is and

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.640
in fact we actually require that they be

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.310
typed twice. So they're typed at a prenatal visit

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.510
and they are also typed when they come

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.560
in before they receive blood. So there's two that,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.570
&gt;&gt; Is that important?

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.876
&gt;&gt; That, that is important because you can't just could, it could be

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:25.692
a mistake, I mean if one, if they had just one result. So

00:02:25.692 --> 00:02:27.282
the, the policy is that, there's

00:02:27.282 --> 00:02:29.614
two that actually correlate that, that they'rere

00:02:29.614 --> 00:02:34.840
the same, If you don't have a blood type then, and you need blood

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.320
then the only option is, you know, the

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.000
blood bank gives you universal donor, which would

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.820
be O negative. but O negative is not the most common type of blood there is, and

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.810
you know, you can't use up your entire pool of O negative blood. So, the best

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.050
thing would be to, you know, give the

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.190
person the type of blood that they actually have.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.300
&gt;&gt; Actually have a match.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.610
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.820
&gt;&gt; Now, you mentioned the ABO type is important.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.440
But you mentioned another factor, a positive or negative factor?

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.910
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:58.790
&gt;&gt; Tell us about that.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.020
&gt;&gt; So in pregnancy,

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:06.400
particularly the RH factor which is a rhesus blood group on the red cell is, is

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.700
important. this refers to a group of antigens,

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.860
the most common being the D antigen. And there's

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.480
a D positive group, and there's a D

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.630
negative antigen in other words you know, or say

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.500
they're missing the D antigen. So everybody has

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.300
two alleles, right? So there, they could be D

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.350
positive, D positive or D positive, D negative or D negative D negative.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.330
&gt;&gt; So it's kind of like, the O type where

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.110
O is nothing, whereas you have A, B or nothing.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.594
&gt;&gt; Correct, exactly, exactly. So, just like with A blood

00:03:38.594 --> 00:03:42.599
type, you can have homozygous A, which be A positive

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.337
A positive, or a heterozygous A, which would be A

00:03:46.337 --> 00:03:50.350
plus O, A plus O. Right? Or AO. the rhesus group

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.680
also is the same thing, so you can have D plus

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.000
D plus, which would be homozygous D plus, or you can have

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.410
D plus D negative, which would be heterozygous D plus, or

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.880
you can have D negative. Which would be D negative, D negative.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.350
&gt;&gt; Right. And we'll learn a lot more about dominance, actually in one of

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.680
our lessons, lesson 5. Where we'll learn

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.200
that, the D plus allele, then is dominant?

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.900
&gt;&gt; Right, right.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.329
And so this becomes an issue when, we find an

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.340
Rh negative woman whose D negative, D negative. so if she,

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.170
marries a partner, who is not Rh negative.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.460
In other words, he's Rh positive and he's

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.820
either D plus D plus or D plus D negative, both of them of which are considered

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:45.606
you know, D or Rh positive. then there's a chance that her child could be RH

00:04:45.606 --> 00:04:49.344
positive, either D plus, well actually it would

00:04:49.344 --> 00:04:52.840
have to be 100% D plus D negative, right?

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:53.280
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.130
&gt;&gt; Because one of the genes comes from her

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.740
and it'll be D negative and the other one

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.120
is going to come from her partner. So we need

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.090
to know what her partner's genotype is, for the Rh

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.470
antigen. And we need to know if the fetus

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.420
has, you know, 100% chance of being Rh positive.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.220
Which this fetus would have if the father was

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.150
homozygus, Rh positive. In other words, he had two copies

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:24.645
of the D gene. that would obviously result in a fetus that's

00:05:24.645 --> 00:05:30.835
heterozygous, Rh positive. However, if the father is heterozygous and

00:05:30.835 --> 00:05:35.000
he's D plus, D negative, then there's a chance that her

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.220
fetus will be Rh negative, which would be D minus, D minus.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.340
&gt;&gt; And so just to be clear here then, the risk here is that the mother

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.590
would be Rh negative and the baby's Rh positive.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:47.060
&gt;&gt; Correct.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.355
&gt;&gt; And if the mother's and the baby's blood were to see each other, that the

00:05:50.355 --> 00:05:53.250
mother's blood might not recognize the Rh positive

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.430
in the baby's blood and attack it or something?

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.170
&gt;&gt; No, no, basic, if the mother's Rh negative and

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.960
sees the Rh positive in the fetus, in the fetus

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.750
blood, fetal blood, then it will recognize it as being

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.640
formed. Because she's never seen the D antigen until she

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.290
became pregnant, right?

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.070
&gt;&gt; So what happens when that, so let's say you,

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.050
you know, the scenario happens. What, what, what, what happens next?

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.360
&gt;&gt; Right. So what happens is if that happens, then

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.160
her antibody screen will come back positive, that she has an

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.895
antibody. So that antibody would be against her fetus's D

00:06:29.895 --> 00:06:33.722
antigen, which is foreign to her and small titer is not

00:06:33.722 --> 00:06:37.670
an issue, but with over time the body has

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.000
a memory. Snd so over time, it will mount a

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.770
higher and a higher response. So, for example, usually

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.810
the first pregnancy, the titers don't get to a point

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.660
where they're concerning or that they will actually destroy

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.510
the fetal, fetal blood. Because if, once the mother makes

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.820
so much antibody against the fetus, the, the antibodies

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.035
will cross and they will actually hemolyze the fetal blood.

00:06:59.035 --> 00:07:01.800
It'll attack, it'll attack the red cells because

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.350
of the foreign antigen on the fetal blood.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:06.660
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. So essentially what, what you're telling us is that, initial, so

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.020
let's say a mother is having her first pregnancy and she's Rh negative, she's

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.910
D negative and the baby's D positive. Even though she may have some antibodies

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.710
that might attack it, because it's her

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.480
first pregnancy there aren't that many antibodies.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:17.680
&gt;&gt; Correct.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.050
&gt;&gt; So it wouldn't be so bad, but maybe in her

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.080
second or third pregnancy, she's have a lot more of those antibodies.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:21.930
&gt;&gt; Right. Exactly. Those antibiotics.

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:22.430
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:23.220
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.140
&gt;&gt; So the first pregnancy,

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.990
what we do is we find out that she's sensitized. That's what the

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.470
word is, you know, when, when we find that she has antibodies already

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:33.610
made against the D antigen. And we follow those titers of those antibodies

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.350
and there's a critical titre above which we, then we start to get worried.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.670
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.680
&gt;&gt; So as long as she's below that critical titre, then we

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:43.190
just follow monthly with blood titers from her. Once she rises above that,

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.080
then we have to start thinking, okay, is this mother going to mount,

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.280
is, is she mounting such a high response that it's causing fetal anemia?

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.870
And we actually have ways of looking for fetal anemia.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.590
The old fashioned way was to put a needle into

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:59.120
the pregnancy sac, take out fluid and check for bilyruben,

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.530
which is a breakdown product of hemolysis, right? And there's

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:05.620
graphs, this curve called the Liley Curve, which you'd plot

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.600
the points and, based on the gestational age. You'd find

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.560
out whether there's a normal amount of bilirubin or an

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.820
abnormal amount, which would indicate a high amount of hemolysis.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.030
Well, that was invasive and, you know, people would

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:20.890
end up having multiple amniocenteses over the pregnancy, course of

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:24.120
the pregnancy. And it wasn't that long ago, because when

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.598
I trained, that was the way we treated sensitized pregnancies.

00:08:27.598 --> 00:08:31.230
But now, there's a non invasive way of monitoring

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:34.179
for fetal anemia, where we use ultrasound, to look at

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:37.100
the blood flow in the fetal brain. And what we

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.049
do is we measure the peak velocity in the middle

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:44.090
cerebral artery of the fetus. And we can tell whether

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:47.650
the fetus is anemic, based on the velocity of flow.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.590
&gt;&gt; If, so then if, if they're anemic it, it slows?

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:51.600
&gt;&gt; It goes up actually.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.120
&gt;&gt; It actually goes up?

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So because, if you're anemic, what you're trying to

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.930
do is you're trying to preserve flow to your most important

00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:00.410
organs and obviously, the brain is the most important. So, it

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:05.020
shunts blood there and you'll have a higher velocity. So that's how,

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.090
and then we have these elaborate curves now.

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:10.110
That based on the flow the peak velocity

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:12.440
in the middle, cerebral artery, we can tell,

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.400
what the chances that this fetus has anemia.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.820
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.420
&gt;&gt; So, if it's high chance, you know, we might just skip

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.850
the whole amniocentesis, and we usually do now, we don't go without, because

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:25.130
it's so predictive. We just go in and we sample the fetal

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:30.120
cord to check the hematocrit rate. And if it's low, then we transfuse.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.360
So we actually get in there, we're ready to transfuse.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.230
and we used O negative blood for the fetus, that is

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:40.450
matched to the mother's, to make sure there's no antibodies

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:45.214
that the fetus can't handle. And we check the keratin, but

00:09:45.214 --> 00:09:47.500
we usually have a idea where it might be and

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.920
there's these charts that, so, if we find out the hematocrit

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.130
is 10 or 15, then we know how much to

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:55.210
transfuse. And then, we check the keratin, and if it's 10,

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:58.010
then we know we have to give this many CC's of blood.

00:09:58.010 --> 00:09:59.901
&gt;&gt; So, what are besides the actual

00:09:59.901 --> 00:10:03.073
mother mother-fetus interaction, are there any other

00:10:03.073 --> 00:10:05.513
important clinical settings related to this or

00:10:05.513 --> 00:10:08.735
otherwise, where knowing blood type's very important?

00:10:08.735 --> 00:10:14.080
&gt;&gt; just the first one, you know for the mother, mostly for her

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.810
safety, if she hemorrhaged during pregnancy

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:18.710
or delivery, that she would need blood.

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:20.400
&gt;&gt; And there are times when I

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.290
guess, patients need a lot of blood, or a little

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:23.890
bit of blood? I mean is there ever, is there ever

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:25.640
been a scenario where you're like, oh gosh, I need this

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.910
type of blood but you know, I don't have enough or.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:28.420
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.860
&gt;&gt; what do you do?

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:32.710
&gt;&gt; So, it yeah, we have something called massive

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:36.170
transfusion protocol. this happens when

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:39.350
there's obstetrical hemorrhage disaster that

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:43.050
happens. usually, if you have time, you try to give

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.580
matched blood, and you know the, the person's blood type.

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.500
Especially if you've anticipated the possibility, and she's already

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.413
been crossed and matched. but, if not, then you know,

00:10:51.413 --> 00:10:55.800
you activate the protocol and you give O negative blood.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.590
And, and we've had cases where due to certain conditions

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:02.110
of the placenta and the uterus, especially one called the

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:05.460
placenta accreta. Where the placenta grows into the uterus, where

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.650
you can't remove the placenta after delivery. We have to

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.460
remove the entire uterus and there's so much blood flow,

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.440
that they, the mothers lose so much blood they

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.240
can receive, you know, 50 to 100 units of blood.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.980
&gt;&gt; what would be the reaction, I'm just curious, if

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:22.390
the wrong blood type was administered? what happens to the patient?

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:26.180
&gt;&gt; so they can have a transfusion reaction, which we'll need

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:28.130
to look up in a book, I mean, I'm, I know,

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:31.190
I know what it's like but it's, basically, they get very,

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:34.600
very sick, you know? It, it, they get high fevers, they

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:40.830
I think they start hemolyzing, basically. All of their blood cells, you know.

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:44.290
And, I know that we can, there's a, there's a mild transfusion reaction,

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:48.000
where you can prevent a little bit of that by giving some pre-medication.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.240
But then, if it's truly unmatched blood, then, you, you could die from that.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.520
&gt;&gt; Well, that raises just sort of I guess

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.030
an interesting question. Do you know your blood type?

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.420
&gt;&gt; I do.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:57.830
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:00.220
&gt;&gt; it's B positive, but I don't

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.640
remember the scenario, I've never received blood.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.450
I think I just asked my parents one time and

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:07.850
they knew, but we have people coming all the time and

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:09.480
they don't know. We, we do a procedure and we

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.810
need to know their blood type. Oh so, here's another, another

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:16.920
scenario we need to know their blood type. I forgot to mention, if you're

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:22.510
RH negative, so we can't obviously type

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:25.840
every single RH negative person, you know, what their fetus

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.510
is, because you don't want to invasively go in there and check.

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:33.645
We also don't need to, to check every father and unless there was some sort of

00:12:33.645 --> 00:12:38.910
issue. So for all of the, sort of, the general RH negative women, they receive

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:43.335
something called RhoGAM during pregnancy. RhoGAM is an

00:12:43.335 --> 00:12:47.451
immuno-globulin that blocks the antigens on the red

00:12:47.451 --> 00:12:50.740
cells. So, if you might imagine the fetal

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.760
cell trying to get into the maternal circulation.

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.740
if it got in there the RhoGAM would just attach itself to all

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:01.220
the sites, bind all the sites, so the mother can't see the antigens.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.140
&gt;&gt; That's clever.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:05.990
&gt;&gt; And, you can't, she won't amount, she won't mount to response.

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:10.110
So that way, if the fetus happened to be RH positive, I

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:14.350
mean, RH positive, that's correct, then she won't see the positive, D

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:18.810
antigen. And so that's what we use RhoGAM for. RhoGAM is given in

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:23.186
the middle of pregnancy, around 28 weeks, on all R Rh negative

00:13:23.186 --> 00:13:27.230
women, just by the chance of perhaps, that fetus might be Rh positive.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:29.718
&gt;&gt; How many are Rh negative in general?

00:13:29.718 --> 00:13:32.193
&gt;&gt; So about 5% of the Caucasian

00:13:32.193 --> 00:13:36.562
population in the United States, are Rh negative.

00:13:36.562 --> 00:13:37.140
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:43.850
&gt;&gt; So they receive RhoGam at 28 weeks, and also after delivery if the fetus,

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:47.090
or the newborn now, obviously after delivery, is RH

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:50.910
positive. So that she doesn't mount a response you

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:53.350
know, by, because during, during the delivery process there's

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:55.870
some mixing of blood between the fetus and the mother.

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:57.560
&gt;&gt; So, and you mentioned now, so, I

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.740
guess we've learned about ABO and sort of this

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:02.524
new antigen RH. Are there other antigens on

00:14:02.524 --> 00:14:04.640
the red blood cells that we care about too?

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:09.020
&gt;&gt; Yes. Actually, there's two pages, very small print, of other antigens

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:13.490
that are on the red cell antigen, on the red blood cell. And some of them, the

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:18.950
most common one is kell. Kell for it's, it's

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:24.780
not common, because, as, it's most of the population is

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:30.120
Kell negative. So, it's only an issue if the

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:34.130
mother has somehow received blood from a Kell positive person, and then she saw

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:37.028
that as being. Foreign as she mounted the,

00:14:37.028 --> 00:14:40.720
Kell antibody, right? Because most people are Kell-negative and

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.110
they meet a Kell-negative person and the reproduce and

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:47.430
there's no issue because there's compatibility. but if you

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:50.770
happen to be Kell-negative and have the antibody, then

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:53.273
that could be an issue because your fetus. Could

00:14:53.273 --> 00:14:56.516
be Kell-negative and you know, you could suffer, the

00:14:56.516 --> 00:14:59.130
fetus could suffer from that. So, again, we go

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.940
through the same thing of monitoring for fetal anemia

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.860
if the mother is has the antibodies to Kell.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.630
&gt;&gt; So it sounds like even in pregnancy and

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:10.670
even otherwise knowing your blood types could be really important.

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:14.570
&gt;&gt; So, we do have people come in for procedures that, like

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:19.380
amniocentesis, and if they're RH negative and they're not sensitized. They have

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:21.400
no antibodies, and we don't want them to be sensitized, so they

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.450
would get RhoGam. So we do need to know their blood type and

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:26.930
their RH type for that reason. We don't really need

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:28.790
to know the ABO at that point because we're not

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:31.160
giving blood. But we really need to know their Rh

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.110
type because if they're Rh negative they would get RhoGam.

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:37.220
most people don't know their blood type. I

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.150
don't know that, that's a critical thing, you

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:42.350
know, right this minute. But, obviously, you know,

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:45.130
it, the time of birth or you're going through

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:47.810
some sort of procedure surgically, the hospital would

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:49.720
say oh, you need to be typed. Just in

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.360
case, you know there's a significant risk that

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.510
you might receive some blood. You should be typed.

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:57.110
&gt;&gt; Great. I, I want to just finish up. I'l love to just hear

00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:01.440
a little bit more about your background and how you actually found yourself in

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.290
the sort of OB realm of medicine.

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.900
&gt;&gt; well, I think like you, in high

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.880
school biology, I was really interested in reproductive medicine,

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:13.580
I just thought it was very beautiful, just how,

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.200
you know. The life is created and all the

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.870
different things that have to go right, in order

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:20.940
to, to create a, a new person. and so

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:23.300
from that intellectual interest I carried that into medical

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.650
school. when I did my OB rotation I found

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:28.810
the people who were in OB were very

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:32.800
upbeat and optimistic. And energetic, in general. And

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.310
I think, you know, because most of our

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:40.070
outcomes are good, it's not, it's in general

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:42.020
a happy field because we get to see

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.340
beautiful babies, and twins, and triplets, and some

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.340
quadruplets. So, there all kinds of things, and

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:51.820
yet, there's another component where it's very intense with,

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:55.346
you know, fetal anomalies. Also, high-risk mothers, that have

00:16:55.346 --> 00:16:59.186
had bad histories where they've lost pregnancies and they're hoping

00:16:59.186 --> 00:17:01.866
to get a good one this time. So, there's a

00:17:01.866 --> 00:17:06.130
whole mixture of both happy and yet very intensely, possibly

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:09.096
sada that we feel like we can do. You know,

00:17:09.096 --> 00:17:12.060
make a difference with. And so, that's, that's what drew

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:14.740
me to OB. And that's why I like high-risk OB.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:17.230
Because of the chance to be able to help people

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:19.460
who have not had such a great outcome in the past.

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:21.930
&gt;&gt; How do you see genetics playing a role in the

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:28.220
future of both, you know, OB pregnancy and maybe medicine in general?

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.950
&gt;&gt; Well, genetics is really the future, you know, I mean,

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:35.320
it's occurring, and the knowledge that's happening in genetics is occurring

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:39.120
at such an incredible speed. It helps us every single day.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.240
I mean, when we, when we see an ultrasound, we wonder if

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:45.370
this is a genetic thing. We wonder if there's testing

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.690
for it. We wonder if we can do it for

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:49.890
maternal blood, or whether we need to do an invasive

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:52.630
procedure to find out what the answer is. So all those

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:55.610
questions, you know, can change from, like, week to week,

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:58.660
and so. It's truly amazing what genetics has, has been

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.530
able to offer us. one example I just want to give

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:06.790
you is this Rh group system again. So, in the past,

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:14.030
if the father had the D antigen and could

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:16.410
pass it to the fetus. And we weren't sure if

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:18.120
the fetus had it or not. We would have to

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:23.295
do an invasive procedure. like an amniocentesis. Or something called

00:18:23.295 --> 00:18:23.900
[UNKNOWN]

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.990
sampling. Which is done in the first trimester. And

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:28.780
that would be, be able to type the fetus's genome

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:32.770
type for our, the Rh, group. in the future,

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:34.490
you know, they're hoping to be able to do this

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:38.260
on maternal blood. And that's a, that's a step

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:42.330
forward in genetics because eventually hopefully, we can avoid having

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:45.940
to do invasive procedures to, to get information. And

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:49.180
already we're moving in that direction. And even with testing

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:52.870
for Down syndrome. It's moved into the, the maternal blood.

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:55.160
So we're doing much fewer and invasive procedures, because of that.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.570
&gt;&gt; So what's the basis behind that? Just really quickly,

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.590
is that the fact that there are blood cells from the,

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:02.610
&gt;&gt; Yes, so there are blood, they're actually it's not blood cells around

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:04.850
there, now, we're talking about DNA.

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:06.350
So there's free-floating DNA from the fetus.

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.800
&gt;&gt; From the fetus?

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.050
&gt;&gt; From the fetus. In the mother's circulation. They were,

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:14.330
for many years, looking for intact cells, but it turns out

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:16.300
intact cells are problematic because they can

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:18.220
last for a long time. They can even

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:21.777
be from a past pregnancy. So, but

00:19:21.777 --> 00:19:24.374
free-flowing DNA is very short-lived, or relatively short-lived.

00:19:24.374 --> 00:19:25.374
&gt;&gt;

00:19:24.374 --> 00:19:24.991
[INAUDIBLE]

00:19:24.991 --> 00:19:25.664
hemolytic event.

00:19:25.664 --> 00:19:28.588
&gt;&gt; Yes, there' actually some apoptosis, which is a

00:19:28.588 --> 00:19:31.220
word meaning cell death. And so these cells that

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.810
die. And they're supposed to, you know. They turn

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:37.540
over, release their DNA, and they're found in maternal circulation.

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:40.180
And because of our incre, incredibly technology, we're able

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:43.450
to detect such minute amounts of DNA, and be able

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:46.100
to separate that from the maternal in a very

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:50.480
complicated fashion which I won't go into here. but by

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.650
using those techniques, they're able to determine, like for

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:58.090
example, the fetal Rh type by just drawing blood on

00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:01.160
the mother. Now, it's not perfect yet. I mean, and

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.120
I think a test like this has to be perfect

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.390
because you don't want to misdiagnose, for example, and

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:10.070
tell the patient that your fetus is D negative and

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:12.979
it's not at risk. When actually, it was D positive.

00:20:12.979 --> 00:20:15.527
So you can't tolerate any mistake right, you can't have

00:20:15.527 --> 00:20:18.690
any error in this part. Has to be 100% accurate. So

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:22.982
when it becomes like that then we could possibly, possibly diagnose

00:20:22.982 --> 00:20:24.178
[UNKNOWN]

00:20:24.178 --> 00:20:27.492
blood. With Down syndrome I think it's already very close

00:20:27.492 --> 00:20:30.436
I mean it's something like one in 10,000 risk if

00:20:30.436 --> 00:20:34.260
you have a negative test on the blood. Yeah. So

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:37.340
they are able to reduce your risk to a very,

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:42.760
very, very low number based on that. So I think,

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.370
you know, genetics is fascinating. That's another reason I went

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:48.053
to high-risk OB, because I really love genetics. I actually

00:20:48.053 --> 00:20:49.163
did a genetics fellowship, in addition to my high-risk OB fellowship.

00:20:49.163 --> 00:20:50.183
So it was a nice supplement because a lot of it goes hand into hand and

00:20:50.183 --> 00:20:50.965
everything you see now in OB and ultrasound,

00:20:50.965 --> 00:20:51.913
pre natal ultrasound, is tied into genetics, somehow.

00:20:51.913 --> 00:20:57.541
&gt;&gt; Very cool, thank you for what you

00:20:57.541 --> 00:21:03.613
do, and for interviewing with us.

00:21:03.613 --> 00:21:11.430
&gt;&gt; Oh, my pleasure, my pleasure, thanks a lot.

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.940
&gt;&gt; Yeah thanks.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:12.180
&gt;&gt; Okay.
