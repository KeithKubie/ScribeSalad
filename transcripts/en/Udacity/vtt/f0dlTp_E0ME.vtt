00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
But, I'm now going to do this with the formula up here.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
In particular, we have four things we add in the denominator

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and also four things we add in the numerator.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It's four because there are four data points over here.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Before we fill in this data, I'm going to ask you a different question,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
one that is easy for you to answer, and that is

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
what are the means for x and for y in this data set.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You will need them when you fill in these blanks over here.

00:00:26.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So, please give me just the two numbers here in green.
