[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.152 --> 00:00:07.110
SPEAKER: Now let's talk
about our guest author.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.240
So we have Bonnie Rochman.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.600
She's a graduate of the
University of North Carolina

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.630
at Chapel Hill.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.430
She's a Seattle local currently.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.020
And an award-winning
health and science writer.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.530
Her work has appeared in
Time magazine, Time.com, O,

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.940
that's the Oprah Magazine,
Parenting, Babble, DX, Slate,

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.794
Cookie, and the
News and Observer.

00:00:25.794 --> 00:00:27.960
She's here today to talk
about her first book, which

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.470
came out one week ago.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.549
It's "The Gene Machine:
How Genetic Technologies

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.194
Are Transforming Parenting
and Reshaping Our Society."

00:00:35.194 --> 00:00:37.110
And in this book she
explores the cutting edge

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.840
of gene technology and how
it is transforming medicine,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.060
bioethics, health
care, and the factors

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.140
that shape our families.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.940
So let's welcome Bonnie Rochman.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:45.440
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.523
BONNIE ROCHMAN: Thank you.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.010
Hi, everyone.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.230
Thanks so much for having me.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.226
I want to let you know,
if you're worrying,

00:00:56.226 --> 00:00:57.600
Ah, this doesn't
really have that

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.780
much to do with my
particular line of work.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.980
Yes, it does.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.280
At its heart, this is
really a story about data.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.980
And I know that
that speaks to you.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.480
So I'm going to
start by telling you

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.770
how this book came about it,
which requires me to pull out

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.550
this questionable graduation
picture from 1994,

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.280
when I graduated from UNC.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.460
It was the bicentennial.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.290
UNC happens to be the nation's
oldest public university.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.980
And we were fully expecting
a really impressive speaker.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.680
So other classes had
gotten Madeline Albright,

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.350
Desmond Tutu, John Grisham.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:41.610
And we heard we were getting
a guy named Francis Collins.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.095
No one knew who he
was at the time.

00:01:43.095 --> 00:01:45.840
Oh, there I see a nod there.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.230
At the time, he was director
of the National Human Genome

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.310
Research Institute.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.120
What?

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.100
No one knew what
that was either.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.940
So his job was to
try to articulate

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.710
all three billion
base pairs that

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.440
are part of our genome,
our genetic code.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.550
And I have to say, it
seemed incredibly remote.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.039
Nevertheless, Francis
did a bang-up job.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.240
He gave a great speech.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.310
We all went out into the world.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.420
And he did such a good
job that, in 2009,

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.390
15 years after graduation,
he was actually

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.350
appointed head of the
National Institutes of Health,

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.030
or NIH, which is our country's
medical research agency.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.440
That was the same
year that I started

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.880
working at Time magazine.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.250
And I was a health and
parenting columnist.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.090
This was my column.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.590
It was called Family Matters.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.620
And I could write about
pretty much anything

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.140
I wanted as long
as it intersected

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.240
with health and parenting.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.460
So that means I got
to write about Beyonce

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.590
and her promotion of
public breastfeeding,

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.310
and how friends influence
other friends' decision

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.980
to vaccinate or not to
vaccinate their children.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.430
And I found that, left
to my own devices,

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.670
I actually wrote quite
a bit about genetics.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.720
So I wrote about some pretty
questionable companies that

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.440
were marketing tests
to kind of determine

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.510
your child's aptitude
for a particular sport,

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.060
you know, kind of
based on their genes.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.790
What they would be particularly
good at, if you want to sort of

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.490
steer them in a direction
of a particular sport.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.130
And I wrote about
parents' decisions

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.680
to share or not to share
their genetic testing

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.770
results with their children.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.440
And I had been doing this
job for about six months

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.230
when the study up there
landed in my inbox.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.650
And I remember this
very well, because I

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.460
was on a plane with my family
en route to a family vacation.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.090
And my kids, who were three,
six, and eight at the time,

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.660
I remember looking
over at them--

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.990
and they were all
seated in one row--

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.270
and thinking, would
I want to know

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.170
this level of data, this depth
of information about my kids?

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.780
So what this study was
about the level of--

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.510
the information that this
study was looking to find out--

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.190
had to do with a
group of parents

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.170
who had had genetic testing.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.270
And the parents were
then asked hypothetically

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.839
if they would want to test
their kids under the age of 18

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:21.880
for some very common,
adult-onset disorders.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.140
Things like diabetes,
like skin cancer,

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.840
like high cholesterol
or high blood pressure.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.810
And the parents pretty much
uniformly, across the board,

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:31.751
said, Yeah.

00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:32.250
Totally.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.870
Bring it on.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.860
We're going-- this is
going to be amazing.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.960
We're going to get the
clean bill of health.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.240
We're going to feel like
our kids are super healthy.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.050
And we'll move on.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.400
So what they didn't realize
was that these mutations

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.512
are so common that, on average,
each kid would have about nine.

00:04:49.512 --> 00:04:51.720
Now not to say they would
definitely get the disease,

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.140
but they were at increased
risk for developing

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.160
this disease later on.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.190
So what was striking to me is
that people did not understand

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.680
the connection between
genes, heredity, disease,

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.770
increased risk.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.740
So they were doing this
testing because they

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.290
thought they would just
roll things out and feel

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.280
really good.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.110
And instead, what
they were going to do

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.850
is find information that was
not particularly definitive

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.440
but kind of raised
more questions.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.900
And in some cases, it could
actually raise more anxiety.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.870
So that made me realize that
genes are not black and white.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.420
That, in some cases, they're
suggestions about what

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.920
will happen down the road.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.960
And in some cases,
they're certainty.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.710
But it's really-- it's
not very cut and dried.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.870
And so there's this
misconception really

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.840
that genes are destiny.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.820
But in truth, it's really
just part of the puzzle.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:56.100
So I was so interested
in these findings,

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.380
that genes are not always
destiny, that you really

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.620
can't know, that I decided
to look into it more.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.810
So this multi-dimensional aspect
of DNA, of genes, of heredity,

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.630
led me to pitch a story
to my editor at Time

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.050
about the implications of
sequencing children's genomes,

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.660
of reading their
entire genetic code.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.576
And about getting all this data,
all of these huge quantities

00:06:19.576 --> 00:06:21.450
of information about
your kids, some of which

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.945
will be deterministic, others--

00:06:24.945 --> 00:06:26.934
some of the information
won't really--

00:06:26.934 --> 00:06:28.600
we won't even really
know what it means.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.150
And is that a good idea?

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:35.070
So it ended up being a series,
a week-long online series.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.740
And then that morphed into a
cover story, the last cover

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.430
story of 2012, which you
see up on the screen.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.060
And you know, when you spend a
ton of time on a big project,

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.340
you're either--

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.450
you never want to hear
another word about it.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.070
Or you're even more intrigued.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.190
So for me it was
the latter, and I

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.730
decided to go ahead and write a
book about this world in which

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.930
we have more access than ever
to cutting-edge technology,

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.410
to peer inside our
genomes, and to emerge

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:08.700
with a snapshot of disease,
both potential and actual.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.770
And I wanted to
do this by telling

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.240
the stories of real people.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.410
So speaking of stories of
real people, you may know,

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:19.650
recognize this guy up
there on the screen.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:28.290
So several years ago, Sergey
Brin did a 23andMe gene panel.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:34.320
And he learned that he has got
a pretty rare genetic mutation

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.160
that predisposes him
to develop Parkinson's.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.960
So I looked up his blog from
when he got his test results,

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:48.150
and he says that when he had
done the genetic testing,

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:52.260
he "viewed it mostly
as entertainment."

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.930
And yet what happened
is he ended up

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:58.440
finding this gene mutation
that actually means

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:04.050
he has a significantly elevated
risk of developing Parkinson's

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.040
disease.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:09.360
Now some people in his situation
might feel very freaked out

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.020
about that, depending on
what their impressions are

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.540
and what their relationship
is with data, especially

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.370
personal genetic data.

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:23.010
But Sergey, on the other hand,
he said this in his blog.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:25.770
He said, "I feel fortunate
to be in this position.

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:28.080
Until the fountain of youth
is discovered, all of us

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.480
will have some conditions
in our old age,

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.549
only we don't know
what they will be.

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:34.559
I have a better guess
than almost anyone else

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:36.600
for what ills may
be mine, and have

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.520
decades to prepare for it."

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:44.159
So that made me think back to
that study that originally set

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:46.290
me off on this entire journey.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:49.590
And it's really interesting
what Sergey says,

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.680
because he is then-- he actually
goes on in his blog to give

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:57.360
specific example of how he might
change his life due to learning

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.880
about this genetic mutation
and the predisposition

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:00.930
to Parkinson's.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.790
So there is some
research showing

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.390
that exercise may be protective
against the development of /

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:11.310
so I can only imagine that
he has the common gym rat.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:16.110
He can also direct his money
to help support research Into

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:19.260
causes of Parkinson's,
treatments for Parkinson's.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:23.730
So I think that his experience
is really illustrative of how

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.450
genetic data, even if
it is not a certainty,

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:30.570
really allows you to take
control of your life.

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:34.540
This is Gracie.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.220
She has Down syndrome.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:39.710
I'll tell you a little bit
more about Gracie in a second.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:44.170
One way that all this access to
new genetic technology and data

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:46.720
is really changing
our world is that it's

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.210
redefining the holy
grail concept of what

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:52.190
it means to be or to
have a healthy baby.

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:55.180
So when you get pregnant,
oftentimes if you ask people,

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.410
oh, are you having
a girl or a boy?

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:00.580
They-- sometimes they
have a preference.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.690
But sometimes they'll
just say, I don't care.

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:04.190
I just want a healthy baby.

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.610
So what exactly
is a healthy baby.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.230
We have this
constantly expanding

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:11.890
array of genetic technologies
that offer insight prenatally

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:13.370
into a baby's health.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:16.150
But what does it
mean to be healthy?

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.550
For example, a
child, a baby born

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:21.100
with Down syndrome,
about half of the time

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.830
they have heart defects
that need surgical repair.

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:26.150
But about half the
time, they don't.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:28.150
And they can just go
home from the hospital.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:32.680
So is a baby with Down
syndrome a healthy baby?

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.200
Up for debate.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:38.950
So you know, when I
was born, my mom didn't

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:40.330
know if I had Down syndrome.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.310
She didn't even know
what gender I was.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.440
And today, already in
the first trimester,

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.570
there are blood tests
that can detect down

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:49.840
syndrome in a noninvasive way.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:55.750
Which is really reshaping a lot
of the debate around disability

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.420
and the perception of
who should and should not

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.730
be born in our society.

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:02.020
So back to Gracie.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:05.800
She is in Boston, who lives
in Boston, right outside.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.710
And she likes lip
syncing to Taylor Swift.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:14.080
I visited her two
years ago, and she lip

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.690
synced Macklemore's
"Thrift Shop" for me.

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:18.130
She is funny.

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:20.710
She is a diligent learner.

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:22.660
She is doing really
well in school,

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:26.350
thanks to her mom's advocacy,
so she's in inclusion classes.

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.810
And she's also really
charmingly irreverent.

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:30.880
One of the funniest
stories in the book

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.500
is Gracie's mom telling me about
Gracie's trip to the dentist.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:40.000
So Gracie-- the dentist
was trying to butter her up

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.870
and said to Gracie,
oh, you're so cute.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:45.670
Can you open your mouth for me?

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:49.930
And Gracie responded, get
away from me, you word

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:52.934
that rhymes with witch.

00:11:52.934 --> 00:11:55.240
So a friend of
Gracie's mom joked

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.850
that Gracie was really just
saying what everyone else is

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.090
thinking anyway.

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:04.300
So there's new research to
improve the lives of people

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.800
who have Down syndrome.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.760
There's research into silencing
the extra copy, the extra copy

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:13.150
of the 21st chromosome that
characterizes this condition.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:16.090
There's research into drugs
that can be taken prenatally

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:19.180
by a pregnant mom or drugs
that can be taken after birth

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.350
by a child with Down syndrome.

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:23.380
And as you might
imagine, some parents

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.480
are really excited about
this, and some parents

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.250
are super conflicted.

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:33.550
And for Melanie, Gracie's mom,
you know, like any parent--

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:36.540
how many of you have kids?

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:40.380
OK, so-- and even for those
of you who don't have kids,

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:43.230
you can imagine-- think
back to your parents.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:46.150
Everyone always wants
the best for their child.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.290
They want their child to have
every single opportunity.

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:51.570
Yet that really
raises the question

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:55.020
of what does it mean to
have every opportunity.

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:57.600
Are drugs actually
changing the essence

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:02.920
of the child versus helping
them to achieve their potential?

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.280
So let's do a quick poll.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.990
I'm going to ask you if it's
good, bad, or inconsequential

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:13.800
to have a baby who is born
blind or missing a limb

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.830
or with some sort of
intellectual disability.

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:20.650
Raise your hand if you
think that's a good thing.

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:23.840
What about bad?

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:24.800
Inconsequential?

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.110
Doesn't matter at all?

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:29.250
So that's pretty standard.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:32.510
I've never had anyone
say it's a good thing.

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:35.960
Most people say
it's a bad thing.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:39.470
And usually a couple of people
say it's inconsequential,

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:42.200
it doesn't really matter
one way or another.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:47.390
And I interview a professor
of law in the book who--

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:52.160
he researches eugenics, which
is the practice of trying

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.830
to build a superior race.

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:58.680
And that is now out of
favor in this country.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:03.350
It reached its height
during the Nazi era,

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:05.000
but it did go on in
the United States

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.200
for many, many, many years.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.290
And this professor,
Paul Lombardo,

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:13.460
he posits that if he would
do a survey of most people

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:17.795
whom he considers compassionate
and not mean spirited,

00:14:17.795 --> 00:14:19.670
that most people would
say there are actually

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:22.730
some conditions the baby
should not be born with,

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:25.470
if there is a way to avoid it.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:27.470
I found really powerful.

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:30.570
Because, you know, we
as a society in general,

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:34.880
we think that we are open
minded, open hearted, and yet,

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.370
when it comes right
down to it, if you're

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:40.610
asked about disability,
and you have the option

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:45.950
to opt out of it,
most people say,

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:48.030
no, thanks, in that
sort of situation.

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:54.590
So I spoke with a mom whose
son has something called 22 Q

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:59.270
deletion, which is a condition
in which her son is missing

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:01.850
a small part of his
22nd chromosome.

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:05.000
And it's accompanied
by mild to moderate

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.440
intellectual disability.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.240
There can be heart defects.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.510
So this boy in particular
was doing amazingly well

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:13.100
when I interviewed his mom.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.690
He was in a
four-year university.

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:17.120
He was living three
hours away from home.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:22.040
And still, this mom was
terrified of the possibility

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:26.480
that her son would give
birth to a child like him.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:31.340
So every year when her son,
who was, I think around 20

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.910
at the time, would go for a
check up with his geneticist,

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:36.830
this mom would
beseech the geneticist

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:41.430
to say you have to tell him that
he has to use birth control.

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:44.960
So here you have this
mom who loves her son

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.940
and who is really proud
of his accomplishments

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:48.170
and his achievements.

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:52.400
But she's saying, oh, my god,
don't have a kid like you.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.865
So people with 22q have a 50
percent chance of passing that

00:15:55.865 --> 00:15:56.740
on to their children.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:02.180
And this mom is saying, please,
don't give me a grandchild--

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.520
don't give me a
grandchild like you.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:08.420
So you can imagine what kind
of delicate, ethical tightrope

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:11.810
that is to be perched on.

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:15.950
You can actually avoid
22q through something

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:19.140
called preimplantation
genetic diagnosis.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:21.980
This is a picture up
here of an embryo,

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:25.460
and a couple cells are being
siphoned out of the embryo.

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.620
The embryo is just a
few days old, probably

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.150
about five days old.

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:32.660
And then those
cells are analyzed

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.150
to determine whether
there is the presence

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:39.500
or absence of a particular
genetic mutation.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.950
And so the way that it is
currently used right now

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:49.280
is it's employed, in
most cases, to get rid

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.700
of very severe, often
fatal childhood diseases.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:56.750
Something like Tay-Sachs which
is often fatal before a child

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:58.500
would reach kindergarten.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.630
So you take these embryos--

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:02.210
so you're not-- it's very
different from something

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:03.170
like gene editing.

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:05.720
You probably have all heard
of something called CRISPR,

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.130
which is a way to edit genes.

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:09.800
So this is not editing genes.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:13.369
Instead, this is taking embryos,
looking at them, and saying,

00:17:13.369 --> 00:17:15.200
oh, that one has--

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.280
that one has Tay-Sachs.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.170
OK, let's discard
that, or let's throw

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:19.970
that-- let's put that aside.

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:21.800
And this one doesn't
have Tay-Sachs.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.770
Let's implant that one
into a woman's uterus.

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:27.387
So you are picking
and choosing, and you

00:17:27.387 --> 00:17:34.270
are selecting in favor of not
having a particular disease.

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:37.790
So what's different again,
going back to CRISPR?

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:40.610
CRISPR obviously raises
concerns of what-- you know,

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:42.980
in the media we talk
about designer babies.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.460
What does that really mean?

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:48.650
Well, the truth is that
we don't know currently

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:52.460
how to build a future
Google engineer

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:57.680
or manufacture the next Michael
Jordan or the next Yo-Yo Ma.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.360
And the reason is
because there is not

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:02.030
one single gene that
codes for a killer

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:10.010
jumpshot or amazing ability as
a cellist or as a programmer.

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:14.630
It's a confluence of influences
from your environment, where

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.940
you live, who your
parents are, your exposure

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:21.580
to all sorts of things,
plus your genetic makeup.

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:25.770
So PGD is often--

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:28.800
PGD, pre-implantation
genetic diagnosis--

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.170
is not as, as you
might imagine, it

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:36.300
is not as an ethically fraught
as something using CRISPR

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.720
technology, to edit
genes, to edit embryos.

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.840
And it's been used
for decades to avoid

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:46.110
transmitting these serious
diseases, such as Tay-Sachs,

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:47.250
that I mentioned.

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:52.230
But it's also now increasingly
being considered for diseases

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:55.880
that are not quite--diseases
that are not necessarily fatal.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.050
So most people in
this room probably

00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:01.360
know someone who's been
diagnosed with breast cancer.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.720
And you can select an
embryo that does not

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.260
have a breast cancer mutation.

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:09.240
So if that BRCA1
or BRCA2 mutation

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.300
runs in your family, or a whole
host of other breast cancer

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:15.790
mutations, BRCA1 and 2
are just the most common.

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:18.120
So if those run in
your family, and you

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.890
want to kind of stop
that train and say,

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:21.930
I don't want to transmit--

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:24.000
you know, this has
been hell in my family.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:24.930
My mom died.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.340
My aunt died.

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:29.460
I was diagnosed when
I was in my 20s.

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:32.370
And I don't want to pass
this legacy onto my child.

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:34.920
You can do your pre-implantation
genetic diagnosis

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.660
to have a child who
has not inherited

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:40.500
your genetic mutation.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:45.480
So that raises the question
of, are we playing God

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.860
by doing something like that?

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.350
You know, breast cancer is
very different from Tay-Sachs.

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:51.840
Having a genetic mutation
that predisposes you

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.550
to breast cancer just
means that you're

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:54.990
at increased risk for it.

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:56.460
It's like Sergey's Parkinson's.

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.510
He won't necessarily get it.

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:00.720
It means he's at
elevated risk for it.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.840
So knowing that someone,
knowing that an embryo

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.120
is at elevated
risk for a disease,

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.814
is it ethical to
not have that child?

00:20:09.814 --> 00:20:11.730
To not bring that child
into the world because

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:13.980
of a possibility
of a disease that

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:17.490
may develop decades
down the road?

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:19.990
Now let's change the scenario
even a little bit more.

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:21.850
Let's say you are
completely opposed

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:23.560
to doing something
like that, to using

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.570
pre-implantation
genetic diagnosis

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:29.850
and that data to weed
out certain embryos.

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:33.640
But let's say you have a breast
cancer mutation in your family.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:34.810
And you have a baby.

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:37.600
Do you then think that
you have the right to data

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.250
to know whether your
child has inherited

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:41.920
your genetic mutation?

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:45.642
So pediatric ethics
guidelines say, no, you don't.

00:20:45.642 --> 00:20:48.100
You don't have the right to
know-- you don't have the right

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.560
to test your child
under the age of 18

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.720
unless it's medically necessary.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.450
And something like knowing
about a risk for breast cancer

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:57.520
would not be considered
medically necessary

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.530
for a three-month old.

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:01.600
So I'm going to read
to you a little bit

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.200
from the book of, even something
like this, how complicated it

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.010
can be.

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:08.830
So the first little bit
I'm going to read to you

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:12.760
is from a doctor
named Mike Bamshad.

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:17.170
He is the head of pediatric
genetic medicine at you UW.

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:19.420
And he says, we are
recommending that parents

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:22.300
be left with the ambiguity
that their infant is

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.820
at higher risk for breast
cancer because they

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:26.800
have breast cancer
in their family

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:30.850
but were unwilling to test
the baby to know for sure.

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:32.680
He disagrees with
that, and he says,

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.759
if we're counseling
someone in clinic,

00:21:34.759 --> 00:21:36.550
and they're at high
risk for breast cancer,

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:38.950
and they have their
infant daughter with them,

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:43.180
why in the world we wait to
talk again until she's 18?

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:47.290
Why would we not test and
say, she's not a BRCA carrier,

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:48.490
or she is.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:50.360
And here's what you
should do about it.

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.870
We should use this
information, this data,

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:54.590
to improve health care.

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:57.700
And one of the clearest
ways to improve health care

00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:59.290
is to prevent disease.

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:00.940
It's very clear cut.

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:04.150
So I find that
incredibly persuasive.

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:06.700
And then I'm going
to read to you

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:10.270
a passage from a woman who
became my friend after I

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:11.180
interviewed her.

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:13.990
She was diagnosed with
breast cancer at age 32.

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:17.080
Her mom died when
she was very young.

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.740
And she has a BRCA mutation.

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:26.740
So this is Debbie, right after
she found out via ultrasound

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:28.850
that she was having a daughter

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:31.990
I came out saying, oh, my god,
what if she gets breast cancer?

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:34.540
Her husband, Evan,
did not understand.

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.580
He calls me doom and gloom.

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:40.600
But I said, I'm going to die
if she gets breast cancer.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.400
Debbie was determined
to find a way

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.220
to test her daughter,
Jordan, but her husband

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.050
was adamantly opposed.

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:48.790
And now she agrees with him.

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:51.490
I don't think it's fair for
us to have that information

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:53.410
and have that
heaviness in our family

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:55.570
or in how we relate to Jordan.

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:58.870
I think knowing whether
Jordan is positive or negative

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:01.330
would also cause a lot
of tension and sadness

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:02.440
in our family.

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.310
When you think about
testing your child,

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:06.520
you have to think
of the ramifications

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:10.010
that it would have on
lots of family members.

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:14.650
So you can see two very
well-reasoned, yet extremely

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:16.570
different, perspectives
on the value

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:18.850
and the appropriateness
of information.

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:22.600
It's really super complicated.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:27.310
As the technology evolves,
these ethical dilemmas

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:30.640
are coming at us
fast and furious.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:31.990
I'm not a scientist.

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:34.090
I like to think of
myself as a humanist.

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:36.130
And I wrote this book
because I'm really

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:38.810
fascinated by these
questions of right or wrong.

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:39.640
And red lines.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.630
Are there red lines?

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:41.650
Are there are red lines?

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:42.670
Where are they?

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:44.080
Who decides?

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.930
And nowhere is this
more heated than when

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:49.630
it comes to making babies.

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:52.930
Again we have to just keep
asking ourselves the question,

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:56.230
and as Google Earth, I'm
sure you can appreciate that,

00:23:56.230 --> 00:24:02.280
Is there such a thing
as too much information?

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.360
So these are all
really big ideas.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.730
I don't give yes or
no answers, because I

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:08.860
don't believe there are none.

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:12.830
I think these decisions
are all extremely personal.

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:15.040
They're individual.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.750
And it really comes
down to choice

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:19.060
and what's right for
you and your comfort

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:22.640
with a great degree of
information and data.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:26.350
So if you're sick of small
talk at your next party,

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:28.810
you can try these
topics on for size.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:32.980
Do parents have a right to all
of their child's health data?

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.620
So some experts believe that
within a couple of years,

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.990
we're going to have our
genome in the cloud.

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:42.250
So if parents-- if
that does come to pass,

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:44.080
should parents know
everything there

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.080
is to know about a child's DNA?

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.970
And let's say that
there's a problem.

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:54.160
Would you love your kid
less or maybe even more?

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.250
Now back to that BRCA mutation.

00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:00.040
Say your newborn has
her genome sequenced,

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.806
and a BRCA mutation
is discovered.

00:25:02.806 --> 00:25:04.180
You know, a couple
minutes ago, I

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:07.420
told you that, well, pediatric
ethics guidelines say

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:09.490
that we don't test.

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:11.352
We don't test kids
under 18 for something

00:25:11.352 --> 00:25:13.060
that is not medically
necessary and needs

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:14.580
to be dealt with right now.

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:18.970
But it's really
likely that that baby

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:22.000
has inherited her
genetic mutation

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.980
from her mom or her dad.

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:26.660
And let's say those
parents don't know

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.600
that they have the mutation.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:33.850
So by telling them,
you then are enabling

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:36.850
them to take whatever measures
they feel are appropriate.

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:39.880
A mom could have a
prophylactic mastectomy.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:43.870
A dad could-- men obviously
get breast cancer as well.

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:46.216
They're also at greater
risk for prostate cancer.

00:25:46.216 --> 00:25:47.590
So you're just
basically enabling

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:50.710
them to be more empowered
regarding their own health.

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:54.070
And you know, it's
really complicated,

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:56.059
because you think
that you're not

00:25:56.059 --> 00:25:57.850
supposed to tell the
parents because you're

00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:00.190
sort of encroaching
upon the child,

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:03.130
you know, the child's right
of privacy and protecting

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:04.840
her own genetic data.

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:10.790
And yet, telling the parents
that the child has a mutation

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:14.150
could actually be
a way, clear way,

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:17.660
to do something really
amazing for that child

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:20.885
by potentially averting the
death of one of her parents.

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:30.110
So in short, it used to be
a lot easier to be pregnant.

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:34.130
As I said, my mom did not even
know if I was a boy or a girl

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:35.060
when I was born.

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:40.310
And today we have tons
and tons of genetic data.

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:44.800
We often-- I won't say
often, but regularly,

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.660
as the tests get
more sophisticated,

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:51.320
we'll find out information
that is completely unclear.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.330
And you have to
then decide, do you

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:55.640
proceed with this
pregnancy based on really

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:56.840
uncertain information?

00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:58.970
I spin the stories
of several families

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:00.990
who got really
disconcerting information,

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:04.430
like their baby was missing
a couple genes or some DNA

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:07.646
was duplicated, and what
exactly does that mean?

00:27:07.646 --> 00:27:09.020
And how do you
proceed with that?

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:10.460
In some of these
cases, the parents

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:12.501
learned that they actually
had the same deletions

00:27:12.501 --> 00:27:14.210
or genetic duplications.

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:15.970
And then, it's
pretty mind blowing.

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:19.370
You have to figure out how
to process all of that.

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:21.710
So I'm going to end with--

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:25.100
I'm going to end with
the best compliment

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:27.260
that I received about
this book, which

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:29.780
is going entail me
telling you a little bit

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:34.880
about the book-building process
and these impressive blurbs

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.320
that appear on the back.

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.690
I feel like Vanna White up here.

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:41.930
So you know, these blurbs
don't just appear there.

00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:44.810
It's not like someone goes into
a bookstore, reads my book,

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:47.990
and is just so incredibly moved
that they contact my publisher

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:50.000
and say, I've got to
write some words of praise

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.160
for the back of
that lady's jacket.

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:53.660
No.

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:59.510
Instead, it's this very arduous
process of reaching out to--

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:02.900
so I convened with my
editor, and we kind of

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:05.180
developed a list of
really influential people

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:08.060
who would be amazing to
blurb the back of the book.

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.250
And then it's this very
humiliating process

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:12.560
of reaching out via
email and basically

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.660
begging these people who
are already incredibly

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:18.410
busy to please read your book
and, if they're so inclined,

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:20.060
and if they like
it, maybe they'll

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:24.530
write a couple of pithy words
for you to stick on the jacket.

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:27.500
So one of these women,
Kelley Benham French,

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.230
had just written her own book,
a really beautiful memoir

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:32.930
about the birth of her
extremely premature daughter.

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:34.430
The book is called "Juniper."

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:39.230
And I had-- she had agreed to
receive a copy of the book.

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:43.640
And so I followed up for
the first time on October 26

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:48.185
by writing to her and saying,
Hey, just checking in.

00:28:48.185 --> 00:28:50.090
You know, trying to
remain all casual.

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:52.070
And she responded,
Just got the book

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:53.600
and haven't looked at it yet.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.560
But I'm looking forward to it.

00:28:55.560 --> 00:29:00.320
So I wrote back, Ugh, isn't this
blurb seeking just the worst.

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:03.110
I appreciate your making
the effort, Kelley.

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:05.090
And the next day,
she wrote back,

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:06.890
The whole book promotion thing.

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:09.410
Ugh, standing naked
on the street corner

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:11.010
would be more fun.

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:14.270
So I decided I was
going up the ante here.

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:16.910
More like standing naked
on the street corner

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:20.000
in subzero temps
in Times Square.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.690
That would only being
to capture the horror.

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:28.320
And then she went radio silent
on me after I bared my soul.

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:31.440
So I decided to check
in after a week.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.740
Hello, fellow naked
street corner dweller.

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:37.370
I'm gritting my teeth, and
oh, so casually checking in,

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:39.950
to see if you just might
be inclined to blurb

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:41.720
this book of mine.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.280
Time dragged by.

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.900
There was no word.

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:48.230
And then finally I
got an email from her.

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:49.100
10 words total.

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:56.630
This book doesn't suck.

00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:57.560
Thank god.

00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:59.390
That would have been awkward.

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:01.550
I laughed, and I
wrote back to her,

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:04.640
That is the blurb right there.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.280
This book doesn't suck.

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:09.260
And then she
responded, you can see,

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:11.850
we had a great email
correspondence going.

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:14.060
And she really
had the last word.

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:21.250
She wrote, Really, that's all
any of us can ever hope for.

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:24.040
So I find that--

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:25.680
it wasn't just about my book.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.190
That's really a universal truth.

00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:30.740
So I hope you enjoyed
hearing about the book.

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:32.510
And I hope you find
it interesting.

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:35.210
I hope it makes you think about
things that you hadn't really

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:36.600
considered before.

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:39.650
About science and babies
and how these two things

00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:43.050
intersect in ways both
marvelous and mysterious.

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:44.960
And thank you so
much for coming.

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:48.200
I'm happy to take any questions.

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:51.140
SPEAKER: Yeah, so I mean,
we can debate the ethics

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:53.019
and have a lot of
philosophical arguments.

00:30:53.019 --> 00:30:54.810
But at the end, either
technology will work

00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:56.150
or it won't, right?

00:30:56.150 --> 00:31:00.230
So you know, when little
Johnny goes to school,

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:02.960
if little Alice, who had
genetic modification,

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.460
is better than
him in everything,

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:08.510
then when Johnny has a brother
or sister, if the parents can

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:11.450
afford it, they're
going to do it, right?

00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:16.730
BONNIE ROCHMAN: Well, not
speaking for Johnny's parents,

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:22.070
but the important thing to
note is that currently, we

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:26.000
don't know how to make
so-called designer babies.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.411
In fact, in the book, I talk
about, well, in some ways,

00:31:28.411 --> 00:31:30.410
we're actually already
creating designer babies.

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:34.730
If anyone here has
had a child via IVF

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:39.650
or know someone who has,
and it's everywhere now.

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:42.200
Those babies could
actually technically

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.720
be considered designer babies.

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:46.460
So if you're
choosing donor sperm,

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:48.980
you go through this
entire checklist.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:53.150
You can learn where the
donor went to school.

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:54.860
What the donor's job is.

00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:56.870
What the donor's
personality is like.

00:31:56.870 --> 00:32:00.110
You can access baby pictures.

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:05.041
You know, it's basically like
this whole smorgasbord of trays

00:32:05.041 --> 00:32:05.540
there.

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:07.760
You know, the donor
has a quick temper.

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:09.560
The donor has an
amazing sense of humor.

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.450
And you can select
all these things.

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:15.770
But you know, I think it can
be argued that already we're

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:16.430
doing that.

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:18.770
And people who have--

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:20.660
who go through
assisted reproduction,

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:23.210
but if you're just having
sex the regular way,

00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:27.260
the way that we've done for
centuries, we just don't--

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:28.730
you can't.

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:30.320
It's luck of the draw.

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.900
And even if you then
apply technologies

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:34.970
through assisted
reproduction, we

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:38.180
don't know how to make
the next Einstein.

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:39.260
So it's a whole--

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:41.960
you know, it's kind of, if
someone could crack the code,

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:46.760
then I think that your question
would be a lot more valid.

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:49.070
But currently, we don't know.

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:51.650
There's not one-- there's
not the intelligence gene.

00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:54.560
And the
awesome-on-the-football-field,

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.270
you know, Seattle Seahawks gene.

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:59.630
So it's just not-- it's not
possible at this point in time.

00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:02.390
It's really focused more
on disease and elimination

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:03.969
of disease.

00:33:03.969 --> 00:33:06.010
SPEAKER: Well, thank you
very much for telling us

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:08.677
about your book
that doesn't suck.

00:33:08.677 --> 00:33:09.760
BONNIE ROCHMAN: Thank you.

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:12.210
[APPLAUSE]
