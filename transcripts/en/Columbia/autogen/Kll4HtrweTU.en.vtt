say just a few words about what what we
 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.410
say just a few words about what what we
are broadly trying to do in terms of

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420
are broadly trying to do in terms of
 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.860
are broadly trying to do in terms of
understanding how the research practices

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870
understanding how the research practices
 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.080
understanding how the research practices
of academics are changing and why we're

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090
of academics are changing and why we're
 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.640
of academics are changing and why we're
doing that and then I'll share findings

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650
doing that and then I'll share findings
 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.680
doing that and then I'll share findings
from two recent studies that have been

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690
from two recent studies that have been
 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.979

reshaping the ways that scholars on a
 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.869
reshaping the ways that scholars on a
day-to-day basis do their work and our

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879
day-to-day basis do their work and our
 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.789
day-to-day basis do their work and our
faculty survey has been tracking those

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799
faculty survey has been tracking those
 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.910
faculty survey has been tracking those
trends since since 2000 and since the

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920
trends since since 2000 and since the
 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.819
trends since since 2000 and since the
theme of the day today is trending I'd

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829
theme of the day today is trending I'd
 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.309
theme of the day today is trending I'd
like to just say that we've found a

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319
like to just say that we've found a
 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.589
like to just say that we've found a
number of really important trends over

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:14.599
number of really important trends over
 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:17.340
number of really important trends over
the last decade and more and when our

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350
the last decade and more and when our
 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.229
the last decade and more and when our
newest cycle of the faculty survey comes

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239
newest cycle of the faculty survey comes
 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.699
newest cycle of the faculty survey comes
out and just about a week and a half

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709
out and just about a week and a half
 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.040
out and just about a week and a half
from now I think that one of the things

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050
from now I think that one of the things
 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.100
from now I think that one of the things
that we're going to find is that in some

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110
that we're going to find is that in some
 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.320
that we're going to find is that in some
cases trend lines are inexorable

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330
cases trend lines are inexorable
 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.070
cases trend lines are inexorable
and that's sometimes an characteristic

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080
and that's sometimes an characteristic
 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.589
and that's sometimes an characteristic
of technologically driven change but

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:35.599
of technologically driven change but
 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:40.500
of technologically driven change but
sometimes it's the it's the quote from

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510
sometimes it's the it's the quote from
 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.080
sometimes it's the it's the quote from
from Warhol that we have to I'm sorry I

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090
from Warhol that we have to I'm sorry I
 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.580
from Warhol that we have to I'm sorry I
didn't write down the quote but I did

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590
didn't write down the quote but I did
 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:46.870
didn't write down the quote but I did
take a picture of it but I don't have it

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880
take a picture of it but I don't have it
 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.700
take a picture of it but I don't have it
in front of men because we have to we

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710
in front of men because we have to we
 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.510
in front of men because we have to we
actually have to read the responses or

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520
actually have to read the responses or
 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.430
actually have to read the responses or

but any number of other kinds of support

00:04:58.839 --> 00:04:58.849
but any number of other kinds of support
 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:00.670
but any number of other kinds of support
services take on it could be that in

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680
services take on it could be that in
 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.080
services take on it could be that in
some cases trend lines are not

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090
some cases trend lines are not
 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.820
some cases trend lines are not
inexorable and that there are

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830
inexorable and that there are
 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.890
inexorable and that there are
opportunities to impact things and so

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900
opportunities to impact things and so
 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.450
opportunities to impact things and so
there's both of those kinds of trends

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460
there's both of those kinds of trends
 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.540
there's both of those kinds of trends
and I want to be really mindful that

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550
and I want to be really mindful that
 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.129
and I want to be really mindful that
that we're seeing both of those kinds of

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139
that we're seeing both of those kinds of
 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.040
that we're seeing both of those kinds of
things and and also shamelessly pleased

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050

the faculty survey will be out in a week
 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:18.490
the faculty survey will be out in a week
and a half and I hope you'll take a look

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500
and a half and I hope you'll take a look
 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.890
and a half and I hope you'll take a look
at it when it comes out but um but but I

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900
at it when it comes out but um but but I
 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.260
at it when it comes out but um but but I
think the essential point that I want to

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270
think the essential point that I want to
 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.070
think the essential point that I want to
try to dry out here is is that is this

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080
try to dry out here is is that is this
 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.070
try to dry out here is is that is this

idea of of what Malcolm is saying about
 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.800
idea of of what Malcolm is saying about
rapid prototyping and smart failure and

example would like researchers to be
doing but to recognize that in fact the

be at the heart of that kind of design
 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.820
be at the heart of that kind of design
thinking and that's that's essentially

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830
thinking and that's that's essentially

what what this set of projects are are

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990
what what this set of projects are are
 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.860
what what this set of projects are are
all about so um these are a series of

scholar centric which means that we're

00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:11.379
scholar centric which means that we're
 

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:12.540
scholar centric which means that we're
not as we're not paying as much

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550
not as we're not paying as much
 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.790
not as we're not paying as much
attention to what would the library like

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800
attention to what would the library like
 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.350
attention to what would the library like
to do as we're paying attention to what

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360
to do as we're paying attention to what
 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.510
to do as we're paying attention to what
do the scholars say they are doing and

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520
do the scholars say they are doing and
 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.820
do the scholars say they are doing and
indicate there they need a scholar

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830
indicate there they need a scholar
 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.100
indicate there they need a scholar
centric field specific approach so

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110
centric field specific approach so
 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.170
centric field specific approach so
that's discipline specific where in some

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180
that's discipline specific where in some
 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.300
that's discipline specific where in some
cases could be interdisciplinary field

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310
cases could be interdisciplinary field
 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.399
cases could be interdisciplinary field
specific approach which which we think

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:29.409
specific approach which which we think
 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:33.390
specific approach which which we think
alongside many other inputs and one of

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:33.400
alongside many other inputs and one of
 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.760
alongside many other inputs and one of
them is how's the university changing at

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:35.770
them is how's the university changing at
 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.620
them is how's the university changing at
a broad strategic level and I think

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:37.630
a broad strategic level and I think
 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.459
a broad strategic level and I think
Malcolm gave us a lot of really

00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:40.469
Malcolm gave us a lot of really
 

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:43.110
Malcolm gave us a lot of really
compelling arguments about how some of

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120
compelling arguments about how some of
 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.809
compelling arguments about how some of
those broader institutional strategic

00:06:45.809 --> 00:06:45.819
those broader institutional strategic
 

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:47.370
those broader institutional strategic
changes are happening so I think we have

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.380
changes are happening so I think we have
 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.520
changes are happening so I think we have
to read those two factors together can

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:50.530
to read those two factors together can
 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:52.800
to read those two factors together can
can be used to help libraries develop

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:52.810
can be used to help libraries develop
 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.719
can be used to help libraries develop
new services so that's that's the

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:54.729
new services so that's that's the
 

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:56.820
new services so that's that's the

actually it's actually producing more
 

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.940
actually it's actually producing more
and more anxiety and so the more that

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:13.950
and more anxiety and so the more that
 

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:16.640

they don't know and so that's that's a

they don't know and so that's that's a
 

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:39.920
they don't know and so that's that's a

00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480
challenges for the way that archivists

challenges for the way that archivists
provide their services right so these

you know there's no opportunity now for
 

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:07.590
you know there's no opportunity now for
us there's less and less opportunity now

us there's less and less opportunity now

looked at this morning was really

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:17.140
looked at this morning was really
 

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:18.180
looked at this morning was really
interesting so I think I'll get a

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:18.190
interesting so I think I'll get a
 

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:19.380
interesting so I think I'll get a
different record group that I was

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:19.390
different record group that I was
 

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:21.660
different record group that I was
looking at earlier because that takes me

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:21.670
looking at earlier because that takes me
 

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.250
looking at earlier because that takes me
in a slightly different direction the

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:23.260
in a slightly different direction the
 

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.300
in a slightly different direction the
I don't know if that's exactly

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:24.310
I don't know if that's exactly
 

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:26.699
I don't know if that's exactly
serendipity but that that that kind of

00:13:26.699 --> 00:13:26.709
serendipity but that that that kind of
 

00:13:26.709 --> 00:13:29.190
serendipity but that that that kind of
experience isn't happening as much so it

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:29.200
experience isn't happening as much so it
 

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.810
experience isn't happening as much so it
puts more of a burden on being able to

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:30.820
puts more of a burden on being able to
 

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:32.460
puts more of a burden on being able to
discover as much as you possibly can

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:32.470
discover as much as you possibly can
 

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:34.740
discover as much as you possibly can
before you've even gotten to the

before you've even gotten to the
 

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:36.510
before you've even gotten to the
archives to figure out exactly what do I

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:36.520
archives to figure out exactly what do I
 

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.810

know how does discovery happen and how

00:13:43.949 --> 00:13:43.959
know how does discovery happen and how
 

00:13:43.959 --> 00:13:45.870
know how does discovery happen and how
does analysis happen when can I consult

does analysis happen when can I consult
 

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.220
does analysis happen when can I consult

the way could be really really useful

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:01.990
the way could be really really useful
 

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:04.170
the way could be really really useful
for discovery purposes couldn't they I

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:10.950
and this is the best way he could come
 

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:13.580
and this is the best way he could come

over his material and organize his
 

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:19.520
over his material and organize his

opportunity to rethink services I don't

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:22.950
opportunity to rethink services I don't
 

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:25.610
opportunity to rethink services I don't
really know what is I mean this I do in

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:25.620
really know what is I mean this I do in
 

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.500
really know what is I mean this I do in
the one hand maybe this is as good as it

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:27.510
the one hand maybe this is as good as it
 

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.600
the one hand maybe this is as good as it
gets maybe you know this maybe this is

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:29.610
gets maybe you know this maybe this is
 

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:32.810
gets maybe you know this maybe this is
the optimal technology for organizing

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:32.820
the optimal technology for organizing
 

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:38.400
the optimal technology for organizing
one's thoughts into a long narrative

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:38.410
 

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:40.600
okay so one of the things that really

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:40.610
okay so one of the things that really
 

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.269
okay so one of the things that really
came out is graduate student training is

00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:43.279
came out is graduate student training is
 

00:15:43.279 --> 00:15:47.079
came out is graduate student training is

field in particular in terms of how
 

00:15:49.519 --> 00:15:52.660
field in particular in terms of how
graduate students learn about research

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:52.670
graduate students learn about research
 

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:55.929
graduate students learn about research
methods and practices so that picture

00:15:55.929 --> 00:15:55.939
methods and practices so that picture
 

00:15:55.939 --> 00:16:00.040
methods and practices so that picture
before that that is how most students

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:00.050
before that that is how most students
 

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:02.889
before that that is how most students
are being taught how to write a book now

00:16:02.889 --> 00:16:02.899
are being taught how to write a book now
 

00:16:02.899 --> 00:16:04.269
are being taught how to write a book now
maybe again maybe that's the best way to

00:16:04.269 --> 00:16:04.279
maybe again maybe that's the best way to
 

00:16:04.279 --> 00:16:05.319
maybe again maybe that's the best way to
write the book and maybe that's how they

00:16:05.319 --> 00:16:05.329
write the book and maybe that's how they
 

00:16:05.329 --> 00:16:07.449
write the book and maybe that's how they
should be taught but but in fact what's

00:16:07.449 --> 00:16:07.459
should be taught but but in fact what's
 

00:16:07.459 --> 00:16:08.559
should be taught but but in fact what's
really happening is that they're not

00:16:08.559 --> 00:16:08.569
really happening is that they're not
 

00:16:08.569 --> 00:16:11.049
really happening is that they're not
really being taught it at all they're

00:16:11.049 --> 00:16:11.059
really being taught it at all they're
 

00:16:11.059 --> 00:16:13.059
really being taught it at all they're
just kind of learning by osmosis because

00:16:13.059 --> 00:16:13.069
just kind of learning by osmosis because
 

00:16:13.069 --> 00:16:15.699
just kind of learning by osmosis because
there aren't as many methods courses as

00:16:15.699 --> 00:16:15.709
there aren't as many methods courses as
 

00:16:15.709 --> 00:16:17.199
there aren't as many methods courses as
we understand they're once worth and

00:16:17.199 --> 00:16:17.209
we understand they're once worth and
 

00:16:17.209 --> 00:16:19.929
we understand they're once worth and
there certainly aren't courses in the

00:16:19.929 --> 00:16:19.939
there certainly aren't courses in the
 

00:16:19.939 --> 00:16:22.569
there certainly aren't courses in the
mechanics of how to do one's research

00:16:22.569 --> 00:16:22.579

the research practices that I've been

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:24.290
the research practices that I've been
 

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:26.470
the research practices that I've been
referring to over the over the past 10

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:26.480
referring to over the over the past 10
 

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:31.150
referring to over the over the past 10
minutes or so so this is any number of

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:31.160
minutes or so so this is any number of
 

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.519
minutes or so so this is any number of
different service models that this might

00:16:33.519 --> 00:16:33.529
different service models that this might
 

00:16:33.529 --> 00:16:35.739
different service models that this might
suggest I'll just I'll just bank through

00:16:35.739 --> 00:16:35.749
suggest I'll just I'll just bank through
 

00:16:35.749 --> 00:16:37.480
suggest I'll just I'll just bank through
these really quickly I want to point out

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:37.490
these really quickly I want to point out
 

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:40.119
these really quickly I want to point out
that we we've largely tried not to focus

00:16:40.119 --> 00:16:40.129
that we we've largely tried not to focus
 

00:16:40.129 --> 00:16:42.369
that we we've largely tried not to focus
these in this presentation anyway I've

00:16:42.369 --> 00:16:42.379
these in this presentation anyway I've
 

00:16:42.379 --> 00:16:43.780
these in this presentation anyway I've
tried not to focus these around

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:43.790
tried not to focus these around
 

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:45.819
tried not to focus these around
what should the library do what should

00:16:45.819 --> 00:16:45.829
what should the library do what should
 

00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:48.039
what should the library do what should
the archives do there are services here

00:16:48.039 --> 00:16:48.049
the archives do there are services here
 

00:16:48.049 --> 00:16:50.139
the archives do there are services here
that are up for grabs if the library

00:16:50.139 --> 00:16:50.149
that are up for grabs if the library
 

00:16:50.149 --> 00:16:52.600
that are up for grabs if the library
wants to want to try to offer some of

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:52.610
wants to want to try to offer some of
 

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:55.629
wants to want to try to offer some of
these services maybe it could if the

00:16:55.629 --> 00:16:55.639
these services maybe it could if the
 

00:16:55.639 --> 00:16:57.609
these services maybe it could if the
American Historical Association wanted

00:16:57.609 --> 00:16:57.619
American Historical Association wanted
 

00:16:57.619 --> 00:16:59.139
American Historical Association wanted
to offer some of these services it

00:16:59.139 --> 00:16:59.149
to offer some of these services it
 

00:16:59.149 --> 00:17:01.030
to offer some of these services it
possibly could and I think that what

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040
possibly could and I think that what
 

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.230
possibly could and I think that what
we're seeing is that when we take a

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:02.240
we're seeing is that when we take a
 

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.789
we're seeing is that when we take a
scholar centric perspective and you'll

00:17:03.789 --> 00:17:03.799
scholar centric perspective and you'll
 

00:17:03.799 --> 00:17:07.120
scholar centric perspective and you'll
see this again with the chemists it's

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:07.130
see this again with the chemists it's
 

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:09.909
see this again with the chemists it's
not always clear who owns what

00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919
not always clear who owns what
 

00:17:09.919 --> 00:17:12.970
not always clear who owns what
responsibility it's not bounded by

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:12.980
responsibility it's not bounded by
 

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:15.250
responsibility it's not bounded by
traditional organizational models or in

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:15.260
traditional organizational models or in
 

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.669
traditional organizational models or in
structures so so some of these things

00:17:18.669 --> 00:17:18.679
structures so so some of these things
 

00:17:18.679 --> 00:17:19.870
structures so so some of these things
are maybe a little more straightforward

00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:19.880
are maybe a little more straightforward
 

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.319
are maybe a little more straightforward

people who have collections probably are

people who have collections probably are

people who have collections probably are
principally responsible for those kinds

principally responsible for those kinds
 

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:27.909

of things but how to make them

scholars I think that's probably
 

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.380

happening in science libraries in the US

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:46.390
happening in science libraries in the US
 

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:49.380

in the US but imagine if you could do

in the US but imagine if you could do
 

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.700

note I'm not saying more open and and
 

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:37.900
note I'm not saying more open and and
maybe open is the solution to it I'm

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:37.910
maybe open is the solution to it I'm
 

00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:39.940
maybe open is the solution to it I'm
saying more impactful because that's the

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:39.950
saying more impactful because that's the
 

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:42.440
saying more impactful because that's the
metric that's being measured

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:42.450
metric that's being measured

if if you could say to chemists I can

00:26:46.129 --> 00:26:46.139
if if you could say to chemists I can
 

00:26:46.139 --> 00:26:48.469
if if you could say to chemists I can
help you be more impactful and therefore

00:26:48.469 --> 00:26:48.479
help you be more impactful and therefore
 

00:26:48.479 --> 00:26:50.930
help you be more impactful and therefore
you will get more funding that would be

00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:50.940
you will get more funding that would be
 

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:53.989
you will get more funding that would be
a really powerful service that that at

00:26:53.989 --> 00:26:53.999
a really powerful service that that at
 

00:26:53.999 --> 00:26:55.609
a really powerful service that that at
least in the UK would matter quite a bit

00:26:55.609 --> 00:26:55.619
least in the UK would matter quite a bit
 

00:26:55.619 --> 00:26:58.369
least in the UK would matter quite a bit
and I kind of suspect it could matter in

00:26:58.369 --> 00:26:58.379
and I kind of suspect it could matter in
 

00:26:58.379 --> 00:27:01.239
and I kind of suspect it could matter in
the US but maybe not quite as directly

00:27:01.239 --> 00:27:01.249
the US but maybe not quite as directly
 

00:27:01.249 --> 00:27:04.009
the US but maybe not quite as directly
so the three sets of service

00:27:04.009 --> 00:27:04.019
so the three sets of service
 

00:27:04.019 --> 00:27:06.349
so the three sets of service
recommendations that we that that came

00:27:06.349 --> 00:27:06.359
recommendations that we that that came
 

00:27:06.359 --> 00:27:08.749
recommendations that we that that came
out of the chemistry project and these

00:27:08.749 --> 00:27:08.759
out of the chemistry project and these
 

00:27:08.759 --> 00:27:11.210
out of the chemistry project and these
are even less tied to the library and

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:11.220
are even less tied to the library and
 

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:13.999
are even less tied to the library and
for the librarians here today you may

00:27:13.999 --> 00:27:14.009
for the librarians here today you may
 

00:27:14.009 --> 00:27:16.820
for the librarians here today you may
say I don't see my library here too much

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:16.830
say I don't see my library here too much
 

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:20.570

and that's everything from managing

and that's everything from managing
 

00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:22.670

some of those things you might imagine

some of those things you might imagine
 

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:29.240
some of those things you might imagine
being within the purview of the library

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:29.250
being within the purview of the library
 

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:30.800
being within the purview of the library
some of these things you might say are

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:30.810
some of these things you might say are
 

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:32.900
some of these things you might say are
well outside the purview of the library

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:32.910
well outside the purview of the library
 

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:36.080
well outside the purview of the library
but the way that the library might hope

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:36.090
but the way that the library might hope
 

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:39.710
but the way that the library might hope
to play a really useful role in the

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:39.720
to play a really useful role in the
 

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:43.430
to play a really useful role in the
process of the chemistry scholar is to

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440
process of the chemistry scholar is to
 

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.570
process of the chemistry scholar is to
figure out a way how to get integrated

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:44.580
figure out a way how to get integrated
 

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:47.120
figure out a way how to get integrated
into all of those things and and I guess

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:47.130
into all of those things and and I guess
 

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:50.210
into all of those things and and I guess
this strikes me as one one really great

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:50.220
this strikes me as one one really great
 

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:52.640
this strikes me as one one really great

you know oh well we're the library so

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:54.840
you know oh well we're the library so
 

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:56.900
you know oh well we're the library so
we're going to do this if you want to

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:56.910
we're going to do this if you want to
 

00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:58.910
we're going to do this if you want to
support chemists that's just not going

00:29:58.910 --> 00:29:58.920
support chemists that's just not going
 

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.230
support chemists that's just not going
to work there's gonna have to be all

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:00.240

kinds of collaborations with different

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:02.070
kinds of collaborations with different
 

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:04.820
kinds of collaborations with different
kinds of service providers to get into

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:04.830
kinds of service providers to get into
 

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:06.890
kinds of service providers to get into
the chemistry laboratory in a way that

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:06.900
the chemistry laboratory in a way that
 

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.930
the chemistry laboratory in a way that
makes sense to the chemist and not in a

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:08.940
makes sense to the chemist and not in a
 

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.430
makes sense to the chemist and not in a
way that makes sense to the librarian

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:10.440
way that makes sense to the librarian
 

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:12.680
way that makes sense to the librarian
and that's that's a key a key dynamic

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:12.690
and that's that's a key a key dynamic
 

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:16.300
and that's that's a key a key dynamic
that that I personally think his is is a

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:16.310
that that I personally think his is is a
 

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:19.160
that that I personally think his is is a
probably a barrier really to to engaging

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:19.170
probably a barrier really to to engaging
 

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:21.440
probably a barrier really to to engaging
really deeply with the sciences and and

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:21.450
really deeply with the sciences and and
 

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:24.290
really deeply with the sciences and and
if extent that research libraries want

00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:24.300
if extent that research libraries want
 

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:26.840
if extent that research libraries want
to be more and more and more than the

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:26.850
to be more and more and more than the
 

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:28.430
to be more and more and more than the
purchasing agent I think is a barrier

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:28.440
purchasing agent I think is a barrier
 

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.620
purchasing agent I think is a barrier
that needs to be overcome and then

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:30.630
that needs to be overcome and then
 

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:32.210
that needs to be overcome and then
finally I mentioned before some of the

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:32.220
finally I mentioned before some of the
 

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:34.370
finally I mentioned before some of the
research dissemination activities that

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:34.380
research dissemination activities that
 

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.650
research dissemination activities that
that we saw chemists really benefiting

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:36.660
that we saw chemists really benefiting
 

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:39.200
that we saw chemists really benefiting
from in terms of in terms of the kinds

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:39.210
from in terms of in terms of the kinds
 

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:41.840
from in terms of in terms of the kinds
of of impact that they're trying to that

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:41.850
of of impact that they're trying to that
 

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:46.610
of of impact that they're trying to that
they're trying to maximize so those are

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:46.620
they're trying to maximize so those are
 

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:50.060
they're trying to maximize so those are
two really different disciplines and and

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:50.070
two really different disciplines and and
 

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:52.850
two really different disciplines and and
and I think that I think that you can

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:52.860
and I think that I think that you can
 

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:55.160
and I think that I think that you can
see at the very beginning of you know

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:55.170
see at the very beginning of you know
 

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:57.140
see at the very beginning of you know
some of those services may be very

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:57.150
some of those services may be very
 

00:30:57.150 --> 00:30:59.480
some of those services may be very
deeply discipline specific some of them

00:30:59.480 --> 00:30:59.490
deeply discipline specific some of them
 

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:02.000
deeply discipline specific some of them
may be more evocative of what humanists

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:02.010
may be more evocative of what humanists
 

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:02.889
may be more evocative of what humanists
need and what

00:31:02.889 --> 00:31:02.899
need and what
 

00:31:02.899 --> 00:31:04.599
need and what
to seed and you know we're really

00:31:04.599 --> 00:31:04.609
to seed and you know we're really
 

00:31:04.609 --> 00:31:06.129
to seed and you know we're really
looking forward as we do more of these

00:31:06.129 --> 00:31:06.139
looking forward as we do more of these
 

00:31:06.139 --> 00:31:08.349
looking forward as we do more of these

much of of this is generalizable how

much of of this is generalizable how
 

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:12.989
much of of this is generalizable how
much of this is very discipline specific

00:31:12.989 --> 00:31:12.999
much of this is very discipline specific
 

00:31:12.999 --> 00:31:15.070
much of this is very discipline specific
to the extent that something is

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:15.080
to the extent that something is
 

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.919
to the extent that something is
generalizable it might be something that

00:31:17.919 --> 00:31:17.929
generalizable it might be something that
 

00:31:17.929 --> 00:31:19.839
generalizable it might be something that
can there might be services that can be

00:31:19.839 --> 00:31:19.849
can there might be services that can be
 

00:31:19.849 --> 00:31:22.359
can there might be services that can be
offered at the campus level very easily

00:31:22.359 --> 00:31:22.369
offered at the campus level very easily
 

00:31:22.369 --> 00:31:25.060
offered at the campus level very easily
to extend the service requirements are

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:25.070
to extend the service requirements are
 

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:26.919
to extend the service requirements are
deeply discipline specific or even

00:31:26.919 --> 00:31:26.929
deeply discipline specific or even
 

00:31:26.929 --> 00:31:29.649
deeply discipline specific or even
subfield specific I think that's even

00:31:29.649 --> 00:31:29.659
subfield specific I think that's even
 

00:31:29.659 --> 00:31:31.029
subfield specific I think that's even
going to challenge whether they can be

00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.039
going to challenge whether they can be
 

00:31:31.039 --> 00:31:31.599
going to challenge whether they can be
offered

00:31:31.599 --> 00:31:31.609

strictly speaking at the campus level or

and even broader collaborations like
 

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:42.459
and even broader collaborations like
that maybe a more significant locus of

that maybe a more significant locus of

so I thought I would just leave leave

00:31:46.149 --> 00:31:46.159
so I thought I would just leave leave
 

00:31:46.159 --> 00:31:48.759
so I thought I would just leave leave
leave us with a couple of questions just

00:31:48.759 --> 00:31:48.769
leave us with a couple of questions just
 

00:31:48.769 --> 00:31:50.349
leave us with a couple of questions just
just to kind of spark some discussion

00:31:50.349 --> 00:31:50.359
just to kind of spark some discussion
 

00:31:50.359 --> 00:31:52.389
just to kind of spark some discussion
and I'll be happy to answer any if

00:31:52.389 --> 00:31:52.399
and I'll be happy to answer any if
 

00:31:52.399 --> 00:31:53.529
and I'll be happy to answer any if
there's time be happy to answer any

00:31:53.529 --> 00:31:53.539
there's time be happy to answer any
 

00:31:53.539 --> 00:31:55.450
there's time be happy to answer any
question or have discussion about any of

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:55.460
question or have discussion about any of
 

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:57.519
question or have discussion about any of
these issues but you know I think that

00:31:57.519 --> 00:31:57.529
these issues but you know I think that
 

00:31:57.529 --> 00:31:59.499
these issues but you know I think that
this question about expertise to

00:31:59.499 --> 00:31:59.509
this question about expertise to
 

00:31:59.509 --> 00:32:02.619
this question about expertise to
historians is really vexing and and at

00:32:02.619 --> 00:32:02.629
historians is really vexing and and at
 

00:32:02.629 --> 00:32:04.509
historians is really vexing and and at
least it's vexing for me when I think of

00:32:04.509 --> 00:32:04.519
least it's vexing for me when I think of
 

00:32:04.519 --> 00:32:06.369
least it's vexing for me when I think of
a subject specialist as someone who has

00:32:06.369 --> 00:32:06.379
a subject specialist as someone who has
 

00:32:06.379 --> 00:32:09.009
a subject specialist as someone who has
a research support role I think the

00:32:09.009 --> 00:32:09.019
a research support role I think the
 

00:32:09.019 --> 00:32:10.719
a research support role I think the
question of whether there are ways that

00:32:10.719 --> 00:32:10.729
question of whether there are ways that
 

00:32:10.729 --> 00:32:12.820
question of whether there are ways that
beyond collections libraries would like

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:12.830
beyond collections libraries would like
 

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:15.339
beyond collections libraries would like
to and can effectively support chemists

00:32:15.339 --> 00:32:15.349
to and can effectively support chemists
 

00:32:15.349 --> 00:32:17.229
to and can effectively support chemists
is a really interesting question and

00:32:17.229 --> 00:32:17.239
is a really interesting question and
 

00:32:17.239 --> 00:32:20.320
is a really interesting question and
cuts at the very heart of for me looking

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:20.330
cuts at the very heart of for me looking
 

00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:21.700
cuts at the very heart of for me looking
at our faculty survey where we have

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:21.710
at our faculty survey where we have
 

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:24.279
at our faculty survey where we have
other disciplines available to us for

00:32:24.279 --> 00:32:24.289
other disciplines available to us for
 

00:32:24.289 --> 00:32:26.739
other disciplines available to us for
analysis what is the library strategy

00:32:26.739 --> 00:32:26.749
analysis what is the library strategy
 

00:32:26.749 --> 00:32:29.139
analysis what is the library strategy
for engaging with scientists as

for engaging with scientists as
 

00:32:29.149 --> 00:32:32.859

at this point I think I think it's fair
to say now discovery and research

00:32:41.769 --> 00:32:41.779

that that emerged for both historians
 

00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:48.879
that that emerged for both historians
and chemists but in very different ways

00:32:48.879 --> 00:32:48.889
and chemists but in very different ways
 

00:32:48.889 --> 00:32:49.810

box that many libraries are trying to
 

00:33:07.219 --> 00:33:09.579

put on their homepage is that is that

notion of undergraduate research

notion of undergraduate research
especially as it's situated in a

especially as it's situated in a
 

00:34:08.839 --> 00:34:11.500

there are classes where the purpose of

there are classes where the purpose of

the class is guiding students through a
 

00:34:19.819 --> 00:34:21.819
the class is guiding students through a
scholarly publishing process and they're

00:34:21.819 --> 00:34:21.829
scholarly publishing process and they're
 

00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:22.899
scholarly publishing process and they're
creating something that's meant for

00:34:22.899 --> 00:34:22.909
creating something that's meant for
 

00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:37.060
creating something that's meant for

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:37.070
 

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:50.800
I could I see a role for libraries in

I could I see a role for libraries in
 

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:52.640
I could I see a role for libraries in
helping the students through this

00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:52.650
helping the students through this
 

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:54.320
helping the students through this
undergraduate through this process like

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:54.330
undergraduate through this process like
 

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:57.010
undergraduate through this process like
helping them with style and citation and

00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:57.020
helping them with style and citation and
 

00:34:57.020 --> 00:35:00.380
helping them with style and citation and
at our library we've actually done that

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:00.390
at our library we've actually done that
 

00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:04.310
at our library we've actually done that
where are where we've set up like

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320
where are where we've set up like
 

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:07.190
where are where we've set up like
scholarly journals for students and it

00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200
scholarly journals for students and it
 

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.500
scholarly journals for students and it
actually becomes part of the learning

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:09.510
actually becomes part of the learning
 

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:13.280
actually becomes part of the learning
process yeah and I think I think that's

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:13.290
process yeah and I think I think that's
 

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:17.350
process yeah and I think I think that's
I think that and in many other fields

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:17.360
I think that and in many other fields
 

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:20.960

probably less so history but in some of

fields I think there is probably a

fields I think there is probably a
 

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:28.010

little more grand for that and and I

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:28.020
little more grand for that and and I
 

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:29.240
little more grand for that and and I
think that in some of our future

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:29.250
think that in some of our future
 

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:31.040

more but we didn't we really excluded

away from the published literature so

00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:13.110
away from the published literature so
 

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:16.610

wasn't the set of services that they

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240
wasn't the set of services that they
 

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:14.570
wasn't the set of services that they
were asking for right I mean they were

to write my article I can find it that

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640
to write my article I can find it that
 

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.190

was really the set of services that they

doubt that that that's not generalizable

00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:28.710
doubt that that that's not generalizable
 

00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:29.960
doubt that that that's not generalizable
but I just want to be clear that that's

but I just want to be clear that that's

but I just want to be clear that that's
what that's what we thought yeah are we
