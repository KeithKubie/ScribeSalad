00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.301
Sal: Let's see if we can
calculate the definite

00:00:02.301 --> 00:00:07.566
integral from zero to
one of x squared times

00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:13.500
two to the x to the third power d x.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.900
Like always I encourage
you to pause this video

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.233
and see if you can figure
this out on your own.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.634
I'm assuming you've had a go at it.

00:00:22.634 --> 00:00:24.300
There's a couple of
interesting things here.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.100
The first thing, at least
that my brain does, it says,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.367
"I'm used to taking derivatives
and anti-derivatives

00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:31.700
of e to the x, not some
other base to the x."

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.700
We know that the derivative
with respect to x of e to the x

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.100
is e to the x, or we could
say that the anti-derivative

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.700
of e to the x is equal
to e to the x plus c.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.900
Since I'm dealing with
something raised to,

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.900
this particular situation,
something raised to

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.500
a function of x, it seems
like I might want to put,

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.433
I might want to change the base
here, but how do I do that?

00:00:56.433 --> 00:01:00.866
The way I would do that is
re-express two in terms of e.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.233
What would be two in terms of e?

00:01:03.233 --> 00:01:09.900
Two is equal to e, is
equal to e raised to the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.033
power that you need to
raise e to to get to two.

00:01:13.033 --> 00:01:14.367
What's the power that you have

00:01:14.367 --> 00:01:16.500
to raise two to to get to two?

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.600
Well that's the natural log of two.

00:01:18.633 --> 00:01:21.633
Once again the natural
log of two is the exponent

00:01:21.633 --> 00:01:24.100
that you have to raise e to to get to two.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.700
If you actually raise e to
it you're going to get two.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.567
This is what two is.

00:01:29.567 --> 00:01:31.567
Now what is two to the x to the third?

00:01:31.567 --> 00:01:34.500
Well if we raise both sides
of this to the x to the third

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.166
power, we raise both sides
to the x to the third power,

00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:40.967
two to the x to the third
is equal to, if I raise

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:43.433
something to an exponent and
then raise that to an exponent,

00:01:43.433 --> 00:01:49.266
it's going to be equal to
e to the x to the third,

00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:53.000
x to the third, times
the natural log of two,

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.134
times the natural log of two.

00:01:56.233 --> 00:01:59.166
That already seems pretty interesting.

00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:01.567
Let's rewrite this, and
actually what I'm going to do,

00:02:01.567 --> 00:02:04.100
let's just focus on the
indefinite integral first,

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.166
see if we can figure that out.

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:06.500
Then we can apply, then we can take,

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.566
we can evaluate the definite ones.

00:02:08.566 --> 00:02:11.566
Let's just think about
this, let's think about

00:02:11.566 --> 00:02:15.033
the indefinite integral of x squared times

00:02:15.033 --> 00:02:18.500
two to the x to the third power d x.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.566
I really want to find the
anti-derivative of this.

00:02:20.566 --> 00:02:23.166
Well this is going to be
the exact same thing as

00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:28.433
the integral of, I'll
write my x squared still,

00:02:28.433 --> 00:02:30.366
but instead of two to the x to the third

00:02:30.366 --> 00:02:32.166
I'm going to write all of this business.

00:02:32.166 --> 00:02:33.833
Let me just copy and paste that.

00:02:33.833 --> 00:02:35.300
We already established
that this is the same

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.500
thing as two to the x to the third power.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.867
Copy and paste, just like that.

00:02:43.433 --> 00:02:47.800
Then let me close it with a d x.

00:02:48.838 --> 00:02:51.767
I was able to get it in
terms of e as a base.

00:02:51.767 --> 00:02:53.434
That makes me a little
bit more comfortable

00:02:53.434 --> 00:02:55.366
but it still seems pretty complicated.

00:02:55.366 --> 00:02:57.700
You might be saying, "Okay, look.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.966
"Maybe u substitution
could be at play here."

00:03:00.966 --> 00:03:05.033
Because I have this crazy
expression, x to the third times

00:03:05.033 --> 00:03:08.000
the natural log of two, but
what's the derivative of that?

00:03:08.033 --> 00:03:09.366
Well that's going to be three x

00:03:09.366 --> 00:03:11.167
squared times the natural log of two,

00:03:11.167 --> 00:03:13.966
or three times the natural
log of two times x squared.

00:03:13.966 --> 00:03:16.166
That's just a constant times x squared.

00:03:16.166 --> 00:03:18.766
We already have a x squared
here so maybe we can engineer

00:03:18.766 --> 00:03:22.934
this a little bit to have
the constant there as well.

00:03:22.967 --> 00:03:24.233
Let's think about that.

00:03:24.233 --> 00:03:27.900
If we made this, if we defined this as u,

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.233
if we said u is equal
to x to the third times

00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:36.234
the natural log of two,
what is du going to be?

00:03:36.234 --> 00:03:39.900
du is going to be, it's
going to be, well natural

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.033
log of two is just a
constant so it's going to be

00:03:42.033 --> 00:03:45.933
three x squared times
the natural log of two.

00:03:46.033 --> 00:03:47.433
We could actually just change the order

00:03:47.433 --> 00:03:49.033
we're multiplying a little bit.

00:03:49.033 --> 00:03:50.500
We could say that this
is the same thing as

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.567
x squared times three natural log of two,

00:03:55.567 --> 00:03:58.566
which is the same thing just
using logarithm properties,

00:03:58.566 --> 00:04:03.766
as x squared times the natural
log of two to the third power.

00:04:03.766 --> 00:04:05.100
Three natural log of two is the same thing

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.166
as the natural log of
two to the third power.

00:04:07.166 --> 00:04:13.333
This is equal to x squared
times the natural log of eight.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.433
Let's see, if this is u, where is du?

00:04:16.433 --> 00:04:19.466
Oh, and of course we can't forget the dx.

00:04:19.966 --> 00:04:25.800
This is a dx right over here, dx, dx, dx.

00:04:25.833 --> 00:04:29.767
Where is the du? Well we have
a dx. Let me circle things.

00:04:29.767 --> 00:04:32.767
You have a dx here, you have a dx there.

00:04:32.767 --> 00:04:36.100
You have an x squared here,
you have an x squared here.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.234
So really all we need is,

00:04:38.234 --> 00:04:40.900
all we need here is the
natural log of eight.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.834
Ideally we would have the
natural log of eight right over

00:04:43.834 --> 00:04:46.966
here, and we could put it
there as long as we also,

00:04:46.966 --> 00:04:49.233
we could multiply by
the natural log of eight

00:04:49.233 --> 00:04:53.333
as long as we also divide
by a natural log of eight.

00:04:53.366 --> 00:04:56.300
We can do it like right over here,

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.833
we could divide by natural log of eight.

00:04:58.833 --> 00:05:01.366
But we know that the
anti-derivative of some constant

00:05:01.366 --> 00:05:04.033
times a function is the
same thing as a constant

00:05:04.033 --> 00:05:06.300
times the anti-derivative
of that function.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.433
We could just take that on the outside.

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:12.333
It's one over the natural log of eight.

00:05:12.566 --> 00:05:15.433
Let's write this in terms of u and du.

00:05:15.433 --> 00:05:18.566
This simplifies to one over the natural

00:05:18.566 --> 00:05:23.346
log of eight times the anti-derivative of

00:05:24.453 --> 00:05:31.766
e to the u, e to the u, that's the u, du.

00:05:31.766 --> 00:05:36.509
This times this times that is du, du.

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:38.700
And this is straightforward,

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.900
we know what this is going to be.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.100
This is going to be equal
to, let me just write

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.600
the one over natural
log of eight out here,

00:05:45.633 --> 00:05:53.879
one over natural log of
eight times e to the u,

00:05:55.771 --> 00:05:57.700
and of course if we're
thinking in terms of just

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.433
anti-derivative there would
be some constant out there.

00:06:00.433 --> 00:06:02.900
Then we would just
reverse the substitution.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.500
We already know what u is.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.300
This is going to be equal
to, the anti-derivative of

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.566
this expression is one over
the natural log of eight

00:06:11.566 --> 00:06:15.367
times e to the, instead
of u, we know that u is

00:06:15.367 --> 00:06:19.100
x to the third times
the natural log of two.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.866
And of course we could put a plus c there.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.234
Now, going back to the original problem.

00:06:24.234 --> 00:06:26.566
We just need to evaluate
the anti-derivative

00:06:26.566 --> 00:06:29.500
of this at each of these points.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.967
Let's rewrite that.

00:06:30.967 --> 00:06:36.066
Given what we just figured out,
let me copy and paste that.

00:06:36.301 --> 00:06:39.120
This is just going to be equal to,

00:06:40.181 --> 00:06:43.966
it's going to be equal to
the anti-derivative evaluated

00:06:43.966 --> 00:06:47.100
at one minus the anti-derivative
evaluated at zero.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.033
We don't have to worry about the

00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:50.033
constants because those will cancel out.

00:06:50.033 --> 00:06:53.566
So we are going to get,
we are going to get one--

00:06:53.566 --> 00:06:55.966
Let me evaluate it first at one.

00:06:56.596 --> 00:06:59.500
You're going to get one
over the natural log of

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:05.433
eight times e to the
one to the third power,

00:07:05.433 --> 00:07:08.100
which is just one, times
the natural log of two,

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.834
natural log of two,
that's evaluated at one.

00:07:10.834 --> 00:07:15.066
Then we're going to have
minus it evaluated it at zero.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.033
It's going to be one
over the natural log of

00:07:18.033 --> 00:07:21.633
eight times e to the, well when x is zero

00:07:21.633 --> 00:07:23.766
this whole thing is going to be zero.

00:07:23.766 --> 00:07:29.100
Well e to the zero is just
one, and e to the natural

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.233
log of two, well that's
just going to be two,

00:07:32.233 --> 00:07:33.966
we already established that early on,

00:07:33.966 --> 00:07:35.766
this is just going to be equal to two.

00:07:35.766 --> 00:07:39.366
We are left with two over the
natural log of eight minus

00:07:39.366 --> 00:07:42.500
one over the natural log of
eight, which is just going

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:47.533
to be equal to one over
the natural log of eight.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:52.266
And we are, and we are done.
