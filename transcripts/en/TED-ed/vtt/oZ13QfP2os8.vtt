00:00:07.281 --> 00:00:12.713
There is a curse that has plagued humanity
since ancient times.

00:00:12.713 --> 00:00:16.080
The Greeks fought it by chewing
aromatic resins,

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.331
while the Chinese resorted to egg shells.

00:00:19.331 --> 00:00:21.385
In the ancient Jewish Talmud,

00:00:21.385 --> 00:00:25.465
it's even considered 
legal grounds for divorce.

00:00:25.465 --> 00:00:31.828
This horrible scourge is halitosis,
otherwise known as bad breath.

00:00:31.828 --> 00:00:36.165
But what causes it,
and why is it so universally terrifying?

00:00:36.165 --> 00:00:39.281
Well, think of some of the worst
odors you can imagine,

00:00:39.281 --> 00:00:43.621
like garbage, feces or rotting meat.

00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:48.312
All of these smells come from the activity
of microorganisms,

00:00:48.312 --> 00:00:50.211
particularly bacteria,

00:00:50.211 --> 00:00:52.487
and, as disgusting as it may sound,

00:00:52.487 --> 00:00:58.789
similar bacteria live in the moisture-rich
environment of your mouth.

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:00.234
Don't panic.

00:01:00.234 --> 00:01:03.386
The presence of bacteria in your body
is not only normal,

00:01:03.386 --> 00:01:05.920
it's actually vital 
for all sorts of things,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.778
like digestion and disease prevention.

00:01:08.778 --> 00:01:12.751
But like all living things,
bacteria need to eat.

00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:15.882
The bacteria in your mouth 
feed off of mucus,

00:01:15.882 --> 00:01:17.322
food remnants,

00:01:17.322 --> 00:01:19.694
and dead tissue cells.

00:01:19.694 --> 00:01:22.817
In order to absorb nutrients
through their cell membranes,

00:01:22.817 --> 00:01:26.834
they must break down the organic matter
into much smaller molecules.

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:31.682
For example, they'll break proteins 
into their component amino acids

00:01:31.682 --> 00:01:35.804
and then break those down even further
into various compounds.

00:01:35.804 --> 00:01:38.879
Some of the foul-smelling 
byproducts of these reactions,

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:42.190
such as hydrogen sulfide and cadaverine,

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.954
escape into the air

00:01:43.954 --> 00:01:47.565
and waft their way 
towards unsuspecting noses.

00:01:47.565 --> 00:01:52.253
Our sensitivity to these odors
and interpretation of them as bad smells

00:01:52.253 --> 00:01:56.876
may be an evolutionary mechanism
warning us of rotten food

00:01:56.876 --> 00:01:58.809
and the presence of disease.

00:01:58.809 --> 00:02:02.020
Smell is one of our most intimate
and primal senses,

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.485
playing a huge role 
in our attraction to potential mates.

00:02:06.485 --> 00:02:10.693
In one poll, 59% of men and 70% of women

00:02:10.693 --> 00:02:14.710
said they wouldn't go on a date 
with someone who has bad breath,

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.898
which may be why Americans alone

00:02:16.898 --> 00:02:21.816
spend $1 billion a year 
on various breath products.

00:02:21.816 --> 00:02:25.062
Fortunately, most bad breath 
is easily treated.

00:02:25.062 --> 00:02:29.301
The worst smelling byproducts come from
gram-negative bacteria

00:02:29.301 --> 00:02:32.190
that live in the spaces 
between gums and teeth

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.219
and on the back of the tongue.

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:36.238
By brushing and flossing our teeth,

00:02:36.238 --> 00:02:39.137
using antibacterial mouthwash at bedtime,

00:02:39.137 --> 00:02:42.577
gently cleaning the back of the tongue
with a plastic scraper

00:02:42.577 --> 00:02:45.685
and even just eating a healthy breakfast,

00:02:45.685 --> 00:02:49.832
we can remove many of these bacteria
and their food sources.

00:02:49.832 --> 00:02:53.017
In some cases, 
these measures may not be enough

00:02:53.017 --> 00:02:57.197
due to dental problems, 
nasal conditions, or rarer ailments,

00:02:57.197 --> 00:03:00.987
such as liver disease 
and uncontrolled diabetes.

00:03:00.987 --> 00:03:03.849
Behaviors like smoking 
and excessive alcohol consumption

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.343
also have a very recognizable odor.

00:03:07.343 --> 00:03:08.918
Regardless of cause,

00:03:08.918 --> 00:03:12.488
the bad smell almost 
always originates in the mouth

00:03:12.488 --> 00:03:15.600
and not the stomach 
or elsewhere in the body.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.430
But one of the biggest challenges lies

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.765
in actually determining 
how our breath smells in the first place,

00:03:21.765 --> 00:03:23.604
and it's unclear why.

00:03:23.604 --> 00:03:25.622
It may be that 
we're too acclimatized

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:29.193
to the smell inside 
our own mouths to judge it.

00:03:29.193 --> 00:03:32.021
And methods like cupping your hands
over your mouth,

00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:36.102
or licking and smelling your wrist
don't work perfectly either.

00:03:36.102 --> 00:03:38.736
One study showed 
that even when people do this,

00:03:38.736 --> 00:03:41.212
they tend to rate the smell subjectively

00:03:41.212 --> 00:03:44.772
according to how bad 
they thought it was going to be.

00:03:44.772 --> 00:03:47.791
But there's one simple,
if socially difficult,

00:03:47.791 --> 00:03:50.551
way of finding out how your breath smells:

00:03:50.551 --> 00:03:54.282
just take a deep breath and ask a friend.
