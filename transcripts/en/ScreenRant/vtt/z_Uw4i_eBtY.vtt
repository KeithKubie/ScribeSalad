00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:12.099
Parents and adults may get as much fun out
of Disney and Pixar movies, but it's assumed

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.690
that the actual stories and humor won't be
anything too mature for younger audiences.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.480
But sometimes, the people actually making
the movie just can't help themselves - sliding

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.090
in crude jokes or adult gags that can't be
unseen, and are almost guaranteed to have

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.570
older viewers laughing... and wondering how
they ever could have missed them the first

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.570
time around.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.040
In some cases you wonâ€™t even believe how
these scenes are actually part of the movies.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.450
Here is Screenrant's look at Dirty Disney:
10 Inappropriate Scenes in Disney Films.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.270
Toy Story 3

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.990
There are some adult jokes that go over kids'
heads, and then there are ones that are subtle

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.930
enough to be missed even by parents.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.470
In Toy Story 3, the gang learns just how rude
the villain Lotso really is when he pulls

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.720
off the mouth of Mrs. Potato Head just to
shut her up.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.070
As they look on stunned, Mr Potato Head lets
Lotso know that only her husband is allowed

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.460
to pull that trick, delivering a veiled sex
joke in the process.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.200
Kids in the audience were probably too scared
to notice their parents eyes widening at that

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.200
one.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.440
Inside Out
Since the movie takes place inside the mind

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.350
of a preteen girl, Inside Out is a fairly
innocent story about leaving childhood behind

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.659
as a family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco.

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.100
But the writers couldn't resist making one
tiny joke given the city's famous history

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.100
in the gay rights movement.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.260
When the emotions run wild upon seeing their
new house, Fear wonders if deadly bears live

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.180
in the city, with Anger claiming to have seen
one already.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.260
The line is meaningless to kids, but adults
will realize the term is typically used in

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.940
the gay community to describe large, hairy
men.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.280
Anger had no idea.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.620
Aladdin: King of Thieves

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.540
There are plenty of Disney fans who name Aladdin
as their favorite, so the two straight to

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.979
home video sequels that followed were no surprise.

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.610
But apparently, the studio figured nobody
was paying attending by the third in the series.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.290
So when Aladdin and princess Jasmine are finally
set to get married, a sudden attack on the

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.960
castle gives Genie the opportunity for one
of his signature one-liners.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.370
Making a sex joke about the young couple wasn't
too inappropriate, but it shows just how much

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.369
can slip by unnoticed when you talk as fast
as Robin Williams.

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.369
The Emperor's New Groove

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.659
Not every crude joke is without some clever
humor - and sometimes, the best gags don't

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:15.400
even have to be called out to get fans laughing.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.870
The Emperor's New Groove saw Kronk out camping
in an extremely small tent.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.490
When audiences realize they're watching as
he "pitches a tent" confined to his crotch,

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.160
they may realize that half of Disney's humor
may have gone by completely unnoticed.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.410
But that might be for the best.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.410
Cars

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.950
Pixar's automotive adventure begins with Star
Lightning McQueen at the top of his game,

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.610
the most famous racer in America.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.340
So famous, he even had groupies in the form
of two shapely young sports cars.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.950
When viewers realize that their decision to
show their high beams to the racer actually

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.319
means that he's being flashed, the dozens
of camera flashes make a lot more sense...

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.280
And guarantee you'll think twice about every
other set of headlights in the rest of the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.280
movie.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.480
Surprisingly, that's not even the only adult
joke made in the movie, as a later scene shows

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.920
a roadside restaurant called the Top Down
Truckstop.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.410
In case audience members didn't get the reference,
the sign also advertises "all convertible

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.150
waitresses" - that's right, a topless truckstop,
right under viewers' noses.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.150
Frozen

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.890
We know, there's no way Disney's heartwarming,
billion dollar tale of sisterly love had anything

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:16.890
crude, right?

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.620
When Anna first joins forces with Kristof,
he's less than supportive about her marrying

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.710
a man she just met, proving it's a bad move
by quizzing her about Hans, including his

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:28.710
foot size.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:38.680
It's a safe bet the women in the audience
gave the line a giggle, since it's an obvious

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:47.340
play on the idea that "size doesn't matter"
when it comes to a man's... equipment.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.340
Hercules

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:56.550
Disney's version of the classical Greek hero
took a different approach to designing Mythical

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.340
creatures, and the Centaur stands out as a
particularly odd one.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.319
Not only does the creatures entire head seem
modelled after a part of the male anatomy,

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.390
but when Hercules sends the beast skyward,
he lands hard - resulting in a massive bruise

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.700
swelling off the top of his head.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.480
If the suggestive shape of his skull passed
any viewers by, his knobby brow and massive

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:22.560
lump show that Disney's animators can still
be as immature as their audience.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.220
Ratatouille

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:31.500
When Linguini is finally forced to admit that
it's his pet rat who is cooking award-winning

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.460
food, and not him, it's his hopeful romance
Colette that he lets in on the secret.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.580
But when trying to explain the tiny little
truth he's hiding, it's impossible to miss

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.259
Colette's grimace, and quick glance below
Linguini's waist.

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:49.610
It's a joke aimed squarely at the older fans,
and is just subtle enough to sneak by without

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:50.610
offending anyone.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:51.610
Bambi

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.479
That's right, even back in 1942 Disney was
slipping some sly adult humor into family

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:56.479
entertainment.

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:01.229
Although Bambi is the star of the show, his
good friend Flower the skunk is just as memorable.

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:07.169
When Flower first runs into Bluebelle, the
pair share a kiss that renders him completely

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:08.169
frozen.

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:15.580
It's a cute and harmless joke, but once people
realized a kiss made Flower flush with blood

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.860
and grow as stiff as a board, it was obvious
the animators were implying something that

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.310
kids hopefully wouldn't ask any questions
about.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.330
Those are the best adult jokes we found hidden
in Disney and Pixar movies, but are there

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:27.330
any we missed?

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.879
