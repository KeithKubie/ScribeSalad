trying to fit all of that together so
 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.910
trying to fit all of that together so
that we have a picture of where people

which we might go forward I said this is

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230
which we might go forward I said this is
 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.440
which we might go forward I said this is
a thoroughly pragmatist approach and it

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450
a thoroughly pragmatist approach and it
 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.690
a thoroughly pragmatist approach and it
is because it's not about perfection

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700
is because it's not about perfection
 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.350
is because it's not about perfection
it's a matter of improvement and

it's a matter of improvement and

it's a matter of improvement and
philosophers I think how are in the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130
philosophers I think how are in the
 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.760
philosophers I think how are in the
business of trying to give us that

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770
business of trying to give us that
 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.790
business of trying to give us that
general picture of ourselves and our

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800
general picture of ourselves and our
 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.680
general picture of ourselves and our
place in the world and the kinds of

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690
place in the world and the kinds of
 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.140
place in the world and the kinds of
lives that we live that will enable us

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150
lives that we live that will enable us
 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.290
lives that we live that will enable us
to take the next steps in improving

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300
to take the next steps in improving
 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.470
to take the next steps in improving
things for ourselves and that means that

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480
things for ourselves and that means that
 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.750

philosophy is a synthetic discipline

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760
philosophy is a synthetic discipline
 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.140
philosophy is a synthetic discipline
primarily it's something that draws from

primarily it's something that draws from
 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.540
primarily it's something that draws from
lots and lots and lots of different

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550
lots and lots and lots of different
 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.540
lots and lots and lots of different

areas and draws from life as it exists
 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.080
areas and draws from life as it exists
at a particular moment in time so every

at a particular moment in time so every
 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.270

age will always need its philosophers

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280
age will always need its philosophers
 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.080
age will always need its philosophers
and in the past we've had great

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090
and in the past we've had great
 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.070
and in the past we've had great
synthesizers we think of people like

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080
synthesizers we think of people like
 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.030
synthesizers we think of people like
Plato and Aristotle in the ancient West

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040
Plato and Aristotle in the ancient West
 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.289
Plato and Aristotle in the ancient West
we think of people I can't and Hegel in

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299
we think of people I can't and Hegel in
 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.410
we think of people I can't and Hegel in
the more recent West we think of people

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420
the more recent West we think of people
 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.190
the more recent West we think of people
like Confucius and Mencius and so on

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200
like Confucius and Mencius and so on
 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.500
like Confucius and Mencius and so on
these are all attempts seems to me to

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510
these are all attempts seems to me to
 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.680
these are all attempts seems to me to
find a big synthesis and that's what

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690
find a big synthesis and that's what
 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.479
find a big synthesis and that's what
philosophy is all about and that's what

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489
philosophy is all about and that's what
 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.180
philosophy is all about and that's what
it needs and that's what philosophers I

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190
it needs and that's what philosophers I
 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.840
it needs and that's what philosophers I
think should be trying to accomplish
