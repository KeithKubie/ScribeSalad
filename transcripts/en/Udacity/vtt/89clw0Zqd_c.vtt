We've been talking about parallel lines a lot recently, but here I've drawn two

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:08.356
lines that are clearly not parallel to one another. Rather, these lines are what

00:00:08.368 --> 00:00:12.443
we call perpendicular to one another. Making us some observations about these

00:00:12.455 --> 00:00:16.491
two lines that I've told you are perpendicular, what do you think that you can

00:00:16.503 --> 00:00:20.729
say about perpendicular lines in general? If two lines are perpandicular to one

00:00:20.741 --> 00:00:24.248
another do they have the same slope? Do they have different slopes? Do they have

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:28.416
specially related slopes? Do they have slopes are related in a special way?

00:00:28.507 --> 00:00:32.164
Should they form a right angle with one another, or do they have slopes with

00:00:32.176 --> 00:00:35.014
oppisite signs? You can pick as many choices as you think are correct.
