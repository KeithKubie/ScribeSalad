Speaker 1:          00:02          Okay. So, um, just want to go back very briefly, um, to, um, uh, approach to as I lay dying last time, we talk about the importance of the epic tradition, uh, to the modern, this novel, uh, and the way that, especially the way that the voice dead and I'm the, and suddenly the boundaries between the human and the nonhuman are being reactivated and redeployed in as I lay dying. Uh, so today we're going to move on to a somewhat different approach to this is really a different way to contextualize, uh, as I lay dying. And, uh, it's more of a kind of an American, uh, tradition, uh, for this novel. And in fact, we really began to see a law that, um, in the person, uh, who, um, is in one sense a key player. Uh, but in another sense, not, um, the eddies partner in the adulterous affair and, uh, Faulkner, uh, text the name of that person from a historic figure that's very well known.

Speaker 1:          01:10          Preacher 18th century preacher George Whitfield, someone who actually has a very large presence and Benjamin Franklin's autobiography. So this is the very dignified looking, uh, historical George with Phil. And this is farmers with Phil. Uh, when he was on his horse, he was able to cross the river as we know, uh, and he's on his way. In fact, he's approaching his right at the house. So, um, with feel, um, has a lot of, has lots to be thankful for. And his expressing his gratitude to God at this moment. It was here in his infinite wisdom that restrained the tail from her dying lives as she lays around by those who loved and trusted her mind. The travail by water, which I sustained by the strength of his hand praise to the indiebound bandages and omnipotent love. Oh, praise. Um, yes. I mean he truly is a very lucky guy.

Speaker 1:          02:23          Um, you know, issue dies before she was able to give away his name and maybe she never, plans are just too proud and was the one to give away his name. Um, so he's lucky and having chosen the right partner, someone who, who lives a seal when it comes to his name. Um, and he's also very lucky in the sense that his horse is such a good swimmer of that, um, is the horse, is able to cross the river when the muse drown. So, um, this is truly, um, you know, he is truly a blessing figure it, but of course I'm making fun of him as I indeed I think Faulkner ones as to, um, the only way I think to take someone like with you, um, is to put him in one particular genre. And this is really what I liked to argue today is the question of Java for as I lay dying, the only way to take with failed is to put them in the genres of comedy.

Speaker 1:          03:22          And he's just a common figure. You know, he's totally serious himself. This congratulating himself in his praising the Lord, but all the time when he's doing that, he's firmly and Scottish in the comic tradition. Um, and it turns out that this, um, self congratulating self dignifying, uh, kind of person actually has a president in American literature, a very prominent president. And it turns out there, this predecessor is also a minister who has an affair with a woman. So we, you know, there's only one novel, um, in American literature that, um, that is like that and not surprisingly is a novel that we all recognize the scarlet letter. Um, so this is Hawthorne's, um, comic figure. Um, skyline is not really usually read as a comic novel, but I do think that half of this having fun when he's portraying other dems down, God knows and he's merciful.

Speaker 1:          04:29          He have proof his mercy. Most of all in my afflictions by giving me this burning towards you or to bear upon my breasts, praise be his name, his will be done. Fair. Well, same. Exactly the same combination of woman whose lips are sealed with never give away the name of her partner. Um, and the same kind of mercy from mercy in cohesion, miles from God. Um, in this, in this case, um, other than his name was lucky. Not in the sense that he has a horse or who's a good swimmer, but in the sense that he dies right at that moment. Um, and so, you know, without in at the very moment when he's thanking God and he is forgiven his sense of a given, he dies. So he, um, is very lucky in that way. Um, and it, um, suggest that from the very beginning, from the 19th century on, um, a story that otherwise would have been taken as tragic.

Speaker 1:          05:32          Ashley has the comic dimension to it. Um, it's just not very easy to roll our eyes when we listen to someone like with the hill and when we listen to someone like Arthur Dimmesdale. Um, but even as we were rolling our eyes, um, I think that there are other things in those two novels that is very hard too, bro. Ally's over. So I want to turn now to this other dimension, um, and want to begin with Hall thought, uh, by talking about obviously the much more important tragic dimension, um, in the scarlet letter and his own has to print the fact of the symbol or rather of the position in respect to society that was indicated by it on the mind of Hester. Prynne herself was powerful and peculiar. All the light and graceful foliage of her character had been weathered up by this red hot brand and had long ago fallen away, leaving a bear and hush outline, which might've been repulsive, has sheet who says friends or companions to be repelled by it.

Speaker 1:          06:50          So just as um, Dimsdale and with feel a Aa lucky, um, has to print is doubly because, uh, she's caused both in the most obvious way because she has to wear the scarlet letter for the rest of her life. Um, and she's also occurs, well, she's actually AAA cause she has to wear the scarlet leather. Her whole being is transformed. So all the beauty of physical beauty or the beauty of her mind seemed to have gone away. Um, and she is just, it's very hush for building character. Um, and that other people might've found repulsive if she had friends, uh, to be repairable. So, you know, really she is an absolute, have not at this point or hold on, as you guys know who read the Scott Leather hold on actually qualifies that this isn't quite the absolute ending of the sky. It's quite early.

Speaker 1:          07:45          Um, so, um, this is kind of low point, absolute low point, the most tragic moment, uh, for Hester in the sky ladder. And, um, I want to turn now from, from Hester to a comparable figure in a thoughtless as I lay dying. Um, and obviously it is adding and she's especially a tragic in relation to the two men in her life. First of all, a relation to, uh, with field. Why waited for him in the woods waiting for him before he saw me? I would think of him as dressed in sin, would think of him as thinking of me as stressed. Also in sin, he, the more beautiful since the Garmin wish here is changed for sin with send defied, I would think of the stand as gum and switch. We would remove in ologist shape and colors to terrible blood to the Phalon echo of the dead wood high in the air.

Speaker 1:          08:49          It was about as, um, joy is the discretion of any condoms, romance. It's not even the romance. It's not adultery. There's no, there's no sex obviously. And as I lay dying, um, there's, um, there's almost no love. Um, it is just the, the whole act itself is causing the terrible blood to the Phalon echo after dead air. So it's, um, if, if that is, you know, it was hard to understand why anyone would even want to do that if that is the nature of the affair. But that's how falconer would like us to think of that affair between had a and a and with you and we can almost to stay was she would be so Phalon because the, his, the fact that he's congratulating himself and scanning himself. Lucky at the moment of her death suggest what kind of a lover he has been a, so maybe it's not surprising that she should've been salon all the way through.

Speaker 1:          09:54          Um, and it is also the case that she's Phalon for another reason. Um, and maybe that's why she got into the fair to begin with a relation to her husband and I would think, and why and why you answer. I would think about his name until after awhile I could see the word as a shape of vessel. And I would watch him liquefy and slow into it, like cold molasses flowing out of the darkness into the vessel until the jars to four and motionless significant shape profoundly without live like an empty doorframe. Um, is the one of the most memorable descriptions of a terrible marriage, unbearable marriage. And um, I think that there's, that says it all. You know, it doesn't exactly justify, uh, eddies action is it needs justify justification. Um, but it really explains a lot. Um, and it is in contrast to that, to that coal molasses in the jar that all of a sudden we see another marriage and perspective.

Speaker 1:          11:12          So just want to refresh your memory about what we saw last time about toe and Cora because it would take a tight house for coral to hope Cora, like a job and milk in the spring. You've got to have the type jar or you need a powerful spraying. So if you have a big spring, why, then you have the incentive to have tight wellmade jars because it is your milk sal or not, because you would rather have them know that we're sour then to have that won't because you are a man. Um, so you know, it's not as spectacular. Marriage was good marriage. Um, and it's, um, a marriage that makes, how have you like a man and public core? Like a woman? Um, I don't mean to be sexist. Um, just, just the, um, just the general description of a good marriage. Um, so, um, his, um, tell and Cora, um, as a foil really, uh, to add a and, and um, so it seems that right now we've seen adding mostly as a tragic, they go right in relation to her too, man.

Speaker 1:          12:21          Um, and uh, and as a kind of a descendant, 20th century descendant of Hesta Prin. Um, but given the residence halls on, given that that's really a comic domination, even in the most tragic tale, we should foot wishing. Be surprised that they would also be a comparable comic dimension in SLA die as well. So I like to read the whole novel, as in some sense kind of constant negotiation between those two poles, between a comic poke betraying comedy on the one hand and tragedy, uh, on the other. And we can see the Karma that coming in, um, in at relation to her son, father man, who's not quite fully retarded as Benji is. Um, the Faulkner is really interested in the slightly retarded mind sort of farther than seems to be an instance of that. Uh, and it comes on and statements like my mother's a fish.

Speaker 1:          13:22          Um, I think that along with call me Ishmael, my mother's is officials got through one of the most famous lines in American literature. Um, and so why does, so this brings us back to the human and the nonhuman. Um, but it also now suggest another dimension and the generic Dinesh and, um, to, um, add a being a fish. And it turns out that she's not just any kind of a fish, but she's a fish out of water, which is, I guess it calmed restatement of the sense of desolation. And the philosophy is, um, that she feels towards with you and towards as, I mean, it's exactly the same thing except it when we say that she's a fish out of water is a couple of completely different style of connotations. So this is vitamin reporting on this fish. They, uh, that he just picked up their fish already dead, uh, that he's chopping up.

Speaker 1:          14:20          Um, so, and you clean it and says he don't look around farming. Oh, sorry. Um, this is this Ashley. Um, this is dow reporting. You clean it and said he did. He don't look around father. When comes back and picks up the fish, it's lies out of his hands, smearing wet dirt onto him and flops down doing itself. Get Mouth Garbo, hide hiding into a dust. Like it was ashamed of being dead like it was in a hurry to get that again. Um, so along with the sens that at a is a misfit is completely alone and by yourself, even in a marriage and even in an adulterous affair, um, there's this additional element that she's ashamed of all of it. And we can see that shame, um, in her reaction to, uh, the horse that, uh, Joe acquires writing, she's proud, she is proud, was just also crying.

Speaker 1:          15:27          Um, and Dow realizes that, um, that she's ashamed of her deceit at that moment. Um, so there's this terrible shame that's going to accompany her, uh, in her death. Um, and in the fish it comes out as the fish being ashamed of being dead. Um, even though there's is like another condition that we could, that we could help, but nonetheless, this fish seems really ashamed of this elemental fact. Um, and in contrast, I think that actually just to, um, stop for a moment, um, the fish actually would be a great paper topic, um, for, for, for your final paper. Um, and uh, it would bring Hemingway and thought no together in a really interesting way. Um, so once again, one of reemphasize how interesting it might be to pick something that is progress, a rope, you know, now the key player, but they're interesting entry point into novels.

Speaker 1:          16:29          So, um, in thinking along those lines, um, we can go back to the fish in, in our time. Um, and it's dead fish too, that fish. Um, but um, but totally different set of connotations that Hemingway, uh, brings to the debt. Trout. Nick cleaned them, sledding them from the vent to the tip of the jaw. All the insides and the Gills and tongue came out in one piece. They were both males, long gray, white strips of no smooth and clean. All the insides clean and Compaq coming out all together. So this is Hemingway's. I do have a good death. Um, is the depth of human beings being actually, uh, prefigure or maybe encoded into this very clean, very dignify death of the fish. There's no way we can avoid dying. Um, but the least that we can ask for is that we should die in a manner that is fitting for us.

Speaker 1:          17:37          Um, uh, man of them that is commensurate with the way that with live, um, and the child has lived a very clean life, is important where to Hemingway has lived with very clean live in the water. So it is fitting that the death should be commensurate with that. Um, and that is really a kind of utopian moment, um, in Hemingway and in contrast, this dirt is fish out of water. Being ashamed and being ashamed into unto death, um, is the dystopian moment in thougth nerve, but it's also a comic moment as well. So all I wish to say they're comedies is obviously very complicated and packed and you know, in many ways contradictory phenomenon, um, in Faulkner. Um, but I want, and it's with that understanding, you know, accommodating quotation lost in many ways that I like to think about the whole structure of as I lay dying, um, as a negotiation to train comedy and tragedy.

Speaker 1:          18:43          And I like to bring up 3 cents of terms that we've been talking about all through the semester to see how comedy and tragedy get mapped onto these terms. One is the human and nonhuman that we've been talking about last time. Um, and then I want to bring him in way back up. It turns out that the two categories have and have not set up by Hemingway will be key actually in the rest of the novels that we'll be reading. So are we using half and have not, um, as key terms within the as very useful and the lid they paradigm and uh, related to those. Um, since we've been talking so much about kinship beginning with the sound of the fury and also now as I lay dying brothers, uh, who is a kid and who is a non kin. Last time we saw the Jew is in danger of being labeled non-kin by uh, his brother Dao and by his sister who do Dell.

Speaker 1:          19:43          So who is going to be a nom kin at the end of this novel? But first let's start out with the most obvious comic future of as I lay dying, which is the most conventional and then happy ending in marriage. Um, and if you guys haven't gotten to that point, I apologize, but there's no way to talk about it as comedy without talking about the very last thing that we see as I lay dying. It is cash and Joel and vitamin and do it our process kind of handle and proud too with his teeth and all, even as he wouldn't look at it. I mean this is [inaudible] so, um, his wife isn't quite in the ground. Um, and um, this is a very fast mover. Um, so he has acquired a new wife, um, and other possessions sessions as well where he, his teeth. Um, and so on.

Speaker 1:          20:44          This is a new future, um, on ends. Um, so this is the, the, the Susie cliched ending, um, for comedy, you've got to have a marriage and family are very obligingly gives us a marriage at the end of, as I lay dying. Um, but we just know he's going to qualify it in some fashion. So right before we see, uh, ends with his new wife and his teeth, his new teeth, um, we see something else and that is just taking one step back. Who is the head. Then we see it wasn't the grip that made them look different. It was this phase and jewel says he's got the teeth. It was a flap. It made him look a foot taller, kind of holding his head up, hand up and proud to, and then we see her behind him carrying the other grip, kind of duck shape woman all dressed up.

Speaker 1:          21:44          And then I see that the grip she was carrying was one of them that are raffle phones. It was a fact, I'll shut up and pretty as a picture and every time a new record with come from the mail order and us setting in the house and the window listening to it, I would think what a shame Dow couldn't be to enjoy it too. So a lot of information is coming at us at this and new teeth, another possession, graffel phone, grandma farm. Um, and the new phenomenon of records coming by mail order. Um, this is truly the 20th century. Um, even though they are still views it. Third, we are firmly in the 20th century. Um, and the crucial detail at the end, the Dow will be there to enjoy the records. So, um, we know right there, and this is very end, this is to 60, so we know already has had $2, just repeating what we've known prior to this moment.

Speaker 1:          22:55          Um, then this would be constituting of the bumper, that family, that one person is no longer can no longer in that family. So how does this happen? Is what we need to find out and we have to go back a few steps to find out how it is that our guest excluded from that family circle. Um, so, but just want to give you a couple of images why the gramophone would be such a desirable object, just like the telephone, all this new equipment, um, just incredibly glamorous when they first appear. Um, so Columbia gramophone and um, and I like to, um, since we have all this desirable objects here, um, is obviously as I lay dying is Faulkner's version of to have and have not. And right there we know that ends has three very prize possessions, teeth, wive and gramophone. Um, and it seems that in contrast, other people have all lost something.

Speaker 1:          24:07          They all have been, uh, reclassified in some sense as, um, have nots. So in many ways, this was not a zero sum game, uh, in, uh, as I lay dying that one person gets a lot of stuff at the expense of someone else is a fairy, a steer and economic model that there's no view. Again, in this world someone gained something, someone loses something. Um, and the three people who lose something in the course of ns acquiring. So much of the history sounds cass, jewel and out. Um, so let's just look at cash. Um, and I, I can, you know, this is not really related to anything that I've been saying so far, but you know, there's clearly cash and Geo caches, the petty cash and jewel is the one whose value cannot be a wreck by cash. So fall is really playing with the economic model in a big way.

Speaker 1:          25:09          So maybe it's not surprising that, you know, it would also be a kind of equal on economic logic that's determining the narrative logic. And as I lay dying as well, but um, cash been named after the petty cash. Here's one who would, um, go try and make $3 a tourism now seeing his, his, his mother when she dies, not being with his mother when she dies. Um, so petty cash, um, but even though he is being is measure by petty cash, um, even in spite of the heat doesn't, can always hold on to what he has low as what he does have initially starting out. His face turned up a second when he was sliding back into the water, it was gray with his eyes closed and the long swipe of mud across his face that he let go into her to go over in the water.

Speaker 1:          26:09          He looked just like no bundle of clothes, kind of washing up and down against the bank. He looked like it was laying there in the water on his face, rocking up and down low, looking at something at the bottom. Uh, so cash is my mentality nonhuman. He's lost his humanity. It looks like a bundle of clothes. Um, and um, and we can all do that. You know, if we are floating in the river, um, unconscious, we can look like we are in an intimate matter, which is what cash is at this moment. Um, he could be in aliment Mather like a Bumbo of old clothes or we can also think about this in kind of kinship that is snapping in place because we have Ashley, um, fall and make sure that we have vivid memory of something else that also slow that before live this in the water between the two hills.

Speaker 1:          27:13          I see the muse once more, they row up out of the water in succession turning completely over the legs, deflate extended as when they had lost contact with the glove. So the reuse of floating belly up the legs stiffly extended, um, best to kind of unnatural postures for them. And cash is floating face down while he's looking at something at the bottom of the river. Um, but either way, the two pastures are almost magical in the sense that uh, both amused and cash are reduced to inanimate matter, um, in, in that kind of posture. Um, and, um, we know that the muse on ambulance photo and, um, they also emblems for it's not cow is cash. Um, is, is for, for caches. Um, kinship, uh, that he too is a creature a with feet of clay. And so, um, this is really FMA reaffirming, um, the fact that he's not capable of lots of things.

Speaker 1:          28:23          It's a very good carpenter, um, based, not capable of surviving in hostile environment and water is one of them. Um, so, um, he right there is just that kinship as being a reaffirm, but we can also see Tash as an ironic instance of a half as well. Um, and this is something that we actually come into play in a big way and the last Hemingway novel, um, that in fact it comes into play in to Hemingway novels. Um, I promise you that this ironic use of the hat will be a central moment, um, in for whom devout hose. But looking back, so we have that to go forward to. Uh, but we can also look back to an earlier moment in half and half, not when Harry Morgan is dying. Uh, his unconscious. Um, and he feels that his, this rubber hose inside of him. Right. So when we're talking about that moment, um, I was suggesting a, although I wasn't pushing very hard on that, um, the, there was a moment of an ironic have, we don't actually have rubber hoses inside our bellies, uh, but they can sometimes feel that way.

Speaker 1:          29:37          Um, and so it's an ironic procession, was very negative possession, ironically vested in us. Um, and here, um, it's the same idea in thought leader. Um, cat as having an Iran, they put stash and that is make tones and into casualty as it did Harry Morgan in to have and have not cash has a broken leg. He has had two broken legs. He lies on the box with a quilt road on his head and the peers who were under his knee, I reckon we ought to left him at arms dance palaces. I haven't got a broken leg and par hasn't and dial hasn't and it's just the bumps catch says it's kind of grinds together a little on a bum. It don't bother them. So far, the man is the one who is speaking here. Vitamin is really rubbing in that has, has a broken leg.

Speaker 1:          30:39          He has had two in his life. He's managed to break both of his legs in his occupation as a carpenter, fallen down from some hype, uh, in this case, just, uh, his leg is broken by a battery by, by the Horse, um, and, and the law. Um, so, um, he, um, has, he does what he has. He's lost his tools at this point. He's lost his consciousness. Um, he's lost his leg. But what he has instead of a good life is a broken leg that as well as in his possession now. So it's definitely, it's an ironic instance. Um, uh, have an vitamin is very, very glad that he doesn't have that. I don't have that part, doesn't have that. Dow doesn't have that. So definitely it is at the verb to have, um, as alive though they, um, but we can also, so that is an instance of Errand Ising that thought, but this also kind of a straightforward instance of cash as a have not in a very simple quantifiable way.

Speaker 1:          31:49          Um, and actually quantification is kind of interesting, um, in thoughts on it as well. If we think of the entire novel, the whole narrative economy is kind of zero sum game than actually quantifying who gets what and measuring that against who loses what actually this kind of quantify logic going on in, uh, it's already done. Um, so this is of quantifying moment. Um, and as I lay dying, we know that the muse have drum, so they have to get another team of news. This is very few poor people, that team of Muse with cause flooding hours. Um, and it seems that ans actually has managed to come up with the $40. So Dow is trying to figure it out where he got the $40 from. So that's what you were doing. And caches closed last night down that cash aim to buy that. Talking machine from Surat with that money does that and stood there, mumbling his mouth to watch him be anything.

Speaker 1:          32:56          Never blinked yet, but that's just $8 more. Does that and that voice, like it was just listening and never give him doing it himself. That's the one by team as to look that you quick kind of sliding his eyes that way that he looked down again. God knows if there was ever a man, it says still, they didn't say nothing. They just watch him waiting and him sliding his eyes to what? The feed and out the legs. But no, Ohio and the homeless, he says, so we know exactly what it takes to reach that fully dollar mach is to get $10 from do doubt. There's no time to talk about that. It's just straightforward. She was $10, um, for the left to fill your abortion and he got the $10 from her. Um, and um, he gets $8 from a cash it gas was going to use that to buy a telephone.

Speaker 1:          34:00          Um, that's very far from that goal. $40. So one very valuable thing has to be traded in order to him to get to $40. And there's just one thing left is the most obvious item that is in anyone's possession. Um, so we can turn now to, you know, uh, Jews, horse obviously is key from beginning to end. Um, but I just, since we've been talking about kinship between humans and animals, I just want to stop very briefly and, and once again, hold on the conjecture but I think that was [inaudible] is in here is in some ways taking this back to the moment when, um, is both a horse and the snake, right? You talked about that last time that he's caught between two posts. His both a horse bill also does something snake like about his movement. Um, and it seems that that association with the snake has been reinvested in ads.

Speaker 1:          35:10          So we have the image of him repeated twice as lightning, his eyes to Sgo, sliding his eyes to a defeat and up the legs, but no higher. It is not sliding motion that realize the human nonhuman configuration in as I lay dying. So that it is, and who is the snake in the family. Um, and it's as a jewel has suddenly been free from his kinship with the snake. Cause someone else, maybe there's just, this is also a zero sum game. There's only one person in a family who could claim kinship with the snake. And as right here is claiming kinship with the snake. So Joe is going to relinquish his friend, his kingship, um, and be redefined in a different way. So, um, but the, just to wrap up with cash is lost $8. Once again, true to his name. That's what he loses.

Speaker 1:          36:12          Still a very [inaudible]. Uh, but this is the big loser. Um, and he has that margin is per session so he can afford to lose big. Um, but let's start out with an image of Geo as still a half still having that thing. Uh, when, um, it's clear that when it, the emergent situation is becoming clear to everyone. Um, it is jewel that as is looking at, and Joe has not reacted in any fashion. So this is a true, um, turning point where things or have a moment of critical moment when things could have gone either way. Right? So the horse is still in Jews possession. Um, he doesn't have to give up. The horse is, would be impossible for as to take control of the horse is the last person to be able to control that wild horse. Only one person can control that whole list.

Speaker 1:          37:09          Joe. So this is a critical moment. How is as going to be able to get a hold of the host to sell the horse? Um, and it seems as if Julie has really tended in one direction, this is a route that he could have taken, but I'm giving it away in the sense that no, is the road not taken, but this is the one when we looked like this was row that he's about to take a, so as soon as Joe here is that, you know, it was, the horse is part of the Bhag and um, then it's spit slow and said hell, he turned and went onto the gate and on the, the Horse in God on it, they went outside that way. The two of them looking like some kind of spot is cycling still true to that original image of incredibly fast movement, almost super human in the speed with which the two of them move.

Speaker 1:          38:02          And also so the human, almost mythic in a sense that man and horse and become one does the Hemingway, um, image that is transposed onto fallen since the closest the farmer has worked ever get to Hemingway is Jew and the horse becoming one. Um, so it looks like that, you know, answers never gonna be able to get $40, because Joe and hosts had cleared out. Um, do you can still be a have if this were the ending of Sally die, this is what happens after that. The horse I said and answers boy taking that horse and clean out last night, probably halfway to Texas by now. And as, I don't know who Brung it used to, said I never see them. I just found the Horse in the barn this morning. They went to few, uh, told Mr snoops he said to bring the team over here. So the team of mew arrives because Mr Snow's did get the whole list and only one person could have brought the horse to Snopes.

Speaker 1:          39:13          So, um, jus becomes, I have not, when we can see why he's losing his kinship to the snake is becoming, have not by voluntarily like relinquishing his possession of the horse. He is the most tragic figure. He one says, uh, because he has the most power to refuse to live, relinquish that procession. And he is the one who actually our office power actually willfully, deliberately, consciously gives up that possession. Um, so, um, it, the time has come for remapping of the whole tennis ship structure. Um, and as I lay dying, Gio has up to this point being been the outsider to the family. Here's the one that everyone picks out as being a non-kin by Dow and by do doubt. Um, but this is the moment when all of a sudden he's been admitted for the first time into the family circle and was interesting is that this will join of the kinship lies is dramatize by Faulkner as through racialization of both cash and kill.

Speaker 1:          40:35          And we can stay why they are both racialized at this critical moment. They become chin because they both become black. Kansas leg and foot turned black. He held the lamb and look at caches for and like where it was black. You full, it looks like a negative. His foot cat, I said Ju was lying on his back on his face. His bag was rare. Do they'll put the medicine on it. The Madison was made of butter and stood to draw the fire. Then his back was black. Does it hurt you? I said, your back looks like a niggers Joe as that Cassius foot. And like look like a negatives. This is really heavy handed a father. They both look like niggers. Um, and for two different reasons. Um, caches, foot, um, is turning black because they put concrete on it by two sinks, the leg does this fix the broken leg, the abundance, I put concrete on it.

Speaker 1:          41:41          That's the way of, that's the medical practice within the bundle and family. So his foot is turning black at this moment. Um, and Jews, um, back is whack because he'd just been in the fire. He's the one who actually safe the coffin. Others dubious thing to do. He's the one who actually saved the coffin when the bottom was selling fire. Um, and as a consequence again, he gets this severe burn on his back and that's why his back is all black. So each of them, Ashley, um, has lost something and they gain something. They don't have a normal color, like have a normal color back. They've gone, they've gained a black legging and plan back, um, and is in as a result of, you know, being black and in this manner and all of a sudden they become brothers. So, um, this is a new concept of brotherhood. Uh, and new membership been proposed for that kinship structure. Uh, Joe, who's previously been outside of that cancer can shift circle has been a minute and we'll see who is going to be excluded once again to sales game. You know, someone has been learning, um, who is it and for what reason is he going to be left out?

Speaker 1:          43:13          It wasn't nothing else to do. It was either send him to Jackson or have to Massbay sewers because he knows some way the dowel set fire to it. So everything is interlocking and father it is that fire than turns Jews back into a black back. And the same fire also has consequences for other people. You don't set fire to the bond without someone paying for it. And it turns out that it is, uh, who is going to be here for it. And the language that is used here, this is cash. Who's speaking, I'm still in the voice of someone who's used to being helpless and used to not being able to modify the situation that is given this just nothing else to do. One person has to take the blame and to take the consequences of that blame. So one person has to be sent to Jackson.

Speaker 1:          44:22          And we know what Jackson is in already has been looming presence and the sound of the theory as the ultimate for bed Jay. Um, and it is actually the home for, for down much sooner than it will be for Benji. So let's look at two instances of the reconstituted of the narrowing of the kinship circle and cash, uh, talking now and looking at his brother Dao, but beginning to see his brother as a non-kin when doubt this is kept speaking. Um, and his actually, his sort of agrees with Dow that might maybe is a good thing to burn up the cart. And you know, it's just so humiliating for adding to be smelling and other buses descending on her. You know, they keep counting 10, and then more and more. Um, and everyone, all the towns, they go through, uh, wanting to sue them because of the terrible smell that is coming from the coffin.

Speaker 1:          45:28          Um, so because of this other humiliation that's been visited upon hourly, it would have been a good thing to burn up the coffin. And because it wasn't going to happen and nobody else was going to do at Dow was going to do it. So cash can see the reason for wanting to burn up the coffin, but he can also see that maybe is not such a great thing for the person who was doing it. When Dalcin that look like one of us would have to do something, I can almost believe he done right in a way, but I don't reckon nothing. Excuses setting fire to man's bond and endangering his stock and destroying his property. That's how I reckon recommend man is crazy. That's how I can see eye to eye. That's how he can see eye to eye with other folks. And I reckon the end, nothing else to do with him.

Speaker 1:          46:17          But what the most folks says is right. So cash ceiling, his bond with Dow as Dow, his brother, the kids should bond is superseded by a much more clearcut [inaudible] relation is you down really has no relation to Joe sp other than that he is the destroyer of Gillespies property, but it is the destroyer of gymnastics property that he will get sent to Jackson. Is that impersonal? Their relationship, they were defined down in the hand and not his kinship with his brother. Two brothers. Um, so this is the exclusion, the beginning of the exclusion and the lodging for that exclusion, uh, of Dow from their family circle. Um, but it is vitamin who puts the case most strongly and clearly fallen in talking about that he went to Jackson, he went crazy and went to Jackson. Both lots of people didn't go crazy pie in cash and Joe and do thou in me then go crazy. We never did go crazy. We didn't go through Jackson leader.

Speaker 1:          47:42          This is a child. He's still clueless, but he's also the most ominous, um, that the family from now on is going to be part and cash and jewel and do it out. And me father man is not going to include, I think work's been radically reconstitute it. Um, and it is on the basis of that reconstitution that we can think about, uh, as behalf not as the, that have not, I think Dow and jewelers and metrical that Science Joe has given up the thing that is most monitoring monetarily valuable and he's given up the thing that is most humanly valuable. Dal has gone to Jackson. This is Dov speaking and then speak referring to himself in the third person talking about himself as in the third person that has gone to Jackson, they put him on another train laughing down a long car, current law, laughing and has turning the heads of hours when he passed.

Speaker 1:          48:45          What are you laughing at? I said, yes, yes, yes, yes. Dow is our brother, our brother Dao. Oh, brother Zhao in occasion, Jackson where his grime has blind with light in the is looking out his phones. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. So he's lost his mind. That's what there is to lose in the cause of this novel. He has lost his family. We know that. That's one of the, uh, nonmonetary things that can also be lost as lost as brothers is lost. Everything is lost, his freedom. And he also has lost his mind. So we can really think of a darker, and then this, and it says a lot about Faulkner, that this dockers of endings is Ashley stuck in the middle of a story. They actually, as a comic, and they, and that's what fat does. What John does.
