00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.761
Here some picture of what most people associate
when they think of chemistry.

00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:08.905
They think of scientists
working on a bench

00:00:08.905 --> 00:00:11.808
with the different vials
of different chemicals.

00:00:11.808 --> 00:00:14.386
They might think of a mad scientist.

00:00:14.386 --> 00:00:16.862
Some of them boiling and changing colors.

00:00:16.862 --> 00:00:19.595
They might associate chemistry
with chemical equations.

00:00:19.595 --> 00:00:22.704
Thinking about how different
things will react together

00:00:22.704 --> 00:00:24.530
to form other things.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.413
They might think about models
of the different molecules

00:00:28.413 --> 00:00:30.354
that can be depicted different ways.

00:00:30.354 --> 00:00:33.782
They might associate it with
the periodic table of elements.

00:00:33.782 --> 00:00:38.000
And all of these things are
a big part of chemistry.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.992
But I want you to do in this video

00:00:39.992 --> 00:00:44.159
is appreciate what at its
essence chemistry is all about.

00:00:45.424 --> 00:00:47.990
And chemistry is one of the sciences

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.845
that really just helps us understand

00:00:50.845 --> 00:00:55.611
and make models and make
predictions about our reality.

00:00:55.611 --> 00:00:57.967
And even something like the
periodic table of elements,

00:00:57.967 --> 00:01:00.986
which you'll see at the front
of any chemistry classroom,

00:01:00.986 --> 00:01:02.485
you take it for granted.

00:01:02.485 --> 00:01:05.953
But this is the product of, frankly,

00:01:05.953 --> 00:01:08.650
thousands of years of human beings

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.485
trying to get to an understanding

00:01:10.485 --> 00:01:13.542
of all of the different
complexity in the world.

00:01:13.542 --> 00:01:15.369
If you look at the world around us,

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.563
and it doesn't even have to be our planet,

00:01:17.563 --> 00:01:19.719
it could be the universe around us,

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:21.876
you see all these different substances

00:01:21.876 --> 00:01:24.359
that seem to be different in certain ways.

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:28.180
You see things like
fire and rock and water.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.928
Even in the planets,

00:01:29.928 --> 00:01:32.492
you see meteorological patterns.

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:35.395
In life, you see all of this complexity

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:36.511
and all of these different things

00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:39.326
and it looks like there's
just like a infinite spectrum

00:01:39.326 --> 00:01:40.739
of differentness out of there.

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:42.229
Of different substances.

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:43.679
Even in things like our human brain.

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:47.244
The complexity and the
electrochemical interactions.

00:01:47.244 --> 00:01:50.426
And you could imagine as a species,

00:01:50.426 --> 00:01:51.752
this is kind of overwhelming.

00:01:51.752 --> 00:01:53.993
How do you make the sense of all of this?

00:01:53.993 --> 00:01:56.326
And it was not an easy path,

00:01:57.767 --> 00:01:59.462
but over thousands of years,

00:01:59.462 --> 00:02:01.572
we did start to make sense of it.

00:02:01.572 --> 00:02:03.979
And why it's very lucky for all of us

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.472
to be born when we are now

00:02:05.472 --> 00:02:07.459
or to be around when we are now.

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:09.406
To be able to learn
chemistry where we are now

00:02:09.406 --> 00:02:10.941
is that we get the answer.

00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:13.630
And it's a partial answer,
which is also exciting,

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.245
cause we don't want the full answer.

00:02:15.245 --> 00:02:17.439
But it's a partial answer
that takes us a long way.

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:19.964
We realize that the
periodic table of elements,

00:02:19.964 --> 00:02:23.567
that all of this complexity
that we're seeing before,

00:02:23.567 --> 00:02:24.772
that at the end of the day,

00:02:24.772 --> 00:02:27.054
things are made of basic building blocks.

00:02:27.054 --> 00:02:29.544
Kind of you could imagine the legos

00:02:29.544 --> 00:02:31.127
that really make up everything.

00:02:31.127 --> 00:02:33.283
And there aren't an
infinite number of legos.

00:02:33.283 --> 00:02:34.813
There's actually a finite number of them.

00:02:34.813 --> 00:02:36.598
We're discovering more all of the time,

00:02:36.598 --> 00:02:37.431
well not all of the time,

00:02:37.431 --> 00:02:39.942
now new elements are not
discovered that frequently,

00:02:39.942 --> 00:02:41.562
but there's a few of these elements

00:02:41.562 --> 00:02:44.050
that are disproportionately showing up

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.789
in a lot of what we see here.

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:48.727
These things that seem so different.

00:02:48.727 --> 00:02:51.586
Well a lot of this is different
compositions of elements

00:02:51.586 --> 00:02:54.652
like carbon and oxygen and hydrogen.

00:02:54.652 --> 00:02:56.936
And even the elements
themselves are made of things

00:02:56.936 --> 00:03:00.212
like protons and electrons and neutrons

00:03:00.212 --> 00:03:02.284
that are just rearranged in different ways

00:03:02.284 --> 00:03:04.024
to give us these elements

00:03:04.024 --> 00:03:07.691
that have all of these
different properties.

00:03:08.761 --> 00:03:10.920
So when you think about chemistry,

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.562
yes, it might visually
look something like this.

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:17.426
These are obviously much older pictures.

00:03:17.426 --> 00:03:20.778
But at its essence, it's
how do we create models

00:03:20.778 --> 00:03:23.224
and understand the models that describe

00:03:23.224 --> 00:03:27.192
a lot of the complexity
in the universe around us?

00:03:27.192 --> 00:03:29.767
And just to put chemistry in,

00:03:29.767 --> 00:03:31.630
I guess you could say, in context

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.188
with some of the other sciences,

00:03:34.188 --> 00:03:37.291
many people would say at the purest level,

00:03:37.291 --> 00:03:40.019
you would have mathematics.

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.769
That math, you're studying ideas,

00:03:43.956 --> 00:03:46.141
which could even be independent,

00:03:46.141 --> 00:03:48.412
you're seeing logical ideas
that could be even independent

00:03:48.412 --> 00:03:51.941
of anything that you've ever
observed or experienced.

00:03:51.941 --> 00:03:54.462
And a lot of folks that
say if we ever communicate

00:03:54.462 --> 00:03:56.201
with another intelligent species

00:03:56.201 --> 00:03:58.111
that could be completely
different than us,

00:03:58.111 --> 00:04:00.517
math might be that common language.

00:04:00.517 --> 00:04:03.541
Because even if we perceive
the world differently

00:04:03.541 --> 00:04:05.157
and think differently in certain ways,

00:04:05.157 --> 00:04:07.765
math might be that common language.

00:04:07.765 --> 00:04:10.669
But on top of math, we start to say,

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.931
well how is our reality
actually structured?

00:04:13.931 --> 00:04:15.469
At the most basic level,

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:17.168
what are the constituents of matter

00:04:17.168 --> 00:04:19.567
and what are the mathematical properties

00:04:19.567 --> 00:04:22.380
that describe how they react together?

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.831
And then, or interact with each other?

00:04:24.831 --> 00:04:26.986
Then you go one level above that,

00:04:26.986 --> 00:04:30.921
you get to the topic of this
video, which is chemistry.

00:04:30.921 --> 00:04:34.228
Which is very closely related to physics.

00:04:34.228 --> 00:04:36.345
When we talk about
these chemical equations

00:04:36.345 --> 00:04:38.870
and we create these molecular structures,

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.929
the interactions between these atoms,

00:04:41.929 --> 00:04:45.293
these are quantum mechanical interactions

00:04:45.293 --> 00:04:49.640
which we do not fully understand
at the deepest level yet.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.343
But with chemistry, we
can start to make use

00:04:52.343 --> 00:04:55.201
of the math and they physics
to start to think about

00:04:55.201 --> 00:04:56.976
how all of these different building blocks

00:04:56.976 --> 00:05:00.584
can interact to explain all
sorts of different phenomena.

00:05:00.584 --> 00:05:02.406
This chemical equation you see right here,

00:05:02.406 --> 00:05:03.653
this is combustion.

00:05:03.653 --> 00:05:05.929
This is hydrogen combusting with oxygen

00:05:05.929 --> 00:05:07.793
to produce a lot of energy.

00:05:07.793 --> 00:05:09.293
To produce energy.

00:05:10.705 --> 00:05:12.784
When we imagine combustion,
we think of fire.

00:05:12.784 --> 00:05:16.343
But what even is fire at
its most fundamental level?

00:05:16.343 --> 00:05:17.378
How do we get,

00:05:17.378 --> 00:05:19.941
why do we perceive this thing here?

00:05:19.941 --> 00:05:21.400
And chemistry is super important

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.335
because on top of that, we build biology.

00:05:25.335 --> 00:05:26.752
We build biology.

00:05:27.737 --> 00:05:29.892
And as you'll see as you
study all of these things,

00:05:29.892 --> 00:05:32.752
there's points where these
things start to bleed together.

00:05:32.752 --> 00:05:34.992
But the biology in, say, a human being,

00:05:34.992 --> 00:05:36.942
or really in any species,

00:05:36.942 --> 00:05:39.297
it's based on molecular interactions.

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:42.230
Interactions between
molecules, between atoms,

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.378
which, at the end of the
day, is all about chemistry.

00:05:45.378 --> 00:05:47.948
As I speak, the only reason
why I'm able to speak

00:05:47.948 --> 00:05:50.516
is because of really,

00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:53.991
hard to imagine the number
of chemical interactions

00:05:53.991 --> 00:05:56.776
happening in me right now

00:05:56.776 --> 00:05:58.560
to create this soundness.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.841
To create this thing that thinks it exists

00:06:00.841 --> 00:06:03.575
that wants to make a
video about how awesome

00:06:03.575 --> 00:06:05.642
and amazing chemistry is.

00:06:05.642 --> 00:06:06.759
And then from biology,

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:08.826
you can build out on
all of everything else.

00:06:08.826 --> 00:06:11.812
So sciences like psychology
and economics, which of course,

00:06:11.812 --> 00:06:14.749
these things also leverage
math and other things.

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:17.742
But this gives you kind of a sense

00:06:17.742 --> 00:06:22.087
of how we build up and how we
explain the reality around us.

00:06:22.087 --> 00:06:25.025
And not one of these is more
important than the other.

00:06:25.025 --> 00:06:27.961
These are all studying
incredibly fascinating things

00:06:27.961 --> 00:06:31.607
that as humans beings
first became thoughtful

00:06:31.607 --> 00:06:33.268
about their environment,

00:06:33.268 --> 00:06:35.384
said, "Gee, why are we here?

00:06:35.384 --> 00:06:36.417
"What is this place?

00:06:36.417 --> 00:06:37.905
"Why do we exist?

00:06:37.905 --> 00:06:39.852
"How do we exist?"

00:06:39.852 --> 00:06:42.253
And chemistry builds models

00:06:42.253 --> 00:06:45.602
for us to understand interactions
at a scale and a speed

00:06:45.602 --> 00:06:47.338
that we can't directly observe,

00:06:47.338 --> 00:06:50.397
but nonetheless, we can to
start to make predictions.

00:06:50.397 --> 00:06:52.253
So that's what's really cool about this.

00:06:52.253 --> 00:06:53.287
When you study chemistry,

00:06:53.287 --> 00:06:56.276
you should not view this
as some type of a chore

00:06:56.276 --> 00:07:00.294
that the school system
is forcing you through.

00:07:00.294 --> 00:07:04.100
There are people who would've
done anything 100 years ago

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.544
to get the answers that are
in your chemistry book today

00:07:07.544 --> 00:07:09.488
or that you can learn from
your chemistry teacher

00:07:09.488 --> 00:07:11.891
or that you can learn
from a Khan Academy video.

00:07:11.891 --> 00:07:14.583
There are people in the
world in the past and today

00:07:14.583 --> 00:07:16.872
who'd do anything to be
able to understand deeply

00:07:16.872 --> 00:07:17.822
what this is.

00:07:17.822 --> 00:07:19.393
That they consider it a privilege

00:07:19.393 --> 00:07:22.226
to be able to learn at this level.

00:07:23.098 --> 00:07:25.030
And then to think about
where this could go

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.017
because none of these fields are complete.

00:07:27.017 --> 00:07:30.861
We have very partial knowledge
of all of these fields.

00:07:30.861 --> 00:07:33.542
Arguably, there's an infinite
more that we could learn

00:07:33.542 --> 00:07:35.201
relative to what we know.

00:07:35.201 --> 00:07:37.980
But what's exciting is that
we have such a strong start.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.630
We're starting to make sense of it.

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:43.380
To really describe
everything in our reality.
