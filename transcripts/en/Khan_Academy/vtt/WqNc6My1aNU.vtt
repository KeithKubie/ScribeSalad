00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.450
The quotient of two
polynomials-- a of x and b

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:04.825
of x-- can be
written in the form

00:00:04.825 --> 00:00:09.700
a of x over b of x is equal to
q of x plus r of x over b of x--

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.020
where q of x and r
of x are polynomials

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.280
and the degree of r of x is
less than the degree of b of x.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.410
Write the quotient
7x to the sixth

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.054
plus x to the third plus 2x plus
1 over x squared in this form.

00:00:27.054 --> 00:00:28.720
Well, this one is
pretty straightforward

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.657
because we're
dividing by x squared.

00:00:31.657 --> 00:00:33.240
So you could literally
view this as 7x

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.590
to the sixth
divided by x squared

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.810
plus x to the third divided
by x squared plus 2x divided

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.467
by x squared plus 1
divided by x squared.

00:00:42.467 --> 00:00:44.050
So we could just do
this term by term.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.030
What's 7x to the sixth
divided by x squared?

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.680
Well, x to the sixth divided by
x squared is x to the fourth.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.570
So it's going to be 7x
to the fourth power.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.260
And then, same thing
right over here.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.850
Plus x to the third
divided by x squared.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.320
Well, that's just going to be x.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.450
So plus x.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.320
And then, we're going to
have 2x divided by x squared.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.750
But remember, we
want to write it

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.570
in a form of r of x over
b of x-- where r of x

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.290
has a lower degree than b of x.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.610
Well, 2x has a lower
degree than x squared.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.410
Here this is degree 1.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.890
This is degree 2.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.070
So you could write it as
plus 2x over x squared.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.380
Like that.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.220
And then, you could write
plus 1 over x squared.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.512
So you could do this--
plus 1 over x squared.

00:01:37.512 --> 00:01:38.845
So you could write it like that.

00:01:38.845 --> 00:01:40.803
But that's not exactly
the form that they want.

00:01:40.803 --> 00:01:44.020
They want us to write it q
of x-- and you could view

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.560
that as 7x to the fourth plus x.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.920
And then, they want plus
r of x over b of x So

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.500
plus some polynomial over
x squared in this case.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.500
So instead of writing it as 2x
over x squared plus 1 over x

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.090
squared, we could just write
it as 2x plus 1 over x squared.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.880
So one way to think about it.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.620
So let me just put
some parentheses

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.650
here so that it interprets
my typing correctly.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.810
So notice, this part
of the polynomial,

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.410
these terms have an equal or
higher degree than x squared.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.620
So I just divided those.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.130
7x to the sixth divided by x
squared is 7x to the fourth.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.160
x to the third divided
by x squared is x.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.440
And then, once I got two terms
that had a lower degree than x

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.690
squared, I just left on there.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.820
I just said plus whatever 2x
plus 1 divided by x squared is.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.735
And that's the form that they
wanted us to write it in.

00:02:37.735 --> 00:02:38.910
We'll check our answer.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.980
And we got it right.
