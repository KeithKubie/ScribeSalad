begins to change the way you think about
 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.670
begins to change the way you think about
the future as well

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680

so if if I'm able to you know hold in my

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390
so if if I'm able to you know hold in my
 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.380
so if if I'm able to you know hold in my
mind the whole scope of human evolution

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390
mind the whole scope of human evolution
 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.780
mind the whole scope of human evolution
and allow that to kind of inform my

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790
and allow that to kind of inform my
 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.130
and allow that to kind of inform my
worldview like what are some of the ways

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140
worldview like what are some of the ways
 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.710
worldview like what are some of the ways
I mean I know it's it's a pretty vast

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720
I mean I know it's it's a pretty vast
 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.810
I mean I know it's it's a pretty vast
concept but I what are some of the ways

concept but I what are some of the ways
 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.910
concept but I what are some of the ways
in which that might change the way I go

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920
in which that might change the way I go
 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.990
in which that might change the way I go
about living my everyday life like in in

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000
about living my everyday life like in in

have you know multiple effects on how we

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220
have you know multiple effects on how we
 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.900
have you know multiple effects on how we
see all kinds of things how we see you

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910
see all kinds of things how we see you
 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.550
see all kinds of things how we see you
know the institutions of human culture

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560
know the institutions of human culture
 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.530
know the institutions of human culture
at all levels political economic social

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540
at all levels political economic social
 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.640
at all levels political economic social
structure social institutions it but you

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650
structure social institutions it but you
 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.270
structure social institutions it but you
know it begins to kind of place our own

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280
know it begins to kind of place our own
 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.400
know it begins to kind of place our own
you know we start to recognize ourselves

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410
you know we start to recognize ourselves
 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.949
you know we start to recognize ourselves
as this sort of advanced advancing edge

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959
as this sort of advanced advancing edge
 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.100
as this sort of advanced advancing edge
in some sense of this vast process of

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110
in some sense of this vast process of
 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.009
in some sense of this vast process of
becoming and that's quite a powerful

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019
becoming and that's quite a powerful
 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.060
becoming and that's quite a powerful
position and place to see human

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070
position and place to see human
 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.400
position and place to see human
consciousness and human culture in light

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410
consciousness and human culture in light
 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.479
consciousness and human culture in light
of that vast evolutionary process and I

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489
of that vast evolutionary process and I
 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.009
of that vast evolutionary process and I
think you you know it places a kind of a

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019
think you you know it places a kind of a
 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.110
think you you know it places a kind of a
tremendous you know cuz from the but

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120
tremendous you know cuz from the but
 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.690
tremendous you know cuz from the but
from the perspective of time you know

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700
from the perspective of time you know
 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.539
from the perspective of time you know
that whole trajectory where as far as we

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549
that whole trajectory where as far as we
 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.640
that whole trajectory where as far as we
as far as we know where the evolutionary

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650
as far as we know where the evolutionary
 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:58.990
as far as we know where the evolutionary
will right at the edge we're right the

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000
will right at the edge we're right the
 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.400
will right at the edge we're right the
evolutionary edge from the perspective

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410
evolutionary edge from the perspective
 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.800
evolutionary edge from the perspective
of time and so when you start to see

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810
of time and so when you start to see
 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.900
of time and so when you start to see
yourself you know at the edge of this

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910
yourself you know at the edge of this
 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.610
yourself you know at the edge of this
kind of creative process that's giving

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620
kind of creative process that's giving
 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.550
kind of creative process that's giving
birth to to so much in the lat and all

you know that period whether whether we

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420
you know that period whether whether we
 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.880
you know that period whether whether we
track at the last 10,000 years the last

billion years it's given birth to so
 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.630
billion years it's given birth to so
much in terms of the creativity of this

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640
much in terms of the creativity of this
 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.580
much in terms of the creativity of this
whole process then when you start to

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590
whole process then when you start to
 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.380
whole process then when you start to
think about our life like that starts to

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390
think about our life like that starts to
 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.000

you start to you start
change the way you relate to your sense

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130
change the way you relate to your sense
 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.580
change the way you relate to your sense
of what's you know of what human life is

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590
of what's you know of what human life is
 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.220
of what's you know of what human life is
and the meaning in human life and then

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230
and the meaning in human life and then
 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.690
and the meaning in human life and then
when we start to think about culture in

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700
when we start to think about culture in
 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.630
when we start to think about culture in
the last hundreds of years the last

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640
the last hundreds of years the last
 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.610
the last hundreds of years the last
thousands of years and we see the way in

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620
thousands of years and we see the way in
 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.760
thousands of years and we see the way in
which we've developed as a species and

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770
which we've developed as a species and
 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.270
which we've developed as a species and
the progress we've made and the

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280
the progress we've made and the
 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.370
the progress we've made and the
challenges we faced and the difficulties

challenges we faced and the difficulties
 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.320
challenges we faced and the difficulties
we've had we see it in light of this

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330
we've had we see it in light of this
 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.470
we've had we see it in light of this
prog project of human development and

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480
prog project of human development and
 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.670
prog project of human development and
the betterment of the human condition

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680
the betterment of the human condition
 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.120
the betterment of the human condition
over time you know we start to have a

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130
over time you know we start to have a
 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.300
over time you know we start to have a
deeper faith in the potential of the

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310
deeper faith in the potential of the
 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.940
deeper faith in the potential of the
future and a deeper sense of optimism

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950
future and a deeper sense of optimism
 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.830
future and a deeper sense of optimism
about what's possible for the future not

about what's possible for the future not
 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.650
about what's possible for the future not
like a naive Optus optimism not like we

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660
like a naive Optus optimism not like we
 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.880
like a naive Optus optimism not like we
know things are gonna be better than the

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890
know things are gonna be better than the
 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.160
know things are gonna be better than the
past but the sense of while we see this

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.170
past but the sense of while we see this
 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.900
past but the sense of while we see this
developmental process we've been on as

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910
developmental process we've been on as
 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.300
developmental process we've been on as
human beings and and it's creating art

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310
human beings and and it's creating art
 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.040
human beings and and it's creating art
this society and we see that the

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050
this society and we see that the
 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.950
this society and we see that the
struggles and this trajectory but we see

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960
struggles and this trajectory but we see
 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.600
struggles and this trajectory but we see
the way we've kind of built up from you

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610
the way we've kind of built up from you
 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.150
the way we've kind of built up from you
know this hunter-gatherers with all the

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160
know this hunter-gatherers with all the
 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.530
know this hunter-gatherers with all the
problems we have and all the

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540
problems we have and all the
 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.540
problems we have and all the
difficulties of our civilization we also

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550
difficulties of our civilization we also
 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.220
difficulties of our civilization we also
see these incredible the incredible

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.230
see these incredible the incredible
 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.140
see these incredible the incredible
breakthroughs in progress we made and we

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150
breakthroughs in progress we made and we
 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.390
breakthroughs in progress we made and we
start to see things in light of that

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400
start to see things in light of that
 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.460
start to see things in light of that
context it gives us this the sense of

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470
context it gives us this the sense of
 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.190
context it gives us this the sense of
potential and meaning and faith and and

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200
potential and meaning and faith and and
 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.250
potential and meaning and faith and and
and also it kind of empowers that sense

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.260
and also it kind of empowers that sense
 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.860
and also it kind of empowers that sense
of responsibility for taking the next

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870
of responsibility for taking the next
 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.960
of responsibility for taking the next
step and for being responsible for that

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970
step and for being responsible for that
 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.250
step and for being responsible for that
next step so help me understand this so

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260
next step so help me understand this so
 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.150
next step so help me understand this so
like you know for me I feel that we've

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160
like you know for me I feel that we've
 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.430
like you know for me I feel that we've
as a species we've made progress in many

you know difficulties of our species sir

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740
you know difficulties of our species sir
 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.800

you know and and and of course like if
we were ever to arrive at the point when

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:10.670
we were ever to arrive at the point when
 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.000
we were ever to arrive at the point when
which you know thankfully didn't happen

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.010
which you know thankfully didn't happen
 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.370
which you know thankfully didn't happen
during the Cold War where we blew

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380
during the Cold War where we blew
 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.470
during the Cold War where we blew
ourselves up with some technology that

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.480
ourselves up with some technology that
 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.880
ourselves up with some technology that
wasn't available when we were cavemen

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:18.890
wasn't available when we were cavemen
 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.150

then would say well what really happened

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160
then would say well what really happened
 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.220
then would say well what really happened
overall you know do you see the whole

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:24.230
overall you know do you see the whole
 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.610
overall you know do you see the whole
thing as progressing in a positive sense

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620
thing as progressing in a positive sense
 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.730

that teaches us that therefore we can
 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.120
that teaches us that therefore we can
move forward not that like there's a

move forward not that like there's a
 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.700
move forward not that like there's a
that there's a grand design that we are

that there's a grand design that we are
 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.430
that there's a grand design that we are
moving forward I don't believe in grand

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440
moving forward I don't believe in grand

development that we've been on and the
 

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.730

sense of that as you said the sense of
 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.640
sense of that as you said the sense of
potential progress but I don't believe

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:05.650
potential progress but I don't believe
 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.230

I I think progress is a delicate word

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:17.550
I I think progress is a delicate word

I I think progress is a delicate word
obviously and there's been a lot of

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.050
obviously and there's been a lot of

notion of progress but I think we're
 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.590
notion of progress but I think we're
starting to see it and much of that had

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:31.600
starting to see it and much of that had
 

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.970
starting to see it and much of that had
to do with the nature of the 20th

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:44.170
evolution evolutionary ideas can be
 

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:46.470
evolution evolutionary ideas can be
dangerous and sometimes very naive and

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:46.480
dangerous and sometimes very naive and
 

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.770
dangerous and sometimes very naive and
very you know all kinds of mischief was

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:49.780
very you know all kinds of mischief was
 

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:53.850
very you know all kinds of mischief was
created by very backward what we call

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:53.860
created by very backward what we call
 

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.890
created by very backward what we call
timoni called great limited very narrow

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:55.900
timoni called great limited very narrow
 

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.200
timoni called great limited very narrow
ideas about what constitutes evolution

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:58.210
ideas about what constitutes evolution
 

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.990
ideas about what constitutes evolution
and culture you know in some of you know

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:01.000
and culture you know in some of you know
 

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.460
and culture you know in some of you know
some of a lot of the problems in 20th

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:02.470
some of a lot of the problems in 20th
 

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:03.720
some of a lot of the problems in 20th
century were created by that so there's

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:03.730
century were created by that so there's
 

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:06.660
century were created by that so there's
kind of this hesitation to begin to

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:06.670
kind of this hesitation to begin to
 

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:09.690
kind of this hesitation to begin to
speak about these ideas so we can add

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:09.700
speak about these ideas so we can add
 

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.000
speak about these ideas so we can add
that as context to how we think about it

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.010
that as context to how we think about it
 

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:16.590
that as context to how we think about it
but nevertheless I think if you you know

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:16.600
but nevertheless I think if you you know
 

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.920
but nevertheless I think if you you know
I do think you can track this

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:18.930
I do think you can track this
 

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:21.270
I do think you can track this
progression of human history in all

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:21.280
progression of human history in all
 

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.650
progression of human history in all
kinds of ways in my book I go through

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:22.660
kinds of ways in my book I go through
 

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:23.850
kinds of ways in my book I go through
different thinkers who track it in

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:23.860
different thinkers who track it in
 

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:24.900
different thinkers who track it in
different ways you can look at the

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:24.910
different ways you can look at the
 

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.540
different ways you can look at the
evolution of of you know culture the

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:27.550
evolution of of you know culture the
 

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:29.370
evolution of of you know culture the
evolution of economic institutions the

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:29.380
evolution of economic institutions the
 

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:32.250
evolution of economic institutions the
evolution of you know worldviews the

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:32.260
evolution of you know worldviews the
 

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.020
evolution of you know worldviews the
evolution of Technology the evolution of

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:34.030
evolution of Technology the evolution of
 

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.909
evolution of Technology the evolution of
politics the evolution of you know

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:35.919
politics the evolution of you know
 

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:37.290
politics the evolution of you know
deeper issues like the evolution of

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:37.300
deeper issues like the evolution of
 

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:38.640
deeper issues like the evolution of
consciousness at some level the

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:38.650
consciousness at some level the
 

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:41.460
consciousness at some level the
evolution of perspectives the evolution

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:41.470
evolution of perspectives the evolution
 

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.620
evolution of perspectives the evolution
you can you can track evolution along

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:43.630
you can you can track evolution along
 

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.020
you can you can track evolution along
different different trajectories but I

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:46.030
different different trajectories but I
 

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.640
different different trajectories but I
think they all point to this overall

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:47.650
think they all point to this overall
 

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.680
think they all point to this overall
development that is occurring now the

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:50.690
development that is occurring now the
 

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:52.630
development that is occurring now the
riki part of development is that there's

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:52.640
riki part of development is that there's
 

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.030
riki part of development is that there's
always this progress and pathology point

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:55.040
always this progress and pathology point
 

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.860
always this progress and pathology point
meaning that even as we make certain

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:56.870
meaning that even as we make certain
 

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.660
meaning that even as we make certain
progress we have we create new problems

00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:58.670
progress we have we create new problems
 

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:00.700
progress we have we create new problems
with that progress so the Western

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:00.710
with that progress so the Western
 

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:01.780
with that progress so the Western
enlightenment and Industrial Revolution

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:01.790
enlightenment and Industrial Revolution
 

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:03.640
enlightenment and Industrial Revolution
was this tremendous progress in an

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:03.650
was this tremendous progress in an
 

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:05.260
was this tremendous progress in an
uplift of the human condition in so many

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:05.270
uplift of the human condition in so many
 

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:07.750
uplift of the human condition in so many
ways yet it created its own series of

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:07.760
ways yet it created its own series of
 

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.610
ways yet it created its own series of
pathologies it's a massive series of

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:09.620
pathologies it's a massive series of
 

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.200
pathologies it's a massive series of
pathologies which are incredibly

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:11.210
pathologies which are incredibly
 

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:13.840
pathologies which are incredibly
dangerous simply because it's like the

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:13.850
dangerous simply because it's like the
 

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:15.790
dangerous simply because it's like the
power of the progress itself makes the

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:15.800
power of the progress itself makes the
 

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.770
power of the progress itself makes the
power of the pathologies that much more

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:17.780
power of the pathologies that much more
 

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.480
power of the pathologies that much more
tricky and that much more and so then

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:19.490
tricky and that much more and so then
 

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:21.790
tricky and that much more and so then
the new way a new a new worldview sort

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:21.800
the new way a new a new worldview sort
 

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.130
the new way a new a new worldview sort
of arose to begin to address those

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:24.140
of arose to begin to address those
 

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.470
of arose to begin to address those
pathologies and so you see this this

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:26.480
pathologies and so you see this this
 

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.480
pathologies and so you see this this
dialect you know this dialectic

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:28.490
dialect you know this dialectic
 

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:30.160
dialect you know this dialectic
relationship in the development of

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:30.170
relationship in the development of
 

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:31.180
relationship in the development of
history so there's nothing guaranteed

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:31.190
history so there's nothing guaranteed
 

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:33.790
history so there's nothing guaranteed
and there's no and you know and each new

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:33.800
and there's no and you know and each new
 

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.580
and there's no and you know and each new
level creates its own issues and its own

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:36.590
level creates its own issues and its own
 

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:37.870
level creates its own issues and its own
difficulties and we have to take

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:37.880
difficulties and we have to take
 

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.610
difficulties and we have to take
responsibility for those and but we're

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:39.620
responsibility for those and but we're
 

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.860
responsibility for those and but we're
starting to think to recognize more how

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:41.870
starting to think to recognize more how
 

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:43.810
starting to think to recognize more how
that is happening the more we recognize

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:43.820
that is happening the more we recognize
 

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:45.160
that is happening the more we recognize
how that is happening the more we can

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:45.170
how that is happening the more we can
 

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:46.750
how that is happening the more we can
actually take responsibility for that

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:46.760
actually take responsibility for that
 

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.580
actually take responsibility for that
process because we've been we haven't

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:48.590
process because we've been we haven't
 

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:49.870
process because we've been we haven't
known where on this developmental

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:49.880
known where on this developmental
 

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.640
known where on this developmental
trajectory over the last 20 years we

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:51.650
trajectory over the last 20 years we
 

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:53.020
trajectory over the last 20 years we
haven't known this this is new

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:53.030
haven't known this this is new
 

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.550
haven't known this this is new
information in culture not just a

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560
information in culture not just a
 

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.140
information in culture not just a
cosmological evolution or biological

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:56.150
cosmological evolution or biological
 

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.630
cosmological evolution or biological
evolution but cultural evolution and

00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:58.640
evolution but cultural evolution and
 

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.610
evolution but cultural evolution and
some of this is he's just beginning to

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:00.620
some of this is he's just beginning to
 

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.860
some of this is he's just beginning to
work its way into into our thought and

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:02.870
work its way into into our thought and
 

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.180
work its way into into our thought and
so it's like it's like we're suddenly

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:04.190
so it's like it's like we're suddenly
 

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.580
so it's like it's like we're suddenly
waking up and so it's like you're in the

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:06.590
waking up and so it's like you're in the
 

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:08.050
waking up and so it's like you're in the
car and you're waking up and suddenly

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:08.060
car and you're waking up and suddenly
 

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.550
car and you're waking up and suddenly
it's like you're you're on the road

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:09.560
it's like you're you're on the road
 

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.110
it's like you're you're on the road
you're going somewhere and you have to

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.120
you're going somewhere and you have to
 

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.940
you're going somewhere and you have to
take control of the steering wheel in

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:12.950
take control of the steering wheel in
 

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:14.530
take control of the steering wheel in
some sense and of course if you're if

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:14.540
some sense and of course if you're if
 

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.120
some sense and of course if you're if
you're kind unconscious and you're kind

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:16.130
you're kind unconscious and you're kind
 

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:18.100
you're kind unconscious and you're kind
of wine you have a lot of wrecks you

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:18.110
of wine you have a lot of wrecks you
 

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:19.540
of wine you have a lot of wrecks you
know and you kind of steer as best you

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:19.550
know and you kind of steer as best you
 

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.130
know and you kind of steer as best you
can you just try to go for open space

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:21.140
can you just try to go for open space
 

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:24.280
can you just try to go for open space
yeah but but if you're if you start to

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:24.290
yeah but but if you're if you start to
 

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.930
yeah but but if you're if you start to
wake up then you start to see some of

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:25.940
wake up then you start to see some of
 

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.530
wake up then you start to see some of
the dynamics of evolution over the last

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:28.540
the dynamics of evolution over the last
 

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.700
the dynamics of evolution over the last
10,000 years and all the difficulties

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:30.710
10,000 years and all the difficulties
 

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:32.310
10,000 years and all the difficulties
but also the progress and the

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.320
but also the progress and the
 

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.420
but also the progress and the
development then you can start we can

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:34.430
development then you can start we can
 

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:37.120
development then you can start we can
start to take more you know on our

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:37.130
start to take more you know on our
 

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.910
start to take more you know on our
shoulders and see more what you know and

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:39.920
shoulders and see more what you know and
 

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.350
shoulders and see more what you know and
take it and that's what people mean when

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:41.360
take it and that's what people mean when
 

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.550
take it and that's what people mean when
they use the term conscious evolution

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:42.560
they use the term conscious evolution
 

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.300
they use the term conscious evolution
they mean consciously taking

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:45.310
they mean consciously taking
 

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:47.500
they mean consciously taking
responsibility for this process that's

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:47.510
responsibility for this process that's
 

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:52.900
responsibility for this process that's
no longer completely unconscious I'm can

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:52.910
no longer completely unconscious I'm can
 

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:54.880
no longer completely unconscious I'm can

progress you know so right right so I I
wonder also I mean the ideas in your

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:03.370
wonder also I mean the ideas in your
 

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.700
wonder also I mean the ideas in your
emerge out of you know conversations

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:05.710
emerge out of you know conversations
 

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:06.630
emerge out of you know conversations
you've been having things you've

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:06.640
you've been having things you've
 

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.460
you've been having things you've
observed as we've been the executive

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:08.470
observed as we've been the executive

editor of enlighten next magazine and
 

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.320
editor of enlighten next magazine and
also out of the thinking in enlightened

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:13.330
also out of the thinking in enlightened
 

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:16.260

next the organization yes and Andrew

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:16.270
next the organization yes and Andrew
 

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:19.500
next the organization yes and Andrew
Cohen who we've interviewed as well um

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:19.510
Cohen who we've interviewed as well um
 

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:23.070
Cohen who we've interviewed as well um
and I wonder what whether any kind of

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:23.080
and I wonder what whether any kind of
 

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.530
and I wonder what whether any kind of
dialogue positive negative both in

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:25.540
dialogue positive negative both in
 

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.030
dialogue positive negative both in
between you know what has been happening

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040
between you know what has been happening
 

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.510
between you know what has been happening
between you guys with these ideas about

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:30.520
between you guys with these ideas about
 

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.460
between you guys with these ideas about
evolutionary enlightenment and evolution

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:32.470
evolutionary enlightenment and evolution
 

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.139
evolutionary enlightenment and evolution
as a kind of lens for viewing the world

00:11:34.139 --> 00:11:34.149
as a kind of lens for viewing the world
 

00:11:34.149 --> 00:11:37.260
as a kind of lens for viewing the world
and the you know quote-unquote harder

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:37.270
and the you know quote-unquote harder
 

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:39.930

sciences of yeah evolutionary biology

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:39.940
sciences of yeah evolutionary biology
 

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.280
sciences of yeah evolutionary biology
and so on like have there been

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:41.290
and so on like have there been
 

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:43.110
and so on like have there been
conversations has there been pushed back

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:51.690
what what's what what's happening there
well yes and no yes in the sense that we

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:51.700
well yes and no yes in the sense that we
 

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.060
well yes and no yes in the sense that we
we love to interview scientists in the

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:54.070
we love to interview scientists in the
 

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.790
we love to interview scientists in the
magazine and we did you know a great we

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800
magazine and we did you know a great we
 

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.470
magazine and we did you know a great we
often did and we have some great

often did and we have some great
 

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.120
often did and we have some great
dialogues with scientists who were

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:00.130
dialogues with scientists who were
 

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:01.590
dialogues with scientists who were
exploring some of the edges of their own

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:01.600
exploring some of the edges of their own
 

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.269
exploring some of the edges of their own
field and some of the implications of

field and some of the implications of
 

00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:04.829
field and some of the implications of
their own fields in different ways

00:12:04.829 --> 00:12:04.839
their own fields in different ways
 

00:12:04.839 --> 00:12:08.000
their own fields in different ways
including evolutionary scientists so

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:08.010
including evolutionary scientists so
 

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:10.170
including evolutionary scientists so
there's certainly a dialogue there and

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:10.180
there's certainly a dialogue there and
 

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.030
there's certainly a dialogue there and
there's certainly interest there I still

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:12.040
there's certainly interest there I still
 

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.620
there's certainly interest there I still
think that mainstream when you talk

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:13.630
think that mainstream when you talk
 

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:16.260
think that mainstream when you talk
about you know we were in in light next

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:16.270
about you know we were in in light next

magazine we were coming at this from a

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:17.650
magazine we were coming at this from a
 

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:19.260
magazine we were coming at this from a
more spirit from spiritually oriented

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:19.270
more spirit from spiritually oriented
 

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.750
more spirit from spiritually oriented
perspective and if you're talking about

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:21.760
perspective and if you're talking about
 

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.269
perspective and if you're talking about

evolutionary biology daily ontology you

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:29.080
evolutionary biology daily ontology you
 

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.199
evolutionary biology daily ontology you
know there's that's just that they they

00:12:31.199 --> 00:12:31.209
know there's that's just that they they
 

00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:32.730
know there's that's just that they they
don't really see that it's the four that

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:32.740
don't really see that it's the four that
 

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:34.590
don't really see that it's the four that
doesn't really use the spiritual side of

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:34.600
doesn't really use the spiritual side of

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:36.040
things doesn't really exist you know
 

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.190
things doesn't really exist you know
it's like it's just kind of noise in the

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:38.200
it's like it's just kind of noise in the
 

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.490
it's like it's just kind of noise in the
background of the knowledge experiment

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:41.500
background of the knowledge experiment
 

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:45.420
background of the knowledge experiment
you know so I think that's I mean that's

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:45.430
you know so I think that's I mean that's
 

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:46.800
you know so I think that's I mean that's
probably an exaggeration but for the

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:46.810
probably an exaggeration but for the
 

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:48.390
probably an exaggeration but for the
most part you know it's going to take

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:48.400
most part you know it's going to take
 

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.569
most part you know it's going to take
more and look and understandably look

00:12:51.569 --> 00:12:51.579
more and look and understandably look
 

00:12:51.579 --> 00:12:57.060
more and look and understandably look
there's been a lot of of theological and

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:57.070
there's been a lot of of theological and
 

00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:00.060
there's been a lot of of theological and
spiritual ideas that were you know just

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:00.070
spiritual ideas that were you know just
 

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:03.180
spiritual ideas that were you know just
not really not really worthy of a deep

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:03.190
not really not really worthy of a deep
 

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:06.090
not really not really worthy of a deep
rational inquiry they weren't they just

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:06.100
rational inquiry they weren't they just
 

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.880
rational inquiry they weren't they just
weren't on the same playing field but to

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:08.890
weren't on the same playing field but to
 

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:11.000
weren't on the same playing field but to
me there's nothing about spirituality or

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:11.010
me there's nothing about spirituality or
 

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:13.890
me there's nothing about spirituality or
even theology that has to be dogmatic

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:13.900
even theology that has to be dogmatic
 

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:16.380
even theology that has to be dogmatic
there has to be supernatural and then

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:16.390
there has to be supernatural and then
 

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:19.350
there has to be supernatural and then
with it you know a spiritual inquiry

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360
with it you know a spiritual inquiry
 

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.680
with it you know a spiritual inquiry
into reality can be rational it can be

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:22.690
into reality can be rational it can be
 

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:24.570
into reality can be rational it can be
it can be it can be important it can be

it can be it can be important it can be
 

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.490
it can be it can be important it can be
a profound inquiry into what knowledge

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:26.500
a profound inquiry into what knowledge
 

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.250
a profound inquiry into what knowledge
is and it may not be explicitly

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:29.260
is and it may not be explicitly
 

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.110
is and it may not be explicitly
scientific it may be you know if there's

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.120
scientific it may be you know if there's
 

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.760
scientific it may be you know if there's
like a range as a scientific there's the

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:32.770
like a range as a scientific there's the
 

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:34.590
like a range as a scientific there's the
philosophical there's the spiritual and

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:34.600
philosophical there's the spiritual and

they all can to me they all can explore

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:38.290
they all can to me they all can explore
 

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:39.690
they all can to me they all can explore
knowledge they all can explore the

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:39.700
knowledge they all can explore the
 

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.050
knowledge they all can explore the
knowledge of this of this universe you

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:42.060
knowledge of this of this universe you
 

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.610
knowledge of this of this universe you
know perhaps in different ways with

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:44.620
know perhaps in different ways with
 

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:47.700
know perhaps in different ways with
different tools but but they don't have

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:47.710
different tools but but they don't have
 

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:51.390
different tools but but they don't have
to be inherently at odds anyway that's

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:51.400
to be inherently at odds anyway that's
 

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.540
to be inherently at odds anyway that's
that's the next book by the way yeah I

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:54.550
that's the next book by the way yeah I
 

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:56.900
that's the next book by the way yeah I
mean I I think this is my last question

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:56.910
mean I I think this is my last question
 

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:59.250
mean I I think this is my last question
which is you know I've been thinking

00:13:59.250 --> 00:13:59.260
which is you know I've been thinking
 

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.830
which is you know I've been thinking
about and will be writing an article

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:01.840
about and will be writing an article
 

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.840
about and will be writing an article
soon about the about consciousness and

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:03.850
soon about the about consciousness and
 

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:05.700
soon about the about consciousness and
the study of consciousness in

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:05.710
the study of consciousness in
 

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:07.650
the study of consciousness in
neuroscience you know and there are

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:07.660
neuroscience you know and there are
 

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.960
neuroscience you know and there are
these areas in science which are sort of

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:09.970
these areas in science which are sort of
 

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:12.540
these areas in science which are sort of
considered fringed by the mainstream

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:12.550
considered fringed by the mainstream
 

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:14.100
considered fringed by the mainstream
they have difficulty getting funding or

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:14.110
they have difficulty getting funding or
 

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.500
they have difficulty getting funding or
whatever because of the unknowns are so

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:16.510
whatever because of the unknowns are so
 

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:18.120
whatever because of the unknowns are so
many of the variables are so many and

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:18.130
many of the variables are so many and
 

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:20.160
many of the variables are so many and
it's much easier to get funding for sort

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:20.170
it's much easier to get funding for sort
 

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:22.830
it's much easier to get funding for sort
of incremental studies of cyanobacteria

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:22.840
of incremental studies of cyanobacteria
 

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.710
of incremental studies of cyanobacteria
or whatever right right and you you

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:25.720
or whatever right right and you you
 

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:29.160
or whatever right right and you you
recently wrote an article about sort of

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:29.170
recently wrote an article about sort of
 

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.380
recently wrote an article about sort of
the need for generalists and the sort of

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:31.390
the need for generalists and the sort of
 

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:34.410
the need for generalists and the sort of
tendency to hyper specialization right

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:34.420
tendency to hyper specialization right
 

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.700
tendency to hyper specialization right
so I wonder you know whether you have

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:37.710
so I wonder you know whether you have
 

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:41.370
so I wonder you know whether you have
any thoughts about how how this kind of

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:41.380
any thoughts about how how this kind of
 

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:44.580
any thoughts about how how this kind of
generalist thinking you know can can

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:44.590
generalist thinking you know can can
 

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:47.910
