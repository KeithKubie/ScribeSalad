00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.900
But, instead, we believe in looking at the
productivity of your company as a whole and

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.019
seeing what we can do to help.
Now, one area that we've noticed is a growing

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.659
productivity problem for a lot of you out
there is managing all of the applications

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:20.040
of your company.
Companies grow, engineering teams change,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.630
servers move.
As all of that happens, it becomes increasingly

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.131
difficult to manage all of the applications
at your company.

00:00:28.131 --> 00:00:34.200
As your company grows from having a few Internet
apps to having hundreds, and from ten employees

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.590
to thousands, managing that whole ecosystem
and keeping it healthy becomes an increasingly

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.100
large challenge for you.
So at Google, we thought about this problem.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.120
And we wanted to do something to help.
Of course, since it has to do with hosting,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.020
we looked to Google App Engine, Google's hosting
offering, which already serves over 100,000

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:01.380
applications that are used every single week.
But as we try to use App Engine to help with

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.710
enterprise software, we noticed that there
were some challenges to getting started.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.500
As Google moved over its own I.T. infrastructure
to App Engine and as we talked to our employees,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.880
our customers, and VMWare, it became increasingly
clear to us that the public cloud in general,

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.869
and Google's cloud in particular had some
barriers to writing enterprise software.

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.880
We heard that you needed something that was
more reliable.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.320
We heard that you needed something that came
with support.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.229
We heard you needed something with key features
that your enterprise can't live without.

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:41.479
We heard that you needed a better way to manage
all of these applications in the cloud, and

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.560
a way that would seem like the best possible
solution both to the engineers at your company,

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.010
as well as the I.T. administrators.
And, finally, we thought that you needed a

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.770
better way to pay for all of this.
Having a single engineering team sign up with

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.890
a credit card each time you want to create
an app, it's not a very scalable solution.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.590
So we took these problems to heart, and over
the past year, we made investments to try

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.890
to fix these problems.
And thus, today's, I'm really excited to announce

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.060
to you a new product, Google App Engine for
Business.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.220
Google App Engine for Business represents
a new version of App Engine that was built

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.680
from the ground up around solving the real
problems that enterprises face.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.810
It's composed of five features that we believe
any business needs to build its infrastructure

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.030
on App Engine.
Those features are, one, a new company-centric

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.310
management console which makes it easy for
you to see, manage, and set security policies

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.560
across all of the applications in your domain.
Two, it comes with professional support so

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.240
that when it's crunch time and you need help
with your application, you know that there's

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.250
someone out there that you can reach.
It also comes with a formal service-level

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.040
agreement, or SLA, for the first time with
App Engine.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.440
That means we're putting our money where our
mouth is when it comes to the reliability

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.739
of your business.
And, finally, it also comes with two additional

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:14.290
key features that we had heard almost every
enterprise needs: SSL for your company's domain,

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.310
and SQL databases.
That's right.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.520
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Kevin Gibbs: You heard me right.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.390
When Google App Engine for Business is completely
available, you'll have the choice of using

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.770
our scalable data store, which is built on
Bigtable, or a standard SQL database.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.260
We know that these features are critical to
enterprise adoption.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.760
And, finally, Google App Engine for Business
also comes with a new way to pay for App Engine,

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.060
a new pricing model that's based around something
that's simple, your applications and your

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.879
users.
But, you know, I actually think the greatest

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.930
thing about Google App Engine for Business
is that it's based on the success that we've

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.489
already had with Google App Engine, a product
that's over a half a billion daily page views

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.761
strong and still growing.
It comes with all of the features that you

00:04:02.761 --> 00:04:08.120
already know and love about Google App Engine:
Its standard Python and Java programming environments;

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.440
that it's easy to use and easy to scale, including
that it's free to get started.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.209
With Google App Engine for Business, anyone
in your company can create an application,

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.619
develop it and test it, all for free.
When they're ready to share it with their

00:04:23.619 --> 00:04:30.249
whole company, they just press "publish."
Now, I mentioned to you that Google App Engine

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:34.889
for Business comes with a new pricing model.
We had heard that our current pricing model

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:39.360
for App Engine is fairly complex, especially
for the enterprise use case.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.199
So we wanted to do something simple.
We took a note from Google Apps for your domain.

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:49.770
The pricing for Google App Engine for Business
is really easy to understand.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:57.629
Your applications cost $8 per user, up to
a maximum of $1,000 per application per month.

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:00.889
That's it.
There are no other fees or charges for you

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.650
to understand.
If you use your application within your domain,

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.399
your usage is unlimited and you can create
as many applications as you'd like.

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:14.129
That means with App Engine for Business, you
don't have to worry about the cost of your

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:19.750
data center, the cost of your management console,
the cost of your licenses and usage, all of

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.979
those things.
It's one simple price.

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.889
You know, we talked to a lot of CIOs when
we were working on this.

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:33.119
And we heard from many of you were spending
60% of your enterprise I.T. budget just keeping

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:36.969
the lights on.
Well, with Google App Engine for Business,

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:41.259
we think we can get that down to zero.
And we're putting our money where our mouth

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:44.740
is.
If your application in App Engine for Business

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:51.270
has no usage, you don't pay a dime.
Now, that's been a lot of me talking about

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.779
this new product.
I'd like to now actually show it to you.

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:59.389
I'd like to show you how the management console
in Google App Engine for Business makes it

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:03.550
easier for you to scale your company in terms
of the number of applications that you have

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:09.089
from the point of view of an engineer, an
I.T. admin, and a CIO.

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:17.120
So let me get started.
Bruce, I might need your help to log in here.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:23.159
Thanks, Bruce.
All right.

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:32.189
So let me go ahead and open it up.
I'm going to open the management console for

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:35.509
App Engine for Business.
Now, for the purposes of this demo, we've

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:38.990
created an example company, The Surly Butcher
Corporation.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:46.759
So I'm going to go ahead and log in as a developer
there.

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:49.619
Now, if you've used App Engine before, this
screen should be familiar.

00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:53.399
It's our normal list of the applications that
you work on as an engineer at the company.

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:59.669
But as you go to create an application, you'll
notice there are a few things that are different.

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:03.990
One, you'll find that it's easier to find
an application identifier for the apps that

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.319
you want to create because these application
identifiers are limited to being within your

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:10.229
business.
So you no longer have to hunt around for one

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:15.699
in the global name space across Google.
You'll also notice that we've got a little

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:19.770
 -- a different host name listed here, rather
than appspot.com.

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.580
When you create an application on Google App
Engine for Business, it's automatically mapped

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.969
into your company's domain.
You don't have to do any DNS setup or do any

00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:32.580
virtual host or anything like that.
It just works with your company's domain name

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.830
and brand.
Now, I'm going to step back here for a second,

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.369
and I'm going to go to an application that
I deployed this morning, which is a sample

00:07:39.369 --> 00:07:43.199
blog for The Surly Butcher Company.
So I'm going to open that up for you.

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:50.209
But before I do, I'm going to go in the background,
and I'm going to go log out of App Engine.

00:07:50.209 --> 00:07:54.739
So I should be logged out now.
Now I'm going to go ahead and open up the

00:07:54.739 --> 00:07:58.569
blog.
There we go.

00:07:58.569 --> 00:08:02.889
And you can see it asked me to log back in.
That's because Google App Engine for Business

00:08:02.889 --> 00:08:09.629
has security default.
They are set by the domain administrator,

00:08:09.629 --> 00:08:14.330
and developers can't change them without permission.
That means that you can be sure your Internet

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:18.360
apps are safe.
So let me go ahead and log into the simple

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:23.249
app.
So there we go.

00:08:23.249 --> 00:08:27.279
There's the company's simple blog.
You can see it's hosted on the company's domain

00:08:27.279 --> 00:08:34.759
name, and I didn't have to set anything up.
So I'm going to go back to the application

00:08:34.759 --> 00:08:37.620
view within the admin console.
Now, as I said before, this view should be

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.579
familiar to you.
This is the standard view you see in App Engine.

00:08:39.579 --> 00:08:42.969
It will be the apps you work on.
But because this is a company, you'll notice

00:08:42.969 --> 00:08:48.060
there's a new link up here which gives me
a link to all of the applications for this

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.800
company.
As I click on that, I can now see every application

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:56.339
that has been created within my company.
And for each application, I can see the applications

00:08:56.339 --> 00:09:00.180
that I have access to and the ones that I
don't.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.699
This helps your developers collaborate across
your company.

00:09:03.699 --> 00:09:09.180
Now, one application that I work on inside
this company is the TechStop application.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.100
This is one we use for our I.T. help desk
for the company.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:17.620
When I open up this application, though, you'll
see the familiar dashboard.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:21.319
But you'll notice there's a new tab under
"permissions."

00:09:21.319 --> 00:09:25.889
With App Engine for Business, you can control
who has access to which application and what

00:09:25.889 --> 00:09:29.680
level of access they have.
Now, for this application, you can see I'm

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.389
listed as a developer.
And that means that I have pretty much full

00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:35.120
rights.
I can view the logs of this application.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.800
I can go and deploy a new version of the application.
And I can go into the data store viewer for

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:46.560
the app and create new data or change data.
But if I go back to a list of applications,

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:51.269
I can see that there are some apps that I
don't have all the same level of privileges.

00:09:51.269 --> 00:09:55.070
So if I open up our company's code review
application where we audit the code that we

00:09:55.070 --> 00:10:00.259
work on, I can see that for this application,
I'm only listed as a viewer.

00:10:00.259 --> 00:10:05.649
That means I can get to this dashboard and
view logs, but if I go to the data store viewer,

00:10:05.649 --> 00:10:09.240
I can't change any data in the app and I can't
deploy a new version.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.589
So this helps you manage within your company
and manage the data that you're working on

00:10:13.589 --> 00:10:19.449
and the safety permissions with your company.
Now, if I jump back to the list of applications,

00:10:19.449 --> 00:10:22.319
you'll see that there are some that I have
no access to at all.

00:10:22.319 --> 00:10:24.750
These applications are ones that I'm just
not a developer on.

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:27.850
And if I click on one, you'll see I have no
access.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:31.420
I can request access, though.
And I'll e-mail the developers to let me on

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.600
if I can.
Now, I said I was going to show you one other

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.550
thing.
And that was showing you that -- how a domain

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:42.769
administrator or CIO looks at all of this.
So I'm going to sign out quickly.

00:10:42.769 --> 00:10:49.779
And I'm going to sign back in as someone who
is a domain administrator at this company.

00:10:49.779 --> 00:10:56.889
So let me do that.
Now, as a domain administrator, I don't actually

00:10:56.889 --> 00:10:59.860
have any applications, 'cause I don't write
code anymore.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:04.730
But when I go to a list of all of the applications
for the company, you can see I have full access

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:07.769
to all of them.
And that means I can go to any app, grant

00:11:07.769 --> 00:11:11.800
developer access or remove a developer who
has left the company and handle situations

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:18.279
like that.
So that's the demo of App Engine for Business.

00:11:18.279 --> 00:11:22.589
Now I want to make one thing clear: Google
App Engine for Business represents a major

00:11:22.589 --> 00:11:26.449
new effort from Google.
It's a big new thing that we're doing.

00:11:26.449 --> 00:11:31.519
Today, I'm announcing App Engine for Business.
It's not yet entirely available for everyone

00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:37.190
to use, but we know that enterprise development
schedules take time and that you need time

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:40.569
to plan.
Thus, we wanted to tell you about this as

00:11:40.569 --> 00:11:44.819
soon as we could.
So in response to that, today, we're publishing

00:11:44.819 --> 00:11:49.870
the road map for Google App Engine for Business.
Because some of the features I told you about

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:54.499
today will take longer than others, some will
be available sooner than others.

00:11:54.499 --> 00:11:59.699
Our road map which is published online at
code.google.com, gives you an idea of when

00:11:59.699 --> 00:12:05.839
each of these features will be available and
when you can expect to see it.

00:12:05.839 --> 00:12:10.319
Already, a number of companies that we're
working with are already testing the App Engine

00:12:10.319 --> 00:12:14.660
management console and using it to help manage
their company and all of the applications

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:19.449
within it.
So, that's the end of my talk today.

00:12:19.449 --> 00:12:24.800
What I've shown you is a new version of App
Engine which is suited to business needs and

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.800
a new way to manage all of your applications
in the cloud.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.209
So thank you for your time.
Please keep watching our road map to see how

00:12:32.209 --> 00:12:35.509
we're doing.
And if you'd like to learn more about our

00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:39.670
toughest customer of Google App Engine for
Business, please come see these talks where

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:44.850
you can see how Google itself is building
its I.T. apps on App Engine.

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:46.189

&gt;&gt;David Glazer: Thanks, Kevin.
Thank you, Kevin.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.920
Thank you, everyone.
Three more slides.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.740
What did we show you?
We made four promises at the beginning.

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:01.620
We said we were going to show you how to build
apps faster with familiar technology, showed

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:05.139
you how integrating Spring tools in Google
Web Toolkit let that happen.

00:13:05.139 --> 00:13:09.240
We said we were going to show you how to reach
all your user on all their devices.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:13.410
The new mobile-ready widgets in Google Web
Toolkit make that happen.

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:17.839
We said we were going to show you how to stop
being trapped into an architecture by a choice

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:21.389
you make when you write your code.
The cloud portability solution we showed you,

00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:24.079
working on VMWare on open standards made that
happen.

00:13:24.079 --> 00:13:28.920
And we said we were going to show you how
to juggle a thousand applications for your

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:33.050
company and keep your sanity.
App Engine for Business allows that to happen.

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:40.110
If you want to learn more, attend the sessions,
you can go online at cloudportability at either

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:46.499
google.com or VMWare.com, get a lot more information,
pointers to documentation, downloads the tools,

00:13:46.499 --> 00:13:53.519
access the road map, sign up for early use,
all of that.

00:13:53.519 --> 00:13:59.220
We started this morning by talking about the
power of open standards and how open standards

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:03.230
leads to innovation.
Some of the people who started using the tools

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:07.319
that we showed you today, some of the people
who started using Spring several years ago,

00:14:07.319 --> 00:14:11.170
started using Google Web Toolkit two years
ago, you're in this room.

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:15.620
When you started using those tools, you didn't
know that you were building applications that

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:19.449
were ready to run on Chrome.
You didn't know that you were running applications

00:14:19.449 --> 00:14:24.430
that were ready to run on the Android browser.
You didn't know that you were building for

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:29.069
the platform of the future, because it didn't
exist when you started building your apps.

00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:34.470
But because you chose to invest in open standards,
you chose to innovate in the open, you are

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:37.850
ready for the future.
Stay with the open standards.

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:40.720
Stay with the Web.
Stay with HTML5.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.930
Come with us into the future.
We're excited about it.

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:45.569
We know you're excited.
Enjoy the sessions.

00:14:45.569 --> 00:14:51.799
Enjoy the rest of your two days here.
Thank you very much.
