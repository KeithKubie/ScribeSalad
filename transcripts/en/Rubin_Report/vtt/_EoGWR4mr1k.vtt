WEBVTT

1
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.640
No.

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.130
<v 1>All right.
People,
we are alive on the worldwide web.</v>

3
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.670
Youtube for as long as they'll let us remain here.

4
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.650
I'm going to be alive for two hours today.
Uh,
we got a lot to talk about.

5
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.220
It's time to,
uh,
to get real.
We're gonna level about a few things.

6
00:00:23.221 --> 00:00:27.090
I'm gonna share some insight into sort of what's going on,
uh,

7
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.400
with the show with Patrion,
with the future.

8
00:00:29.401 --> 00:00:33.600
I know you guys have a budget union questions and,
uh,

9
00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:36.870
I've got a lot of answers.
We'll do ask me anything.
Uh,

10
00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:40.410
we're going to do a little,
a little fundraising for the show.
Uh,

11
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.750
but before I do anything,
I feel like most importantly,

12
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.310
I just got to catch you guys up on sort of where we're at at the moment and
just,

13
00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:51.090
uh,
briefly a little bit on my adventure to get here and,
uh,

14
00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:55.140
and sort of where we're at.
So as most of you guys know,
um,

15
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.480
I launched on Patrion,

16
00:00:57.481 --> 00:01:00.480
we launched the Rubin Report on Patrion about two and a half years ago.

17
00:01:00.481 --> 00:01:05.481
It was June of 2016 and at the time right before that,

18
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.340
we had obviously had the show on the young Turks for about two years.
Uh,

19
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.740
then we were very briefly at riot,
uh,
which was a startup and just,

20
00:01:13.741 --> 00:01:15.120
we sort of were going in different directions.

21
00:01:15.121 --> 00:01:17.990
Everyone in there was great but just didn't work out.
Uh,

22
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.810
and then we were at aura,

23
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.810
TV and aura back in September of 2015 is where I had my first interview with Sam

24
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.801
Harris,

25
00:01:25.801 --> 00:01:29.520
who was the first time I had done a sort of one on one interview on camera.

26
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.490
And that basically when the,
when the show ended,
I was like,
Whoa,

27
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.190
that's what I want to do.
Like that's the best thing that I've done.

28
00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:39.060
It was real and it was raw and it was important and relevant and true.

29
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.120
And I was like,
that's what we're going to do.
And really that was the day,

30
00:01:42.121 --> 00:01:45.570
I think,
uh,
if I'm not mistaken,
it was September 9th,

31
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.730
2015 is when our first show on Ron up.

32
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.440
It was the one with Sam Harris and my life changed and that's where the show

33
00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:55.710
started blowing up.
And then subsequently,
um,
you know,

34
00:01:55.711 --> 00:01:58.920
we started going more and more into the free speech space and then all of the

35
00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:01.890
things that I now care about,
we stayed at Ora till,
uh,

36
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.920
till about May of 2016 and at that point I realized at oral was great by the

37
00:02:07.591 --> 00:02:10.110
way.
And we were at aura because Larry King,

38
00:02:10.111 --> 00:02:13.960
who is the greatest interviewer of all time,
bar none,
uh,

39
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.720
he welcomed us there.
He,
I mean,

40
00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:18.300
he welcomed me to do an interview show on his network,
pretty,

41
00:02:18.301 --> 00:02:20.000
pretty freaking great.
Uh,

42
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.030
and Larry has become obviously a friend and mentor to me.
Um,
in any event,

43
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.370
the show was really blowing up and what we realized we're was basically was that

44
00:02:29.371 --> 00:02:33.270
we were Kinda,
we were sort of getting bigger than the network at some level.

45
00:02:33.271 --> 00:02:35.910
And I thought,
you know what?
We could do this alone.
I want to,

46
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.940
I want to own the show.
I want to control what we're doing.
I want,

47
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.050
I want to be my own boss and,

48
00:02:41.051 --> 00:02:43.470
and figure out how to grow a business here in all of these things.

49
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.710
And then we launched on Patrion in June of 2016 and the night before we launched

50
00:02:49.561 --> 00:02:54.090
on Patrion,
I said to David and the mirror who joined me,
left their jobs,

51
00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:57.060
we all quit our jobs and left our health insurance and all that stuff just to

52
00:02:57.061 --> 00:03:00.490
try this thing.
And we had no idea whether it was going to work.
Uh,

53
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:03.820
I said to that,
man,
I may have really screwed up the night before we launched.

54
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.190
I was like,
I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow.
Uh,

55
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:07.660
but within hours of launching,

56
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:10.960
we realized that we were going to hit our fundraising,
um,

57
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.550
measures the markers that we wanted to hit.
And then we went independent.
Uh,

58
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:19.390
we rented a studio for for about six months after that.
Uh,

59
00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:24.280
and then when we fully,
fully,
fully achieved independence was,
uh,

60
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.610
two years ago,
uh,
almost it was two years ago,
November.

61
00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:29.440
So a little over two years ago,
uh,

62
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:34.441
when we were able to buy this house and now we absolutely control and own and

63
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:36.010
operate everything that we're doing.

64
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.890
I'm super proud of the small business that we've created here.

65
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.470
The same things that I talk about,
uh,

66
00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:44.740
about personal responsibility and limited government and all of these things.

67
00:03:44.741 --> 00:03:47.800
And,
and the,
the classical liberal and Libertarian ideas that I,

68
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.190
that I talk about all the time or the same ways that I try to run my business.

69
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.920
Uh,
we pay 100% of our employees health insurance.
We've got,

70
00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:56.770
we've got part timers,
full timers,
all these things.
And I'm just,

71
00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.430
I'm thrilled and elated about everything that's happened here.
Uh,

72
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.550
now I should mention because I think most of you are watching this right now

73
00:04:03.551 --> 00:04:07.210
because of the Patriot in situation that for the two,

74
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.850
two plus years that we were on Patrion,
everything was fine.

75
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.170
There was the incident where they booted Lauren southern off the platform and I

76
00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:16.870
had Jack Conti a little about a year and a half ago,

77
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.510
sit in that chair right over there,
uh,

78
00:04:19.511 --> 00:04:23.800
and tell me that they were not going to police speech on their platform,

79
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.010
that what Lauren had done was taken part in what he termed manifest observable

80
00:04:29.711 --> 00:04:32.500
behavior,
meaning behavior,
not just words,

81
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:34.780
behavior that she had partaken in.

82
00:04:34.781 --> 00:04:37.540
I don't even want to get into the specifics of everything that,

83
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.420
that she did or didn't do.
It doesn't even matter actually.

84
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.050
But he said words themselves.
He said to me,
I think he said it on camera,

85
00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:47.410
but he certainly said it off camera.
I would never run the risk of being booted.

86
00:04:47.411 --> 00:04:50.980
Now,
first off,
he's just one guy that happens to run the company right now.

87
00:04:50.981 --> 00:04:53.680
That's nice to hear,
I suppose.
But also it's like,
well,

88
00:04:53.681 --> 00:04:56.440
I don't want to be on a platform that everyone else might be getting booted off

89
00:04:56.441 --> 00:04:59.080
of,
but I'm just getting some assurance that I'm safe.

90
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.760
I think you do know that I care about free speech and free expression and all

91
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.780
that.
So anyway,
uh,

92
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.530
he said manifest observable behavior is what will get you booted if the,

93
00:05:08.531 --> 00:05:13.030
if you do something off platform,
that's an actual action,
not just words.
Um,

94
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.620
manifest observable behavior mob,
the acronym mob,
mob behavior.

95
00:05:17.621 --> 00:05:21.370
You can't make that up.
Uh,
but that's what they said.
We do it anyway.
A couple,

96
00:05:21.371 --> 00:05:25.090
a couple of weeks ago,
I guess it's a,
about a month and a half ago now,

97
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.470
beginning of December,
uh,
Patriot booted Sargon of a cod,
Carl Benjamin,

98
00:05:29.471 --> 00:05:33.280
who also has sat in that seat over there and who I've done collaborations with

99
00:05:33.281 --> 00:05:36.050
over the years,
uh,
who's a classical liberal,
uh,

100
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.540
from the UK who years ago when I was still on the young Turks and I was really

101
00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:44.050
waking up to what was going on with the left related to free speech and calling

102
00:05:44.051 --> 00:05:47.710
everyone a racist and a bigot and homophobe in the rest of it and realizing how

103
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.970
illiberal the liberals had become a,
everybody online was saying,

104
00:05:51.971 --> 00:05:55.570
you've got to talk to Sargon of,
of God.
He's the guy.
He's been doing it forever.

105
00:05:55.571 --> 00:05:57.290
He's putting up all these videos.
Anyway,

106
00:05:57.291 --> 00:06:01.940
I did talk to him and I think that that actually started some of my success in

107
00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:05.180
this space.
Um,
anyway,
about a month and a half ago,

108
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:09.770
they booted him off Patrion with no warning because,

109
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:10.460
uh,

110
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.050
he used the n word on a video from February.

111
00:06:15.051 --> 00:06:19.820
So from about 10 months prior on someone else's channel,
not his channel,

112
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:22.700
and not a video that was even posted to Patrion.

113
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.810
Now he used the word because he was using the all rights language against him.

114
00:06:26.811 --> 00:06:29.420
This guy is against the outright.
He's an old school liberal.

115
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.390
I don't want to even get into every little specific of every little thing that

116
00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:37.100
he has said.
Um,
but he is someone that debates all right people.
Okay,
so,

117
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.340
but the p the real point here is not even the specifics of the words,

118
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:45.230
it's that it's something that he said off platform,
not even on his own channel.

119
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.230
So it wasn't like he was doing something on his channel that wasn't on Patriot

120
00:06:48.231 --> 00:06:50.570
and they said,
well,
you're funding that through patron.

121
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.090
It was something that was on someone else's channel all together.

122
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.330
They booted him.
There was no recourse,
there was no warning.

123
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.500
And this was obviously just as,
uh,

124
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:05.000
a truly massive move of the line.
And Sam Harris canceled his,

125
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.980
uh,
patriotic a couple of weeks ago.

126
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.760
Jordan Peterson and I have announced that we are canceling our Patriot on

127
00:07:10.761 --> 00:07:14.330
January 15th.
This is the engine of the show.
This,
you know,

128
00:07:14.331 --> 00:07:18.680
we're 100% fan funded here.
You guys,
you are 100% independent.

129
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.980
Really its independence more than anything else because of you guys.

130
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.970
So this is a major risk that I'm taking.
I'm,

131
00:07:23.971 --> 00:07:28.700
I'm voluntarily giving up about 60 to 70% of our monthly rev,

132
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.060
um,
because I think it's the right thing to do.
And uh,

133
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.250
and I know that a lot of you guys are with me.

134
00:07:34.251 --> 00:07:37.450
So there's a really interesting thing happening right now.
I'm watching our,

135
00:07:37.451 --> 00:07:39.110
our monthly rev go down,

136
00:07:39.111 --> 00:07:42.770
but I'm feeling very inspired because I'm getting so many messages from you guys

137
00:07:42.771 --> 00:07:45.260
who are telling me,
uh,
you know,
I'm,

138
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.290
I'm going to stand up for something just like you are.
So it's pretty cool.
Okay.

139
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.490
So let me just do a couple of little pimp shout outs right here up top just to

140
00:07:52.491 --> 00:07:53.780
tell you what we're doing and then we'll,

141
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.690
we'll go more back into the story and everything else.
So first off,

142
00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:59.570
we are closing our patrion on January 15th.

143
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:04.780
We are trying to move everybody over to Dave rubin.com/donate and what,

144
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.290
uh,
what that's all about is it doesn't solve the biggest problems related to

145
00:08:09.291 --> 00:08:12.680
censorship yet it doesn't solve the biggest problems related to payment

146
00:08:12.681 --> 00:08:14.030
processors and things like that,

147
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:16.820
but it does remove one portion of the middleman here.

148
00:08:16.821 --> 00:08:18.230
We don't need patrion anymore.

149
00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:20.870
It's not like anyone's discovering us on patrion there.

150
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.620
They're taking a cut of the money and they're doing practices that I,

151
00:08:23.621 --> 00:08:24.650
I don't believe in.

152
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.700
So we were trying to get as many people as possible that have supported us on

153
00:08:28.701 --> 00:08:33.310
patrion or new people over Dave rubin.com/donate and uh,

154
00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.660
and help support the show.
We'll see what happens.

155
00:08:35.661 --> 00:08:37.970
Like there are many other ways that I can go about supporting the show.

156
00:08:37.971 --> 00:08:41.090
I could be reading ads and I could be joining networks and all those things.

157
00:08:41.091 --> 00:08:44.360
I like being independent.
I think we've done something really cool here and,

158
00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:48.020
and it's really on a,
on you guys to see what the,
what the future will hold.

159
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:53.110
So what we're gonna do though for this live stream is if you donate 25 bucks

160
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:57.450
monthly while we're doing this live stream for the next two hours,

161
00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:01.620
you are going to get a Reuben report,
Reuben select tee shirt.

162
00:09:01.621 --> 00:09:02.940
Now these were the tee shirts there.

163
00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.760
A limited amount of these that will never be printed again because these were

164
00:09:05.761 --> 00:09:08.400
the tee shirts that we were given away to our patrons.

165
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.320
So there's a couple of hundred of them left.

166
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.830
And if you donate $25 or more monthly,
while I'm doing this,

167
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:15.150
you're going to get a tee shirt.

168
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.870
I should be selling a like crockpots or something.

169
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.740
I'm wearing that t shirt right now as you can see.

170
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:24.770
And if you donate $50 or more right now during this live stream,

171
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:29.760
we're going to send you a Reuben report mug.
This is a select member mug.

172
00:09:29.761 --> 00:09:32.490
That was only for our patrons.
We've got a couple of hundred of them left.

173
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.700
I'm going to sign it for you right here and give you a shout out and anyone that

174
00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:39.330
donates say five bucks or more during the live stream.

175
00:09:39.331 --> 00:09:42.120
I will give you a shout out as well,
so I've got a trusty iPad here.

176
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:45.000
My team's going to be send to me names telling me what you guys are doing.

177
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.340
I'll answer all your questions related to all of this.

178
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:51.180
I just think it is time to take a stand.

179
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:55.170
It is just time to take a stand.
I don't take any great pleasure in this.

180
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.780
I don't want to fight Patriot and I don't want to fight Google.

181
00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:00.210
I don't want to fight any of these things.
I want to do a talk show.

182
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.540
I want to have some fun and joy in my life,
but it's like enough of this,

183
00:10:03.541 --> 00:10:07.770
this ever encroaching movement on what we can say and who's allowed to be on

184
00:10:07.771 --> 00:10:09.570
what platform to say this or that.

185
00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.620
And it's coming from more and more people who are not bigots or racists or

186
00:10:13.621 --> 00:10:14.940
anything even close to that.

187
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.990
Although I would defend bigots and racists right to speech as well.
Um,

188
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:22.260
it's coming for people that just have some thoughts that are a little bit

189
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:24.450
outside of sort of the leftist,

190
00:10:24.451 --> 00:10:28.560
progressive dogma that has just completely taken over academia and certainly

191
00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:31.140
everything going on in Silicon Valley.
So a,

192
00:10:31.141 --> 00:10:33.990
so please do what for the next two hours while we're here,
I'll,

193
00:10:33.991 --> 00:10:37.680
I'll give you a shout out by name of Dave rubin.com/donate for five bucks and

194
00:10:37.681 --> 00:10:40.680
above 25 bucks and above monthly you're getting a tee shirt,

195
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.820
50 bucks above and monthly you are getting a tee shirt and a Mug,

196
00:10:44.821 --> 00:10:48.230
which I will sign right here for ya.
And uh,

197
00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:52.200
oh quickly already we got some shout outs.
James,
Megan,
Jeffrey,
David,
Beverly,

198
00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:56.370
Holly and John.
Welcome aboard guys.
Thank you very much.
I do appreciate it.
Um,

199
00:10:56.371 --> 00:11:01.080
okay,
let's see.
So here's how I'm going to jump in with uh,
with some questions.

200
00:11:01.081 --> 00:11:04.260
I'm going to start with questions from patrons right now because you guys have

201
00:11:04.261 --> 00:11:07.560
been the lifeblood of this thing and I see some questions popping up there
first.

202
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:12.150
Uh,
I admire you leaving.
Do you,
do they still have you on the front page?

203
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.870
I guess a couple of people were saying that Patrion was still using me as a,

204
00:11:15.871 --> 00:11:18.690
as someone that they were publicizing on the front page.
I don't know.
You know,

205
00:11:18.691 --> 00:11:19.410
it's funny,

206
00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:22.830
I sort of had a love hate relationship with them this whole time because I never

207
00:11:22.831 --> 00:11:27.831
truly felt they really wanted us say the sams and the Jordans and the Bret

208
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:28.410
Weinstein's in me.

209
00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:31.530
I never really felt that they kind of wanted us on there because they are a

210
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:35.460
lefty silicon valley thing.
Um,

211
00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:38.790
so I don't know that they're using me or not right now,
uh,
to,

212
00:11:38.791 --> 00:11:42.840
to pimp out this stuff.
Um,
but you know,
they never followed me on Twitter,

213
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.570
which always really bothered me.
I was like,
I'm making you guys a lot of money.

214
00:11:45.571 --> 00:11:50.430
Like,
what are you doing anyway?
That's just like silly little dribble.
Um,
okay.
So,

215
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.530
uh,
but the point is we're gonna,

216
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.690
we're gonna stay on there until January 15th and then that day we'll,

217
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.170
we'll shut it down.
Um,
and also I do want to address something.
You know,

218
00:11:59.171 --> 00:12:03.130
I saw a couple of people say,
well,
Sam did the right thing because you know,

219
00:12:03.131 --> 00:12:07.030
he just immediately deleted it.
And I think it's worth mentioning that we all,

220
00:12:07.031 --> 00:12:10.930
God bless them for doing that cod blessing,
the atheist for doing that.
Um,

221
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:13.120
you know,
we all have different considerations.

222
00:12:13.121 --> 00:12:15.820
I have a business here with several employees.
Actually,

223
00:12:15.821 --> 00:12:19.390
the day that we found this out,
I was in a,

224
00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:22.690
I had speaking either that night or the night before,
I was in Montana,

225
00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:28.050
a speaking at the University of Wyoming and we had just sent a part timer,

226
00:12:28.571 --> 00:12:32.320
one of our part timers of fulltime employment contract.
So in the midst of this,

227
00:12:32.321 --> 00:12:35.380
I'm just committing to a,
another full time person as I see all this.

228
00:12:35.381 --> 00:12:38.560
So we all just have different considerations,
uh,
that we're,

229
00:12:38.561 --> 00:12:40.540
that we're dealing with.
But I think we're doing the right thing.
And by the way,

230
00:12:40.541 --> 00:12:44.590
I also don't begrudge any of the people that want to stay on Patrion and fight.

231
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.690
So I,
you know,
I have plenty of friends that are going to,

232
00:12:46.691 --> 00:12:50.230
I think do just that or at least doing it at the moment and say Bret Weinstein

233
00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:53.440
and uh,
and column Moriarty and plenty of other people.

234
00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.690
It's like if you can stay in fight and change them,

235
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:59.830
we can all have different tactics on how we want to go about this rope a dope.

236
00:12:59.831 --> 00:13:01.540
I think some of us leaving is probably good.

237
00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:05.020
I think some people trying to fight and stay in change.
It's probably good.
It's,

238
00:13:05.021 --> 00:13:06.180
it's all there.
Uh,

239
00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:11.080
shout outs to Jason to whim to her Kahn who is getting a tee shirt and a mug.

240
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:14.980
That's right.
My man.
I'm going to sign that Mug for you right now.

241
00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:20.050
This is a Reuben select member mug that will never be printed again because it

242
00:13:20.051 --> 00:13:24.460
was for Patrion.
It has been signed and it's going to you my man.

243
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:29.580
Thank you very much.
Okay,
let's see.
Uh,
I'll jump on another patriot.

244
00:13:29.581 --> 00:13:31.690
I want,
I see a lot coming in on super chat too,
which is great.

245
00:13:31.691 --> 00:13:35.470
So I'll get to those.
Uh,
will you have the opportunity to pay through paypal?

246
00:13:35.471 --> 00:13:38.140
Yeah.
If you go to Dave rubin.com/donate uh,

247
00:13:38.141 --> 00:13:42.160
you can just use a credit card or you can use paypal there and you're good to
go.

248
00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:45.070
So I should address,
actually that's a good point.
So look,

249
00:13:45.071 --> 00:13:47.950
there's a couple of things happening here.
One of the,
one of the parts of,

250
00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:51.730
of censorship that we have to deal with is what's going on with these tech

251
00:13:51.731 --> 00:13:54.610
companies.
Are People be in shadow banned on Twitter?

252
00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:58.750
Are the algorithms not showing certain videos?
Are People Getting unsubscribed?

253
00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:02.080
All of these things that you guys know all about.
Now,
again,

254
00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.980
I say this all the time,
these companies are allowed to do what they want.

255
00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:09.670
I would like them to sort of uphold the principles of free speech that I hold

256
00:14:09.671 --> 00:14:13.360
dear,
but I don't know that I can force a private company to do that.
Now,

257
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.290
if they were doing shady things in the boards of these companies,

258
00:14:17.291 --> 00:14:20.080
the shareholders of these companies found out,
well now maybe there's some,

259
00:14:20.081 --> 00:14:23.470
there might be some legal issues.
There would be some internal issues for sure.

260
00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:24.603
Um,

261
00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.760
but I don't think that the government coming in and breaking up these companies

262
00:14:27.761 --> 00:14:31.510
is the right answer.
There could be certain legal things within that.

263
00:14:31.511 --> 00:14:34.150
I'm not a lawyer that might have to be looked at.
Okay.

264
00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:39.970
Now as far as,
uh,
the payment processor part of this.
So that's,

265
00:14:39.971 --> 00:14:41.560
that's just the speech part of it,
right?

266
00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:45.100
That's how can people be on platforms and be allowed to talk.

267
00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:47.320
So it's like a guy like Carl Benjamin.

268
00:14:47.321 --> 00:14:50.410
It's like if this guy isn't allowed to be on platforms,

269
00:14:50.411 --> 00:14:53.150
then probably you watching this and half of the people you know,

270
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.580
and that may include me,
can't be on these platforms.

271
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:59.420
That's why this was important for somebody to start standing up to some of this

272
00:14:59.421 --> 00:15:01.370
stuff.
The next level of this though,

273
00:15:01.371 --> 00:15:05.450
so we have to deal with the platforms themselves who can be on platforms and

274
00:15:05.451 --> 00:15:07.340
what are you allowed to do on these platforms?

275
00:15:07.341 --> 00:15:09.770
And they can all have different terms of service.
Should,

276
00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:14.060
should future platforms maybe only have to obey the laws of the land.

277
00:15:14.061 --> 00:15:16.490
So anyone can say whatever they want except you can't make,

278
00:15:16.491 --> 00:15:18.980
say a direct threat or you can't do a,
you know,

279
00:15:18.981 --> 00:15:23.510
a fire alarm in a movie theater type thing.
Um,
or you know,
uh,

280
00:15:23.511 --> 00:15:27.500
inspire a,
a terrorist attack,
something like that or call for a terrorist attack.

281
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:29.450
That would be an interesting way to do it.

282
00:15:29.451 --> 00:15:32.540
Should a terms of service have more to do with the statement of principles that

283
00:15:32.541 --> 00:15:36.050
the University of Chicago has put out defending free speech possibly.

284
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:40.220
So all of these things have to be dealt with and thought about and all of that.

285
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:45.140
The other part of this issue though is the payment process or part of this,

286
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:47.990
um,
because it turns out now,

287
00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:51.980
and this is very annoying because nobody wants to fight mastercard and visa and

288
00:15:51.981 --> 00:15:53.480
the rest of it,
I assure you I don't,

289
00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.620
that you can catch there is there is a tweet that one time over the summer,

290
00:15:57.621 --> 00:15:58.700
I think it was in August,

291
00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:02.780
that Patrion tweeted to Robert Spencer who is in not Richard Spencer,

292
00:16:02.781 --> 00:16:06.470
the outright guy,
Robert Spencer,
who is a New York Times bestselling author.

293
00:16:06.471 --> 00:16:08.210
Now he happens to write a lot about Islam,

294
00:16:08.211 --> 00:16:09.860
but he's a New York Times bestselling author.

295
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:13.310
They tweeted to him that they had to close their account and they said,

296
00:16:13.311 --> 00:16:18.260
unfortunately,
because of pressure from mastercard.
So now it's like,

297
00:16:18.261 --> 00:16:19.094
wait a minute,

298
00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:23.150
are we going to be policing speech to the point that people won't even be able

299
00:16:23.151 --> 00:16:26.060
to make money,
that people will not be able to exchange in,

300
00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:29.210
in commerce and in goods?
Well now we've really ramped this thing up.

301
00:16:29.211 --> 00:16:30.800
So these are major,
major,

302
00:16:30.801 --> 00:16:34.790
major things that people better start thinking about that I know you watching

303
00:16:34.791 --> 00:16:36.020
this are thinking about,

304
00:16:36.021 --> 00:16:39.780
but everyone better start thinking about these things before it's too late.
Um,

305
00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:44.300
okay.
A couple of shadows.
Jacob,
Raquel,
Earl and Edward,
Sean Glenn,

306
00:16:44.301 --> 00:16:47.180
Joe Jeffrey Taylor,
Taylor's getting a mug.

307
00:16:47.181 --> 00:16:50.090
I'm signing that Mug for Taylor right now.
What did I do with this?

308
00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:53.600
With the marker?
Here we go.
Thank you Taylor.

309
00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:58.560
I appreciate that you're getting a Mug,
my friend and Morgan's getting a mug.

310
00:16:58.561 --> 00:17:03.530
All right,
Morgan,
here we go.
And guys,
I truly,

311
00:17:03.531 --> 00:17:08.320
I just want to be clear.
First off.
Um,
I just want to be clear about how,

312
00:17:08.321 --> 00:17:13.220
how truly appreciative of your support.
I am like you guys make this thing go.

313
00:17:13.221 --> 00:17:16.880
Like if you believe in resetting some of the national conversation into

314
00:17:16.881 --> 00:17:17.511
something decent,

315
00:17:17.511 --> 00:17:21.380
if you believe that we can actually change the world through ideas as I believe,

316
00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:22.513
um,

317
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:26.360
you're supporting the show because hopefully this gets out to more people and I

318
00:17:26.361 --> 00:17:28.730
can promise you that it is like,
trust me,

319
00:17:28.731 --> 00:17:32.240
I just did this world tour with Jordan where we're going to continue this and it

320
00:17:32.241 --> 00:17:35.330
would probably another 40 or 50 stops in the spring and we're doing about 10

321
00:17:35.331 --> 00:17:38.720
stops in Australia in February.
And it's like everywhere we went,

322
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:39.800
every airport I went,

323
00:17:39.801 --> 00:17:44.420
whether it was in Helsinki or Stockholm or Copenhagen or a Dublin,

324
00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:48.110
it's like people were coming up to us and it's like there's something happened

325
00:17:48.111 --> 00:17:48.290
here.

326
00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:51.990
Like something good really is happening and people want to stand up for what

327
00:17:51.991 --> 00:17:55.540
they believe in and people want to fight for ideas that they care about and

328
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:58.770
people want to know more and not be like bludgeoned by the mainstream media.

329
00:17:58.771 --> 00:18:01.620
That makes everyone dumb.
And not be called a racist.

330
00:18:01.621 --> 00:18:05.280
Every time you say something that's slightly out of what mainstream can accept.

331
00:18:05.281 --> 00:18:07.420
So I truly you you've,

332
00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:10.860
I mean in the statement that I wrote that we released to our patrons,

333
00:18:10.861 --> 00:18:14.130
you guys have quite literally made my dreams come true cause I'm doing what I'm

334
00:18:14.131 --> 00:18:16.380
supposed to be doing and I,
you know,

335
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:21.120
I can't possibly be more appreciative of that.
Okay.
Hey Dave,

336
00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:25.980
if the social justice warrior ideology has infected visa and mastercard and can

337
00:18:25.981 --> 00:18:30.510
cut funding or services to whomever they please,
what legal recourse is there?

338
00:18:30.511 --> 00:18:31.860
If there are no alternatives,

339
00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:35.160
it's downright disturbing for it to have come to this.
Okay.
So as I said,

340
00:18:35.161 --> 00:18:39.480
I'm not a lawyer,
but there are lawyers looking into some of this stuff.
Um,

341
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:43.740
I look,
they have their own agreements.
Like when you sign up for a credit card,

342
00:18:43.741 --> 00:18:46.860
you sign some crazy agreement that nobody has a lawyer sitting there with.

343
00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:50.670
So can these companies do what they want?
There's probably some there,

344
00:18:50.671 --> 00:18:54.060
there is relationships with government agencies related to these companies.

345
00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.210
So there's probably something to look at their,
I would say,
you know,

346
00:18:57.211 --> 00:18:59.070
I'm hearing a lot of this,
especially on Twitter,

347
00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:02.760
is that maybe the end game of all of this,

348
00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:05.430
is that the only way to truly,

349
00:19:05.431 --> 00:19:09.690
truly be a free creator now,
whatever that means,
whatever you create.

350
00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:10.524
So in this case,

351
00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:15.060
creating video and audio content is that you would be posting it on the

352
00:19:15.061 --> 00:19:19.020
blockchain and also doing all your financial transactions on the blockchain

353
00:19:19.021 --> 00:19:22.260
through Bitcoin and ethereum and light coin and everything else.

354
00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:25.140
We're learning about it.
I have a zillion meetings tomorrow,

355
00:19:25.141 --> 00:19:28.920
basically all day long tomorrow I'm going to be talking to crypto people and uh,

356
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:32.130
we're,
we're trying to figure out all that.
So by right now,

357
00:19:32.131 --> 00:19:35.790
by closing Patrion I'm doing it to remove a middleman and do something that I

358
00:19:35.791 --> 00:19:39.900
just think is the right thing to do.
We're pushing everybody to our website,

359
00:19:39.901 --> 00:19:43.260
which doesn't solve the long longterm problems if,

360
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.960
if payment processors come for us and things like that.

361
00:19:45.961 --> 00:19:48.930
But think how crazy this conversation is.
Like,
I'm,

362
00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:53.960
I actually have to entertain the idea that payment processors could come from me

363
00:19:54.541 --> 00:19:58.260
or anyone in my crew that you know of,
or come for you.

364
00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:00.420
Like how crazy is that?
That's crazy.

365
00:20:00.421 --> 00:20:03.480
Like we're not doing something evil and twisted here.
You know what I mean?

366
00:20:03.481 --> 00:20:06.090
We're doing actually what you're supposed to do in a free society,

367
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:07.440
which is talk about things.

368
00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:11.800
So switching everybody over doesn't solve the long,

369
00:20:11.801 --> 00:20:13.860
long term problem.
But we're also,
as,

370
00:20:13.861 --> 00:20:16.620
as I discussed with Jordan and you can watch the two videos that are on our

371
00:20:16.621 --> 00:20:18.060
channel and on Jordan's channel,

372
00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:21.060
we're working on some technological answers to this.

373
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:26.160
I think that there may be multi multipronged and sort of,
um,

374
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:30.030
multilayered versions of how we're going to put all of this out.

375
00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:31.170
That may be some,
you know,

376
00:20:31.171 --> 00:20:34.950
maybe we'll have everything on the traditional platforms and be putting up

377
00:20:34.951 --> 00:20:39.070
everything,
uh,
on blockchain.
I'm there.
There's all sorts of ways we're,

378
00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:41.280
we're trying to hit this and trust me,

379
00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:45.240
the amount of people that have reached out to me that work at Google,

380
00:20:45.241 --> 00:20:47.810
that work at Facebook,
that work at Yahoo,
uh,

381
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:51.190
that are tech startup people that are just regular folks in the middle of

382
00:20:51.191 --> 00:20:52.870
nowhere.
It's like,
man,

383
00:20:52.871 --> 00:20:56.500
people see an opportunity here and this is what freedom is all about,
right?

384
00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:00.100
Someone is going to solve this.
I hope that I'm part of it,
right?

385
00:21:00.101 --> 00:21:03.250
Like I hope the right thing comes across here where the right idea pops.

386
00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.200
And it's like,
I'm part of the thing that solves this.

387
00:21:05.201 --> 00:21:08.770
But if you are watching this right now,
if you can solve this freaking thing,

388
00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:12.850
I'll join you on that platform.
Like,
let's figure this thing out together.
Okay.

389
00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:17.890
Uh,
shout outs.
Alex,
Christine,
Bryan,
Jenna,
Christopher Page.
Michael James.

390
00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:22.090
Neal.
Thank you guys.
Uh,
Neil in California.
He's getting a mug.

391
00:21:22.091 --> 00:21:24.430
I'm going to do that right now.
Uh,

392
00:21:24.431 --> 00:21:28.990
also drew and Glen are getting mugs.
Thank you guys.
I signed that one already.

393
00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:33.730
Uh,
so okay,
there we go.
That's for Neil.

394
00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:38.710
Where's this one?
Hold on.
I got,
I'm going to need more mugs.
Uh,
this is for Glenn.

395
00:21:38.711 --> 00:21:43.450
There you go,
brother.
Thank you very much.
And one more,
right?

396
00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:47.950
There you go.
You're getting the full day Reuben signature right there.
Um,

397
00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:53.260
you know,
the other piece of this thing that's interesting is that,
you know,

398
00:21:53.261 --> 00:21:55.510
everyone,
as I said,
everyone has different considerations.

399
00:21:55.511 --> 00:21:56.950
Everyone does things differently.

400
00:21:56.951 --> 00:21:59.800
So like I've had all these networks reaching out to me.

401
00:21:59.801 --> 00:22:01.870
I don't want to name them right now,
but I there,

402
00:22:01.871 --> 00:22:04.900
I know right now that there are a couple of different networks that are sort of

403
00:22:04.901 --> 00:22:07.570
vying for me to join them.
Um,

404
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:11.440
the fact that I can make my own schedule that,
you know,

405
00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:14.110
in December we basically pretending,

406
00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:17.200
I think we did some of the best shows we've ever done in December.
Um,

407
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:19.240
most of them were pre-taped,
uh,

408
00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:23.120
because I had done all sorts of travel with Jordan and we're doing more travel.

409
00:22:23.121 --> 00:22:25.300
Like we're going to try to do some more stuff on the road.

410
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.540
Like I can make every decision that I think is right because of the freedom that

411
00:22:28.541 --> 00:22:29.410
you guys are afforded to me.

412
00:22:29.411 --> 00:22:33.850
So please don't think that that is lost on me because it's a,
it's awesome.
Uh,

413
00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:35.110
have I talked to Sargon lately?

414
00:22:35.111 --> 00:22:38.620
We've traded a couple emails and I think at some point we'll probably do a Skype

415
00:22:38.621 --> 00:22:39.730
chat.
Um,

416
00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.430
but we were sort of waiting for a little bit of the dust to settle here and

417
00:22:42.431 --> 00:22:46.510
we'll,
we'll figure it out.
So yes,
we will,
we will do something with him.
Uh,

418
00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:51.190
any information on professed goals to develop slash back in alternative platform

419
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:53.680
as well as a funding strategy for said product.

420
00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:55.960
So I can't get into all of this right now.

421
00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:59.290
Suffice to say that as I discussed with Jordan,
we are working on something.

422
00:22:59.291 --> 00:23:04.291
He was building out something already that had some of the technological needs

423
00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.350
that we would need for a Patriot unlike platform.

424
00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:10.180
But there's all sorts of questions here.
Like,

425
00:23:10.181 --> 00:23:11.770
I will be very honest with you guys,

426
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:16.930
is the idea that we should be building a platform that absolutely everyone

427
00:23:16.931 --> 00:23:17.620
should be on,

428
00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:21.840
that then becomes the home of all sorts of nefarious activities and,

429
00:23:21.841 --> 00:23:26.110
and bad people.
Now that let's say it's within the realm of legality at least,

430
00:23:26.111 --> 00:23:28.960
right?
Like,
okay,
I in principle I can get there,
but it's like,

431
00:23:28.961 --> 00:23:31.930
do I want to be the leader of that platform?

432
00:23:31.931 --> 00:23:35.860
And also when it gets to the moment where there has to be actual gatekeeping

433
00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:39.520
where somebody does something that's really bananas,
it's like,

434
00:23:39.521 --> 00:23:44.140
do I want to be the guy or do I want to be on the board of the group that has to

435
00:23:44.141 --> 00:23:48.020
make the decision to boot people.
Like,
I don't know that,
that's exactly for me.

436
00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:51.980
Um,
but again,
this is why blockchain might resolve some of these things.
So we'll,

437
00:23:51.981 --> 00:23:56.930
we'll figure out some of that.
Um,
okay.
Couple of other uh,
shout outs,
Angelo,

438
00:23:56.931 --> 00:24:01.520
Adam,
John and John and Ian.
Uh,
and a couple more mugs.
Peter,

439
00:24:01.521 --> 00:24:06.230
drew and Christian.
I'm gonna need more bugs guys.
We're running low on mugs here.

440
00:24:06.231 --> 00:24:10.670
We only put about 20 here to start.
Okay,
we got that one,
that one drew.

441
00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:15.710
There you go.
My man and a,
I'm going to need another mug for Christian.

442
00:24:15.711 --> 00:24:19.190
Okay.
Um,
here we go.
Uh,

443
00:24:19.191 --> 00:24:22.160
just subscribed@daverubin.com.
Donate for 25 bucks a month.

444
00:24:22.161 --> 00:24:25.440
Keep up the excellent work and the good fight.
You got it,
my friend.
Uh,

445
00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:29.450
thank you for your hard work and putting your principles ahead of the money.
Um,

446
00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.510
let me just address that quick because I,
I said this before,

447
00:24:32.511 --> 00:24:37.160
you can just toss them down.
We're again,
um,
I said this before but um,

448
00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:38.780
you know,
it's funny like,

449
00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:42.590
so in the last couple of weeks are our patrion when we got on Patrion as I said

450
00:24:42.591 --> 00:24:45.230
in,
uh,
in June of 2016,

451
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:50.630
patron was mostly like video gamers and some other interesting creators,

452
00:24:50.631 --> 00:24:53.330
but not a lot of political people.
I think I was really one of the first,

453
00:24:53.331 --> 00:24:57.020
if not the first from sort of the more political free speech space to get on

454
00:24:57.021 --> 00:24:58.100
there.
And then once I got in there,

455
00:24:58.101 --> 00:25:01.100
that sort of broke the dam and then a then a whole bunch of other people that
on.

456
00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:04.400
Um,
we got to our original funding goal,

457
00:25:04.401 --> 00:25:07.440
I think we originally asked for for 20 grand a month.
Uh,

458
00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:09.350
eventually we moved that up to 30 grand a month.

459
00:25:09.351 --> 00:25:12.590
That helped me literally buy this house,
build this studio.
We've,

460
00:25:12.591 --> 00:25:16.060
we've been able to Redo the studio,
hire fulltime or as part timers,

461
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:20.090
all of those things.
Um,
because of you guys.
Um,

462
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:25.690
but what I was also realizing along the road was that why back?

463
00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:27.180
You know what,
it's not even where,

464
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:30.590
what I was realizing basically was it's like having,

465
00:25:30.591 --> 00:25:31.940
even if this was all going great,

466
00:25:31.941 --> 00:25:35.120
why shouldn't we absolutely control line everything we're doing?

467
00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:39.650
Why not take that last step to sort of true independence?
So,
all right,
let's see.

468
00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:43.580
Um,
hey Dave,
as much as I hate the idea of government intervention,

469
00:25:43.581 --> 00:25:47.240
is it time for the government to look into the d platforming issue or is that

470
00:25:47.241 --> 00:25:49.340
too much of a slippery slope?
I think this is,

471
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:54.430
this might be the digital conversation to have in 2019,

472
00:25:54.681 --> 00:25:57.890
as I said in the video with Jordan.
What kind of Internet do you want?

473
00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:01.400
What kind of ability to communicate with other people?
Do you want,

474
00:26:01.401 --> 00:26:03.470
we're going to really have to start thinking about it now.

475
00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:05.810
Look from a libertarian perspective,

476
00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:10.250
the idea that the government would come in and and and break up these companies

477
00:26:10.251 --> 00:26:12.140
are forced them to do anything.
It,

478
00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.690
it makes no sense from a libertarian perspective,

479
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:18.260
from a classical liberal perspective where you you're more okay with a light

480
00:26:18.261 --> 00:26:22.010
touch of the government.
There could be some argument.
That makes sense.

481
00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:26.810
Certainly from a more conservative argument because conservatives generally are

482
00:26:26.811 --> 00:26:28.160
antigovernment but then our,

483
00:26:28.161 --> 00:26:31.640
okay often with breaking up monopolies and things like that.
Okay.

484
00:26:31.641 --> 00:26:33.350
There is now from a leftie perspective,

485
00:26:33.351 --> 00:26:35.450
you have that you'd love to have the government involved in everything.

486
00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:38.870
My feelings still right now,
even though I'm,

487
00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:42.170
I'm right in the thick of this thing and it would be nice to have like,
you know,

488
00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:46.170
some super power just come in and fix the whole damn thing is that I believe in

489
00:26:46.171 --> 00:26:50.580
human ingenuity,
this problem will be solved.
There are people watching this.

490
00:26:50.581 --> 00:26:53.540
I have no doubt there are people watching this that work at Google,
at work,

491
00:26:53.541 --> 00:26:56.040
at all of these companies that want to solve these things.

492
00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.890
I don't think everyone is a social justice warrior.

493
00:26:58.891 --> 00:27:03.891
I don't think everyone wants to be this hysterical preening Morling monster that

494
00:27:04.711 --> 00:27:08.160
is writing these terms of services that is deciding who can speak and who won't

495
00:27:08.161 --> 00:27:11.220
speak in all of these things.
So I think that,
um,

496
00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:13.230
I think that ingenuity is the way to do it.

497
00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:17.430
There's always an argument to be made that the government should jump in and,

498
00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.340
and do these things.
And I just think that the,

499
00:27:20.341 --> 00:27:23.310
say if you give the government more power,
right,

500
00:27:23.311 --> 00:27:27.000
you give the government more power,
the government does not give that power back.

501
00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:31.110
So you have to be very,
very,
very careful.
That said,
look,

502
00:27:31.111 --> 00:27:36.020
Prager u sued youtube over restricting their videos.
I love Dennis Prager.
We,

503
00:27:36.021 --> 00:27:39.570
we,
I think just have a difference of opinion on that and that that's just how it

504
00:27:39.571 --> 00:27:44.560
is.
All right,
I got some more mugs here.
So here we go.
Uh,
Steven and Kenny,

505
00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:48.910
you're getting mugs.
Thank you guys very much.
I appreciate it.
That's for you,

506
00:27:48.911 --> 00:27:53.470
Steven.
There you go,
brother and Kenny,
you're getting a mug.

507
00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:58.870
There we go.
All right.
And you're getting a t shirt to a super chat.

508
00:27:58.871 --> 00:28:01.390
Thanks Dave.
You got it.
Love the show or right.

509
00:28:01.391 --> 00:28:05.500
Loved Dave and the IDW civil discourse among people with disparate ideas.

510
00:28:05.501 --> 00:28:09.640
Why not?
Right?
Um,
I'm getting a lot of thank you's here.

511
00:28:09.641 --> 00:28:12.520
There's a lot of thank you's,
but I want to get to some questions.
Um,

512
00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:17.650
do you think you and Jordan will make a big enough dent to Patrion if they're

513
00:28:17.651 --> 00:28:22.150
forced to change their ways because of,
uh,
the exit pegs it,

514
00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:24.720
who would you return?
So this is interesting.
So look,

515
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:30.110
when we started this thing,
when this thing all hit at the beginning of,
uh,

516
00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.950
December,
I think we were at that point,

517
00:28:31.951 --> 00:28:34.770
we were making around 30 grand a month on Patrion.
Now of course,

518
00:28:34.771 --> 00:28:38.580
that sounds like a lot of money,
right?
So 30 grand a month times 12 months,

519
00:28:38.581 --> 00:28:43.470
we're looking at about 400.
No,
it's 300 and 360 grand a year,

520
00:28:43.471 --> 00:28:46.650
something like that.
Right?
Um,
now that is obviously a lot of money.

521
00:28:46.651 --> 00:28:50.500
Now when I tell you that I have employees and mortgages and insurance and all of

522
00:28:50.501 --> 00:28:53.130
that other nonsense to make a business,
it's actually not that much money.

523
00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:56.730
But I'm not sitting here complaining and this isn't cry me a river or anything

524
00:28:56.731 --> 00:28:59.730
like that.
Now they're,
they get a small PR,
you know,
whatever it was.

525
00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:03.090
They get let's say 5% of that or something like that and then some other fees on

526
00:29:03.091 --> 00:29:06.570
top of that.
Jordan,
I don't know exactly what he was making per month,
but I know,

527
00:29:06.571 --> 00:29:07.950
I know it was more than that.

528
00:29:07.951 --> 00:29:12.951
Sam was probably in that category as well is is are all of us leaving and

529
00:29:13.081 --> 00:29:15.000
whoever else is leaving,
I think Tim pool left.

530
00:29:15.001 --> 00:29:19.050
I think some other people are planning on leaving our,
all of us leaving,

531
00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:23.070
going to cause enough of a dent in their finances to have them turn around now,

532
00:29:23.071 --> 00:29:25.050
if I'm not mistaken,
but someone can check on this.

533
00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:29.730
Patriotic got about $450 million in VC funding in the last like year or two.

534
00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:33.780
So let's say we cause them to lose a couple hundred grand or even a couple

535
00:29:33.781 --> 00:29:37.040
million this year and people are really pissed at them.
Do they?

536
00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:41.380
If they really have just bought into social justice and bought this,

537
00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:46.180
this language control and all of this nonsense,
it's like a couple million bucks,

538
00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:48.340
probably doesn't hurt them at all.
And if anything,

539
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.400
the people who are funding that might be thrilled that they're getting us off

540
00:29:51.401 --> 00:29:52.234
these platforms.

541
00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.930
So that's why I think it's completely legit for some people to say,

542
00:29:55.931 --> 00:29:58.510
I'm going to stay here and fight.
And for some people to go,

543
00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:00.970
it's like any other movement of any time,
right?

544
00:30:00.971 --> 00:30:05.350
Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Junior didn't agree on every tactic and I'm in

545
00:30:05.351 --> 00:30:07.330
no way comparing us to them.
But you know what I mean?

546
00:30:07.331 --> 00:30:10.180
Like this is just how things,
how every battle is fought.

547
00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:12.130
You have people that want to be more aggressive.

548
00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.110
You have people that want to change things from the inside.

549
00:30:14.111 --> 00:30:16.240
You have people that want to leave and come from the outside.

550
00:30:16.241 --> 00:30:19.720
You have all of those different dynamics.
So we're all gonna try.
Look,

551
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:22.690
the fact that nobody's from from Patriot has reached out to me.

552
00:30:22.691 --> 00:30:26.140
Nobody's reached out to Jordan.
I don't think anyone reached out to Sam.

553
00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:30.160
I think in a weird way,
they're mostly probably happy that we're going.
Um,

554
00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:32.470
but that doesn't mean it's a reason to stay.
I think you just,

555
00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:37.060
you gotta do what you think is right.
I really do believe that.
Um,

556
00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:40.630
what are your options after Patrion?
So as I said at the moment,

557
00:30:40.631 --> 00:30:43.810
we want to shift as many of you guys to monthly donations that Dave

558
00:30:43.811 --> 00:30:45.970
rubin.com/donate,
which by the way,
we're taking,

559
00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:48.730
we're taking bitcoin there as well.
Um,

560
00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:52.270
and then the hope is that we will solve the longterm problem,

561
00:30:52.271 --> 00:30:54.820
which I think is probably a crypto answer.
But in the meantime,

562
00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:57.730
there are many other ways of,
of doing subscription things.

563
00:30:57.910 --> 00:30:59.140
We're going to try to figure out,
I mean,

564
00:30:59.141 --> 00:31:03.310
I know one of the reasons that people loved Patrion was you had access to an ad

565
00:31:03.311 --> 00:31:05.920
free version of the podcast.
So we're going to look into that.

566
00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:08.530
We're going to look into a couple other things related to what,

567
00:31:08.531 --> 00:31:10.960
what other things we can do for you guys.
Uh,

568
00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:12.850
but at the moment it's about getting everybody,

569
00:31:12.851 --> 00:31:15.970
just getting everybody to move over and then hopefully whatever we build on the

570
00:31:15.971 --> 00:31:20.560
other side of that,
we'll be able to just flip the,
uh,
the info.
Uh,
so like,

571
00:31:20.561 --> 00:31:23.020
so stripe is the payment processor we're using.

572
00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:25.500
I think they're pretty decent and I think that they're,

573
00:31:25.501 --> 00:31:28.540
they're going to offer us some protections and that hopefully what we build

574
00:31:28.541 --> 00:31:28.841
after,

575
00:31:28.841 --> 00:31:32.710
we'd be able to fold in the info that we have from you guys on stripe into the

576
00:31:32.711 --> 00:31:36.490
next thing.
Um,
okay.
Um,

577
00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:41.050
what will you do if Richard Spencer or David Duke signs up as a creator on your

578
00:31:41.051 --> 00:31:44.170
platform?
Will you remove them or leave them on?
So this is,
uh,

579
00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:47.950
so first off this is about the,
the thing that Jordan and I are working on.

580
00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:50.530
We are working through all of these problems.

581
00:31:50.531 --> 00:31:53.980
We are trying to decide if this should be an invite only platform or should it

582
00:31:53.981 --> 00:31:55.840
be up to everybody.
As I said before,

583
00:31:55.841 --> 00:32:00.841
there are major issues related to terms of service and all of these things.

584
00:32:01.511 --> 00:32:05.470
So I don't want to comment on that specifically yet because it would be because

585
00:32:05.471 --> 00:32:08.770
it's being worked out at the moment.
I think you know me,

586
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:12.190
I think you guys know me well enough that I will do everything I can to defend

587
00:32:12.191 --> 00:32:14.770
everyone's right to be able to say what they want.

588
00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:18.400
That does not mean there aren't going to be consequences and I also believe that

589
00:32:18.401 --> 00:32:20.620
private companies can do what they want.

590
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:23.680
There is the question of platform verse publisher here,

591
00:32:23.681 --> 00:32:26.860
which is really interesting as as a,

592
00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:30.300
I said in the thing with Jordan the other day to loosely quote Eric Weinstein,

593
00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:33.370
should conservatives be allowed to drive on public roads?

594
00:32:33.371 --> 00:32:34.870
I mean at at some point,

595
00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:39.100
should conservatives or conservatives or anyone that's outside of the
mainstream,

596
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:43.130
should they be allowed to have access to telephones and running water at their

597
00:32:43.131 --> 00:32:46.550
house and all of these things because that's how important these modes of

598
00:32:46.551 --> 00:32:49.890
communication these platforms are.
It's like this is your,

599
00:32:49.891 --> 00:32:51.350
your way to connect with the world.

600
00:32:51.351 --> 00:32:53.900
And if they're allowed to say you can't connect with the world,
well,

601
00:32:53.901 --> 00:32:57.320
what else are they allowed to hold off on you on?

602
00:32:57.450 --> 00:33:01.040
So it's a lot to think about it.
It's a lot to think about for sure.
All right,

603
00:33:01.041 --> 00:33:04.910
let me jump back in.
We got a lot of shout outs here.
Uh,

Thank you guys for donating.
Why we're doing this.

608
00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:23.930
Just a reminder in case you're just jumping in,

609
00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:28.240
if you donate a Dave rubin.com/donate uh,

610
00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:31.850
for 25 bucks monthly,
you're going to get the Ruben report shirt.

611
00:33:31.851 --> 00:33:33.770
There's only about 200 of these left on earth.

612
00:33:33.771 --> 00:33:35.500
They will never be made again because these were the,

613
00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:38.780
the patrion shirts that we were given to our patrons.

614
00:33:38.781 --> 00:33:41.990
So since we're leaving Patrion,
we're not going to print any more of these.
Uh,

615
00:33:41.991 --> 00:33:46.040
and if you do $50 and above,
monthly on a,

616
00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:47.680
on Dave Rubin dot conversation.
I it,

617
00:33:47.681 --> 00:33:51.080
you're going to get the shirt and I'm going to sign a Mug for ya right here.

618
00:33:51.081 --> 00:33:54.890
Okay.
Uh,
Timothy and Bonnie.
Thank you guys.
Um,

619
00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:57.560
let's see.
Uh,
hi Dave.

620
00:33:57.561 --> 00:34:00.470
I appreciate how thoughtful you've been with your decision to leave.

621
00:34:00.471 --> 00:34:04.850
Patrion I agree with you that there's a solution to the d platforming issue on

622
00:34:04.851 --> 00:34:06.590
Patrion and other sites.
Uh,

623
00:34:06.591 --> 00:34:10.010
have you seen today's headline about Mckayla Peterson's brief suspension from

624
00:34:10.011 --> 00:34:11.960
youtube?
Uh,
so I did see that.

625
00:34:11.961 --> 00:34:16.410
So Jordan looped me and I know Mikayla obviously through Jordan.
Uh,

626
00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:18.860
mckayla is Jordan's daughter.
Mikayla,
uh,

627
00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:22.610
has a youtube channel and has been a big proponent of the carnival or diet,

628
00:34:22.611 --> 00:34:26.780
which she,
I don't want to,
I don't want to misquote her at all here,

629
00:34:26.781 --> 00:34:31.781
but she basically has been eating exclusively red meat and it has solved a lot

630
00:34:32.061 --> 00:34:35.690
of,
of her health problems.
She had all sorts of health problems,

631
00:34:35.691 --> 00:34:37.940
I think rheumatoid arthritis and a whole bunch of other things.

632
00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:40.610
And through this diet,
it is seriously helped her.

633
00:34:40.611 --> 00:34:43.130
She's been on Joe Rogan talking about it and a whole bunch of other things.

634
00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:48.290
Her channel got a strike two days ago or it might've even been yesterday and she

635
00:34:48.291 --> 00:34:49.010
was gonna have,
uh,

636
00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:51.620
she was going to be temporarily banned or something for three months.

637
00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:56.030
And of course youtube doesn't know why.
So then again,
or it doesn't tell you why.

638
00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:59.660
And this is why all of this is so tough to deal with.
So even me right now,

639
00:34:59.661 --> 00:35:02.290
so we're about to cross a million subscribers.
Um,

640
00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.910
obviously the show's doing incredibly well.
Last month was,

641
00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:08.390
I think our second or third best month in subscribers and views and all that

642
00:35:08.391 --> 00:35:12.380
stuff.
I don't even have a personal contact at Youtube.
I have no,

643
00:35:12.381 --> 00:35:13.760
if I have a problem with Youtube,

644
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:18.080
I have to fill out a generic form that they just send you some robotic answer

645
00:35:18.081 --> 00:35:21.830
back.
I don't even have an email or a name of someone at youtube to contact.

646
00:35:21.831 --> 00:35:25.750
Like that's the problem.
These companies have become so big that they,

647
00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:29.480
they operate as sort of monolithic government.
And how,
again,

648
00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.480
do I think that the government coming in and breaking up those companies will

649
00:35:32.481 --> 00:35:33.291
somehow make them better?

650
00:35:33.291 --> 00:35:35.720
Do I think the government that doesn't really understand technology,

651
00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:39.180
if they could only break up technology companies would make any of this better?

652
00:35:39.181 --> 00:35:43.650
Or if government regulators had to come in and audit youtube every now and again

653
00:35:43.651 --> 00:35:46.380
and say,
you know,
you have to give Dave Rubin a personal contact number.

654
00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:48.810
It's like,
I don't think any of that is the answer.
Um,

655
00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:51.930
but I think by talking about these issues,
this is the funny thing.

656
00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:54.090
You see this all the time when,

657
00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:58.860
when you talk about that competition is the answer a then you'll see all these

658
00:35:58.861 --> 00:36:01.350
people that'll be like,
oh,
see you free market people.

659
00:36:01.351 --> 00:36:03.630
You don't want the government involved.
You're not allowed to complain.

660
00:36:03.631 --> 00:36:07.200
And it's like,
no,
you're supposed to.
That's what you do in a free society.

661
00:36:07.201 --> 00:36:11.580
You exercise your freedom to hopefully change things for the better,

662
00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:16.410
which is exactly what we're doing here.
Okay.
Uh,
shout outs to Anthony,
Andrew,

663
00:36:16.411 --> 00:36:19.710
Robert,
Chris and Laurie and conservative Mexican.

664
00:36:19.711 --> 00:36:24.210
He just upgraded his mug status.
So I'm going to sign him a mug.
Thank you.

665
00:36:24.211 --> 00:36:28.200
Conservative Mexican.
I,
you know,
I've got to tell you guys,
uh,
since uh,

666
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:32.370
since your name is conservative Mexican there I have met a lot of conservative

667
00:36:32.371 --> 00:36:36.290
Mexicans in the last year that I did not really know where out there either at

668
00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:40.240
my standup shows are at the Petersen shows.
Uh,
I've met a lot of not,

669
00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:43.020
not only Mexicans,
I've met a lot of conservative Latino people.
Oh.

670
00:36:43.021 --> 00:36:45.960
And actually speaking of stand up,
if you're in Ontario,
California,

671
00:36:45.961 --> 00:36:49.290
which is southern Cali,
about half hour,
45 minutes from La,

672
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:53.820
I will be there on January 9th doing stand up,
uh,
and then uh,
uh,
live,

673
00:36:53.821 --> 00:36:58.020
sit down with a,
with Bret Weinstein on January 9th.
And on January 30th,

674
00:36:58.021 --> 00:37:02.430
I will be in Irvine County or I will be in Irvine,
which is in Orange County,

675
00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:06.510
California.
Uh,
and there will be a surprise IDW guests with their,

676
00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:08.700
with me there to the standup shows have just been great.

677
00:37:08.701 --> 00:37:11.970
Like I'm getting back to my roots.
I promise you it's a standup show.

678
00:37:11.971 --> 00:37:14.310
Like you have not seen.
It's sort of just a free for all.

679
00:37:14.311 --> 00:37:17.160
I just sort of do a town hall.
I tell a couple of jokes,

680
00:37:17.161 --> 00:37:18.590
but I'm just messing around with the crowd.

681
00:37:18.591 --> 00:37:22.890
I give stuff away and it's completely politically incorrect and we're just

682
00:37:22.891 --> 00:37:26.850
having a ball and I think you'll enjoy it.
Uh,
Robert,
you're getting a mug.

683
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:30.870
Here you go,
Robert.
Thank you very much.
Okay.

684
00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:35.730
I felt that was a particularly good signature.
Here we go.
Let's see.

685
00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:40.350
Um,
man,
this a zillion look at this question is just flying in here.

686
00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:42.090
Um,
hey Dave,

687
00:37:42.091 --> 00:37:46.680
will there be a video slash live stream of you shutting down the Patriot account

688
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:48.630
on the 15th so we've been discussing that.

689
00:37:48.631 --> 00:37:51.990
I actually think it would be pretty cool if I have my laptop and I literally

690
00:37:51.991 --> 00:37:54.840
just like walk up to the camera over there and press delete.

691
00:37:54.841 --> 00:37:57.240
So we have a whole bunch of scheduling things going on.

692
00:37:57.450 --> 00:38:01.770
January is completely bananas because I'm going to be in Australia for most of

693
00:38:01.771 --> 00:38:06.000
February,
so we're taping a ton of stuff in January.
Um,

694
00:38:06.001 --> 00:38:08.310
so that we have content obviously for February,

695
00:38:08.311 --> 00:38:10.140
but I think we'll probably do that.

696
00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:13.590
I want to make sure that there aren't technical reasons why we couldn't do that,

697
00:38:13.591 --> 00:38:16.740
but yes,
I think we're gonna try to do that.
Um,

698
00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:19.500
thanks for stepping up and being a leader in this freedom of speech and helping

699
00:38:19.501 --> 00:38:22.410
us all have a voice.
You know,
I have nothing better to do.

700
00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:26.370
That's really the truth.
Uh,
why have you in Jordan not performing Germany yet?
20,

701
00:38:26.371 --> 00:38:29.340
19.
Yeah,
I think we're going to be in Germany either in May or June.

702
00:38:29.341 --> 00:38:33.060
We're working out the rest of that European tour.
Um,

703
00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:38.650
let's see.
Um,
holy cow is lot here.
Um,

704
00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:43.680
how can we get in on the Beta test version of your and JPS Patrion on

705
00:38:43.681 --> 00:38:44.860
alternative?
Uh,

706
00:38:44.861 --> 00:38:48.910
I think there will be an answer to that probably within the next month or so.

707
00:38:48.911 --> 00:38:52.540
I think they'll probably end up being a landing page and sort of an invite only

708
00:38:52.541 --> 00:38:55.910
to the beta.
So hang tight on that.
I mean,
it's not just that,

709
00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:59.740
not only do you have to build tech and solve these problems and address terms of

710
00:38:59.741 --> 00:39:00.101
service,

711
00:39:00.101 --> 00:39:02.710
it's like there's a whole bunch of other stuff you've got to figure out about

712
00:39:02.711 --> 00:39:05.200
branding.
We got a business to build,
like there's a million,

713
00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:08.910
a million million things.
So I think our one sort of,
um,

714
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:13.240
slight mistake was that in the first video that I did with Jordan,
um,

715
00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:16.900
Jordan said that he was going to try or thought it was possible that maybe we

716
00:39:16.901 --> 00:39:20.020
could get it out by December 25th or January 1st.

717
00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:22.480
That was probably a little bit,
uh,

718
00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:25.990
over ambitious just because we really wanted to solve a problem.
So it was like,

719
00:39:25.991 --> 00:39:29.950
holy cow,
can we do this quick and just,
just get some bare bones thing up.

720
00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:31.540
And then when we really thought about it,

721
00:39:31.541 --> 00:39:34.350
it's like you really do have to be methodical and you want to make sure that,

722
00:39:34.351 --> 00:39:37.660
that,
that all of those pressure points that you can be taken down on either

723
00:39:37.661 --> 00:39:40.840
technologically or because of the mob or everything else or because the media is

724
00:39:40.841 --> 00:39:41.770
going to come after you.

725
00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:44.080
You want to make sure that you're covering all your bases here.

726
00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:48.400
So we are covering our bases.
I promise you that.
Ben,
are you ready for a mug?

727
00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:52.570
I'm sending you a Mug.
Thank you,
Ben.
Alright,
there you go.

728
00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:54.070
I'm going to need more mugs guys.

729
00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:57.220
And you're getting a t shirt to everyone that gets a Mug,
gets a tee shirt.

730
00:39:57.430 --> 00:40:00.460
Dave rubin.com/donate a is where you're going to do that.

731
00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:04.990
A superchat happy new year.
Thank you very much.
Uh,
I absolutely love your show.

732
00:40:04.991 --> 00:40:08.380
How do I get my wife to watch your show with?
And you put that part in caps.

733
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:11.530
I like that.
Um,
that's funny.
You know,

734
00:40:11.531 --> 00:40:14.170
I get a lot of messages from people that are having problems.

735
00:40:14.171 --> 00:40:17.860
I get messages from people that are getting divorced over politics because it's

736
00:40:17.861 --> 00:40:22.861
you usually not always the case is that the woman is a lefty SJW the whole thing

737
00:40:24.881 --> 00:40:28.240
and that the man has been trying to um,
you know,

738
00:40:28.241 --> 00:40:32.470
show her some of these videos or just break her out of that mindset.

739
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:35.620
It's not always that way with the female on one side of the male and the other.

740
00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:38.770
Um,
but I've literally gotten messages of people that are getting divorced over

741
00:40:38.771 --> 00:40:39.940
politics,
which is sad.

742
00:40:39.941 --> 00:40:43.780
And it's also like that's why not everything should be political.

743
00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:45.820
And it's why if you look at my Twitter,

744
00:40:45.821 --> 00:40:48.730
I don't tweet about the political machinations everyday.

745
00:40:48.731 --> 00:40:51.730
I don't think I've tweeted once about the government shutdown.

746
00:40:51.731 --> 00:40:54.790
It's like politics is starting to become incredibly boring to me.

747
00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:59.470
What is interesting to me is what is happening culturally and what is happening

748
00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:03.610
with the way we relate with the way we relate to government with the way we

749
00:41:03.611 --> 00:41:07.210
relate to these platforms and the way we relate to conversation and our ability

750
00:41:07.211 --> 00:41:09.850
to communicate with each other.
That is really interesting to me.

751
00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:13.150
The little machinations of politics.
It's like,
man,
you've got,

752
00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:17.020
you've got half the country that,
that says Trump is Hitler,

753
00:41:17.021 --> 00:41:20.500
which is so absolutely bananas ridiculous.
And at the same time,

754
00:41:20.501 --> 00:41:23.020
their answer is they always want more government.
And it's like,
no,

755
00:41:23.021 --> 00:41:26.920
you should always want to strip the power away so that when it's somebody you

756
00:41:26.921 --> 00:41:28.270
don't like,
they don't have a lot of power.

757
00:41:28.271 --> 00:41:29.800
And then the trade off is when it's somebody you do,

758
00:41:29.801 --> 00:41:34.220
like maybe they can't get everything done that you want in your Utopian society.

759
00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:39.780
Um,
okay.
Uh,
shout outs.
No,
El Cerrito,

760
00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:44.540
Mike,
he,
Wayne Christian,
Linda,
Mike,
Chris,
Peter,
Nicholas and Paul.

761
00:41:44.541 --> 00:41:49.130
Thank you guys very much.
I really do appreciate it.
Um,
okay.

762
00:41:49.131 --> 00:41:51.050
A lot of people are saying that I should delete the,
uh,

763
00:41:51.051 --> 00:41:52.970
the Patriot account online.
So maybe I'll do it.

764
00:41:52.971 --> 00:41:55.760
I'll just bust out the laptop and just do it in front of you guys.

765
00:41:55.761 --> 00:41:59.030
That would actually be pretty fun.
Um,
there's a lot of super chats coming in.
I'm,

766
00:41:59.031 --> 00:42:03.920
I'm trying to try and read them here.
Um,
let's see.
Uh,

767
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:06.200
freedom of speech is worth a bit of inconvenience.

768
00:42:06.201 --> 00:42:10.610
Close my patron on account after January 1st auto payments and also paypal since

769
00:42:10.611 --> 00:42:12.560
they're complicit,
we'll look,
this is,

770
00:42:12.561 --> 00:42:15.260
this is the payment processor thing and believe me,

771
00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:18.800
I did not know what a tremendous amount about payment processing,
uh,

772
00:42:18.850 --> 00:42:20.180
until the last couple of weeks.

773
00:42:20.181 --> 00:42:23.750
And there are certain payment processors that are a little more willing to stand

774
00:42:23.751 --> 00:42:25.410
up to the mob.
Some of them aren't.
If,

775
00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:30.410
if an entire company has been sort of infected by by the progressive dogma,

776
00:42:30.411 --> 00:42:34.280
then they're going to drop anybody at the first sign of trouble.
Um,

777
00:42:34.281 --> 00:42:36.890
so we're talking to all sorts of people.
Uh,
as I said,
yes,

778
00:42:36.891 --> 00:42:40.880
tomorrow I have it just an insane day basically from 8:00 AM to the end of the

779
00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:44.360
day just taking calls and taking video chats with all sorts of people that think

780
00:42:44.361 --> 00:42:45.260
they have solutions.

781
00:42:45.261 --> 00:42:48.590
And so now it's like I've got like an as if I wasn't busy enough between the

782
00:42:48.591 --> 00:42:52.130
tour and I'm writing the book and I'm doing the show and doing standup.

783
00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:56.450
It's like,
now I have this alternate job as like a,
as like a tech guy,
which uh,

784
00:42:56.510 --> 00:43:01.160
is quite bizarre.
But life is strange.
Um,
let's see.

785
00:43:01.161 --> 00:43:04.040
I'm a strong conservative that has changed some of my beliefs because of your

786
00:43:04.041 --> 00:43:07.730
show.
While I appreciate that,
you know,
it's,
it's cool.
You know,
it's funny,

787
00:43:07.731 --> 00:43:08.870
there was this,
um,

788
00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:13.430
this data and society ridiculous report that was funded by some Soros group,

789
00:43:13.431 --> 00:43:15.380
doesn't matter,
um,
that did all this,

790
00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:19.160
this whole thing about how youtube is converting people into the alt right.

791
00:43:19.161 --> 00:43:20.480
And they somehow connected.

792
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:23.210
They just use lines to connect people that have talked to each other.

793
00:43:23.211 --> 00:43:26.320
So I'm connected to Joe Rogan and this guy is connected to Tim pool.

794
00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:29.480
This guy's connected to Sam Harris and this guy is connected to this.

795
00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:32.450
And it's like,
there was no methodology behind that.
Of course,

796
00:43:32.451 --> 00:43:35.840
as reclined at vox tweets out how important of a study it is and all this

797
00:43:35.841 --> 00:43:40.250
endless bullshit and buzzfeed does pieces on and the rest of it.
And,

798
00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:42.890
um,
the whole idea being that we're,

799
00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:45.950
that you're watching this show that you person watching this right now or

800
00:43:45.951 --> 00:43:47.030
watching this show,
you're watching,

801
00:43:47.031 --> 00:43:50.180
the conversations that I have listening to the things that I talk about are my

802
00:43:50.181 --> 00:43:50.870
guest talk about.

803
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:54.320
And somehow you're being radicalized to the alt right that you're hearing about

804
00:43:54.321 --> 00:43:55.160
the individual,

805
00:43:55.161 --> 00:43:58.250
and that we should treat people as individuals and treat everybody equally and

806
00:43:58.251 --> 00:44:01.880
should not be racist,
and we should not be prejudice and all of these things.

807
00:44:01.881 --> 00:44:05.880
And that somehow that's turning you ultra bright.
Um,
of course it's dribble.

808
00:44:05.881 --> 00:44:07.730
There was actually,
Tim pooled did a video on this.

809
00:44:07.731 --> 00:44:11.960
There was a guy who recently did a true analysis of a lot of these channels.

810
00:44:11.961 --> 00:44:15.110
And it turns out in many cases,
when people watch these shows,

811
00:44:15.111 --> 00:44:18.020
you have people that are hard,
more hardcore,
right?
Let's say,

812
00:44:18.021 --> 00:44:22.480
that are actually shifting a little bit more liberal.
Um,
it's all just dribbled.

813
00:44:22.481 --> 00:44:25.010
But I will tell you this,
that the focus,
you know,
it's why,

814
00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.690
why is there so much focus,

815
00:44:26.691 --> 00:44:29.300
buzzfeed and vox and New York Times and the rest of these things?

816
00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:32.730
Why are they always focusing on like this little crew of youtubers?

817
00:44:32.731 --> 00:44:35.430
Why do they want to take down puny pie so badly?
Well,

818
00:44:35.431 --> 00:44:37.890
it's like people are actually watching this.

819
00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:39.900
People are watching this and those companies,
they're,

820
00:44:39.901 --> 00:44:42.660
they're just funded to the tilts,
but they're,
they're dying,
they're dying,

821
00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:46.440
they're dinosaurs that should die and hopefully something better will be,

822
00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:50.520
will come after them.
So there you go.
All right,
shout outs to Thomas,
Robert,

823
00:44:50.521 --> 00:44:54.660
Robert and Irma and Dana,
you're getting them on sister.

824
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:56.010
I'm going to sign it right here.

825
00:44:56.290 --> 00:44:58.630
<v 2>Here you go.
There you go.</v>

826
00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:02.350
<v 1>You know what?
I will also offer up,</v>

827
00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:04.510
I don't know if I was going to get in trouble for doing this,

828
00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:08.920
but you know when we,
uh,
when we flipped our set,
uh,
when we,

829
00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:12.190
this past September,
we have most of our old set,

830
00:45:12.191 --> 00:45:14.350
we've got the chairs from our old set.

831
00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:17.400
I need to hang onto the red chair cause I still use it.
Um,

832
00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:19.330
when I do the three way conversations,

833
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:22.540
but we've got to have the guests chairs that my guests were always sitting and

834
00:45:22.541 --> 00:45:25.600
you may remember those awkward chairs and we've got the old table,

835
00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:27.010
the old coffee table.

836
00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:31.960
So I would say make us an offer that we can't refuse and maybe we can get you

837
00:45:31.961 --> 00:45:34.210
one of those if you want one of those.
Um,

838
00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:37.540
that would be a logistical nightmare probably in the shipping and
ridiculousness.

839
00:45:37.541 --> 00:45:40.390
But let's see.
Okay.
Um,

840
00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:42.073
<v 2>th</v>

841
00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:46.330
<v 1>the left doesn't care now that they control the media and the Internet platform,</v>

842
00:45:46.331 --> 00:45:47.440
company companies,

843
00:45:47.441 --> 00:45:50.130
if you want to know how they react when they are on the other side of the coin,

844
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:54.040
see the 1960s freedom of speech is a right,
regardless of which side you are on.

845
00:45:54.041 --> 00:45:57.460
And Dave and Jordan are right.
What is going on is very ominous and Orwellian.

846
00:45:57.580 --> 00:46:00.860
Well,
we'll look,
I agree.
Both sides can,

847
00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:02.620
can be pretty bad when it comes to speech.

848
00:46:02.621 --> 00:46:06.580
Remember it was the right that used to be all about video game violence,
right?

849
00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:09.520
That video games are causing violence and they should have warnings and

850
00:46:09.521 --> 00:46:13.300
shouldn't be sold and they were going to boycott the stores and all of these

851
00:46:13.301 --> 00:46:17.020
things.
So this is not necessarily our left right issue.
And again,

852
00:46:17.021 --> 00:46:17.890
we talk about this all the time,

853
00:46:17.891 --> 00:46:21.310
but this is also one of those things where it's like the left right paradigm is

854
00:46:21.311 --> 00:46:24.190
just becoming increasingly meaningless because you're either basically

855
00:46:24.191 --> 00:46:28.210
libertarian in that you're sort of,
that you're for personal freedom,

856
00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:31.210
which can be a little bit messy because that means someone else is going to have

857
00:46:31.211 --> 00:46:32.050
personal freedom to,

858
00:46:32.051 --> 00:46:35.470
and they might be doing something you don't like or you want central planning,

859
00:46:35.471 --> 00:46:37.150
you want state control over things.

860
00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:40.270
I think you guys know where I fall out on that.
Um,

861
00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:45.690
what I would say is that we want to build something that will be as open as

862
00:46:47.261 --> 00:46:51.940
possible,
that will also be protected from,
I mean,

863
00:46:51.941 --> 00:46:53.680
I've said this board,
it will be protected from the mob.

864
00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:57.310
It will be technologically sensible and it will offer some answers to some of

865
00:46:57.311 --> 00:46:57.790
these things.

866
00:46:57.790 --> 00:47:01.030
There's a little bit more that I could tell you that we've accomplished already,

867
00:47:01.031 --> 00:47:04.600
but I just can't quite get into all of that.
And I wish I could.
Okay.
Uh,

868
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:05.980
conservative Mexican,
he's back.

869
00:47:05.981 --> 00:47:10.650
Can I pick up my mug and shirt when I see you at a CSUF?

870
00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:15.550
Uh,
I met you at the Improv in Irvine.
Um,
yeah.
You know what,

871
00:47:15.551 --> 00:47:18.580
we'll make that happen guys.
Can you make a note of that conservative Mexican?

872
00:47:18.581 --> 00:47:22.030
We're gonna,
we're gonna bring him the shirt when I do that show on January 29th,

873
00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:24.730
which,
uh,
that reminds me,
January 9th,

874
00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:27.910
I'm at Ontario Improv down here in southern Cali.

875
00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:30.640
Bret Weinstein's going to joining me for that.
When I do about an hour,

876
00:47:30.641 --> 00:47:34.870
then will join me for about an hour live.
Sit down.
January 30th,
I'm at Irvine,

877
00:47:34.871 --> 00:47:38.770
California with an undisclosed member of the intellectual dark web and I'm at

878
00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:43.750
CSUF cal state,
uh,
on January 29th,
which is a college Gig,

879
00:47:43.751 --> 00:47:47.320
but they are selling tickets to the public on that too.
Okay.

880
00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:49.930
What the hell are we doing here?
A little radio reset for you.

881
00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:54.220
We are leaving patrion on January 15th.
That's it.
That's it.

882
00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:57.910
They don't want to respect free speech.
You got to stand up sometimes in life.

883
00:47:57.940 --> 00:48:02.590
It's weird.
Uh,
I'm watching my monthly revenue drop like hell and uh,

884
00:48:02.591 --> 00:48:05.640
and I'm getting emails from people that are inspiring me.
Um,

885
00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:09.850
so it's a little bizarre.
Uh,
if you go to Dave rubin.com/donate,
uh,

886
00:48:09.851 --> 00:48:14.590
we are gonna send you a Mug and a tee shirt.
If you jump in for a $50 and above,

887
00:48:14.591 --> 00:48:17.710
and I'll sign the mug right here for you.
If you do that on a monthly level,

888
00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:19.990
25 bucks,
you're getting the limited,

889
00:48:19.991 --> 00:48:23.500
never going to be printed again because they were just for Patriot tee shirts.

890
00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:27.670
Whew,
that's a lot of talking.
Okay.
And five bucks in above.

891
00:48:27.671 --> 00:48:29.200
And I'm just going to give you a shoutout right here.

892
00:48:29.201 --> 00:48:32.590
So I'm going to give a shout out to Jacob,
to William and to Garret and Aaron,

893
00:48:32.591 --> 00:48:33.490
Lawrence and Ricardo.

894
00:48:33.491 --> 00:48:37.660
You guys are getting mugs and that's a running out of mugs again.
All right,

895
00:48:37.661 --> 00:48:42.310
here we go.
There we go.
Mama Mia,

896
00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:44.590
keep the questions coming guys.
I'm seeing all these and um,

897
00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:49.390
I promise you I'm going to get to as many as possible.
Okay.
Um,

898
00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:51.500
<v 3>okay.</v>

899
00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:54.980
<v 1>This is real,
right?
It's real and it's raw.
That's what I can tell you.
You guys,</v>

900
00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:58.130
um,
let's see.

901
00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:04.850
Uh,
I seriously hope I can continue to listen to you and many others that I do.

902
00:49:04.851 --> 00:49:08.450
I think it was positive that you're taking a preemptive step versus waiting for

903
00:49:08.451 --> 00:49:11.540
the ax to fall,
assuming that it does.
Well,
that's interesting.

904
00:49:11.541 --> 00:49:13.070
So what I can tell you is this,

905
00:49:13.071 --> 00:49:17.360
so if you think about sort of the whole IDW crew,

906
00:49:17.361 --> 00:49:18.770
whatever that actually means to you,

907
00:49:18.771 --> 00:49:22.600
but let's say this group of 20 or 30 or so people,
I can tell you that the,

908
00:49:22.610 --> 00:49:26.630
the Sargon thing by Sargon getting booted,
everyone realized,

909
00:49:26.631 --> 00:49:27.980
even though some of the people had never met him,

910
00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:29.480
some of the people didn't know who he was.

911
00:49:29.481 --> 00:49:31.190
There were several people who didn't even know anything about him.

912
00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:34.790
Everybody was like this,
this one is just,
you know,

913
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:38.780
in life you don't get the perfect opportunity the second you want it.

914
00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:39.643
You know what I mean?

915
00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:42.410
You're either going to swing early sometimes and sometimes you're going to swing

916
00:49:42.411 --> 00:49:45.920
too late,
but sometimes you just got to swing.
And I think what I realized,

917
00:49:45.921 --> 00:49:47.720
at least for this one was it was like,

918
00:49:47.721 --> 00:49:51.740
not only because as I said to you earlier when I started waking up to some of

919
00:49:51.741 --> 00:49:54.800
these ideas,
Sargon was someone that was doing this on youtube.

920
00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:57.980
And although I don't know everything about him and,
and truth be told,

921
00:49:58.070 --> 00:49:59.990
I don't think I've watched a video of his in a year.

922
00:49:59.991 --> 00:50:02.090
I've just been extremely busy.
Um,

923
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:06.140
I know that he's basically a decent human and I know that he's not all to write.

924
00:50:06.141 --> 00:50:09.050
And I know that he's been fighting the forces of racism and the rest of it.

925
00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:13.820
And it's like we could just sit quietly,
right?
Like we could like the chances,

926
00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:17.870
I suppose,
well,
I think some of you would disagree with me on this,

927
00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:20.510
but I think the chances that they're going to come from me,

928
00:50:20.511 --> 00:50:24.140
let's say in the next couple of weeks or a couple of months,
are pretty slim,

929
00:50:24.141 --> 00:50:25.610
right?
Like basically,

930
00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:28.580
cause that would be such a massive vine that it would be bananas,

931
00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:31.070
but we just saw a massive move the line.

932
00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:36.170
So it's like we just don't know when it's gonna happen and you don't get that

933
00:50:36.171 --> 00:50:37.130
perfect moment.

934
00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:41.750
So maybe Sargon isn't the perfect case here that everyone's going to jump aboard

935
00:50:41.751 --> 00:50:46.640
and defend Jordan.
And I felt it was the right one and,
and here we are.
Um,
okay.

936
00:50:46.641 --> 00:50:48.230
Let's see.
Um,

937
00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:54.890
would you have tried to launch this new platform if paypal,
stripe,
mastercard,

938
00:50:54.891 --> 00:50:58.820
et Cetera,
had not caught off patriots competitions,
subscribed star?
That was big.

939
00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:01.440
So,
you know,
it was interesting when,
when this whole thing happened,

940
00:51:01.441 --> 00:51:04.130
subscribed star sort of came out of nowhere and everybody was like,
well,

941
00:51:04.131 --> 00:51:06.560
you gotta jump on subscribed.
Sorry.
It's the Patriana alternative.

942
00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:07.850
And what I kept saying,
everybody,

943
00:51:07.851 --> 00:51:11.330
and this was before I was even discussing with Jordan about doing a,
uh,

944
00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:14.150
an alternative platform,
alternative platform,

945
00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:19.850
was that just jumping to another site?
Even if their intentions are good,

946
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.730
it's just a,
it's just a little stop gap.

947
00:51:22.731 --> 00:51:26.060
Like this is a frog in a pot that is slowly boiling in the frog,

948
00:51:26.061 --> 00:51:27.350
doesn't know when it's going to be dead.

949
00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:29.720
That's sort of where we're at at the moment.
So just jumping,

950
00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:33.350
this has nothing to do with the people that subscribe star,
any of that,

951
00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:38.000
but it was just going to jump to sort of an earlier version of patrion which

952
00:51:38.001 --> 00:51:40.660
then lets say in a year from now if it had gone successfully,

953
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:42.680
would've had all of the problems of a patriot.

954
00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:44.870
So that's why I didn't want to do subscribe star.

955
00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:49.250
I suppose right now if substrate subscribe star had not had,

956
00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:52.460
I guess it was stripe and paypal and mastercard and whoever else.

957
00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:55.940
If they had not cut them off then I think there would be a little more

958
00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:58.220
legitimacy behind what subscribed started doing.

959
00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:02.000
But that's why I'm saying this is a massive technological problem that perhaps

960
00:52:02.001 --> 00:52:07.001
can only be solved by blockchain and in the meantime if we can just remove as

961
00:52:07.401 --> 00:52:10.340
many middlemen as possible for all that you guys see.

962
00:52:10.341 --> 00:52:14.060
That's another interesting thing is that there's a real generational shift here.

963
00:52:14.061 --> 00:52:17.570
We know that most of the people that watch these videos on youtube are younger,

964
00:52:17.571 --> 00:52:21.170
younger people are more willing to spend their hard earned dollars supporting

965
00:52:21.171 --> 00:52:24.590
people that care about the things that they care about.
So like back in the day,

966
00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:29.330
I'm not that old,
I'm 42 for most of my life.
You had bundled cable.

967
00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:33.830
So let's say you only wanted to watch ABC,
NBC,
Espn,

968
00:52:33.831 --> 00:52:36.530
and TNT.
Well you,
that wasn't a package.

969
00:52:36.531 --> 00:52:39.500
You couldn't just pay a couple bucks for each of those and get that.

970
00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:42.470
They forced you to buy a bundle basically.

971
00:52:42.471 --> 00:52:46.220
So you'd end up with lifetime and we channel and comedy central and a zillion

972
00:52:46.221 --> 00:52:48.950
other things that maybe you'd never wanted.
And that's the only way you did it.

973
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:51.620
As that model crumbles,

974
00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:54.830
and it's so interesting because we're watching the television model crumble.

975
00:52:54.831 --> 00:52:58.010
The cable model crumble as we're watching mainstream media crumble as we're

976
00:52:58.011 --> 00:53:01.130
watching the political establishment crumble or watching all this happen at
once.

977
00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:03.440
But as that crumbles,
people are going,
oh,

978
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:07.580
I don't have to spend say 120 bucks on cable a month anymore.

979
00:53:07.850 --> 00:53:10.100
I could say spend,
say 40 bucks a month.

980
00:53:10.101 --> 00:53:12.770
And I could divvy that up amongst eight creators that I like,

981
00:53:12.771 --> 00:53:15.440
give him five bucks each.
And if enough people do that,

982
00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:17.960
all of these people that care about the things that I care about,

983
00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:21.100
we'll be able to go on and live and hopefully do more and,

984
00:53:21.101 --> 00:53:22.010
and all of those things.

985
00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:25.470
So there's also an interesting age thing happening here and,

986
00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:30.300
and it's very cool to be part of truly a,
okay,
let's jump back to shout outs.

987
00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:34.710
Andy Drag,
uh,
Andy drew,
Zachary,
Camille,
Michael.

988
00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:39.660
Thank you guys.
And we got some more mugs.
Todd and Peter with a d.

989
00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:42.390
He's on there.
And Brandon,
thank you guys.

990
00:53:42.391 --> 00:53:46.440
So you guys are getting mugs that I'm signing right now signing the mugs right

991
00:53:46.441 --> 00:53:47.274
now.

992
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:52.430
You guys are getting a tee shirts that will get out to you as soon as possible.

993
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:59.130
And the last one,
there was four a for Brendan.
Thanks man.
Appreciate it.

994
00:53:59.610 --> 00:54:03.630
Um,
it's cool,
right?
Like it's actually the other thing that,

995
00:54:03.730 --> 00:54:08.630
it was so interesting just on a personal note,
you know,
this year,
this past year,

996
00:54:08.650 --> 00:54:10.800
2018 was definitely without question.

997
00:54:10.801 --> 00:54:14.870
It was the most rewarding of my life personally,
professionally on,

998
00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:19.530
on every front.
Uh,
the work that I'm doing I think is important.
And good.
It's,

999
00:54:19.531 --> 00:54:22.650
it's,
I,
it's brought a certain level of happiness and success to my life,

1000
00:54:22.651 --> 00:54:23.850
which is great.
Uh,

1001
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:27.780
going on this tour with Jordan where we did about a hundred stops in all sorts

1002
00:54:27.781 --> 00:54:30.570
of different countries and went all over the United States.
And as I said,

1003
00:54:30.571 --> 00:54:32.400
we're going to extend it now into,

1004
00:54:32.401 --> 00:54:36.870
into Australia for February and then we're doing all these European stops and

1005
00:54:36.871 --> 00:54:41.160
meeting all of you guys.
Like that's the thing,
it's like I know that online,

1006
00:54:41.161 --> 00:54:44.850
it seems like an endless hate fest and,
and it often is in its,

1007
00:54:44.851 --> 00:54:48.240
we're owning the Lib tards and the cuckservatives and all of this nonsense.

1008
00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:51.270
But it's like there are good people everywhere.

1009
00:54:51.271 --> 00:54:54.360
And I saw them and I see them every single night.

1010
00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:57.510
One of the things that we do at the,
uh,
at the Jordan shows,

1011
00:54:57.511 --> 00:54:59.670
he does a meet and greet after a,

1012
00:54:59.671 --> 00:55:02.430
and I do a meet and greet now for Jordan's meet and greet.
Obviously it's,

1013
00:55:02.490 --> 00:55:03.660
it's Jordan's show.

1014
00:55:03.661 --> 00:55:06.330
So he gets let's say 300 people that go to his meet and greet and you get a

1015
00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:10.020
picture with him and he does a little talk minor are usually somewhere between

1016
00:55:10.021 --> 00:55:12.900
like say 20 and 50 people.

1017
00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:15.960
And it's really cool because we go into a private room or sometimes there's like

1018
00:55:15.961 --> 00:55:20.460
a bar area at the theater.
Um,
and we get to chat.
Like I sit around,

1019
00:55:20.490 --> 00:55:22.070
we try to get the,
the,

1020
00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:27.090
the chairs in a circle and we sit around and I get to hear from people about

1021
00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:31.950
their concerns or what's what they're excited about or whatever it is.

1022
00:55:31.951 --> 00:55:34.020
And they asked me questions.
Sometimes I ask them questions.

1023
00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:36.030
I know that people meet after we've been,

1024
00:55:36.031 --> 00:55:39.070
we've been meeting people that are starting the ITW groups,
uh,

1025
00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:41.730
people are hanging out after sometimes at some of the shows.

1026
00:55:41.731 --> 00:55:43.330
There are people that hand out fliers in there.

1027
00:55:43.331 --> 00:55:46.330
Like if you want to talk about some of these ideas afterwards,
um,

1028
00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:48.060
meet us at the bar down the block.
And I've,

1029
00:55:48.061 --> 00:55:50.490
I've gone to one or two of them actually at the,
uh,

1030
00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:54.090
we did two shows in Stockholm,
which were two of my favorite shows that I loved,

1031
00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:57.240
loved,
loved,
loved the Nordic countries,
but Stockholm particularly.

1032
00:55:57.570 --> 00:56:00.360
And we did my meet and greet and there were a ton about like 60 people there.

1033
00:56:00.361 --> 00:56:02.910
We were jammed in this little room and then I was like,
you know what,

1034
00:56:02.911 --> 00:56:04.860
why don't we just wrap this thing up early and go to a bar?

1035
00:56:04.861 --> 00:56:08.100
And then like 60 of us went to a bar.
Uh,
Aaron Flamm was there,

1036
00:56:08.101 --> 00:56:10.650
who's a comedian from Sweden who's been on the show in a couple of other

1037
00:56:10.651 --> 00:56:15.240
influential people there.
Shout outs to Rs.
Derek,
Laura and Joseph.

1038
00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:19.170
Thank you guys very much.
And a mug and a t shirt for Dylan.
Thank you brother.

1039
00:56:19.171 --> 00:56:24.010
I already signed that one guys.
I'm going to need more mugs.
Um,
yeah,

1040
00:56:24.011 --> 00:56:27.130
so,
uh,
lots of,
lots of cool stuff happening guys.
There you go.

1041
00:56:27.131 --> 00:56:31.150
That is the Dave Rubin Mug.
I'm renting out a room at the table here.
Um,

1042
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:33.850
okay.
Um,

1043
00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:38.890
if mastercard or other payment companies can prevent me from supporting the

1044
00:56:38.891 --> 00:56:42.130
artists or makers who are engaging in illegal activities that I prefer,

1045
00:56:42.131 --> 00:56:44.200
there's no limit to what they control.

1046
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:47.320
It's definitely a big issue and I think that the left doesn't understand how

1047
00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:50.770
giving this type of power to a corporation can swing back around on them.

1048
00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:54.250
Have you reached out to mastercard so that that Harkens back to an earlier

1049
00:56:54.251 --> 00:56:58.300
question.
One of the,
one of the reasons that this is so crazy is that,

1050
00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:01.360
so think about it.
You've got half whatever it is.

1051
00:57:01.361 --> 00:57:04.080
There's certain set of people that think Trump is the antichrist.

1052
00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:07.990
He's Hitler or any of this nonsense,
but generally speaking,
people on the right,

1053
00:57:08.290 --> 00:57:11.170
generally speaking,
right,
if you're a,
generally speaking,

1054
00:57:11.410 --> 00:57:15.340
a conservative or libertarian doesn't want to use state power to accomplish

1055
00:57:15.341 --> 00:57:18.940
their goals.
They want the market and individual people to solve things.

1056
00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:23.410
Now on the left,
they believe that state power is the answer to most things.

1057
00:57:23.411 --> 00:57:26.110
Bernie believes that state power is the answer to most things.

1058
00:57:26.110 --> 00:57:27.190
Elizabeth Warren believes this.

1059
00:57:27.191 --> 00:57:31.510
Kamala Harris believes this is what 99% of progressives believe.
Now,

1060
00:57:31.870 --> 00:57:33.100
obviously I don't agree with that,

1061
00:57:33.101 --> 00:57:35.590
but let's give them a benefit it out that sometimes the government can do some

1062
00:57:35.591 --> 00:57:39.330
good things.
Okay,
sure.
The government has done some good things by the way.
A one,

1063
00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:41.200
I mean,
if you want to watch really interesting interview,

1064
00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:44.110
I talked about this with Peter Teal and then he said at some point it just

1065
00:57:44.111 --> 00:57:46.600
stopped working.
He said,
he said something to the effect of,

1066
00:57:46.601 --> 00:57:49.960
I'd have no reason to be a libertarian if any of it worked.
Um,

1067
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:54.310
but what the real scary part of what's happening right now is it's like,
okay,

1068
00:57:54.311 --> 00:57:55.900
so let's say we give the power,

1069
00:57:55.990 --> 00:57:58.120
let's say the Conservatives and Libertarians are like,
you know,

1070
00:57:58.121 --> 00:58:02.290
what does d platforming thing is so dangerous and,

1071
00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:05.230
and it's because it's coming after us.
We're gonna,
we're gonna.
Um,

1072
00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:08.140
we're going to shave away on our ideals.
And you know what?

1073
00:58:08.141 --> 00:58:11.110
The government can get involved this one time because Google controls so much

1074
00:58:11.111 --> 00:58:13.360
information.
The government can do it this one time.
Well,

1075
00:58:14.350 --> 00:58:16.210
what happens then when,

1076
00:58:16.211 --> 00:58:21.211
let's say Trump is out and now you've got a progressive in the White House who

1077
00:58:21.461 --> 00:58:22.820
believes the government control everything.

1078
00:58:22.830 --> 00:58:26.920
Now you've just given the control of the platforms to people who are even more

1079
00:58:26.921 --> 00:58:30.280
politically,
uh,
against you and have more power.

1080
00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:33.100
So this is why everyone has to be very careful and why,
once again,

1081
00:58:33.101 --> 00:58:36.610
I would still say this is about ingenuity of the American people.
Okay,

1082
00:58:36.611 --> 00:58:40.540
let's see a hundred bucks on super chat.
Keep up the good work.
Great work.

1083
00:58:40.570 --> 00:58:44.050
Thank you.
I will do that.
Uh,
thank you penny.
Thank you Andrew.
Thank you Leslie.

1084
00:58:44.051 --> 00:58:47.350
Thank you Donald.
And a Mug for Keanae.
You've got it.

1085
00:58:48.460 --> 00:58:51.400
Here we go.
Um,
man,

1086
00:58:51.401 --> 00:58:54.250
I wish we could move the camera a little because I am surrounded by mugs right

1087
00:58:54.251 --> 00:58:58.480
now.
This is pretty crazy.
Um,
okay.
Hey Dave,

1088
00:58:58.481 --> 00:59:01.300
what about Maxine Bernina?
Is there an interview coming soon and love the show.

1089
00:59:01.301 --> 00:59:03.000
Keep up the great work.
Yeah,
we've got to,

1090
00:59:03.001 --> 00:59:06.730
Maxine Bernay is a libertarian up in Canada,

1091
00:59:06.731 --> 00:59:09.790
which you know that the government has gone completely out of control if

1092
00:59:09.791 --> 00:59:14.260
Libertarians are gaining steam and Canada.
We've got him be a Skype.
Uh,

1093
00:59:14.261 --> 00:59:17.220
I believe it's next week,
maybe a week or two.
Uh,

1094
00:59:17.260 --> 00:59:20.830
but we are doing that and I'm looking forward to doing that one.
Let's,

1095
00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:24.500
I love you so much for the stance.
You're making.
No tolerance for censorship.

1096
00:59:24.501 --> 00:59:25.334
I love you too.

1097
00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:28.220
Thank you for taking a stand against censorship and providing exceptional

1098
00:59:28.221 --> 00:59:31.040
content.
You got it.
Hey Dave,
huge fan here.

1099
00:59:31.041 --> 00:59:34.730
What things did Patrion do well that you guys want to nail down in this new

1100
00:59:34.731 --> 00:59:37.610
platform?
Also,
can you tell us everything knew about it?

1101
00:59:37.611 --> 00:59:39.470
We didn't previously know.
Have a great day.

1102
00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:42.180
So I can't give you all the specifics on what we're trying to do and,

1103
00:59:42.181 --> 00:59:44.720
and a lot of it's still is a morphous and believe me,

1104
00:59:44.721 --> 00:59:48.080
we're bringing in a lot of the voices that you'd think we'd bring in and we're

1105
00:59:48.081 --> 00:59:50.930
bringing in some voices that maybe you wouldn't think we'd bring in.
What are,

1106
00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:52.280
what did Patrion and knew?
Well look,

1107
00:59:52.281 --> 00:59:55.010
they were the first one that solved a massive problem.

1108
00:59:55.011 --> 00:59:59.660
There was a problem that creators could not figure out a way to make a living

1109
00:59:59.661 --> 01:00:02.540
despite making good content on youtube.
The,
the CPMS,

1110
01:00:02.541 --> 01:00:04.760
meaning the cost per thousand views that the eds,

1111
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:07.750
the advertisers were paying out,
he's extremely low on youtube.

1112
01:00:07.751 --> 01:00:10.670
It's something like two bucks per thousand views.
Then there was the heat,

1113
01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:14.910
the whole demonetization issue,
which by the way,
he's still real.
So,
uh,

1114
01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:18.590
although generally speaking,
it's gotten better for our channel.
Um,
you know,

1115
01:00:18.591 --> 01:00:20.900
right before Christmas,
who,
who do I have on?
Right before Christmas,

1116
01:00:20.901 --> 01:00:22.370
while I did a show with a rabbi,

1117
01:00:22.371 --> 01:00:25.430
David Wolpe from Temple Sinai here in Los Angeles,

1118
01:00:25.431 --> 01:00:27.080
and he was sitting in that chair and I,

1119
01:00:27.081 --> 01:00:30.890
and this chair was a bishop Barron from the archdiocese here in la.
Uh,

1120
01:00:30.891 --> 01:00:33.890
that was monetized.
What was the show that I had on earlier in the week?

1121
01:00:33.891 --> 01:00:37.460
Just two days before?
Uh,
it was a mom to Ed.
They did not,

1122
01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:41.030
they demonetize that one by not only the algorithm do you monetize it,

1123
01:00:41.031 --> 01:00:44.750
but then manual review.
So I can talk to a rabbi and a priest monetized.

1124
01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:49.160
I could talk to Ema,
not Monica.
It's like,
it's just all bananas and subjective.

1125
01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:52.910
Um,
so patrion what do they do?
Well,
they were the first one that said,

1126
01:00:52.911 --> 01:00:57.230
let's find another way that creators can come together in one spot and people

1127
01:00:57.231 --> 01:00:59.680
who are interested in creators would have some discovery.

1128
01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:03.560
So maybe you'd go on there.
Let's say you were,
you were a a Jordan Peterson fan.

1129
01:01:03.561 --> 01:01:07.450
You might go on there,
you might donate five bucks a month to Jordan and then,
uh,

1130
01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:11.600
you might look around and I think they had like a sort of related channels kind

1131
01:01:11.601 --> 01:01:12.560
of thinking.
You might go,
you know what,

1132
01:01:12.561 --> 01:01:16.250
I've got 20 extra bucks a month or I'm going to drink one less beer a month and

1133
01:01:16.251 --> 01:01:18.860
I'm going to take that six bucks that I spend on a beer month and I'm going to

1134
01:01:18.861 --> 01:01:22.940
give three creators two bucks,
or whatever it is.
So they really did do that.
Well,

1135
01:01:22.941 --> 01:01:24.710
there were other things that I loved about,
you know,

1136
01:01:24.711 --> 01:01:26.210
they did some of the backend stuff.

1137
01:01:26.211 --> 01:01:29.960
So I was doing voice and video chats with groups,
small groups,

1138
01:01:29.961 --> 01:01:33.340
and one on one people over the last couple of months we eliminated the one on

1139
01:01:33.341 --> 01:01:37.040
ones cause I just simply didn't have any time anymore.
Um,
but I've loved,

1140
01:01:37.041 --> 01:01:41.090
by the way,
doing the group chats,
you know,
I do,
I still do a series of these,
um,

1141
01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:45.260
which we are phasing out,
but I've met so many people and it's really cool.

1142
01:01:45.261 --> 01:01:49.010
So I spend about a while,
at one point I was going from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM.

1143
01:01:49.011 --> 01:01:52.430
I was a whole day of talking to people,
um,
where I would bounce around.

1144
01:01:52.431 --> 01:01:55.820
I talked to somebody in Japan and then somebody in Australia and then you know,

1145
01:01:55.821 --> 01:01:59.510
somebody in Mexico and Brazil and Iceland and Sweden and blah,
blah,
blah.

1146
01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:00.583
It was like,
man,

1147
01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:04.010
the amount of perspective that I would get and just talking to interesting

1148
01:02:04.011 --> 01:02:06.020
people who were thinking about the same things all over the world.

1149
01:02:06.021 --> 01:02:11.000
It's pretty freaking awesome.
So patron,
this is not,
I don't,

1150
01:02:11.030 --> 01:02:13.850
I don't hate Jack Conti.
I don't hate this Jacqueline heart.

1151
01:02:13.851 --> 01:02:16.280
The head of a trust and safety.

1152
01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:19.070
It's like I think they're not particularly good at their jobs.

1153
01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:23.040
I think that they're not standing up for the right principles.
Um,

1154
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:26.670
but if either one of them want to come and,
and talk to me again,

1155
01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:29.910
I guess I'd be happy to do it.
Although everything Conti said to me last time,

1156
01:02:29.930 --> 01:02:32.850
it turned out,
turned out either to be intentionally lying,

1157
01:02:32.851 --> 01:02:36.030
but I don't like to attack people's motives.
So he was either mistaken,

1158
01:02:36.031 --> 01:02:39.360
didn't realize the problems that were coming down the pike or just didn't know

1159
01:02:39.361 --> 01:02:41.840
what he was talking about.
I don't,
I don't know which one of those is,

1160
01:02:41.841 --> 01:02:44.970
is the truth.
Uh,
Yo Dave,
check out youtube or law.

1161
01:02:44.971 --> 01:02:46.770
He's a tech lawyer looking to take action.

1162
01:02:46.790 --> 01:02:50.100
Seems like he has a lot of support from the legal and so I know people have sent

1163
01:02:50.101 --> 01:02:53.880
me the videos.
I haven't seen them yet,
but I will take a look at that.
Um,

1164
01:02:54.090 --> 01:02:58.830
the IDW has made my husband and I closer.
We need more IDW women to speak up.

1165
01:02:58.831 --> 01:03:03.200
I know we exist.
Absolutely.
You do.
Look there.
There are,
there are,

1166
01:03:03.210 --> 01:03:06.960
there are plenty of women from ion and Christina Hoff summers and I would say

1167
01:03:06.961 --> 01:03:10.530
Caitlin Flanagan and,
and Claire Lehman.
And you know,
there,

1168
01:03:10.531 --> 01:03:12.660
there are plenty of others.
But yeah,
I think we could,

1169
01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:14.580
this is the irony of the whole thing,
right?

1170
01:03:14.581 --> 01:03:16.260
It's like we don't care about identity politics,

1171
01:03:16.261 --> 01:03:19.320
but you want to feel that there are people from all sorts of walks of life that

1172
01:03:19.321 --> 01:03:21.150
are represented with good ideas,

1173
01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:25.110
not because of the color of their skin or their sexuality or gender or any of

1174
01:03:25.111 --> 01:03:28.530
that.
Um,
but yeah,
the,
we'll look,
I promise you guys,

1175
01:03:28.531 --> 01:03:31.320
as long as I can keep doing this show and we can keep making this thing work,

1176
01:03:31.530 --> 01:03:32.281
I will,
uh,

1177
01:03:32.281 --> 01:03:35.880
I will keep finding people regardless of any of those immutable characteristics.

1178
01:03:35.881 --> 01:03:38.340
And if it happens to be more women than so be it.

1179
01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:45.720
Let's see.
Um,
you and Jordan's bromance is awesome.

1180
01:03:45.721 --> 01:03:49.110
Please come with Jordan to the UK soon and somewhere a student can afford

1181
01:03:49.111 --> 01:03:52.650
tickets.
Have a great day,
Dave.
We did about six or seven stops in the UK,

1182
01:03:52.651 --> 01:03:55.860
which was actually totally fun and cool and it was nice to bounce around the

1183
01:03:55.861 --> 01:03:56.161
country.

1184
01:03:56.161 --> 01:04:00.510
One of the most fun things that I did in the UK was during one of our days in

1185
01:04:00.511 --> 01:04:04.290
London,
I had a couple of hours off and I spent the day at Mckayla school.

1186
01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:07.140
Jordan's daughter happens to be named Mckayla,
but that is not connected to this.

1187
01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:08.940
Uh,
you may remember my former guests,

1188
01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:13.530
Catherine verbal Singh who was on at the end of August and she,

1189
01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:16.830
she runs a school called Mckayla.
She used to be a big lefty.

1190
01:04:16.831 --> 01:04:21.831
She realized how leftism was teaching just no personal responsibility and always

1191
01:04:21.961 --> 01:04:24.150
kicking the can down the road and throwing money at things.

1192
01:04:24.330 --> 01:04:29.130
And she has this school where they take inner city kids from every walk of life

1193
01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:33.950
and they,
they teach them how to be responsible,
smart,
um,

1194
01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:37.770
self aware adults.
I mean,
I,
so I sat up,
I didn't know what I was doing.

1195
01:04:37.771 --> 01:04:39.840
I just showed up there.
She's like,
you're going to have lunch with these kids.

1196
01:04:39.841 --> 01:04:43.860
I sat at a table with a,
with a bunch of kids,
like eight kids,

1197
01:04:43.861 --> 01:04:45.990
and we added this incredible conversation.
They,
I,

1198
01:04:45.991 --> 01:04:49.210
they took me to all these classrooms.
I gave a talk at the end of the day to the,

1199
01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:52.840
to the teachers there,
but they,
they,
you know,
they're not allowed to talk.
Uh,

1200
01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:55.170
they're allowed to talk about a specific topic during lunch.

1201
01:04:55.171 --> 01:04:58.620
They can't talk in the hallways.
They have to walk on certain sides of the thing.

1202
01:04:58.621 --> 01:05:00.570
Like it sounds sort of authoritarian in a way,

1203
01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:03.760
but they're teaching these kids incredible personal responsibility.
It's,

1204
01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:07.230
it's pretty awesome.
All right,
let me jump back in here.
Shout outs to Kyle,

1205
01:05:07.231 --> 01:05:09.860
Matt and Scott and uh,
just a reminder,

1206
01:05:09.870 --> 01:05:13.920
Dave rubin.com/donate if you do it while I'm doing this right now,

1207
01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:16.440
25 bucks a month and you're going to get a Reuben report tee shirt,

1208
01:05:16.590 --> 01:05:19.690
which will never be printed again because it was the patriots shirt.

1209
01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:24.130
And you will also get a signed autographed Ruben Report Mug,

1210
01:05:24.131 --> 01:05:27.940
which I'm going to sign for you right here.
I am surrounded by mugs right now.

1211
01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:29.650
All right,
here we go.

1212
01:05:30.310 --> 01:05:34.060
I'm excited to see Maxime on the show.

1213
01:05:34.061 --> 01:05:37.750
Is there any possibility of getting some more focused on Canadian politics?
Uh,

1214
01:05:37.810 --> 01:05:40.930
well there's obviously something going on in Canada.
Uh,
yeah.

1215
01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:45.520
Well we're going to have,
um,
Stephen Harper,
a former prime minister,

1216
01:05:45.521 --> 01:05:49.840
Stephen Harper will be on the show,
uh,
I think in January if I'm not mistaken.

1217
01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:50.311
And there,

1218
01:05:50.311 --> 01:05:53.770
there really is something going on in Canada related to free speech and all
this,

1219
01:05:53.771 --> 01:05:58.060
which is why Jordan obviously is from Canada and Lindsay Shepherd and Ezra

1220
01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:02.680
Levant and plenty of other people that are fighting this fight are in Canada.
Um,

1221
01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:03.611
let's see.
Dave,

1222
01:06:03.611 --> 01:06:08.410
will your platform allow creators of legal erotic content writing,
drawing,

1223
01:06:08.411 --> 01:06:13.360
photography?
Uh,
yeah.
I'm talking about what a lot of people call a porn.
Uh,
again,

1224
01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:13.961
this is,

1225
01:06:13.961 --> 01:06:18.190
this is all about trying to figure out what kind of platform we want to build.

1226
01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:21.790
Do we want absolutely everybody on there?
Should it be invite only?

1227
01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:24.730
Do you need to be recommended by a couple of people?
I know.

1228
01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:25.630
Anything I say right now,

1229
01:06:25.631 --> 01:06:27.760
he's going to make a certain amount of people mad no matter what.

1230
01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:31.800
We are talking all of this stuff out,
so my look,

1231
01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:36.490
my general feeling,
so I can only speak for myself for just a second.

1232
01:06:36.850 --> 01:06:39.370
I can always only speak for myself,
but particularly at this moment,

1233
01:06:39.970 --> 01:06:43.450
my general feeling is I want as little gatekeeping as possible.

1234
01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:46.300
If you are doing something that is legal,

1235
01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:50.980
it is legal in the country that you live in,
then I would,

1236
01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:56.080
I personally would err on the side of that being completely fine on the
platform.

1237
01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:01.320
Now that the problem with that at least optically is if you try to do that,

1238
01:07:01.961 --> 01:07:06.700
then a certain amount of of people who are doing all sorts of racist,

1239
01:07:06.701 --> 01:07:09.940
whatever,
like truly racist and evil stuff,

1240
01:07:09.970 --> 01:07:13.030
they're going to all flock to that platform and maybe that's going to overrun

1241
01:07:13.031 --> 01:07:15.850
all of the,
the good decent stuff that's there.

1242
01:07:15.970 --> 01:07:19.810
That's just an issue to deal with because well even if even if you're okay with

1243
01:07:19.811 --> 01:07:20.644
that,
right?

1244
01:07:20.650 --> 01:07:23.950
Well then you've got then the mob that comes in after and it's like see what

1245
01:07:23.951 --> 01:07:27.940
this platform is.
See what this platform is.
It's an outright haven for evil,

1246
01:07:27.941 --> 01:07:29.920
racist,
and pornographers and the rest of it.

1247
01:07:30.010 --> 01:07:32.350
And then whether you want it to be a problem or not,

1248
01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:35.020
or whether you believe in all of these people's right to free speech or not,

1249
01:07:35.110 --> 01:07:38.650
if they then come after your payment processor is the mastercards and paypal's

1250
01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:40.420
well not,
you've still got a massive headache.

1251
01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:43.750
So that's why we have to figure this thing out in,
in a whole bunch of steps.

1252
01:07:43.751 --> 01:07:46.480
Okay.
Um,

1253
01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:52.840
wow.
There's a lot here.
Um,
thank you for all your hard work,
Dave.

1254
01:07:52.841 --> 01:07:55.900
I may just be a dumb mechanic,
but I find all your content,
very important.

1255
01:07:55.901 --> 01:07:57.280
Best of luck to you in your adventures.

1256
01:07:57.281 --> 01:08:00.640
You're not a dumb mechanic and thank you for that.
Um,

1257
01:08:01.390 --> 01:08:03.820
you can view the parade,
oh,
principal through two lenses.

1258
01:08:03.821 --> 01:08:05.800
One that says 80% of people are worthless.

1259
01:08:05.801 --> 01:08:09.100
The other perspective says that small businesses are more productive.

1260
01:08:09.101 --> 01:08:12.130
Globalism is dead.
It's like I snuck that in there.
Well,
you know,

1261
01:08:12.131 --> 01:08:15.080
it's funny about small businesses because it really is one of the things that

1262
01:08:15.081 --> 01:08:18.770
I'm most proud of.
We ever seriously great small business here.

1263
01:08:18.771 --> 01:08:22.340
We have built something that I'm super proud of that we,
as I said before,

1264
01:08:22.341 --> 01:08:25.610
we payable of our health insurance for our employees.
We give nice bonuses,

1265
01:08:25.611 --> 01:08:29.240
we treat everybody well.
I try to let people take more vacations than,

1266
01:08:29.241 --> 01:08:32.210
than you would at a normal job.
And we,
and we work with people.
However,

1267
01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:35.030
however we can to make a good business.
We have no debt.

1268
01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:38.180
We own everything that we're doing here.
I mean,
I'm dead in the,
in the,

1269
01:08:38.181 --> 01:08:41.090
in the home,
but I mean we have,
you know,
we own all of our equipment.

1270
01:08:41.091 --> 01:08:45.710
We've run a very responsible business that I'm super excited about.
Um,

1271
01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:47.210
but I remember once,
um,

1272
01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:51.230
Jonathan Chait who's a lefty writer from either New York magazine or The New

1273
01:08:51.230 --> 01:08:52.820
Yorker,
I'm blanking.
I think it's New York magazine,

1274
01:08:52.821 --> 01:08:56.330
but somebody could let me know about a year or two ago.

1275
01:08:56.331 --> 01:08:58.640
I saw him tweet something about how like small business,

1276
01:08:58.641 --> 01:09:03.110
the phrase small business is just a,
uh,
it's just like a made up phrase by,

1277
01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:06.380
by big government or by Republicans,
something like that.

1278
01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:08.210
And I wrote back and I was like,
you know,

1279
01:09:08.211 --> 01:09:11.740
I gotta tell you I run a small business and I'm super proud of it.
Um,

1280
01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:14.600
and we have a couple of,
we have several employees and you know,
whatever.

1281
01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:18.800
And then he retweeted me and he wrote back several employees mocking the fact

1282
01:09:18.801 --> 01:09:21.170
that I only have several employees and I thought this is,

1283
01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:26.200
this is exactly why people don't like elite liberals and and sort of the the,

1284
01:09:26.531 --> 01:09:31.130
the coast liberalism and this big government nonsense.
It's like,

1285
01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:34.010
wait a minute.
If I was a big company,

1286
01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:38.030
you'd say I'm bad because I'm an evil corporation now I'm a small business and

1287
01:09:38.031 --> 01:09:41.240
you mock me for only having several employees.
I've created something.

1288
01:09:41.241 --> 01:09:44.270
I've created content that's valuable.
I've created jobs for people,

1289
01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:47.660
which I'm super proud about.
I don't know that he's ever created anything.

1290
01:09:47.661 --> 01:09:49.370
I don't want to make this about him specifically,

1291
01:09:49.670 --> 01:09:51.440
but it's like what is the right number?

1292
01:09:51.441 --> 01:09:53.480
If you hate corporations and you hate small business,

1293
01:09:53.481 --> 01:09:56.210
what's the right amount of people that I should have hired that then I would be

1294
01:09:56.211 --> 01:09:59.790
in that sweet spot if I had 16 employees.
Are we good?
Are we good?
Then like what,

1295
01:09:59.791 --> 01:10:01.690
what are we really talking about here and there?

1296
01:10:01.691 --> 01:10:04.300
And often there's really no answer because they have some sort of

1297
01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:06.160
<v 4>mmm,
okay.</v>

1298
01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:09.840
<v 1>I think if I just have an idea of what's right instead of having anything to do</v>

1299
01:10:09.841 --> 01:10:10.620
with what reality,

1300
01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:15.270
what is realistically practical and Jonathan Shade is from New York magazine.
Uh,

1301
01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:20.300
Keith,
Andrew,
Angela and Camille.
Thank you guys very much.
Appreciate it.
And uh,

1302
01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:25.200
it's Dave ruben.com/donate guys,
I'm signing mugs and I'm giving away tee shirts.

1303
01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:26.213
Here we go.

1304
01:10:26.430 --> 01:10:29.610
Might I suggest having bishop Barron and Jordan Peterson shared discussion on

1305
01:10:29.611 --> 01:10:31.740
your show?
That would be quite an event.
I think that would be,

1306
01:10:31.741 --> 01:10:33.450
it would be really a really,

1307
01:10:33.451 --> 01:10:37.080
really interesting and I know that the bishop is a big fan of,
of Jordan,

1308
01:10:37.081 --> 01:10:39.420
so I will see if I can make that happen.
Uh,

1309
01:10:39.450 --> 01:10:43.830
have you looked at decentralized solutions like Alexandria Slash Open Index

1310
01:10:43.831 --> 01:10:46.950
Protocol?
I think the problem needs to be solved at the protocol level.

1311
01:10:46.951 --> 01:10:50.790
So payment is decentralized,
separate from content delivery.
Um,

1312
01:10:50.791 --> 01:10:54.570
I don't want to answer that one specifically.
Suffice to say,
as I said earlier,

1313
01:10:54.571 --> 01:10:56.640
I have many phone calls tomorrow,

1314
01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:01.830
<v 4>so think,
think about it that way.
Um,
yeah.</v>

1315
01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:02.571
<v 1>Hey Dave.</v>

1316
01:11:02.571 --> 01:11:05.990
I realized a while ago that I'm bisexual and I'm having trouble accepting it as

1317
01:11:05.991 --> 01:11:07.040
part of my identity.

1318
01:11:07.041 --> 01:11:09.900
Do you have any advice based on your own coming out experience?
Well that's,

1319
01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:13.830
it's nice to get away from the topic for just a second.
Um,

1320
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:16.940
the only,
the only advice I can give on,

1321
01:11:16.970 --> 01:11:21.630
on anything I think related to sexuality or anything like that is you just have

1322
01:11:21.631 --> 01:11:26.430
to be yourself.
Like you can try not to be yourself.
You can,
I did it for many,

1323
01:11:26.431 --> 01:11:28.260
many years.
I'm going to be writing about this in my book.

1324
01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:31.370
I came out of the closet way too late.
Um,

1325
01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:35.390
I think I did damage to myself.
I think emotionally,

1326
01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:38.370
psychologically damaged my relationships,
family,

1327
01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:41.760
all sorts of things that you don't just put aside one day and her magically

1328
01:11:41.761 --> 01:11:46.710
fixed.
I think then you have a lifetime of sort of repairing those things.
Um,
so,

1329
01:11:46.711 --> 01:11:47.191
you know,
it's funny,

1330
01:11:47.191 --> 01:11:50.460
I don't regret anything I did because I got to a place in life that's good.

1331
01:11:50.461 --> 01:11:54.510
But we all live with some of the scars of our former selves,
you know.
Um,

1332
01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:57.810
but I would say if you are what you Popeye,

1333
01:11:57.811 --> 01:12:01.110
I am what I am and that's all that I am.
I mean,
if you are something,

1334
01:12:01.111 --> 01:12:05.550
whether you're gay or bisexual,
whatever you are,
if you are like,

1335
01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:10.680
you gotta be it,
whatever that means to you.
And uh,

1336
01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:12.720
if you think that people aren't going to accept you for it,

1337
01:12:12.721 --> 01:12:15.930
then maybe you should find some other people to be around.
Um,

1338
01:12:16.050 --> 01:12:20.220
and that's not a fun thing to say or cool either.
Um,
but be who you are.

1339
01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:24.280
It's all you can do.
I,
you know,
like it's hard to leave one lie.

1340
01:12:25.050 --> 01:12:27.960
This is what I would say.
It's hard to live one life on this earth,
right?

1341
01:12:27.961 --> 01:12:29.460
Like live in one life is hard.

1342
01:12:29.461 --> 01:12:31.650
What does Jordan talk about all that life is suffering,
man.

1343
01:12:31.651 --> 01:12:34.770
You got to figure out some way to pilfer some,
some pleasure out of it.

1344
01:12:34.771 --> 01:12:35.990
Being on an adventure that,

1345
01:12:35.991 --> 01:12:38.850
that gives that is rewarding to you and meaningful and all of those things.

1346
01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:40.650
I think I've been able to do that.

1347
01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:44.250
But like imagine trying to live two lives and this is what people who are

1348
01:12:44.251 --> 01:12:47.550
closeted half to do and,
and people,
people are closeted for all sorts of reasons.

1349
01:12:47.551 --> 01:12:51.240
I would say conservatives now are more closeted than gay people in a lot of ways

1350
01:12:51.241 --> 01:12:52.230
because everywhere I go,

1351
01:12:52.231 --> 01:12:56.130
I meet people that are just basic decent conservatives who might be prolife are

1352
01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:59.520
pro gun,
who are afraid to tell anybody what their political views are.

1353
01:12:59.730 --> 01:13:04.080
Now you know what it's like to be in the closet.
The closet isn't just,

1354
01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:04.980
the closet is just,

1355
01:13:04.981 --> 01:13:07.350
there's just room for one there and it's just you and your thoughts.

1356
01:13:07.351 --> 01:13:10.740
And that is a lonely place.
But it's hard to live life as one person.
Now.

1357
01:13:10.741 --> 01:13:14.910
Imagine trying to live life as to people all the time.
It's not fun and,
and uh,

1358
01:13:15.690 --> 01:13:19.770
yeah,
it's not good.
It's not good.
I hope that,
I hope that had some value.
Um,

1359
01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:21.120
shout outs to Benjamin,

1360
01:13:21.121 --> 01:13:25.980
Beverly and Patricia and mugs to fill up and to Thor.
Speaking of Thor,

1361
01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:27.091
you know,

1362
01:13:27.091 --> 01:13:31.170
I've been on planes like I don't know how many freaking plane rides I've taken,

1363
01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:34.890
um,
in the last year.
Um,
but I've watched,
um,

1364
01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:39.660
Avengers infinity war like 10 times and I like it better every time.

1365
01:13:39.661 --> 01:13:42.660
Like it really is just spectacular.
I can't wait until the next one.

1366
01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:47.130
So this is for you.
Four and a.
All right,
where are we?

1367
01:13:47.130 --> 01:13:49.680
Where are we?
Um,

1368
01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:52.531
uh,

1369
01:13:52.531 --> 01:13:55.540
we'll be sure to send you monthly via paypal until your new platform comes out.

1370
01:13:55.570 --> 01:13:57.750
Keep fighting the good fight.
Thank you very much.
Happy new year,

1371
01:13:57.751 --> 01:13:58.411
Dave and everyone,

1372
01:13:58.411 --> 01:14:01.410
how do we solve the whole problem when it starts with the payment processors?

1373
01:14:01.411 --> 01:14:03.990
It's like we need our own payment processor.
Yeah.
Again,

1374
01:14:03.991 --> 01:14:05.130
so we've hit this a couple of times,

1375
01:14:05.131 --> 01:14:08.070
but maybe there will be a payment processor or maybe there is one out there

1376
01:14:08.071 --> 01:14:12.730
where maybe I have a phone call with one of them tomorrow,
uh,
with,
with,
uh,

1377
01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:14.410
with the ability to stand up to the mob.

1378
01:14:14.411 --> 01:14:17.380
Or maybe they'd have some outside the box thinking,
uh,

1379
01:14:17.410 --> 01:14:21.850
solutions to some of these things.
So we shall see.
Um,

1380
01:14:21.970 --> 01:14:25.990
let's see.
Um,
thanks Dave.

1381
01:14:25.991 --> 01:14:28.990
For so many hours of great content leading me to Peterson Rogan will the

1382
01:14:28.991 --> 01:14:30.910
Weinstein brothers and so many other interesting people.

1383
01:14:30.910 --> 01:14:34.360
Thank you for giving us hope for the next generation of freedom to think it's

1384
01:14:34.361 --> 01:14:37.240
scary raising my children in this generation.
Keep fighting.
Well,

1385
01:14:37.241 --> 01:14:38.980
thank you for that.
And you know,
one of the things that I,

1386
01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:43.520
when I go to colleges that I talk to students about night,
I just spoke at,
um,

1387
01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:46.300
turning point USA did their student action summit,
which was great.

1388
01:14:46.510 --> 01:14:50.820
Peterson spoke there at Greg Gutfeld and,
and,
uh,
Candice Owens,
Charlie Kirk,
uh,

1389
01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:55.090
Kyle could Shubie was actually like a Reuben report reunion basically.
Um,

1390
01:14:55.450 --> 01:14:57.130
but one of the things that I always say to these kids,

1391
01:14:57.131 --> 01:15:01.660
it's like if you think that you're kind of not saying what you think right now,

1392
01:15:01.661 --> 01:15:06.661
if you think that your silenced and your teachers are teaching nonsense and all

1393
01:15:06.770 --> 01:15:08.560
these things,
if you don't stand up now,

1394
01:15:08.561 --> 01:15:10.520
do you think it's going to be any better in three years?

1395
01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:12.550
Do you think it's gonna get any better magically in four years?

1396
01:15:12.551 --> 01:15:15.010
The people that want to take away your rights,
that want to silence you,

1397
01:15:15.130 --> 01:15:16.840
they have no problem doing it.
Now,

1398
01:15:16.841 --> 01:15:20.290
I'm not saying be as awful as them be a little better than them.

1399
01:15:20.291 --> 01:15:23.860
It's not that hard.
They're pretty awful.
Be a little better than them.
But if you,

1400
01:15:24.010 --> 01:15:26.740
what would it be like for your kids if you're 18 right now you're in college,

1401
01:15:26.741 --> 01:15:28.360
right?
You're a freshman in college.

1402
01:15:28.361 --> 01:15:31.420
You're getting indoctrinated with this leftist craziness,
right?

1403
01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:35.500
And this intersection of lunacy and all of this stuff.
It's like,

1404
01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:39.940
do you think that if you don't fight it when you're young,
you're 18 you've got,

1405
01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:40.511
you know,

1406
01:15:40.511 --> 01:15:44.020
a chip on your shoulder and you've got energy and enthusiasm and you're ready to

1407
01:15:44.021 --> 01:15:46.210
take on life.
It's like if you don't do it,

1408
01:15:46.211 --> 01:15:49.600
then you're not going to suddenly be 27 and you're going to be married and have

1409
01:15:49.601 --> 01:15:53.050
car payments and a mortgage and a dog and a blah,
blah,
blah,

1410
01:15:53.051 --> 01:15:55.540
and your back's gonna hurt and a whole bunch of other stuff and be like,

1411
01:15:55.630 --> 01:15:58.870
and now I'm going to take on the world.
Actually,
you'll never do it.
So,

1412
01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:00.760
so do it now before it's too late.

1413
01:16:01.370 --> 01:16:05.950
I would say that to somebody that doesn't agree to me.
Um,
okay.
Uh,
all right.

1414
01:16:05.951 --> 01:16:07.990
You know what?
Let's not,
let's throw to a wide shot for a second,

1415
01:16:07.991 --> 01:16:10.360
just so people can see how many mugs I'm surrounded by here.

1416
01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:11.710
We've got a lot of mugs,
people,

1417
01:16:11.711 --> 01:16:13.720
there's a whole bunch of them on the left side of me too.

1418
01:16:14.050 --> 01:16:16.780
We've got mugs being signed every which way.

1419
01:16:16.930 --> 01:16:18.970
So if you guys want to jump in on a Mug,

1420
01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:22.690
I'm guessing we probably have around 50 left,
maybe of the stash.

1421
01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:25.450
I'm going to have room in my closet again.
I can't believe it.
Uh,

1422
01:16:25.451 --> 01:16:29.380
it's Dave ruben.com/donate and uh,
and you'll get a,

1423
01:16:29.381 --> 01:16:31.390
you'll get a mug and we're going to send you a tee shirt.

1424
01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:34.840
I've got a couple on sidelines down here and I'm giving shout outs to anyone

1425
01:16:34.841 --> 01:16:39.700
that jumps on $5 and above.
So there you go.
I'm Dave,

1426
01:16:39.701 --> 01:16:42.240
I'm a huge fan of yours in Collin.
Moriarity uh,

1427
01:16:42.250 --> 01:16:44.080
your show first introduced me to him.

1428
01:16:44.260 --> 01:16:47.290
I hope you and Collin can find a way to do more interviews together even though

1429
01:16:47.291 --> 01:16:50.470
you'll no longer be on patron.
I Love Collin.
Uh,
you know,

1430
01:16:50.471 --> 01:16:53.080
one of the beauties of this show is that I've,

1431
01:16:53.230 --> 01:16:57.820
you've watched me in real time become friends with some of my best friends now.

1432
01:16:58.090 --> 01:17:01.120
You know what I mean?
Like,
obviously Jordan and I and,
and you know,

1433
01:17:01.121 --> 01:17:04.420
Sam and his wife just came over for dinner the other night and Collin and I

1434
01:17:04.421 --> 01:17:06.200
become best of friends and people goes in,

1435
01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:09.770
has become an incredibly close friend and guide,
sad and,
and a whole.

1436
01:17:09.771 --> 01:17:13.040
And Eric has become like an older brother to me and I love Brett and the whole

1437
01:17:13.041 --> 01:17:16.190
crew.
It's like these things have happened in real time in front of you.

1438
01:17:16.190 --> 01:17:17.240
It's really cool.
It actually,

1439
01:17:17.241 --> 01:17:19.190
one of the things that I love doing about this most,

1440
01:17:19.191 --> 01:17:23.120
it's like not only do I get to learn from these people every week,
like I really,

1441
01:17:23.121 --> 01:17:27.150
I,
I sit here and listen.
It's why I don't sit and stare at notes and go,

1442
01:17:27.151 --> 01:17:29.900
I got to ask you this and I gotta get you with that.
And that whole thing.

1443
01:17:29.901 --> 01:17:34.901
It's like if you could sit in a room with somebody and just be a,

1444
01:17:35.330 --> 01:17:39.320
you can learn and if you can learn,
uh,
I think it can be a better person.

1445
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:43.040
So I'm a,
I'm a better person,
not a perfect person.
Got It.
Got Plenty to work on.

1446
01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:47.750
A shout out to Paul.
Thank you,
my friend.
Um,
let's see.

1447
01:17:47.810 --> 01:17:52.610
I'm excited to see what bubbles up in the near future to fill acilitate the Max

1448
01:17:52.611 --> 01:17:55.610
effective transfer of complex slash tricky ideas.

1449
01:17:55.940 --> 01:18:00.320
Each additional platform is a new opportunity to work out the kinks.
Yeah,
you're,

1450
01:18:00.321 --> 01:18:03.200
you're actually totally right.
You know,
one of the interesting things here is,

1451
01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:04.880
and I said this right at the beginning,

1452
01:18:05.150 --> 01:18:06.950
it's like Jordan and I are working on this thing.

1453
01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:09.980
There are a zillion people that work want to work on a zillion different things.

1454
01:18:09.981 --> 01:18:11.020
There are people that are saying,

1455
01:18:11.110 --> 01:18:13.910
you got to go crypto right now there are people saying you've got to,
you know,

1456
01:18:13.911 --> 01:18:14.870
that's a two year plan.

1457
01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:18.080
There are people saying that the payment processors won't be a problem as long

1458
01:18:18.081 --> 01:18:21.950
as you're sort of decentralized a patriot in my view that they're just going to

1459
01:18:21.951 --> 01:18:26.180
nip us off slowly.
That way nobody knows what the answer to any of this is,

1460
01:18:26.181 --> 01:18:27.680
but again,
this is why.

1461
01:18:27.681 --> 01:18:31.400
How cool is it that there is a problem like think about this is what's so cool

1462
01:18:31.401 --> 01:18:35.090
about being a human and being alive in a free society,
right?

1463
01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:37.820
It's like there is a problem.
You guys see a problem,

1464
01:18:37.821 --> 01:18:40.100
you watching this right now you see that there's a problem.

1465
01:18:40.101 --> 01:18:42.410
I happen to be one guy talking about that problem,

1466
01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:46.250
but you might be able to solve it and maybe what you do,

1467
01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:48.410
the amount of people that have reached out to us,
it's like,
guess what?

1468
01:18:48.411 --> 01:18:49.550
We do read our emails.

1469
01:18:49.670 --> 01:18:51.980
Sometimes people reach out to Jordan and he forwards me something.
He says,

1470
01:18:51.981 --> 01:18:54.320
what do you think about this?
Or I forward it to Eric and I go,

1471
01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:57.910
this might seem like something.
So we're all trying to figure it out.

1472
01:18:57.930 --> 01:18:58.970
Doesn't mean that there's a,
you know,

1473
01:18:58.971 --> 01:19:01.730
everyone is like I saw when I announced that I was leaving patron,

1474
01:19:01.731 --> 01:19:05.270
I saw a couple verified people on Twitter go after me.
Like,
oh you see,

1475
01:19:05.271 --> 01:19:07.520
well if you,
if you really wanted to fight free speech,

1476
01:19:07.521 --> 01:19:09.320
you wouldn't just get off Patriot and you'd get off Twitter.

1477
01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:12.830
You get off Facebook,
you get off youtube and it's like,
you know what?

1478
01:19:12.890 --> 01:19:16.790
Everyone can sit there and complain about everything and bitch and Moan about

1479
01:19:16.791 --> 01:19:19.190
how everyone's not perfect,
but sometimes,

1480
01:19:20.150 --> 01:19:21.980
sometimes some people stand up and do something.

1481
01:19:21.981 --> 01:19:26.630
I think that's what we're doing here.
I really do.
All right.
Shout outs to Jonas,

1482
01:19:26.631 --> 01:19:31.370
to Ian,
to Amanda.
Oh,
to Amanda Lee.
Amanda Lee,
who I just sent you a note.

1483
01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:33.770
Uh,
your brother reached out over the holidays.

1484
01:19:33.771 --> 01:19:36.320
I'm sorry I didn't get it to you before Christmas.
Uh,

1485
01:19:36.321 --> 01:19:39.710
but you are a student at Ucla and you just completed the El sets.

1486
01:19:39.711 --> 01:19:44.060
Congratulations.
There you go.
Um,
okay.
Uh,

1487
01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:47.090
Holy Shit.
There's a lot going on here.
We,

1488
01:19:47.091 --> 01:19:48.620
the people are super proud of what you're doing.

1489
01:19:48.621 --> 01:19:50.630
Have you reached out to get Matt Christiansen on the show?

1490
01:19:50.631 --> 01:19:53.960
He's welcome to come on.
I don't know that I've reached out to him specifically.

1491
01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:57.080
I'd like to do it in studio.
He's in like Montana or something.
But yeah,

1492
01:19:57.081 --> 01:19:59.870
if he's watching what Matt,
we'll make it happen.
Um,

1493
01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:03.200
support from Australia where the world has also gone bat shit crazy.

1494
01:20:03.201 --> 01:20:05.270
Hoping to see Jordan Peterson here in February.

1495
01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:08.630
My government already banned Gavin from entering the country.
Uh,

1496
01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:11.910
we've got about about 10 stops in Australia.

1497
01:20:11.911 --> 01:20:14.280
They sold out crazily quickly.

1498
01:20:14.490 --> 01:20:18.450
So then we're supposed to be going after Australia.
We go to New Zealand.

1499
01:20:18.451 --> 01:20:20.460
I actually can't go to New Zealand.
Unfortunately.

1500
01:20:20.461 --> 01:20:21.840
I would love to go to New Zealand.

1501
01:20:21.841 --> 01:20:25.110
It's like how many chances does someone get to go to New Zealand?
But my family,

1502
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:29.730
uh,
my folks and my,
uh,
brother and sister and spouses and kids and everything,

1503
01:20:29.731 --> 01:20:33.450
we do one week of vacation a year together and that happens to be then,

1504
01:20:33.451 --> 01:20:36.750
so I'm leaving Australia,
uh,
so I'm missing,
I'm,

1505
01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:39.450
I'll be at all to show is up until the 16th in Sydney.

1506
01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:41.190
Then I'm going to miss like two or three shows.

1507
01:20:41.191 --> 01:20:45.180
Jordan goes to New Zealand and then from there,
uh,

1508
01:20:45.181 --> 01:20:46.740
he's then going back to Australia.

1509
01:20:46.741 --> 01:20:50.160
But it doesn't make sense for me to fly all the way back across the world,
uh,

1510
01:20:50.161 --> 01:20:52.710
to do that.
Although I've done some crazy flying things.
You know,

1511
01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:57.660
the craziest thing that I did on the whole tour so far was I left,

1512
01:20:57.900 --> 01:20:58.290
uh,

1513
01:20:58.290 --> 01:21:03.290
the UK on a Friday night or on a Friday afternoon to get back to Los Angeles to

1514
01:21:04.111 --> 01:21:06.300
go to,
uh,
to my good friend.

1515
01:21:06.301 --> 01:21:10.860
And former Ruben report gets Bob Saget and his beautiful wife Kelly Rizzo to go

1516
01:21:10.861 --> 01:21:12.210
to their wedding in Santa Monica.

1517
01:21:12.211 --> 01:21:16.320
So I got in that morning after like a 10 hour flight from the UK or however long

1518
01:21:16.321 --> 01:21:18.960
that flight is,
a went to the wedding,
had a great time,

1519
01:21:19.050 --> 01:21:22.020
was slow dancing by the way,
next to Billy crystal and his wife.

1520
01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:26.250
And I think our butts Kinda touched.
Um,
and then,
uh,

1521
01:21:26.490 --> 01:21:29.910
then had the wedding and then immediately the next day flew all the way back to

1522
01:21:29.911 --> 01:21:31.740
Amsterdam,
which was completely bananas,

1523
01:21:31.741 --> 01:21:36.390
but it was like you gotta you gotta do what you gotta do.
A shadow to Maryland,

1524
01:21:36.391 --> 01:21:40.320
to Aaron,
to Robert,
to Shawn and to Emilio.
Thank you guys.
Appreciate it.

1525
01:21:40.321 --> 01:21:44.910
Dave rubin.com/donate guys,
you guys truly are the lifeblood of this show.
Look,

1526
01:21:45.870 --> 01:21:46.980
I don't want to Belabor the point,

1527
01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:50.760
but I've got several networks that want me to join them.
Um,

1528
01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:54.480
we could do all sorts of things where I start doing live reads and more live ads

1529
01:21:54.481 --> 01:21:58.170
and all that stuff.
I like doing it the way we've done it.
And if we can just,

1530
01:21:58.260 --> 01:21:59.250
if we can,
uh,

1531
01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:04.320
to quote a Blanche Dubois or Blanche Devereaux as the case may be,

1532
01:22:04.321 --> 01:22:07.650
at least in my world,
uh,
I've always depended on the kindness of strangers.

1533
01:22:07.650 --> 01:22:10.770
You know what I mean?
Like you guys,
if you guys keep funding this thing,

1534
01:22:10.771 --> 01:22:14.370
we'll keep doing it this exact same way and we'll keep figuring out other ways

1535
01:22:14.371 --> 01:22:18.510
to,
to grow and expand.
Oh,
and by the way,
one of the things that,
um,

1536
01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:20.130
that I'm planning on doing,
so,
you know,

1537
01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:24.630
we had this great partnership with learn liberty,
which is a classical liberal,

1538
01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:28.020
a nonprofit.
And we worked with them for about two years.
They gave us some,

1539
01:22:28.050 --> 01:22:32.400
some of my favorite episodes.
They gave us with,
um,
Georgetown professor,
uh,

1540
01:22:32.610 --> 01:22:34.680
Randy Barnett,
who talked about the foot vote.

1541
01:22:34.681 --> 01:22:37.860
That was one of the episodes that really changed my views on small government

1542
01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:42.630
and we,
Steve Davies and Deirdre mccloskey and Shawn Hopwood and,

1543
01:22:42.660 --> 01:22:45.810
and they sponsored our episode with Phil de Franco just because they liked them.

1544
01:22:45.811 --> 01:22:48.630
They'd never even met the guy,
but they,
they thought they'd sponsor that episode.

1545
01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:50.310
So we worked with them for about two years.

1546
01:22:50.311 --> 01:22:53.460
They wanted to sign on for another year and I just kinda want it to go in

1547
01:22:53.461 --> 01:22:54.121
another direction.

1548
01:22:54.121 --> 01:22:57.450
So we actually do have a new nonprofit that I've done some stuff with,

1549
01:22:57.451 --> 01:22:59.970
but I may as well just tell you,
we're going to be doing a little bit more with,

1550
01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.840
uh,
with the iron ran institute.
Uh,
they,
I've done some live events with them,

1551
01:23:03.841 --> 01:23:06.700
obviously.
I've had,
you're on Brooklyn here who's been,
uh,
who's a great guy,

1552
01:23:06.701 --> 01:23:08.950
who's been very influential for me.
Um,

1553
01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:11.920
and we're going to be doing some sponsored shows with them and get them in there

1554
01:23:11.921 --> 01:23:13.810
because they,
because this is a beautiful thing,

1555
01:23:14.230 --> 01:23:17.380
they actually believe in the ideas of objectivism.

1556
01:23:17.530 --> 01:23:20.470
So we're going to do a couple of shows where it's objectivism verse and you'll

1557
01:23:20.471 --> 01:23:24.280
be able to see people sort of tangle and spar over ideas and they're putting

1558
01:23:24.281 --> 01:23:27.670
their money where their mouth is.
So that's actually a pretty cool.
All right.

1559
01:23:28.210 --> 01:23:29.070
<v 4>MMM.</v>

1560
01:23:30.250 --> 01:23:30.731
<v 1>Hey Dave,</v>

1561
01:23:30.731 --> 01:23:34.980
is there someone who you have come across that thinks like Thomas soul or who,

1562
01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:39.220
who are or who you think could become the next time?
It's all,
well,

1563
01:23:39.221 --> 01:23:42.610
I don't think there'll ever be another time.
His soul.
Is there anyone?

1564
01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:46.840
I mean I'm sure there's some people out there.
Um,

1565
01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:49.180
well I would say at some level,

1566
01:23:49.181 --> 01:23:51.760
although he's probably a little more left than Thomas.

1567
01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:56.680
I would say Coleman Hughes is,
is sort of on the way in,
in a certain respect.

1568
01:23:56.970 --> 01:24:01.330
Uh,
and Coleman I've had on here who's a,
who's a great guy and really bright.
Um,

1569
01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:07.120
I don't know,
could there ever be another time to probably not.
Probably not.

1570
01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:11.650
Shout outs to Gareth,
to John,
to Jeff,
to Jason to Albin and to Timothy.

1571
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:16.480
And then what I do with my marker,
we got a couple mugs come in,
Troy and Nathan,

1572
01:24:16.481 --> 01:24:21.040
you guys are getting mugs signed right there.
Troy.
There you go.

1573
01:24:21.070 --> 01:24:24.400
That's your Mug,
Nathan.
It's coming.
Okay.

1574
01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:29.710
Dave ruben.com/donate guys,
I really do appreciate it.
And by the way,
you know,

1575
01:24:29.711 --> 01:24:32.710
we're not going to,
if you look at how many times we did like serious,

1576
01:24:32.711 --> 01:24:35.110
like fundraising over these last couple of years,
we did it.

1577
01:24:35.111 --> 01:24:37.780
I tried to do it maybe once or twice a year and not even that.

1578
01:24:37.781 --> 01:24:40.380
I don't intend on doing this type of thing all the time.
Uh,

1579
01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:42.280
it's just at this brief moment where,
you know,

1580
01:24:42.281 --> 01:24:45.760
the other thing that's funny is that,
so we were at,
as I said,

1581
01:24:45.761 --> 01:24:48.700
around 30 grand a month for most of the last year on Patrion.

1582
01:24:48.701 --> 01:24:52.510
Then the than the Sargon thing happened.
We went down to like,
you know,

1583
01:24:52.540 --> 01:24:53.470
25 or something.

1584
01:24:53.471 --> 01:24:56.020
Then I started really talking about it a couple of weeks ago with Jordan.

1585
01:24:56.230 --> 01:24:59.590
We went down another 10.
Uh,
then I had made this announcement.

1586
01:24:59.591 --> 01:25:02.950
Now we're down to like,
we're down to like 14.
Let's say on there,

1587
01:25:02.951 --> 01:25:05.620
even despite the fact that I have announced to the patrons I'm leaving,

1588
01:25:05.950 --> 01:25:09.040
but there's 14 grand just sitting there because a lot of times people sign up

1589
01:25:09.041 --> 01:25:12.130
and then never think of it again.
I'm going to close the account either way,

1590
01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:16.060
so it's like they're going to be a lot of people who may be just signed up and

1591
01:25:16.061 --> 01:25:19.210
that aren't that active in all of this or maybe don't pay attention to Twitter

1592
01:25:19.211 --> 01:25:20.800
or whatever.
And it's like,

1593
01:25:20.890 --> 01:25:24.310
that's why we have to do some of these things where we talk about these things

1594
01:25:24.311 --> 01:25:27.280
and do these livestreams and do videos and the rest of it.

1595
01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:30.760
A shout out to Heidi and madness.
That is a great name.
Magnus,

1596
01:25:30.910 --> 01:25:31.960
you are getting a mug.

1597
01:25:33.130 --> 01:25:33.650
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1598
01:25:33.650 --> 01:25:34.370
<v 1>Right there.</v>

1599
01:25:34.370 --> 01:25:39.050
I'm going to write your name on it because Magnus is an all star name.
Magnus.

1600
01:25:39.770 --> 01:25:40.230
<v 4>Okay,</v>

1601
01:25:40.230 --> 01:25:43.320
<v 1>you're getting a Mug,
brother.
There you go.
All right.
Let's see.</v>

1602
01:25:44.650 --> 01:25:45.483
<v 4>MMM.</v>

1603
01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:48.930
<v 1>Paying for freedom.
How much for a Mug,
Dave?</v>

1604
01:25:48.931 --> 01:25:53.520
ruby.com/donate if you sign up for 50 bucks a monthly,

1605
01:25:53.670 --> 01:25:56.550
we're going to send you a mug right now and I'm going to sign it for you.
Um,

1606
01:25:56.580 --> 01:26:00.090
you said speaking in Montana at the University of Wyoming,
uh,

1607
01:26:00.270 --> 01:26:04.340
as a graduate of both Montana State Bozeman and university of Wyoming Laramie.

1608
01:26:04.341 --> 01:26:06.620
I forgive you for the mix up.
Keep up the battle.
Dave.

1609
01:26:07.070 --> 01:26:11.060
I've got a lot on my mind lately.
It was university of Wyoming at Laramie.

1610
01:26:11.090 --> 01:26:14.150
That's where it was.
Uh,
and that was,
that was fun.

1611
01:26:14.151 --> 01:26:15.770
I actually went out with some of the,
uh,

1612
01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:18.950
the students there from turning point after we had a good time except in like

1613
01:26:18.951 --> 01:26:23.420
bottle of ketchup exploded on me,
which actually did happen.
Um,

1614
01:26:23.570 --> 01:26:24.403
let's see.

1615
01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:28.820
To determine someone's true convictions look no further than the personal

1616
01:26:28.821 --> 01:26:32.210
sacrifices they've made to uphold them.
Love you Dave,
and keep up the great work,

1617
01:26:32.211 --> 01:26:35.540
Tim.
Thank you.
Well,
thank you Tim.
I appreciate that.
Um,

1618
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:38.450
these attacks are not new.

1619
01:26:38.451 --> 01:26:41.570
The banks had been strangling gun manufacturers and sellers for years.

1620
01:26:41.930 --> 01:26:44.450
Are you interested in speaking out on other rights?
Well,

1621
01:26:44.451 --> 01:26:46.950
that would be interesting.
Just to find out a little bit more about that.
I've,

1622
01:26:46.951 --> 01:26:47.784
I've heard that,

1623
01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:51.770
I've heard that from people that work in the adult film business that they've

1624
01:26:51.771 --> 01:26:55.040
said they have all sorts of problems with payment processors and things like

1625
01:26:55.041 --> 01:26:57.470
that.
Again,
this is where I would say that generally if,

1626
01:26:57.500 --> 01:27:00.140
if I was running things and I don't want to run things,

1627
01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:05.470
but I would say if you're following the laws of the country and Americans case,

1628
01:27:06.111 --> 01:27:10.370
the state that you live in,
that,
that everything basically should be allowed.

1629
01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:14.090
If you're breaking those laws,
then we have a different problem.
Um,

1630
01:27:15.050 --> 01:27:17.930
but yeah,
that's where I would fall out on that.
Um,

1631
01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:21.330
what are your thoughts on Bitcoin?
Do you think it could replace normal currency?

1632
01:27:21.331 --> 01:27:25.310
So first off,
we are accepting bitcoin now.
Uh,
we're also accepting bitcoin cash.

1633
01:27:25.311 --> 01:27:27.980
We're looking into light coin in theory,
him and a couple of the others.

1634
01:27:27.981 --> 01:27:31.520
But our bitcoin address is at [inaudible] dot com slash donate.

1635
01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:35.000
I have a lot to learn on crypto.
Trust me,
I'm trying to learn.

1636
01:27:35.001 --> 01:27:38.240
I have a whole bunch of calls tomorrow talking to crypto people on all sorts of

1637
01:27:38.241 --> 01:27:40.550
different fronts.
Um,
look,

1638
01:27:40.551 --> 01:27:44.420
because it's on the blockchain and it's not centralized,
um,

1639
01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:49.480
there is a power to this type of currency that I think will,

1640
01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:52.880
will be more important as we move forward.

1641
01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:55.580
There's still all sorts of problems related to how quickly you can do

1642
01:27:55.581 --> 01:27:59.660
transactions and is it really,
is it,
is it,
uh,
is it,
uh,
uh,

1643
01:27:59.661 --> 01:28:03.320
money the way caches where you can quickly do transfers or is it more of like a

1644
01:28:03.321 --> 01:28:05.960
gold standard sort of thing?
Um,

1645
01:28:06.170 --> 01:28:08.660
I got a ton to learn so I don't even want to speak out of school here,
but I,

1646
01:28:08.690 --> 01:28:12.890
but I promise you that I'm,
I'm learning as fast as I can.
Um,

1647
01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:15.350
okay.
Um,

1648
01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:20.330
are the donations through Patrion or other that you receive tax?
Yeah,
they are.

1649
01:28:20.331 --> 01:28:22.010
I have to report everything and we just,

1650
01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:25.610
I just did my year in taxes with my accountants.
It was not pretty.

1651
01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:26.473
You want to become a,

1652
01:28:26.570 --> 01:28:31.130
you want to become a libertarian pretty quick start paying taxes.
Um,

1653
01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:34.280
hey Dave just transferred from Patrion to your platform monthly.

1654
01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:36.440
Thank you very much.
Same with Jordan B.
Peterson.

1655
01:28:36.441 --> 01:28:38.930
Do you know if bill whittle would love to see you talk with them?
Yeah,

1656
01:28:38.931 --> 01:28:41.210
it had bill a little on bout a year ago.
Uh,
check it out.

1657
01:28:41.211 --> 01:28:44.180
Just put his name in slash Ruben report and Rubin report in the,
uh,

1658
01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:48.800
and the thing there.
All right.
We are about an hour and a half in.
Holy Cow.

1659
01:28:48.801 --> 01:28:51.690
I had been talking for a long time.
Um,
let's,

1660
01:28:51.750 --> 01:28:53.870
let's throw it in the wide shot because I'm surrounded by mugs.

1661
01:28:53.871 --> 01:28:57.680
There's a whole bunch of mugs you can't even see over there.
Um,
and remember,

1662
01:28:57.860 --> 01:29:00.860
you can get the t shirt,
the Rubin report,
tee shirt at 25,

1663
01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:03.210
and we'll send these things out to you pretty quick.

1664
01:29:03.211 --> 01:29:05.930
We'll try to get all these out within a,
within a day or two.

1665
01:29:05.950 --> 01:29:08.340
My guys are gonna kill me for saying that.
Um,

1666
01:29:08.370 --> 01:29:11.460
but we will do the best we can on that,
uh,
to get these out to you.
And yes,

1667
01:29:11.461 --> 01:29:13.410
these will never be printed.
And where am I looking over here?

1668
01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:16.410
These will never be printed again because these were the shirts that we were

1669
01:29:16.411 --> 01:29:20.630
given out to our patrons.
So we had about 200 of them or so left.
And,
uh,

1670
01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:25.380
we're clearing out stock here at the Rubin report today.
Uh,
let's see,

1671
01:29:26.610 --> 01:29:29.900
um,
uh,

1672
01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:34.260
exciting to witness the birth of a cultural paradigm where people have different

1673
01:29:34.261 --> 01:29:37.680
ideas unite under the ages of good faith and reason.
Discussion.

1674
01:29:37.681 --> 01:29:42.330
Let's make history one dark conversation at a time.
Let's do it.
Let's roll.

1675
01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:47.820
Um,
what is your opinion on Brazilian Prime Minister?

1676
01:29:47.890 --> 01:29:51.750
Uh,
Baldassar both Sarner row,
uh,

1677
01:29:51.810 --> 01:29:54.480
regarding,
oops,
there's a lot of things moving here.

1678
01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:59.040
Deforestation of the rainforest.
Ps,
I'm a Christian.
I bake you a cake though.
Uh,

1679
01:29:59.070 --> 01:30:02.100
you know,
I don't know enough about him.
Um,

1680
01:30:02.130 --> 01:30:04.770
but it sounds like he really hates Marxism and he's,

1681
01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:08.130
and he's really pushing Brazil to become more of a world leader and that he

1682
01:30:08.131 --> 01:30:12.270
actually is for capitalism and he's trying to get some of the SJW stuff out of

1683
01:30:12.271 --> 01:30:14.670
the schools.
I just saw a tweet by him a day or two ago.

1684
01:30:14.670 --> 01:30:18.000
So on that front and as again,
I don't know a ton about him.

1685
01:30:18.210 --> 01:30:22.110
That all sounds good to me.
Um,
and as a,
as a Christian,

1686
01:30:22.111 --> 01:30:26.050
I appreciate your offer to bake me a cake.
Um,
that,

1687
01:30:26.051 --> 01:30:29.640
that would be very a nice view.
Thank you very much.
Um,
let's see,

1688
01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:35.610
uh,
shout outs to mill high to William,
to Trenton,
to Daniel,
to Juanita,

1689
01:30:35.611 --> 01:30:38.520
to Henrik,
to Greg,
to Sam to Alexis and to Andrew.

1690
01:30:38.521 --> 01:30:42.510
Thank you guys very much.
Men.
You got look,
you know,

1691
01:30:42.810 --> 01:30:46.050
I said before that when we originally went on Patrion the night before,

1692
01:30:46.051 --> 01:30:50.100
I was like,
I don't know,
did I just destroy my career that I just cause,
uh,

1693
01:30:51.060 --> 01:30:54.840
my partner and my friends to,
to not have jobs anymore and the whole thing.

1694
01:30:55.110 --> 01:30:57.150
And uh,
you know,
look,

1695
01:30:57.151 --> 01:31:00.450
I knew this time coming through because we have a couple of different revenue

1696
01:31:00.451 --> 01:31:03.360
sources.
So,
so fan funding is the bulk of it.
As I said,

1697
01:31:03.690 --> 01:31:07.650
patron has been about 60 to 70% of our rev.
Uh,
there is youtube red.

1698
01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:10.500
But the problem with building a business around youtube rev is it goes like
this.

1699
01:31:10.501 --> 01:31:12.330
You just never know when it's going to go up and down.

1700
01:31:12.450 --> 01:31:15.870
It's also seasonal where it gets better in like November and December before the

1701
01:31:15.871 --> 01:31:18.390
holidays and then January,
February are pretty bad.

1702
01:31:18.391 --> 01:31:21.840
And with the monetization and all that,
uh,
we also do audio.

1703
01:31:22.210 --> 01:31:25.920
A podcast reads,
that's one way we do it.
Uh,
and as I said,

1704
01:31:25.921 --> 01:31:29.580
there would be plenty of opportunities if I right now want it to start doing ads

1705
01:31:29.610 --> 01:31:33.660
just this way,
just on youtube like this,
we could make a shit ton of money.

1706
01:31:33.661 --> 01:31:35.850
I mean far more than I was making on Patrion.

1707
01:31:36.030 --> 01:31:38.040
I just don't know that that's the route that I want to go.

1708
01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:39.540
I don't begrudge anyone for doing it.
You know,

1709
01:31:39.541 --> 01:31:42.510
it's funny when when Shapiro does it,
it's become part of his shtick.

1710
01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:45.810
It's actually kind of fun when he does it.
I just,
I just like doing it this way.

1711
01:31:45.811 --> 01:31:50.790
Also be for the purposes of the conversation,
and this is not a knock on anybody,

1712
01:31:51.060 --> 01:31:52.380
but for the purposes of the conversation,

1713
01:31:52.381 --> 01:31:55.950
when I sit in this room and they closed that door,
we go straight through.

1714
01:31:55.951 --> 01:31:59.650
We do not edit for content.
I sit there,
I look at that person,
uh,

1715
01:31:59.651 --> 01:32:02.470
I stare at them in the eyes and we,
and we go for it.
Right.

1716
01:32:02.770 --> 01:32:06.400
And I don't know that I would want to be stopping to read ads in the middle of

1717
01:32:06.401 --> 01:32:10.180
that.
Again,
that's not smirking anybody the way anyone has to do anything.

1718
01:32:10.450 --> 01:32:13.360
It's just what I've become accustomed to in the more that,
uh,

1719
01:32:13.870 --> 01:32:15.970
the more that you guys allow me to do that.
I think the,

1720
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.870
the better work that I could do a shout outs to Christian and to Stefan.

1721
01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:24.250
Thank you guys.
Um,
okay.
Here we go.
Um,

1722
01:32:25.780 --> 01:32:28.360
Dave,
I love your content as well as the IDW as a whole.

1723
01:32:28.361 --> 01:32:31.120
I just wanted to make sure you're subscribed to Pewdie Pie.
Please confirm.

1724
01:32:31.300 --> 01:32:33.040
I am subscribed to Pewdie Pie.

1725
01:32:33.190 --> 01:32:36.840
I don't know if it's actually through the Ruben report youtube channel.
Uh,

1726
01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:39.220
but it through.
I have another one that I am subscribed to the Cutie Pie.

1727
01:32:39.221 --> 01:32:42.460
He's funny,
he's funny.
He did this really funny video.

1728
01:32:42.461 --> 01:32:45.670
He actually mentioned me in a video about the whole patrion thing,
uh,

1729
01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:49.760
maybe a week or two ago.
But he just does these Holly,
he opens this video like,

1730
01:32:49.780 --> 01:32:53.950
and it's like this mock sort of cartoony CNN and he's like,
hi,
I'm Gloria Borger.

1731
01:32:53.951 --> 01:32:57.790
And it's like,
what?
He's just,
the guy is just funny.
I like them.
Um,

1732
01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:00.310
let's see.
Thanks for what you do.

1733
01:33:00.311 --> 01:33:03.910
You should interview retiring a representative Trey Gowdy about free speech and

1734
01:33:03.911 --> 01:33:06.430
regards to national security and censorship there in,

1735
01:33:06.431 --> 01:33:10.270
I would be happy to do that.
Let's see if we can reach out to him.
Good idea.
Uh,

1736
01:33:10.271 --> 01:33:13.810
have Neil Ferguson back on to discuss what's going on with credit processors

1737
01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:16.600
from a historical perspective?
What a great idea.
I got to tell you,

1738
01:33:16.601 --> 01:33:21.220
one of the interviews,
I knew that,
that Neil was a,
was a,
uh,

1739
01:33:21.460 --> 01:33:24.040
a brilliant historian and was outspoken and all that,

1740
01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:29.340
but I did not fully expect him to be the absolute power house that he was.

1741
01:33:30.191 --> 01:33:33.820
He,
he flew in,
he like walked,
he had just landed.

1742
01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:37.930
He walks any like pound some water.
He sits down and he just goes,
and we did,

1743
01:33:37.931 --> 01:33:40.240
I think about an hour and 20 minutes and we could have done much more,

1744
01:33:40.241 --> 01:33:43.810
but he had to jump back on the plane.
Uh,
but he's a brilliant,
brilliant guy.
He's,

1745
01:33:43.811 --> 01:33:47.500
his wife by the way,
is Ion Hirsi Ali.
And He,
when he talks about her,

1746
01:33:47.501 --> 01:33:48.550
the interview,
it's like,
you know,

1747
01:33:48.551 --> 01:33:50.680
some people who could talk about their wife or their husband and they're just

1748
01:33:50.681 --> 01:33:53.080
like saying something nice and it just meeting us.
But the,

1749
01:33:53.081 --> 01:33:56.530
the way that he talks about that woman,
it's like,
wow,
that is,

1750
01:33:56.560 --> 01:33:59.080
that is what love really is.
Um,

1751
01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:04.150
will you work with software engineers to create solutions with freedom as a core

1752
01:34:04.151 --> 01:34:08.050
value?
Yeah.
This is what people are reaching out to us.
As I said,

1753
01:34:08.051 --> 01:34:10.880
I'm not making this up.
Well,
I got Google engineers reaching out to me.

1754
01:34:10.881 --> 01:34:12.640
I got people at Facebook reaching out to me.

1755
01:34:12.860 --> 01:34:17.320
We're going to try to figure this all out.
Um,
it's a lot to chew off.
Uh,

1756
01:34:17.740 --> 01:34:22.570
Shawn m a shout out Leonard a shout out and Sean Wwa for a Mug.

1757
01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:25.390
All right.
I got five more mugs right there and a bunch over there.

1758
01:34:25.391 --> 01:34:29.650
Let's get rid of all these mugs people.
There we go.
Another mug.
Go.
Kay.

1759
01:34:30.190 --> 01:34:34.450
Um,
let's see,
um,

1760
01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:40.000
much of the talk between you and your colleagues highlights the issues around

1761
01:34:40.001 --> 01:34:42.460
radical leftist indoctrination at universities.

1762
01:34:42.461 --> 01:34:45.730
Are there still reasons to pursue an education at these institutions in the

1763
01:34:45.731 --> 01:34:46.810
current climate?
Ah,

1764
01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:50.350
this is such a tough question and I get this a lot because I speak at colleges.

1765
01:34:51.790 --> 01:34:56.240
Look,
there are a million reasons to go to college.
I think that that are,

1766
01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:58.190
aren't necessarily the academic reasons.
Let's,

1767
01:34:58.191 --> 01:35:00.980
let's just put academia side for a second.
There are social reasons.

1768
01:35:00.981 --> 01:35:02.420
Meeting people from different walks of life,

1769
01:35:02.421 --> 01:35:04.730
meeting people from different parts of the country or different parts of the

1770
01:35:04.731 --> 01:35:08.780
world.
Living in a dorm,
living in,
you know,
when you move off campus maybe,

1771
01:35:08.781 --> 01:35:10.160
and you live in a small house with some friends,

1772
01:35:10.161 --> 01:35:13.520
like learning how to socialize with other people,
not under your parents' roof,

1773
01:35:13.730 --> 01:35:16.850
but not under the roof of a where you're gonna live with,

1774
01:35:16.851 --> 01:35:18.590
say your spouse one day or something like that.

1775
01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:20.720
So there's all sorts of social reasons.
Learning,

1776
01:35:20.721 --> 01:35:24.500
learning Tata hang out and have fun and maybe smoke a joint and have a beer and

1777
01:35:24.501 --> 01:35:27.470
what and whatever else that you're going to do to help become a person that is

1778
01:35:27.471 --> 01:35:29.690
all what part of what the college experience is like.
Now,

1779
01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:33.380
if the academic side of it is just indoctrination than man,

1780
01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:39.080
it's tough.
I would say the most important thing you can do is as a parent is um,

1781
01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:41.750
try to steer I suppose your,

1782
01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:47.240
your children to schools that are going to be respectful of ideas that are going

1783
01:35:47.241 --> 01:35:49.250
to be respectful of defending free speech.

1784
01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:52.790
University of Chicago is doing a great job of this.
Um,

1785
01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:56.870
there are schools that are still doing this by the way.
I spoke down in Clemson.

1786
01:35:56.871 --> 01:35:58.880
They've got a great,
um,

1787
01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:02.780
a program down there about capitalism and free markets that I thought they're

1788
01:36:02.781 --> 01:36:05.600
doing a nice job in Jordan and I spoke to a small group of students there and

1789
01:36:05.601 --> 01:36:07.370
then then did a big talk.
Um,

1790
01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:10.550
there's all sorts of schools that are doing interesting and he's Chapman

1791
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:11.450
University here,
uh,

1792
01:36:11.451 --> 01:36:15.020
outside of Santa Barbara where I'm Michael Shermer teachers I think is doing a

1793
01:36:15.021 --> 01:36:18.320
nice job defending free speech.
But yeah,
if you're going to just send them,

1794
01:36:18.620 --> 01:36:21.750
if you're gonna send them to Berkeley to just be indoctrinated and then now

1795
01:36:21.751 --> 01:36:23.290
that's problem.
But that being said,
I've,

1796
01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:26.600
I've given talks to the Berkeley College Republicans,
um,

1797
01:36:26.660 --> 01:36:29.210
and they're there and they're fighting for what they believe in.

1798
01:36:29.211 --> 01:36:33.200
So hopefully you've given your child enough of,
uh,
of,
uh,

1799
01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:36.710
understanding of what the world is or the basic bones of how to go about life,

1800
01:36:36.711 --> 01:36:38.060
that they're not going to go to the school,

1801
01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:41.030
forget everything you taught and then just come out a Zombie on the other side.

1802
01:36:41.031 --> 01:36:43.070
But that's tough.
And,
um,
as someone who's not a parent,

1803
01:36:43.071 --> 01:36:47.120
it's a little bit hard for me to say that with full Gusto or something.

1804
01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:50.150
A shout outs to Michael,
to Angie,
to Blake,
to Ashley,

1805
01:36:50.151 --> 01:36:54.260
to Tony to call in to Jerry and a Mug for Robin.

1806
01:36:54.830 --> 01:36:59.780
All right,
Robin,
that's yours,
Robin.
There you go.

1807
01:36:59.781 --> 01:37:03.320
All right.
Um,
what are some books that changed your life?

1808
01:37:03.321 --> 01:37:06.110
Love the show and everything that you're doing.
Thanks Dave.
Um,

1809
01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:08.240
I like this question.
So first of all,
every book that we have,

1810
01:37:08.241 --> 01:37:11.420
we could go to the wide shot for a sec.
Every book that's on our set right now,

1811
01:37:11.421 --> 01:37:12.890
including some books that you can't see over there,

1812
01:37:12.891 --> 01:37:17.890
these are all former Ruben report guests.
So there's any mutual Steven Pinker,
uh,

1813
01:37:17.900 --> 01:37:22.040
you're on Brooklyn is teal.
There's Ferguson,
Kelly Carlin Sagat.
Um,

1814
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:26.660
David from Sam Harris is over there.
Douglas Murray,
I mean Thomas Soul,

1815
01:37:26.700 --> 01:37:31.510
Scott Adams Ababa.
Um,
so that's,
sorry,

1816
01:37:31.511 --> 01:37:34.430
I've read most of these books.
You know,
the first,
the first year of the show,

1817
01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:36.590
at least maybe the first two years of the show,

1818
01:37:36.620 --> 01:37:39.430
I read every book of every guest that we had on and,

1819
01:37:39.590 --> 01:37:42.350
and then suddenly my schedule got so crazy.
It was impossible to do.

1820
01:37:42.351 --> 01:37:47.351
I also found sometimes in certain interviews if I knew a little bit less about

1821
01:37:48.890 --> 01:37:51.180
the specific topic of the booklet,

1822
01:37:51.270 --> 01:37:53.660
say I can ask better questions because I didn't,

1823
01:37:53.690 --> 01:37:56.190
I wasn't sort of subconsciously leading in a certain way.

1824
01:37:56.191 --> 01:38:01.140
I was actually going in the most open way.
So when I had Jordan on even,
um,

1825
01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:05.520
I think 12 rules was right.
I mean the Jordan,
I knew each other pretty well,

1826
01:38:05.521 --> 01:38:08.010
but there's certainly before the tour,
um,

1827
01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:12.270
I think either either 12 rules had just come out or was just about to come out.

1828
01:38:12.300 --> 01:38:15.600
I had not read the book and we went through the rules and it's like,
now I know,

1829
01:38:15.601 --> 01:38:19.230
I know the rules inside and out,
and he,
and he does these awesome,
really Dan,

1830
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:24.150
they're truly incredible talks about them all the time.
Um,
so,
but okay.

1831
01:38:24.151 --> 01:38:27.620
But as two books that I would recommend,
um,
the,

1832
01:38:27.730 --> 01:38:30.360
the book that I would recommend more than anything else because it affected me

1833
01:38:30.361 --> 01:38:35.160
in such a deeply profound way,
is a billions and billions by Carl Sagan.

1834
01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:38.340
It's Carl Sagan.
Uh,
it's his last book.

1835
01:38:38.341 --> 01:38:40.530
He actually died before he finished it.

1836
01:38:40.531 --> 01:38:43.710
So then his wife Andrew and who's [inaudible],
who's also a professor at Cornell,

1837
01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:47.130
she finished it for him.
Um,
Carl Sagan,

1838
01:38:47.131 --> 01:38:50.370
if most of you know who Carl Sagan is,
um,
he,

1839
01:38:50.371 --> 01:38:54.240
but he wrote Cosmos and he did the TV show cosmos and he used to go on the old

1840
01:38:54.241 --> 01:38:57.090
Johnny Carson tonight show in the,
the joke that Johnny Carson would say,

1841
01:38:57.330 --> 01:39:00.600
Johnny Carson would always mock him and say,
you say billions and billions,

1842
01:39:00.601 --> 01:39:02.850
except it turns out that he actually never said that phrase.

1843
01:39:02.851 --> 01:39:05.040
That's why he named the book millions of billions.
Anyway,

1844
01:39:05.041 --> 01:39:08.700
it's just a great book about,
about the way humans react to each other,

1845
01:39:08.701 --> 01:39:13.290
how important science and belief are in a whole bunch of other things.
So yes,

1846
01:39:13.291 --> 01:39:16.110
I would check that out if I were you.
A shout out to Marshall.

1847
01:39:16.111 --> 01:39:20.940
Thank you my friend.
Um,
let's see.
Um,

1848
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:24.810
do you think the next election we'll see more people move towards the middle

1849
01:39:24.811 --> 01:39:28.380
with their votes are further away from moderation also.
You're my fave,
Dave.

1850
01:39:28.381 --> 01:39:32.100
All right,
I appreciate that.
Um,

1851
01:39:33.030 --> 01:39:37.260
well I tweeted out yesterday like a six tweet thread about sort of what my

1852
01:39:37.261 --> 01:39:39.690
predictions are for,
for the year.
I look,

1853
01:39:39.691 --> 01:39:44.691
I think that the left unfortunately at all the markers over the last couple of

1854
01:39:45.330 --> 01:39:48.210
years where they could have done a little self reflection and said that we

1855
01:39:48.211 --> 01:39:51.810
shouldn't be in tight entity politics.
We shouldn't judge people as groups.

1856
01:39:52.050 --> 01:39:55.470
We should look at the individual more things that used to be liberal principles,

1857
01:39:55.471 --> 01:39:58.800
right?
Um,
we shouldn't look for the government to solve everything.

1858
01:39:58.801 --> 01:40:02.970
Jfk Liberal Democrat JFK is not what the country can do for you as well you can

1859
01:40:02.971 --> 01:40:05.190
do for the country.
That's the reverse of what they say.

1860
01:40:05.191 --> 01:40:08.220
Now that imagine if Bernie started saying that they would not be happy with

1861
01:40:08.221 --> 01:40:09.660
Bernie.
Um,

1862
01:40:10.650 --> 01:40:15.650
so I think that the left we're going to see like a truly bananas left that is

1863
01:40:16.021 --> 01:40:17.700
going to get worse and worse and worse.

1864
01:40:17.970 --> 01:40:21.180
What I and the meeting is going to keep feeding it and giving it all the energy.

1865
01:40:21.181 --> 01:40:22.170
That's the worst part.

1866
01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:27.000
What I think will will happen subtly is what's been happening suddenly,

1867
01:40:27.001 --> 01:40:31.140
which is there is a really interesting group of say,

1868
01:40:31.141 --> 01:40:36.141
moderate conservatives and Libertarians and some Trumpers and some disaffected

1869
01:40:36.541 --> 01:40:39.660
liberals who are coming together with pretty moderate stance is now,

1870
01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:41.700
who is the leader of that?
Like I don't think,

1871
01:40:41.730 --> 01:40:44.640
I don't think ultimately that Trump is the leader of that,

1872
01:40:45.010 --> 01:40:48.630
even though by no means do I have Trump derangement syndrome and I think he's

1873
01:40:48.631 --> 01:40:52.650
done a lot of good things on,
on policy funds and forget Twitter for a second.

1874
01:40:53.050 --> 01:40:53.883
Um,

1875
01:40:56.480 --> 01:41:00.650
so I think that will continue to be built that,
that group,

1876
01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:03.860
but it wa but it's about where will it get its energy from ultimately who will

1877
01:41:03.861 --> 01:41:08.000
be the leader of it and what is it like?
Is it a more moderate Republican?

1878
01:41:08.060 --> 01:41:11.660
Is Ben Shapiro gonna run for President?
I mean,
who knows?
Could it be Nikki Haley?

1879
01:41:11.661 --> 01:41:11.871
I mean,

1880
01:41:11.871 --> 01:41:15.260
I'd probably vote for Nikki Haley and that would really flip identity politics

1881
01:41:15.261 --> 01:41:18.860
on its head right now.
You've got a brown woman,
Republican.
Well,

1882
01:41:18.861 --> 01:41:22.130
what are they going to do with that?
So yeah,
it's really,
it's interesting stuff.

1883
01:41:22.250 --> 01:41:24.770
I,
my hope is that people who returned to moderation,

1884
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:28.070
we don't want to look back when in 20 years from now and go,
man,

1885
01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:31.670
2018 2019 those were the good old days because now we're in the middle of a

1886
01:41:31.671 --> 01:41:33.770
civil war,
over Twitter fights.
You know what I mean?

1887
01:41:33.771 --> 01:41:35.960
It's like we still got a pretty damn good here.

1888
01:41:35.990 --> 01:41:39.860
Right for you may think that all hells that's so horrible were so mean to each

1889
01:41:39.861 --> 01:41:42.340
other.
It's never been worse.
You know,
read some of the things that,

1890
01:41:42.341 --> 01:41:43.760
that Thomas Jefferson,
who I love,

1891
01:41:43.761 --> 01:41:46.580
we'd say about his political opponents or that they would say about him.

1892
01:41:47.420 --> 01:41:50.830
It's like there were crazy,
crazy things being said.
Um,
uh,

1893
01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:54.680
and attacking each other and all that.
So it's like,
it may feel crazy right now,

1894
01:41:54.681 --> 01:41:56.390
but also this is where every now and again,

1895
01:41:56.391 --> 01:42:00.680
get offline and go talk to real people and they're actually pretty decent.
Um,

1896
01:42:00.730 --> 01:42:05.060
shout out to James,
Ron and Collin.
All right guys,
we've got 15 minutes left.

1897
01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:10.000
Dave rubin.com/donate.
I got a couple mugs left.
You will get an autograph mug.

1898
01:42:10.001 --> 01:42:14.330
Got a lot of graph right here.
We'll get you the exclusive Ruben report,

1899
01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:17.780
Reuben select tee shirts that will never be printed again because it was our

1900
01:42:17.781 --> 01:42:22.610
patrion a t shirt.
We are leaving Patriot on January 15th.

1901
01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:23.270
Um,

1902
01:42:23.270 --> 01:42:28.040
I thank you guys for being surrounded by mugs and support and love and all of

1903
01:42:28.041 --> 01:42:32.510
those things.
I'm just doing what I,
what I think I should do.
Who here we go.

1904
01:42:32.511 --> 01:42:35.810
Thank you Andrea.
I appreciate it.
Uh,
Ruben,

1905
01:42:35.811 --> 01:42:37.520
you and the rest of the IDW or the best,

1906
01:42:37.521 --> 01:42:41.270
keep up the good work and never apologize to the leftist for anything they are

1907
01:42:41.271 --> 01:42:44.390
truly lost in.
They're in desperate need of reasonable voices like yours.

1908
01:42:44.391 --> 01:42:47.690
I'll bake you a cake.
Thank you.
Um,
you know,
it's funny too,

1909
01:42:47.691 --> 01:42:52.160
it's like if you listen to what the media will say,
it's like,

1910
01:42:52.370 --> 01:42:54.230
look,
I went to this turning point thing,

1911
01:42:54.231 --> 01:42:56.930
the student action summit at the end of December that I mentioned and as I said,

1912
01:42:56.931 --> 01:43:01.931
Prager was there and Gutfeld and Charlie Kirk and Candace and Jordan and a and a

1913
01:43:03.141 --> 01:43:05.950
whole bunch of other people brand them.
Tatum,
Brandon,
Tatum,

1914
01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:10.930
a whole other people holler bunch.
And um,
I met when I had,

1915
01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:14.330
when I got there to get backstage.
Um,

1916
01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:15.980
I dunno if I walked in the wrong entrance or whatever,

1917
01:43:15.981 --> 01:43:18.950
but I had to walk through like a crowd of hundreds of people and everyone's

1918
01:43:18.951 --> 01:43:22.130
coming up to me and they take selfies and I'm sign and stuff and all this stuff.

1919
01:43:22.131 --> 01:43:25.460
And it's like these are great people from every walk of life.

1920
01:43:25.461 --> 01:43:26.390
They're every color.

1921
01:43:26.391 --> 01:43:30.760
And I met gay people and straight people and I met Orthodox Jews wearing Yamakas

1922
01:43:30.770 --> 01:43:34.640
and I met brown Muslims and I met all of these different people.
And guess what?

1923
01:43:34.700 --> 01:43:37.370
They're all conservatives.
They're all decent.
They're all human.

1924
01:43:37.371 --> 01:43:39.500
They're open to ideas.
I went on stage,

1925
01:43:39.501 --> 01:43:42.050
I gave a talk about the differences that I have with conservatives.

1926
01:43:42.051 --> 01:43:45.260
I'm pro choice.
I know some of them are not thrilled with gay marriage,

1927
01:43:45.261 --> 01:43:49.940
a series of other things.
I'm,
I'm,
I'm uh,
against the death penalty.
Um,

1928
01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:53.540
and they still,
they still love it.
I got a great ovation afterwards.

1929
01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:55.730
It's like these are not the intolerant people,

1930
01:43:55.731 --> 01:43:57.320
but that's the way it's always going to be framed.

1931
01:43:57.321 --> 01:44:00.170
Which also brings me quickly to something on the media that I wanted to address,

1932
01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:04.940
which is you may have seen the New York Times article from about 10 days ago.

1933
01:44:05.270 --> 01:44:09.910
I'm on the patrion situation and the entire article is nonsense.
It's,
it's,

1934
01:44:10.130 --> 01:44:11.570
it's almost completely made up.

1935
01:44:11.571 --> 01:44:14.990
It's written by a New York Times journalist by the name of Nellie Bowles.

1936
01:44:14.991 --> 01:44:19.820
She's the one who did the article on Jordan and enforced monogamy from,
from uh,

1937
01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:24.140
you know,
about a year ago now.
And she framed the whole thing ridiculously.

1938
01:44:24.141 --> 01:44:26.930
She refers to me as a libertarian podcast or which I don't care about being

1939
01:44:26.931 --> 01:44:29.120
called a libertarian.
That's fine.
But it's like,

1940
01:44:29.121 --> 01:44:30.500
you're only saying that because you know,

1941
01:44:30.501 --> 01:44:34.070
in the minds of your ultra left readers that when you say libertarian,

1942
01:44:34.071 --> 01:44:35.480
that somehow means bad person.

1943
01:44:35.660 --> 01:44:39.470
Like if you were being an honest reporter and not someone colorizing something,

1944
01:44:39.650 --> 01:44:42.650
you would say Dave Rubin,
who refers to himself as a classical liberal,

1945
01:44:42.890 --> 01:44:44.840
but what would ever put that aside?
It doesn't even matter.

1946
01:44:45.110 --> 01:44:47.960
The quote she gets from Jacqueline Hart who's the head of trust and safety at

1947
01:44:47.961 --> 01:44:52.961
Patrion is basically in effect that Karl Sargon to buckeyed said these words

1948
01:44:53.061 --> 01:44:56.330
meaning the n word on the platform and you're not allowed to do it on the

1949
01:44:56.331 --> 01:44:59.810
platform except he never said those words on the platform.
So the whole,

1950
01:45:00.050 --> 01:45:03.080
that's the most important quote of the whole article that sets up everything

1951
01:45:03.081 --> 01:45:04.850
about why people are leaving and everything else.

1952
01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:09.020
Now then I tweeted at her and I and many other people did and they got hundreds

1953
01:45:09.020 --> 01:45:11.360
and thousands of retweets saying the quote that she gave you,

1954
01:45:11.361 --> 01:45:13.820
that is the backbone of the article is a lie.

1955
01:45:14.330 --> 01:45:17.180
And it's like there's no correction at her.
New York Times doesn't give a shit.

1956
01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:20.690
So it's like we are watching fake news crumble and I say freaking let them

1957
01:45:20.691 --> 01:45:24.470
crumble.
All right.
How do you really feel about that Dave?
Uh,

1958
01:45:24.471 --> 01:45:29.330
shout out to Scott and Jay is getting a mug.
All right,
Jay,
let's do it.

1959
01:45:29.420 --> 01:45:30.253
Here we go.

1960
01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:32.873
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1961
01:45:34.050 --> 01:45:36.360
<v 1>All right.
That's fine.
Signature right there.</v>

1962
01:45:36.450 --> 01:45:41.430
That might be my best one of the day.
You are in luck,
Jay.
I'm okay.

1963
01:45:43.330 --> 01:45:44.163
<v 5>Ciao.</v>

1964
01:45:44.470 --> 01:45:47.560
<v 1>Do you think you'll face legal challenges no matter what platform or payment</v>

1965
01:45:47.561 --> 01:45:51.670
system you adopt?
I mean,
I certainly hope not.
I'm not doing anything illegal.

1966
01:45:51.850 --> 01:45:55.600
Um,
I don't intend on doing anything illegal.
We're all,

1967
01:45:55.630 --> 01:45:58.090
all of us are just trying all,
I can't say all of it.

1968
01:45:58.540 --> 01:46:00.310
What I can tell you that most of the people that are,

1969
01:46:00.311 --> 01:46:03.580
I'm talking to about these things from the Weinstein brothers to Jordan and

1970
01:46:03.581 --> 01:46:05.620
everybody else,
it's like we want to have,

1971
01:46:05.621 --> 01:46:08.740
we want to be able to be on platforms where the information is not being

1972
01:46:08.741 --> 01:46:11.680
manipulated,
where people are getting,
with what they're subscribed to,

1973
01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:15.010
where if you send a tweet out that it's not going to be shadow band,

1974
01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:17.920
that you can make an honest dime,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

1975
01:46:17.921 --> 01:46:21.010
We're not trying to revolutionize the world.
Nobody wants to fight Google.

1976
01:46:21.011 --> 01:46:25.510
Did you think that seems fun?
Biting Google that's bite mastercard,
like,
you know,

1977
01:46:25.511 --> 01:46:25.640
I,

1978
01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:28.780
I'd rather play video games and go play basketball and take a walk with my dog.

1979
01:46:28.810 --> 01:46:32.290
You know what I mean?
It's like,
that's just true.
So it's like,

1980
01:46:32.291 --> 01:46:34.480
do I think we're gonna face legal challenge everywhere?
I mean,

1981
01:46:34.481 --> 01:46:35.700
this is all part of,
I suppose,

1982
01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:38.710
growing a business and we're going to have to think through all of these things,

1983
01:46:38.711 --> 01:46:42.550
but that's why these are not,
I know people want the silver bullet right now.

1984
01:46:42.551 --> 01:46:46.510
They want the magic answer right now.
Just be patient,
be patient.
And that's why,

1985
01:46:46.511 --> 01:46:47.770
as I said a couple of times now,

1986
01:46:47.771 --> 01:46:50.040
it's like we're going to get off Patrion for now.

1987
01:46:50.041 --> 01:46:53.130
We're gonna move everybody over to our website that eliminates the middleman.

1988
01:46:53.370 --> 01:46:55.740
We may have to deal with the payment processor issue at some point,

1989
01:46:55.741 --> 01:46:58.200
but hopefully we'll be able to fold that into whatever else we're doing.

1990
01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:02.100
But right now it's,
if you dig what I'm doing here and you want to support it,

1991
01:47:02.101 --> 01:47:06.780
you have a way to do it at Dave rubin.com/donate.
So there you go.
Um,
Dave,

1992
01:47:06.781 --> 01:47:08.760
while you go on this adventure,
remember you're not alone.

1993
01:47:08.761 --> 01:47:11.190
Keep the words of Cs Lewis close to your heart.

1994
01:47:11.191 --> 01:47:15.360
Adventures are never fun while you're having them.
I love that quote actually.
Um,

1995
01:47:15.390 --> 01:47:18.930
I'm very aware of that.
Trust me.
Like,
trust me,
trust me,
trust me.

1996
01:47:19.270 --> 01:47:22.860
I've been able to go across the world and the last year and meet so many people

1997
01:47:22.861 --> 01:47:27.861
who are so kind and decent and it has made me a better person.

1998
01:47:28.741 --> 01:47:31.950
It just has.
And like when people come up to you and say,
Oh,
you know,

1999
01:47:31.951 --> 01:47:33.120
you affected me this way,

2000
01:47:33.121 --> 01:47:36.300
or I watched you and I shared this thing and now my brother and I aren't

2001
01:47:36.301 --> 01:47:39.540
fighting so much,
or whatever it is,
it's like,
it's real,
man.
It's real.

2002
01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:43.050
I think I've told this before,
but,
um,

2003
01:47:43.470 --> 01:47:47.640
one of the shows that we did with Jordan,
I forgot,
I think we're in the UK.

2004
01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:49.500
Um,
there was,
uh,
uh,

2005
01:47:49.501 --> 01:47:54.501
a father and son at the show by coincidence and the sun was like 16,

2006
01:47:56.250 --> 01:47:59.190
and they hadn't,
I'm slightly butchering this.
The son was like 16,

2007
01:47:59.191 --> 01:48:02.100
and they hadn't seen each other in four years and they both just happened to be

2008
01:48:02.101 --> 01:48:04.980
at the show and then saw each other started hysterical crying.

2009
01:48:04.981 --> 01:48:06.150
They came backstage after like,

2010
01:48:06.180 --> 01:48:08.850
like amazing things are happening if you open your eyes to it.

2011
01:48:09.090 --> 01:48:13.770
And sometimes it just has to be,
uh,
offline to make it happen.

2012
01:48:14.010 --> 01:48:16.470
Much respect for your decision,
Dave.
You're on the right side of history.

2013
01:48:16.471 --> 01:48:19.950
Don't abandon your path.
Yeah.
You know what I better to do than save the world.

2014
01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:25.320
Uh,
um,
Jacob.
Thank you Vidar.
Thank you Ryan.
Thank you,
Mike.

2015
01:48:25.380 --> 01:48:30.300
Thank you.
Kay.
Carla.
Thank you.
Um,
all right guys.
10 more minutes.

2016
01:48:30.660 --> 01:48:33.660
10 more minutes.
If you want a Reuben Select Mug,

2017
01:48:33.661 --> 01:48:36.540
that will never be created again because they were created for patron.

2018
01:48:36.541 --> 01:48:39.380
I'll sign it right here for you.
50 bucks on a monthly donation.

2019
01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:42.720
Dave rubin.com/donate t shirts are right here.

2020
01:48:43.110 --> 01:48:45.810
I feel like I should be selling the,
the set it and forget it.
Chicken.

2021
01:48:45.980 --> 01:48:49.380
Where's Ron Popeil when you need them.
Tony.
Thank you,
Laura.
Thank you.

2022
01:48:50.580 --> 01:48:52.350
I'm super chat.

2023
01:48:52.351 --> 01:48:55.200
I really enjoyed watching your channel and exploring how you went into things

2024
01:48:55.201 --> 01:48:57.030
openly and listening.
You're doing a great job.

2025
01:48:57.031 --> 01:49:00.420
You started my journey on educating myself on current day topics and asking

2026
01:49:00.421 --> 01:49:04.500
harder questions.
I love to hear that.
That's what it's all about.
Um,

2027
01:49:05.070 --> 01:49:08.070
you,
Jordan and Sam are the real defenders of free speech.

2028
01:49:08.071 --> 01:49:11.700
Is there anything patrion slash Twitter can say do to regain the trust of true

2029
01:49:11.701 --> 01:49:15.150
liberals like you guys?
Look if right now,
look,

2030
01:49:15.151 --> 01:49:16.980
there's someone at Patrion watching this,
right?

2031
01:49:16.981 --> 01:49:20.730
Like maybe Cottey is watching this right now,
or Jacqueline heart or,
uh,

2032
01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:23.300
some of our other representatives over at patron.

2033
01:49:23.310 --> 01:49:27.210
If you guys are watching this right now for,
hey,
this is nothing personal to you.

2034
01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:30.450
I am just doing what I think is right because you guys are not defending

2035
01:49:30.451 --> 01:49:33.600
principles that I believe are the most fundamental basic American principles.

2036
01:49:33.780 --> 01:49:35.910
We have to be able to exchange ideas with each other.

2037
01:49:36.060 --> 01:49:38.400
We have to be able to exchange money with each other.

2038
01:49:38.401 --> 01:49:41.310
We have to be able to interact with each other.
Now I get it.

2039
01:49:41.370 --> 01:49:43.620
All these other platforms are doing things.
Twitter's manning people,

2040
01:49:43.621 --> 01:49:48.190
Facebook bans,
people,
et Cetera,
et cetera.
I felt this was the right one to fight.

2041
01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:49.840
Um,
but coffee,

2042
01:49:49.841 --> 01:49:53.950
if you're watching this right now or any representative at Patrion,

2043
01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:57.820
if you want to come in here and talk about these things and,
and tell me why.

2044
01:49:57.820 --> 01:49:58.750
I'm wrong about this.

2045
01:49:58.751 --> 01:50:02.110
Tell me why the platform isn't going to do this again now I'd welcome it.

2046
01:50:02.140 --> 01:50:02.861
Would I believe you?

2047
01:50:02.861 --> 01:50:07.300
Probably not because you already told me that only manifest observable behavior

2048
01:50:07.301 --> 01:50:11.560
mob would get someone kicked off the platform and that's not what happened in

2049
01:50:11.561 --> 01:50:12.010
this case.

2050
01:50:12.010 --> 01:50:15.040
And you also lied to the New York Times and the New York Times doesn't care that

2051
01:50:15.041 --> 01:50:18.660
you're lying by saying this happened on your platform,
which it didn't happen.
Um,

2052
01:50:18.661 --> 01:50:21.490
but I,
but I want these things to be better.
That's the funny thing.

2053
01:50:21.491 --> 01:50:25.690
It's like when people,
people,
if I complained about youtube,
right,

2054
01:50:25.691 --> 01:50:28.120
people will be like,
oh,
you what you want.
You know,

2055
01:50:28.150 --> 01:50:31.450
you should just get off you too.
I said this before and it's like,
no,

2056
01:50:31.510 --> 01:50:34.720
you complain about things and you fight for things to be better so that

2057
01:50:34.721 --> 01:50:37.030
hopefully your voice can be heard.
That is,

2058
01:50:37.060 --> 01:50:40.450
that is the essence of expressing what freedom is.

2059
01:50:40.690 --> 01:50:44.260
Being a free person in a free society doesn't just mean laying there and taking

2060
01:50:44.261 --> 01:50:47.530
it all the time.
It means that you use what you can use.

2061
01:50:47.531 --> 01:50:51.430
Whatever those tools are within the context of being a free person to hopefully

2062
01:50:51.431 --> 01:50:55.540
affect things better.
So if enough of us rose up and said,
you know what?

2063
01:50:55.541 --> 01:50:58.270
Patrion we're not going to take this.
Maybe they would change their minds.

2064
01:50:58.271 --> 01:51:01.390
Maybe there has to be,
I know there are a couple people,

2065
01:51:01.391 --> 01:51:04.720
probably a patriot who have a flickering brain cell who are probably watching

2066
01:51:04.721 --> 01:51:07.000
this or watched some of the videos.
The Jordan I did or,

2067
01:51:07.001 --> 01:51:09.460
or notice that Sam left or whatever that are going.

2068
01:51:09.461 --> 01:51:11.250
Maybe this is the wrong thing and that's why.

2069
01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:15.740
That's why the people that want to d platform,
everybody are,

2070
01:51:15.741 --> 01:51:19.360
are they're afraid of ideas.
They're afraid that if you hear an idea,

2071
01:51:19.450 --> 01:51:22.010
it could completely change what you think about everything and you'll turn

2072
01:51:22.030 --> 01:51:22.870
against them.
Well,

2073
01:51:23.140 --> 01:51:26.750
you might because their ideas are often pretty bad and they don't want,

2074
01:51:26.890 --> 01:51:29.350
they don't want to defend their ideas,
so they think,
okay,

2075
01:51:29.620 --> 01:51:32.200
it's easier to just call someone a racist and d platform them.

2076
01:51:32.201 --> 01:51:33.100
Now I'm in the winter,

2077
01:51:33.250 --> 01:51:37.090
which is why it's so interesting that I see so much intellectual flexibility on

2078
01:51:37.091 --> 01:51:37.481
the right.

2079
01:51:37.481 --> 01:51:41.950
These days we're conservatives will debate and talk to almost anybody and be

2080
01:51:41.951 --> 01:51:45.250
willing to defend those ideas.
And it's almost gone on the left.

2081
01:51:46.540 --> 01:51:51.190
Shout out to Rachel to Danny to will and Mary,
you're getting a mug.
All right,

2082
01:51:51.191 --> 01:51:55.780
Mary,
here we go.
By the way,
guys,
um,

2083
01:51:56.020 --> 01:51:57.010
some people have told us,

2084
01:51:57.011 --> 01:52:01.720
do not wash these mugs in the dishwasher because it might wash away the a,

2085
01:52:01.721 --> 01:52:06.040
the signature.
I'm using a very fancy sharpened he industrial strength pen here.

2086
01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:07.780
Uh,
but hand-wash these lightly.

2087
01:52:07.781 --> 01:52:10.900
That's the best way to keep the signature on there.
All right,
we got a,

2088
01:52:10.901 --> 01:52:12.610
we got five more minutes.
Oh,
by the way,
did I mention,

2089
01:52:12.611 --> 01:52:15.250
I'm going to be on Tucker Carlson tonight talking about you're not going to

2090
01:52:15.251 --> 01:52:19.270
believe this people,
uh,
free speech and Patrion.
Uh,
so I will be on tonight.

2091
01:52:19.271 --> 01:52:22.360
I think I'm on the second half of the show.
So that's a,
what's that?

2092
01:52:22.361 --> 01:52:25.870
Eight o'clock eastern?
So I'll probably be on around eight 45 eastern,

2093
01:52:25.930 --> 01:52:30.460
which is about five 45 Pacific and a,
I mean,
look,
it's a guy,
a guy like Tucker.

2094
01:52:31.570 --> 01:52:34.900
I'm a guy like Tucker.
Uh,

2095
01:52:35.090 --> 01:52:38.590
I think four years ago I thought he was like in complete opposition to

2096
01:52:38.591 --> 01:52:40.570
everything.
I think.
I think he's shifted on some things.

2097
01:52:40.571 --> 01:52:43.780
I think I've shifted on some things and that's why I said 2018 was going to be

2098
01:52:43.781 --> 01:52:47.780
the year of unusual alliances.
Say Sam Harrison,
Jordan Peterson,
say Kanye West,

2099
01:52:47.781 --> 01:52:51.650
Donald Trump.
And uh,
and I think this year there's going to be,

2100
01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:53.720
there's going to be a quiet revolution of sanity.

2101
01:52:53.721 --> 01:52:58.660
I think that's going to be what's happening here.
Um,
oh,
again,
uh,

2102
01:52:58.710 --> 01:53:00.080
you know,
I do want to mention,

2103
01:53:00.081 --> 01:53:03.500
so one of the things as we roll people into Dave rubin.com/donate,

2104
01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:06.800
our hope is that when we build this new thing will just be able to roll you

2105
01:53:06.801 --> 01:53:08.900
right into it because we don't want people to have to sign up for things and

2106
01:53:08.901 --> 01:53:10.130
cancel things and sign up again.

2107
01:53:10.670 --> 01:53:12.770
All of that remains to be seen and we're trying to figure it out.

2108
01:53:12.771 --> 01:53:13.490
So this is just,

2109
01:53:13.490 --> 01:53:16.940
this is just giving us breathing room right now to figure out everything else.

2110
01:53:16.941 --> 01:53:21.410
Okay guys,
we've got five minutes left.
Five minutes left.
Uh,

2111
01:53:21.470 --> 01:53:24.440
Dave rubin.com/donate.
Do you want these shirts?

2112
01:53:24.441 --> 01:53:28.610
I need room in my closet back.
25 bucks a month.
Month,

2113
01:53:29.050 --> 01:53:31.880
a monthly on a Dave Rubin.
Dot Conversation doing it.

2114
01:53:31.881 --> 01:53:33.920
You're going to get a tee shirt and you want a mug.

2115
01:53:34.490 --> 01:53:37.400
We're going to give you a mug.
$50 a month.
You're going to get a mug.

2116
01:53:37.460 --> 01:53:39.380
I'm going to sign it for you or we're going to get you the tee shirt,

2117
01:53:39.590 --> 01:53:43.940
the whole freaking thing.
A Christian is getting a mug.
That's right.

2118
01:53:43.941 --> 01:53:48.080
Christian is getting a mug.
Okay.
Five more minutes.
Who else wants a Mug?

2119
01:53:49.250 --> 01:53:54.080
Um,
and shout outs.
I'm giving shout outs.
Alan,
thank you very much.

2120
01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:59.300
Um,
let's see.
Uh,

2121
01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:01.700
have you seen Tim pools coverage of Sargon and patriot,

2122
01:54:01.701 --> 01:54:04.430
especially these interview with Youtube or law?
I didn't see that,

2123
01:54:04.431 --> 01:54:07.610
but I have seen some,
I've been in contact constantly with Tim.
Uh,

2124
01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:10.430
we may get him in.
He's going to be in La,
I think the end of January.

2125
01:54:10.431 --> 01:54:12.090
We may get him in here.
Uh,

2126
01:54:12.091 --> 01:54:16.220
is there any chance you could have in AMCAP economist onto debate Weinstein on

2127
01:54:16.221 --> 01:54:18.170
his ideas?
I'm not sure which Winestein you're talking about,

2128
01:54:18.171 --> 01:54:21.380
but I assume you're talking about Eric because he does more on economics.
Uh,

2129
01:54:21.381 --> 01:54:25.820
that'll be interesting.
You know,
I did a,
um,
a public event with,
um,

2130
01:54:26.090 --> 01:54:30.410
with Eric Weinstein and you're on Brooke from Ari on Rand Institute in New York

2131
01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:32.090
a couple months ago,
which was really,
really good.

2132
01:54:32.091 --> 01:54:35.360
And they really got into it about regulation and maybe we can pull that off.

2133
01:54:35.361 --> 01:54:35.751
As I said,

2134
01:54:35.751 --> 01:54:38.810
we're going to be doing a partnership with Ari over the next couple months.
Um,

2135
01:54:38.990 --> 01:54:43.100
maybe I can get the two of them to sit down.
So hang on to that.
Um,

2136
01:54:44.210 --> 01:54:46.910
are the people reaching out to you from Facebook and Google doing it out of the

2137
01:54:46.911 --> 01:54:49.910
fear of losing free speech or these people worried about censorship?
Yeah.

2138
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:52.730
I think people have realized that,
uh,

2139
01:54:52.731 --> 01:54:56.150
what's happening at these companies is not good and they're quietly trying to

2140
01:54:56.151 --> 01:54:58.400
figure out ways to solve it.
And again,

2141
01:54:58.820 --> 01:55:02.180
I say if these companies start cleaning up their act,

2142
01:55:02.181 --> 01:55:03.320
start respecting free speech,

2143
01:55:03.321 --> 01:55:06.500
why is it that everyone that gets banned is always on the right?
You can do,

2144
01:55:06.620 --> 01:55:10.220
you can,
you can literally anyone right now watching this,
including myself,

2145
01:55:10.221 --> 01:55:12.740
could start calling everybody are white supremacists,
right?

2146
01:55:12.741 --> 01:55:15.740
I could call everybody on the right are white supremacists.

2147
01:55:15.741 --> 01:55:18.380
I could call Donald Trump a white supremacist.
I could call Ben Shapiro,

2148
01:55:18.381 --> 01:55:21.530
white supremacists and white nationalists and a KKK member.

2149
01:55:21.620 --> 01:55:22.520
I mean these things that are,

2150
01:55:22.521 --> 01:55:26.720
that are wise and they're the worst sort of damaging,

2151
01:55:26.900 --> 01:55:29.540
dishonest things you can say about somebody.
Nobody gets banned for that.

2152
01:55:29.870 --> 01:55:30.890
There's plenty of other things.

2153
01:55:30.891 --> 01:55:34.160
If you call people and people on the left do this to people on the right all the

2154
01:55:34.161 --> 01:55:38.510
time.
The other way you get banned if you do it the other way.
So this is a,

2155
01:55:38.540 --> 01:55:41.450
this is a problem.
This is,
this is an asymmetric war.

2156
01:55:41.630 --> 01:55:45.720
A shout out to Terrence and Ryan,
you're getting a mug.
All right,

2157
01:55:45.721 --> 01:55:46.740
I've got a couple more months there.

2158
01:55:46.741 --> 01:55:48.420
Can one of you guys come on and you're in hand me those mugs.

2159
01:55:48.570 --> 01:55:51.990
Let's move these last months.
I've got five more mugs there.
Let's move them.

2160
01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:55.860
I got,
I got three minutes people.
Three minutes to move.
Five bugs,

2161
01:55:56.370 --> 01:55:58.560
Dave rubin.com/donate.
I'm going to sign your mug.

2162
01:55:58.561 --> 01:55:59.640
I'm going to give you a tee shirt.

2163
01:55:59.690 --> 01:56:03.030
Then I'm going to drink a little tea and then I'm going to see Tucker Carlson.

2164
01:56:03.090 --> 01:56:06.700
We've got another Ryan for a Mug.
May I have a mug right me a mug.

2165
01:56:09.100 --> 01:56:12.580
One mug.
Look at this.
The magic of Youtube.
Oops.
That's,

2166
01:56:12.700 --> 01:56:17.260
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Wow.
You're getting the old school mug.

2167
01:56:17.650 --> 01:56:20.530
Ryan is getting to old Rubin Report Mug.

2168
01:56:20.950 --> 01:56:24.190
The big mug that I drink out of myself.
These are,
these are the new ones.

2169
01:56:24.340 --> 01:56:28.630
You're getting the big ass Mug,
Ryan.
All right,
there you go.
Uh,
holy cow.

2170
01:56:28.631 --> 01:56:32.740
Lots going on here.
All right guys.
We've got about two minutes left.
Um,

2171
01:56:34.360 --> 01:56:38.780
some then when platforms abused their status,

2172
01:56:38.781 --> 01:56:41.810
I feel powerless.
When creators like you lead by example,
I'm hopeful.

2173
01:56:41.811 --> 01:56:43.280
Thank you for taking the stand.
By the way,

2174
01:56:43.281 --> 01:56:46.250
will you vote for Kanye and 2024 good luck to you and happy new year.

2175
01:56:46.251 --> 01:56:50.750
At this point.
You know,
it's as likely as anything else.
We'll see.
Um,

2176
01:56:50.810 --> 01:56:52.760
okay.
Um,

2177
01:56:52.820 --> 01:56:56.720
have you considered having an open minded quantum physicists sit down with you,

2178
01:56:56.721 --> 01:57:00.380
Jordan and Ben to discuss conscientiousness,
truth and reality?

2179
01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:02.900
That can be amazing.
Who Do you recommend on that?
Give me,
give me a name.

2180
01:57:02.901 --> 01:57:06.830
Give me a name,
a shout out to Manuel.
I gotta move these last couple of mugs.

2181
01:57:06.831 --> 01:57:10.040
People,
Dave ruby.com/donate.
Um,

2182
01:57:11.490 --> 01:57:15.800
uh,
I read that one.
Um,
let's see.

2183
01:57:16.010 --> 01:57:19.160
Will you speak to the issue of American Legislative Exchange Council?

2184
01:57:19.161 --> 01:57:22.220
And why aren't we hearing more about the anti American policies being put into

2185
01:57:22.221 --> 01:57:24.440
place?
No one seems to know who they even are.

2186
01:57:24.980 --> 01:57:26.360
I'm going to have to include myself in that.

2187
01:57:26.361 --> 01:57:30.140
I'm actually not totally sure what you're talking about.
So hang tight.
Um,

2188
01:57:30.170 --> 01:57:30.591
hey Dave,

2189
01:57:30.591 --> 01:57:33.740
I'm a seasoned Ios developer here who can certainly help with the Patriot on

2190
01:57:33.741 --> 01:57:37.420
alternative and more.
How do I get involved?
Resume is ready.
Go Ruben,

2191
01:57:37.450 --> 01:57:40.840
report.com/contact.
Drop me a line.
We're categorizing.

2192
01:57:40.841 --> 01:57:43.210
I can't respond to all of these emails right now.
As I said,

2193
01:57:43.211 --> 01:57:46.690
I have like five jobs as is and now I'm like a like a tech person.

2194
01:57:47.530 --> 01:57:50.770
But what I'm trying to do is I have somebody that I,

2195
01:57:50.771 --> 01:57:53.680
that I trust who knows a lot about all of this,

2196
01:57:53.681 --> 01:57:55.570
who I'm forwarding all of these emails to.
We're,

2197
01:57:55.571 --> 01:57:59.020
we're putting them all in a database and I think maybe at some point I may try

2198
01:57:59.021 --> 01:58:03.130
to pull off a day where we just invite a gajillion people together to talk this

2199
01:58:03.131 --> 01:58:05.860
all out.
So if you,
if you,
if you are developing your are interested,

2200
01:58:05.861 --> 01:58:09.850
this is a good way to end all of this.
Um,
go to Ruben report.com/contact.

2201
01:58:09.851 --> 01:58:12.690
Drop us a line and,
and I promise at some point,
uh,

2202
01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:15.880
we will try to get back to you Logan.
Thank you very much.
Okay.

2203
01:58:15.881 --> 01:58:18.230
Just a reminder guys.
January 9th,

2204

Bret Weinstein and I am doing standup for about an hour and then we're doing a

2205
01:58:20.861 --> 01:58:24.970
live sit down,

On January 30th,
I'm at Irvine,

Thank you to Christopher.

Um,

2212
01:58:45.970 --> 01:58:49.960
thank you guys that really like,
I'm looking at this,
I'm sitting in a room,

2213
01:58:49.961 --> 01:58:52.660
I'm surrounded by a hundred mugs right now.
Um,

2214

you guys are making this thing happen and uh,
it's,
it's in,

2215
01:58:57.280 --> 01:59:00.220
it's humbling.
It's incredibly,
uh,

2216
01:59:02.050 --> 01:59:04.560
I'll keep going.
I'll keep going if you keep going.
I mean,
that's the,

2217
01:59:04.561 --> 01:59:07.960
that's the best thing I can say,
right?
Um,
sort of like Dirk Diggler speech,

2218
01:59:08.200 --> 01:59:10.750
when he first was winning the awards in Boogie Nights,
he says,

2219
01:59:10.751 --> 01:59:12.610
I'll keep rocking and rolling if you keep rock and rolling.

2220
01:59:12.611 --> 01:59:15.400
And that's Kinda of what I feel about this.
It's like,
let's do this together.

2221
01:59:15.401 --> 01:59:17.890
I'm one guy,
I happened to be doing this.
We,
we've,

2222
01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:19.530
there are a lot of allies out there,
there,

2223
01:59:19.531 --> 01:59:22.510
there's a lot more support for all of these ideas then you're going to hear

2224
01:59:22.511 --> 01:59:26.110
about,
because the other people have silenced everybody pretty damn effectively.

2225
01:59:26.111 --> 01:59:30.030
But maybe that's what,
uh,
that's what the beauty of this is.
Uh,

2226
01:59:30.100 --> 01:59:33.190
I want it to say this earlier,
but so did the year was ending and I was,

2227
01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:37.210
I was going away with my brother and sister for the end of the year to take a

2228
01:59:37.210 --> 01:59:38.950
couple of days off and I really was going to try to disconnect.

2229
01:59:38.951 --> 01:59:42.670
And you guys know,
I like to try to get offline when I can and then,

2230
01:59:42.671 --> 01:59:45.330
and then the Sargon thing like broke and I wasn't a,

2231
01:59:45.331 --> 01:59:48.670
I was sitting on a beach in Florida and like I had my phone and I was like,
man,

2232
01:59:48.671 --> 01:59:49.121
this sucks.

2233
01:59:49.121 --> 01:59:52.610
Like I needed to just like three or four days to just like stare at the ocean

2234
01:59:52.820 --> 01:59:55.450
and clear my mind.
But I know how important all this was.

2235
01:59:55.451 --> 01:59:57.400
And then something hit me.

2236
01:59:57.401 --> 02:00:01.390
It was like this was exactly how the year was supposed to and it was like it was

2237
02:00:01.391 --> 02:00:04.870
such a great year and everything was tracking so properly and then right at the

2238
02:00:04.871 --> 02:00:08.410
end it was like the world kind of flipped.
It kind of,
you know,
like life,

2239
02:00:08.411 --> 02:00:10.360
just life just throws you these things.

2240
02:00:10.361 --> 02:00:12.460
Life throws you a lemon and what do you do?
You make lemonade.

2241
02:00:12.700 --> 02:00:15.100
And it's like something weird just happened here.
But I think that,

2242
02:00:15.250 --> 02:00:19.810
I know that for me at least every time something weird has come along the road

2243
02:00:19.870 --> 02:00:22.270
that if I've kept my wits about myself and I've,

2244
02:00:22.271 --> 02:00:25.150
and I've been honest with myself and the people around me that we've been able

2245
02:00:25.151 --> 02:00:27.340
to make the right decisions to go forward.
I think that's,

2246
02:00:27.370 --> 02:00:28.570
that's what I see for myself.

2247
02:00:28.570 --> 02:00:31.300
I think it's probably what you see for yourself and we'll just keep going.

2248
02:00:31.301 --> 02:00:34.900
So this does feel right to me.
Like,
if you would've told me a month ago,
man,

2249
02:00:34.901 --> 02:00:38.290
you're going to be cancelling patriot and given up the 30 grand a month that's

2250
02:00:38.291 --> 02:00:40.780
on there and having to figure out all sorts of new stuff.
And we're,
and we,

2251
02:00:40.781 --> 02:00:41.111
by the way,

2252
02:00:41.111 --> 02:00:44.920
we're completely redoing our website and a whole bunch of other things.
Um,

2253
02:00:44.980 --> 02:00:47.590
I would have been like,
you're nuts.
Like that.
I'm not going to do that.

2254
02:00:47.591 --> 02:00:48.880
I'm going to voluntarily do that.

2255
02:00:48.881 --> 02:00:53.290
Like who gives up 60 or 70% of their company's revenue voluntarily.
Um,

2256
02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:54.850
but I know it's the right thing to do.
And,

2257
02:00:54.851 --> 02:00:56.500
and for the financial hit that will take,

2258
02:00:56.501 --> 02:00:58.360
even though obviously we're making some of it back here,

2259
02:00:58.361 --> 02:01:01.270
it's like where there's no risk,
there's no reward.

2260
02:01:01.271 --> 02:01:04.330
So we're just gonna keep going.
Final shout outs to Christopher,

2261
02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:06.280
to Bernadette and Michael,

2262
02:01:06.310 --> 02:01:09.760
unless someone else joins by the time I finished this sentence,

2263
02:01:09.761 --> 02:01:13.120
you are getting the last Monday of the day.
So here we go.

2264
02:01:13.600 --> 02:01:18.430
Michael is getting the last mug.
There we go.
Michael,
that's for you.

2265
02:01:18.790 --> 02:01:23.440
Um,
really,
thank you guys.
Um,
you know,
we'll,
we'll have a couple other,

2266
02:01:23.470 --> 02:01:27.130
uh,
we may do a couple of other live streams in the next week or so,

2267
02:01:27.131 --> 02:01:29.680
just so we can let people know about what's going on with the Patriot on

2268
02:01:29.681 --> 02:01:33.100
situation.
This is all unfolding,
uh,
as Jordan and I said,

2269
02:01:33.101 --> 02:01:36.410
we're going to be as open and honest with you as we possibly can as we figure

2270
02:01:36.411 --> 02:01:40.940
out all of these things.
Uh,
we're listening to you and,
uh,
you know,

2271
02:01:41.180 --> 02:01:45.980
I think,
I think that's it for now.
Stand up January 9th,
Ontario,
California,

2272
02:01:45.981 --> 02:01:50.030
January 30th,
uh,
in Irvine,
California.
And,
uh,

2273
02:01:50.031 --> 02:01:53.750
I got to stop talking for about an hour so that I can do this.

2274
02:01:53.751 --> 02:01:58.610
We've talked a relater,
so check,
uh,
check out Fox News about eight 45 or so,
