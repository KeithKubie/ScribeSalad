00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
It effects grown men, little boys and even happens to males still in utero.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.747
You know, the ability to "pitch a tent" in the morning, 
without any actual camping skills.

00:00:09.747 --> 00:00:18.057
Now that we got the one obligatory joke out of the way, we can get to the hard facts
of nocturnal penile tumescence, otherwise known as "morning wood".

00:00:18.057 --> 00:00:23.435
It turns out morning erections are part of the normal sleep cycle 
and occur multiple throughout the night.

00:00:23.435 --> 00:00:33.574
The mind and body go through stages of sleep, from non-REM stages, which gradually become deep sleep
finally followed by REM or "Rapid Eye Movement" sleep which is actually fairly shallow sleep.

00:00:33.574 --> 00:00:36.397
This cycle occurs between 4 or 5 times a night.

00:00:36.397 --> 00:00:42.030
As you enter REM sleep, not only do dreams occur, but a few physiological changes take place as well.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.536
Namely, your brain begins to shut off some neurotransmitters in an effort to regulate your body,
and in some cases stop you from acting out your dreams.

00:00:49.536 --> 00:00:54.530
One of these neurotranmitters, norepinephrine, happens to be involved with the control of erections.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.096
Specifically it causes vasoconstriction of penis blood vessels, actively preventing an erection.

00:01:00.096 --> 00:01:08.355
It is like a stop sign for blood flow.  But as you enter REM sleep, norepinephrine decreases and testosterone related actions
are now able to take place.

00:01:08.355 --> 00:01:14.096
This leads to vasodilation, or increased blood flow to the blood vessels, ultimately causing an erection.

00:01:14.096 --> 00:01:15.225
Why is this important?

00:01:15.225 --> 00:01:23.898
Well, similar to muscle and other tissue, at night this extra blood increases oxygenation,
serving as a system of repair and helping to maintain functionality.

00:01:23.898 --> 00:01:26.690
But why do we often wake up to this pleasent surprise?

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.017
Well, we often wake up just out of REM sleep, and as a result
see the remnants of this sleep stage.

00:01:32.017 --> 00:01:35.497
There is also evidence that a full bladder can contribute to morning wood.

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:41.333
The increased baldder size for the night stimulates a region of the spinal cord
which can cause a reflex erection.

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:45.477
The physiological benefit of this is to prevent you from urinating in your sleep.

00:01:45.477 --> 00:01:51.440
But most men can attest to the difficulty proposed by this conundrum after waking in the morning.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.708
Rise and shine.

00:01:52.708 --> 00:01:57.585
