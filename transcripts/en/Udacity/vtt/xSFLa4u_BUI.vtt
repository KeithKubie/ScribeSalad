00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.830
In congestion collapse, an increase in traffic load

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.510
suddenly results in a decrease of useful work done.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.890
As we can see here, up to a point, as we increase network load, there is an

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.730
increase in useful work done. At some point,

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.650
the network reaches saturation, at which point increasing the

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.140
load no longer results in useful work getting done.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.490
But at some point, actually increasing the traffic load

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.170
can cause the amount of work done or the amount of traffic forwarded to actually

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.320
decrease. There are many possible causes. One possible

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.110
cause is the spurious re-transmissions of packets that

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.150
are still in flight. So when senders

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.120
don't receive acknowledgements for packets in a timely

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.160
fashion, they can spuriously re-transmit, thus resulting in

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.420
many copies of the same packets being outstanding

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.780
in the network at any one time.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.510
Another cause of congestion collapse is simply undelivered

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.530
packets, where packets consume resources and are dropped

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.695
elsewhere in the network. The solution to spurious

00:01:03.695 --> 00:01:07.010
re-transmissions is to have better timers and to

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.450
use TCP congestion control, which we'll talk about

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.650
next. The solution to undelivered packets is to

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.490
apply congestion control to all traffic. Congestion control

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.690
is the topic of the rest of this lesson.
