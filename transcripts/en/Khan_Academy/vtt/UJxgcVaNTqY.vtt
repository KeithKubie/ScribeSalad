00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.810
Let's take a little bit of a
hiatus from our more rigorous

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.570
math where we're building the
mathematics of vector algebra

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.310
and just think a little bit
about something that you'll

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.080
probably encounter if you ever
have to have to write a

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.230
three-dimensional computer
program or have to do any

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.300
mathematics dealing with
three dimensions.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:26.880
And that's the idea of just the
equation of a plane in R3.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.120
And you know what a plane is.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.880
I mean we live in a
three-dimensional world and we

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.200
see planes all around us.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.580
The surface of your monitor, of
your computer monitor is a

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.910
plane, regardless of what
angle you hold it at.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.750
And I can draw here in
three dimensions.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.840
Let me do a little bit
better job than that.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.220
So let's say that that
is the x-axis.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.850
This is my y-axis.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.110
And then that's my z-axis.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.820
And we know what a
plane looks like.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.840
it looks something like that.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.950
I'm just drawing it at an
arbitrary angle and it goes

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.980
off in every direction.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.870
Now, the equation of a
plane-- and you've

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.430
probably seen this before.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.390
It's a linear function
of x, y and z.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:18.450
So it's ax plus by plus
cz is equal to d.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.720
If this is the graph on that
plane, then that means that

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:28.090
every point on this plane, every
x, y and z on this plane

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.085
satisfies this equation.

00:01:30.085 --> 00:01:34.150
Now another way, just as valid
a way to specify a point or

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.480
specify a plane is to give you
an actual point on the plane.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.670
So we'll say, look, that's
the point on the plane.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.800
Let's say that this is the
point x0, y0, and z0.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.420
It could be one of the instances
of this point right

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.800
here, but I'm just saying
this is another point

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.260
that's on the plane.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.940
That obviously by itself isn't
going to specify the plane.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.030
You could pivot the plane
around that point in an

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.470
infinite number of ways.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.090
But if you specify that point
and you specify a vector

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.240
that's perpendicular to the
plane-- and I can draw that

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.460
starting from here, but I can
shift a vector wherever.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.950
But let me just draw
it right there.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.210
So if I also specify a normal
vector to the plane.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.400
And I just used a word that I
haven't defined for you yet.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.280
But when I say a normal
vector, so

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.280
n is a normal vector.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.990
Or which just means that it's
perpendicular to the plane.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.450
It's perpendicular to everything
on the plane.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.680
It's perpendicular to every
vector on the plane.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.270
Perpendicular to, I guess the
best way to say it, I'll just

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.850
say it in very imprecise
terms--

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.570
everything on the plane.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.730
So if you have some vectors
lying on the plane, if I have

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.050
some vector here, let's say
that's lying on the plane.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.960
If you imagine the plane as
a piece of cardboard, that

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.450
yellow arrow I just drew-- I
would've actually drawn that

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.240
on the cardboard.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.670
It's sitting on the plane.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.280
If this yellow vector, let me
call it vector a, then if this

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.970
is just some arbitrary vector
sitting on the plane and this

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.810
is the normal vector through
the plane, we know from our

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.810
definition of vector angles that
this is perpendicular to

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:23.090
this if and only if, n dot a--
only if the dot product of

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.350
these two things
are equal to 0.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.050
And that's true for any vector
that we pick that actually

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.680
lies on the plane.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.470
So let's see if we can use this
definition of a plane, if

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.870
we can use the-- I'll call it
the normal or let me call it

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.700
the n plus-- let me
do it this way.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:54.390
The n plus some x0,
y0, z0 definition.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.950
And if I can go from that to
just the standard linear

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:07.010
equation definition, ax plus
by plus cz is equal to 0.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.420
Let's see if there's some way
based on what we already know

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.730
and using this information
that we can do that.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.350
So the way to think about it,
this point, this little blue

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.570
point that lies on the plane,
I can specify it

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.390
by a position vector.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.950
So let me set some position
vector x0 to be equal to-- so

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.470
I'm going to define x0
to be equal to the

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.855
scalar x0, y0, z0.

00:04:30.855 --> 00:04:32.630
And I want to be very clear.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.240
This specifies the coordinate
that lies on the plane.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.750
This vector does not lie
entirely on the plane.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.620
The way I drew it right here,
it's starting at the origin.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.870
It's a position vector.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.840
And the way I drew it it's
behind the plane.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.180
The tip of its arrow
sits on the plane.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.330
But this vector itself,
it's not necessarily

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.640
drawn on the plane.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.210
This plane might not even go
through the origin, while this

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.270
vector does touch
on the origin.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.300
It just specifies some
point on the plane.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.440
Similarly, let me define
another vector.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.210
I said this was some other
arbitrary point on the plane

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.800
xyz, and so you know,
this is true for any

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.380
point on the plane.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.490
Let me define another vector
x, and I'm going to define

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.710
that as x, y, and z.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.980
So once again, like x0, the
vector x-- let me draw it

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.790
right there.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.690
This vector x does not
lie on the plane.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:24.890
It goes from the origin.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.260
It's a position vector
that specifies a

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.320
point on the plane.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.240
So it goes from the origin
and it goes out.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.200
And you can almost view them
as if the plane was like a

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.060
coffee table that this would
kind of be these vectors.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.020
Let me see if I can draw it.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.470
If this was the flat surface of
the plane that the vector

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.380
x0 is going from the origin
to specify some

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.180
point on the plane.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.570
And then the vector x is also
going from the origin to

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.550
specify-- let me do it
in a different color.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.410
The vector x is also going from
the origin to specify

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.970
some other point on the
plane right there.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.870
I just took the plane and made
it flat, so you see it right

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.790
along its side.

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.240
If you could imagine sitting
right at the surface of the

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.170
plane and then you could see
that these guys clearly do not

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:13.680
lie in the plane.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.460
But using these guys, I can
construct a vector that does

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.080
lie on the plane.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.253
What does the vector x
minus x0 look like?

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.420
Well, I just drew a little
triangle here. x minus x0--

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.300
I'll do it in this
green color.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.130
It'll look exactly like this. x
minus x0 will be this green

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.270
line right here.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.670
This is x minus x0.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:46.460
We could view x0 plus this
vector plus x minus x0 is

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.590
going to be equal to x.

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.345
If I were to do it on this
graph, it's going

00:06:49.345 --> 00:06:50.130
to look like this.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.540
It's going to be like this.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.550
So let me draw it better
than that.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.250
It's going to go from that
point from x0, the point

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.500
specified by x0 to the
point specified by x.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.660
And it's going to lie
along the plane.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:07.220
So this right here
is x minus x0.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.110
I know this drawing is getting
very dirty, but you can see

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.060
that this is definitely
lying on the plane.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:20.555
So this vector right here must
be perpendicular to n.

00:07:23.592 --> 00:07:29.980
Perpendicular to our
normal vector.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:36.150
Now, if my normal vector-- let's
say my normal vector n.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.940
So this vector is perpendicular
to this guy

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:39.440
right here.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.770
It's perpendicular to the
vector n1, n2, n3.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:48.260
Now using this information, how
can we get to this type of

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.730
an expression, just this linear
equation of x, y and z?

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:58.680
Well, we know that n-- let me
switch to a neutral color.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.885
We know that n-- actually, I
didn't want to do this caret

00:08:01.885 --> 00:08:03.950
here. n is not a unit vector.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:08.170
But let's say n, so it's
perpendicular to this.

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:10.620
So the dot product of it,
we saw that right there.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.600
We saw it in the
previous video.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.640
The dot product of n with this
vector right here-- actually,

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.650
let me draw it.

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:18.740
You know, I already drew the
plane sideways, so I can

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.300
actually draw my n vector.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.010
My n vector's going to look
something like this.

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.130
It's going to be popping
straight out of the plane.

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:26.320
And I could shift it over, but
it's always going to be in

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.030
that same direction.

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:30.300
It's going to be perpendicular
to this vector right here.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.659
So n is perpendicular
to x minus x0.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:42.260
Which means that their dot
product is equal to 0.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.280
Well what does x minus
x0 look like?

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.240
So this is going to look
like this expression.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:53.090
If I write out the vectors
themselves it's the vector n1,

00:08:53.090 --> 00:09:00.570
n2, n3 being dotted with-- well,
if I take x minus x0,

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.980
that's just the scalar x
minus the scalar x0.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.740
The first term subtracted.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.950
And then the scalar y
minus the scalar y0.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.920
And then the scalar z
minus the scalar z0.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.540
We know that this whole thing
has to be equal to 0 because

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:18.880
they're perpendicular.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:25.756
And then if we take the dot
product here, we get n1 times

00:09:25.756 --> 00:09:34.130
x minus x0 plus n2 times y minus
y0 plus n3 times z minus

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:37.510
z0 is equal to 0.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:40.420
And you might not completely
recognize it, but this is--

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.960
you'll have to do a little
algebra to clean it up-- but

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:52.160
this is the form ax plus by
plus cz is equal to d.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.570
And actually, I think I
made a mistake here.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:58.110
This should be not 0,
this is equal to d.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:03.160
This is the general form
for a plane in R3.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.070
A plane is just a linear
surface in R3.

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:06.770
I shouldn't have written
a 0 there.

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:09.570
So this does take this form.

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:11.360
And if you don't believe
me, we can do it

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.020
with an actual example.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.080
So let's say we have--
I gave you my

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.590
normal-- I specify a plane.

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:20.420
If I give you a normal vector
and I tell you that normal

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:25.110
vector is the point 1, 3, minus
2 and I say that it

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:30.840
intersects the point, or a point
that lies on the plane--

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.060
The normal vector and the point
don't necessarily have

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.140
to intersect.

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.920
But let's say for a point that
lies on the plane, I have the

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.380
point 1, 2 and 3.

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.920
And I say give me the equation
for this plane.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:46.430
Well, I would say well, if I
take any other point on that

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:52.115
plane-- so if I take any other
point on that plane, xyz and

00:10:52.115 --> 00:10:56.110
it's specified by this vector,
the vector that's defined by

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:58.190
the difference between
these two is going

00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:59.840
to lie on the plane.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.270
This point and this point
lie on the plane, so the

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:05.870
difference between these two
vectors, the whole vector will

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:08.190
lie on the plane.

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:09.180
Let me take the difference.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:22.530
So x minus x0 is equal to x
minus 1, y minus 2, and

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:25.310
then z minus 3.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:29.320
I'm saying this will
lie on the plane.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.800
This is on the plane.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.230
And it's going to
be perpendicular

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.480
to our normal vector.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:44.590
So if I dot my normal vector, 1,
3, minus 2, with this thing

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:51.000
right here, with x minus 1,
y minus 2, z minus 3,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.660
I should get 0.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.910
Because this has to be
perpendicular to anything that

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:56.710
lies on the plane.

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:57.320
So what do we get?

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.990
We get 1 times x minus
1 is x minus 1.

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:04.710
Plus 3 times y minus 2.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:06.010
Just taking the dot product.

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:11.050
Minus 2 times z minus
3 is equal to 0.

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:14.380
Let's if we can do a little bit
of algebra here to clean

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:15.720
this up a little bit.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:24.920
I get x minus 1 plus 3y
minus 6 minus 2z plus

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.870
6 is equal to 0.

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:29.400
And let's see.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.200
Minus 6 and a plus
6 cancel out.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.380
And then I can take
this minus 1.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:41.540
I could add 1 to both sides and
I get x plus 3y minus 2z--

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.300
add that 1 to both sidess--
is equal to 1.

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:45.750
And there you have it.

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:49.330
Just by using the simple fact
that this is a point on the

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.720
plane and this is a normal
vector, I was able to use the

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.930
idea that this has to be normal
or its dot product with

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:58.130
any point, with any vector that
lies on the plane, I was

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:00.570
able to get this right here.

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:02.000
I didn't have to go
through this whole

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:02.700
business right here.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.450
You could have just used this
formula right here.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:11.370
You could have just said n1
is 1 times x minus x1.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:13.180
Or x0 I could call it.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:23.260
So x minus this 1 plus n2, 3
times y minus 2 plus minus 2

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:28.070
times z minus 3 is equal to 0.

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:29.700
And then if you just did
a little bit of math.

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.130
a little bit of algebra, you
would've gotten there.

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.150
So hopefully find this
reasonable useful.

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:37.230
This is actually quite useful
if you ever have to do

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:40.660
anything that involves any
type of three-dimensional

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:41.520
mathematics.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.970
And if you ever become a game
programmer this would be--

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:46.540
there's thousands of
other applications.

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:49.680
But this is kind of a useful
byproduct of some of the

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.740
formal mathematics that
we've been doing.
