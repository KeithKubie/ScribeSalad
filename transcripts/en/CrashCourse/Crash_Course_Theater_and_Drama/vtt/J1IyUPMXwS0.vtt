00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:05.909
Hey there I'm Mike Rugnetta, this is crash course theater and today

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.780
we're exeunt in late medieval Europe and headed to late medieval Japan introducing one of the world's most distinct and

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.779
Lasting theatrical styles, Noh. What's that York? No. It's no it's called Noh.

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:21.580
Yes

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.750
Noh.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.080
No, Noh is the name no, spelled n o h

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.900
The H is silent, handle it dude. Anyway, we'll be tracing Noh's origins showing how it flourished in the 14th century

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.800
And then we'll explore its staging.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.300
We'll look at Kyogen, the farcical scenes between Noh plays which act as a nice reminder that the world isn't all

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.140
Vengeful ghosts and lamenting women

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.040
We'll also look at Atsumori, Zeami Motokiyo's

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.260
Flute playing samurai Noh drama so put on your favorite spirit mask and let's go

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.669
We don't exactly know when or how theatres arrived in Japan

00:01:05.669 --> 00:01:10.000
But the mythical version goes like so. 
One time the sun goddess Amaterasu

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:17.980
Was teased so badly by her brothers that she hid in the heavenly rock cave and the world went dark.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.600
Not great, so the gods tried to get her to emerge

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.760
But nothing worked until Amano-Uzumeno, the goddess of dawn mirth and revelry came up with a brilliant plan

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:34.499
She would sing and dance while taking off her clothes, so she does this and the gods go

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.690
crazy so crazy

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.050
that the sun goddess pokes her head out and is like what's all this fuss about

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:47.129
Light returns to the world and maybe also stripping gets invented. Stripping, theater, and light a natural tree, oh really.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.429
In terms of non-mythical origins sacred dance was part of Shintoism the traditional religion of japan

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.190
particularly important was Kagura or God music a dance performed by priestesses

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.089
But in the 6th century CE, Buddhism arrived and with it Japan adopted

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:11.309
Additional forms of dance and ritual we know about some of these from a 712 CE. text called Records of Ancient Things

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.800
Sort of does what it says on the title.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.300
In 782 some killjoy Nobles nix palace entertainers who were then taken in by Buddhist and Shinto

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.760
Temples at which point worship got a lot more exciting

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.859
Maybe you're noticing some similarities with the rise of liturgical drama in the West. Noh has two more

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:33.899
immediate predecessors Dengaku, or field music possibly originated in Korea

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.299
it was associated with spring rice sowing and fall rice harvest festivals and

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:47.339
included comedy juggling and dance Sarugaku, or monkey music possibly originating in China featured animal acts and

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:55.109
Nudity more significant for no Sarugaku also included dance theater in which the chorus would speak the lines for the main

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:01.979
character when the dance became too vigorous in the 12th century Buddhist temples adopted Sarugaku Noh a

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.170
cleaned-up version of the Sarugaku as a

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.389
Teaching tool even without animal acts were still a pretty long way from no proper

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:15.440
Though the real funny moment came with Kiyotsugu Kan'nami an acclaimed Sarugaku Noh performer .

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:23.120
When he shows up Japan is structured as a Shogunate meaning that while there's an emperor most of the ruling is done by the Shogun the

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.239
highest-ranking general the Shogun in the late 14th century is Ashikaga Yoshimitsu.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:36.769
And he is big-time into culture he becomes a patron at two Kan'Ami and then a patron and lover of Kan'Ami

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.959
'he's son Zeami Motokiyo.

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.969
Father Kan'Amii manages to combine

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.970
Sarugaku Noh with stories borrowed from

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:50.580
Classical Japanese sources like The Tales of Genji and then ties the whole thing up with a Buddhist bow

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.400
Son Zeami then takes that form

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.000
Perfects it, and write some theory about it

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.520
Because I mean come on someone's got to be doing theory at your theater, right?

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.340
Zeami, also writes about a hundred of the plays

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.540
Considered Noh canon and guess what we still have 21 of them yes sources.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.480
Noh plays are short only 10 or so pages long, but they take anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.820
To perform, which may seem like a nice reasonable evening at the theater

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:27.229
But when there are five types of Noh play and court entertainment includes one of each type

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:30.439
Performances could last a but numbing eight

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.780
hours each play consists of two scenes and most involve a ghost a demon or a

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.949
Tormented human who can't rest the language is a mix of verse and prose

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.470
most of it sung or chanted

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.489
Every Noh play ends with the dance the five types of noh

00:04:46.489 --> 00:04:51.300
Play are the Kami Mono, which involved the sacred story of a Shinto shrine.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.800
Shura Mono plays are about warriors like Atsumori

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.349
We're gonna meet him soon Katsura Mono plays or wig plays are about wigs. JK(just kidding)

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:05.380
They're about ladies who were played by wig wearing men because surprise surprise dudes only.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.500
the fourth type of no play is basically a grab-bag

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.940
Though it often included Gendai Mono plays which told

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.159
naturalistic stories or the Kyojo Mono aka mad woman plays which are

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:22.940
Sad wig plays about a woman who loses a child or a lover and then goes insane.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.660
the final type the Kichiku mono or demon plays feature

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.280
Supernatural beings and have the coolest

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.220
masks I mean look at this and

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.689
Also, this Noh dramas are philosophical and somewhat

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:46.729
static they're heavily influenced by Shinto ideas about our connection to nature and Buddhist ideas concerning the

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:54.529
Transitory nature of life and the destructiveness of desire there's not a lot of action and the goal is to convey a mood

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.649
Rather than to tell a story each play has at least three characters and some have four or five

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.690
The three essential types of characters are first the Shite, or main character

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.309
This is the only character to wear a mask second the Tsure the Shite's

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.120
companion and third the Waki or witness or

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.720
antagonist sometimes the Shite is disguised in the first scene and

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:25.960
Reveals himself in the second scene sometimes as in Atsumori the Shite plays two different characters

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.530
Between subsequent Noh plays and sometimes between the scenes of one play

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:36.770
Comedy scenes called Kyogen were staged these were probably a nice change of pace because Noh plays

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.290
Aren't um?

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.989
Funny? There are two kinds of Kyogen, parodies of know which are like satyr plays and

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:51.169
scenes of everyday life based around stock characters, which resemble Roman comedies

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:56.809
But in both cases. There is one big difference Kyogen are never vulgar

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.299
They are short usually music less

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.680
And though the language is more casual than in Noh they are still very

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:09.379
Carefully performed the Noh stage is pretty rad the main part the Hon-Butai is

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.920
Roofed like a shrine and held up by four pillars

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:19.249
Jars are embedded under the stage to help with acoustics and a pine tree is painted on the back wall

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:27.920
Okay, no not enough. No  enough time for a pine tree stage right stands a bridge called the Hashigakari also roofed

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.940
This is dotted with three pines representing heaven earth and man

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.479
This is where the main characters enter and exit

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:37.729
Noh theater doesn't have scenery

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:42.890
But actors wear beautiful costumes of embroidered silk and carry hand props

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.270
The fan is the most important object as it can symbolize rain

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:54.799
Wind the Sun the moon and a lot of other things a three or four person Orchestra called the Hayashi sits at the back of

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.050
the stage dressed in samurai costumes

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.559
traditionally the orchestra a flute and two or three drums

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:06.859
Follows actors rhythms and movements in addition to the main cast a six to ten person chorus sings

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:12.290
Narrates and takes over the lines of the Shite when he's busy dancing like the Sanskrit theater

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.599
Noh acting is highly gestural and

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:22.699
codified no actors train from the age of seven there are no directors and nothing that we would recognize as

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:28.940
Rehearsal rigorous training means the actors performances must be perfect every time

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:35.330
Only the Shite are masked in most plays and that mask has one of five types. Agent,

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:40.130
Male, Female, God or Monster. Zeami who wrote more than 20 booklets

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:44.960
Explaining the philosophy and style of Noh said this about acting

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:49.610
just as the transparent crystal produces fire and water or a

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.480
colorless cherry tree bears blossoms and fruit a

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:58.130
Superb artist creates a moving work of art out of a landscape

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:03.890
Within his soul according to Zeami actors did this using three techniques Monomane,  meant

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:11.030
identifying with and embodying the character. Yugen meant lending that embodiment elegance while emphasizing the

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:17.600
impermanence of life and Hana or flower meant and dowing the performance with spontaneity

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.360
so that even within those highly systematic

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:28.340
Style a play would feel a little different every time. Noh were primarily court entertainments performed for aristocratic audiences

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.069
But unlike other cultures the Japanese mostly

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:38.960
Revered actors during the height of Noh many performers were even able to join the noble cast the samurai

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:44.240
Speaking of samurai let's turn to our a tragic tale Zeami's Atsumori.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:49.540
A story adapted from the popular tales of the Heike a Noh thought bubble, No Problem.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:54.940
The play begins as the Waki or witness dressed as a priest enters via the bridge saying

00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:01.999
Awake to awareness the world's but a dream one may cast it aside is this what is real

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:07.549
Just in case the Buddhist influence wasn't totally clear the witness says his name used to be Kumagai

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:14.719
But now it's Rensho. He became a monk because he feels guilt over killing a young warrior Atsumori.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:21.319
Rensho explains he'll take a trip and pray for his soul he crosses the stage and his journey is complete

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.820
arriving at his destination

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:30.020
He sees the Shite a flute playing grass cutter. Rensho marvels that a low-class person can play

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:33.979
So well the grass cutter encourages him to be more woke

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.640
and they talk about flutes it turns out the grass cutter is a

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:43.159
Relative of Atsumoti so he and the priests pray together and now a pigeon interlude

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.450
Where in the Waki asks a pesent to tell the story of Atsumori's death?

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:54.650
Turns out Atsumori was ready to escape a battle when he realized he left his precious flute returning for it

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:56.630
He missed the last boat out

00:10:56.630 --> 00:11:02.839
He met enemy warrior Kumagae a who admired Atsumori's bravery and elegance, but killed him anyway

00:11:02.839 --> 00:11:05.359
And then the Waki is like that's me

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:12.860
I'm Kumagai in the second scene the Waki prays before bed. The Shite masked as Atsumori's ghost enters and

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.950
Dances the chorus describes Atsumori's death

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:20.330
And there's a moment where it seems like he'll take revenge on Rensho

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:26.180
But instead he kneels and asks Rensho to pray for his soul in the hopes

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:32.209
They'll both be reborn on a single lotus petal which is the Zen version of a happy ending?

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:36.199
Thank you, thought bubble so the moral of the story is that attachment is bad

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:40.370
Even if it's two flutes and also don't underestimate grass cutters

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:44.000
we can see by its philosophical orientation slow pacing and

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:48.709
Melancholy tone that Noh has a different feel than other types of theater

00:11:48.709 --> 00:11:53.359
We've encountered so far, but there's an even more important difference unlike so much of the ancient theatre

00:11:53.360 --> 00:12:00.919
We've been learning about Noh is a living art form it is still performed today by troops. Who've inherited traditions passed down since

00:12:01.709 --> 00:12:02.990
Zeami's time

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:09.890
While it struggled in the late 19th and early 20th centuries now. It's considered an essential part of Japanese culture well

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:16.069
It's time for me to take the hurry door next time. We'll be heading to Italy where theatres briefly gets neoclassical and then

00:12:16.589 --> 00:12:18.589
Gets rude until then

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:22.880
Curtain crash-course theatre is produced in association with PBS Digital Studios

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:28.279
Head over to their channel to check out some of their shows like the art assignment and yawns, and it's okay to be smart

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.500
Crash course theater is filmed in each

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:35.869
Chad and stacey emigholz studio in indianapolis indiana and is produced with the help of all of these very nice people
