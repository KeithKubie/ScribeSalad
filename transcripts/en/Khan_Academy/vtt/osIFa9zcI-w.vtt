00:00:00.186 --> 00:00:01.092
- [Voiceover] So they tell us

00:00:01.092 --> 00:00:04.284
that Alexander has nine marbles,

00:00:04.284 --> 00:00:07.412
Emily has five marbles.

00:00:07.412 --> 00:00:08.636
And then we're asked,

00:00:08.636 --> 00:00:12.271
how many more marbles does
Alexander have than Emily?

00:00:12.272 --> 00:00:13.433
So pause the video

00:00:13.433 --> 00:00:16.405
and try to see if you
could figure this out.

00:00:16.405 --> 00:00:19.842
Now let's work this out together.

00:00:19.842 --> 00:00:20.793
So let's just draw it out.

00:00:20.794 --> 00:00:22.675
Alexander has nine marbles.

00:00:22.675 --> 00:00:24.787
So we could draw his marbles.

00:00:24.787 --> 00:00:26.380
So one,

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.840
two, three

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.356
four, five

00:00:29.356 --> 00:00:30.855
six, seven

00:00:30.855 --> 00:00:33.091
eight, nine.

00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:35.259
And Emily has five marbles.

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:37.746
One, two, three,

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:39.357
four, five.

00:00:39.357 --> 00:00:40.507
So how many more marbles

00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:42.390
does Alexander have than Emily?

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.640
Well we can see it in this
picture right over here.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.494
These are all the...

00:00:46.494 --> 00:00:51.281
So, up until this point

00:00:51.281 --> 00:00:54.437
this is the same number
that Alexander has as Emily.

00:00:54.437 --> 00:00:56.318
And then Alexander has...

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:58.362
Alexander has...

00:00:58.362 --> 00:00:59.988
We see it right over here,

00:00:59.988 --> 00:01:02.162
he has one, two, three,

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:04.843
four more marbles.

00:01:04.843 --> 00:01:06.312
Now what's another way

00:01:06.312 --> 00:01:08.231
that we could have thought about it?

00:01:08.231 --> 00:01:12.676
Well, Alexander has nine marbles

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.752
and if you were to subtract the
number of marbles Emily has,

00:01:16.752 --> 00:01:19.515
that's how much more
marbles Alexander has.

00:01:19.515 --> 00:01:21.953
That's how much more nine is than five.

00:01:21.953 --> 00:01:26.031
So you could have said nine minus five

00:01:26.031 --> 00:01:28.051
is equal to...

00:01:28.051 --> 00:01:31.101
Is equal to the four...

00:01:31.101 --> 00:01:32.322
the four marbles.

00:01:32.322 --> 00:01:37.212
That's how much more marbles
Alexander has than Emily.

00:01:37.212 --> 00:01:39.541
Let's do another one of these.

00:01:41.987 --> 00:01:44.574
Noa was mailing two letters.

00:01:44.575 --> 00:01:46.732
The heavier letter...

00:01:46.732 --> 00:01:49.751
The heavier letter had eight stamps.

00:01:49.751 --> 00:01:54.186
The lighter letter had five fewer stamps.

00:01:54.186 --> 00:01:57.854
How many stamps did the
lighter letter have?

00:01:57.854 --> 00:01:59.062
So once again,

00:01:59.062 --> 00:02:00.548
try to pause this video

00:02:00.548 --> 00:02:03.427
and see if you can figure
it out on your own.

00:02:03.427 --> 00:02:04.332
So the heavier letter,

00:02:04.332 --> 00:02:05.470
it's always useful to just,

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.392
well, what are they telling us?

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:07.606
So they are saying,

00:02:07.606 --> 00:02:11.182
just write down whatever
information they give us.

00:02:11.182 --> 00:02:14.386
So the heavier letter has eight stamps,

00:02:14.386 --> 00:02:17.251
the lighter letter has five fewer stamps.

00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:19.286
So do we know how many
the lighter letter has?

00:02:19.286 --> 00:02:20.306
Well not immediately.

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:21.631
That's what they're actually asking us.

00:02:21.631 --> 00:02:23.465
How many stamps did the
lighter letter have?

00:02:23.465 --> 00:02:24.905
But it's five fewer.

00:02:24.905 --> 00:02:26.275
Five fewer than what?

00:02:26.275 --> 00:02:28.828
Five fewer than eight stamps.

00:02:28.828 --> 00:02:30.290
And so we could write that.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.150
If we have eight stamps

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:33.681
and we want to go five fewer than that...

00:02:33.681 --> 00:02:35.098
Five fewer...

00:02:35.098 --> 00:02:36.932
Well that's going to be eight minus five.

00:02:36.932 --> 00:02:38.999
This is five fewer than eight,

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:43.503
which is going to be equal to three.

00:02:43.503 --> 00:02:45.500
The lighter letter has three stamps.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.032
Now another way you could
have thought about it,

00:02:47.032 --> 00:02:49.260
The heavier letter had eight stamps.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.887
Let's draw eight stamps.

00:02:50.887 --> 00:02:55.074
So one, two,

00:02:55.074 --> 00:02:58.214
three, four,

00:02:58.214 --> 00:03:00.914
five, six,

00:03:00.914 --> 00:03:03.274
seven, and eight.

00:03:03.275 --> 00:03:04.821
That's how much the heavier letter had.

00:03:04.821 --> 00:03:07.581
The lighter letter had five fewer stamps.

00:03:07.581 --> 00:03:08.694
Let's take away one,

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.620
two, three

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.061
four, five.

00:03:12.061 --> 00:03:14.244
And what are you going to be left with?

00:03:14.244 --> 00:03:15.786
Well you're going to be left with

00:03:15.786 --> 00:03:18.123
these three stamps right over here.

00:03:18.123 --> 00:03:22.036
This is how many stamps
the lighter letter had.
