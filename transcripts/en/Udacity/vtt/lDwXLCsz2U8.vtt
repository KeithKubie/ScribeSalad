So if you chose the sensory neurons will carry signals from our senses to the

00:00:03.625 --> 00:00:08.753
central nervous system, you are correct. Remember our sensory neurons perceive

00:00:08.753 --> 00:00:13.595
information from touch, taste, smell and hearing. It relays that message to the

00:00:13.595 --> 00:00:18.221
central nervous system, our brain and spinal chord. From there the brain

00:00:18.221 --> 00:00:23.280
interrupts that information and activates our motor neurons. The motor neurons

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.094
allow us to move and behave appropriately. So remember, we have sensory neurons

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:33.120
that send information to the central nervous system. The brain interprets that

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.955
material and activates motor neurons which allow us to move and behave

00:00:36.955 --> 00:00:38.960
appropriately.
