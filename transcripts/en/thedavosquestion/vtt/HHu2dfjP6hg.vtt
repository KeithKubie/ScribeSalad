00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
&gt;&gt; Well the thing that probably that leaders
could do that might help the world is to say

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.600
what they mean. In other words, to say that
they're going to do something and do it or

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.450
say they're not going to do something and
not do it. And that goes for politicians as

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.260
well as businessmen because it's important
that everyone should communicate very clearly.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:26.990
On the other hand, I think those that don't
regard themselves as leaders need to take

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.280
more power into their own hands. Not in the
sense of nagging the politicians and the rich

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.140
of this world to do things on their behalf
but to actually do things themselves. Policians

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.480
are very fallible people. They don't, they
tend to believe that what they say is what

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.910
happens and of course the two are very different.
So I think on balance, they should say what

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.000
they mean and the rest of us should do what
we think we ought to do rather than wait for

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.330
our leaders to do it for us.
