00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.635
Its fun to look at these old pictures once you know what they mean

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.320
y'know? at-at least that's what i come to understand

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.500
Once I kinda understand the

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.360
the underlying rationale for, i mean someone worked hard

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.280
on that, that's an engraving right? they took a long time making that picture

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.080
they're serious about it.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.980
When you understand what it means

00:00:21.425 --> 00:00:22.545
You know, all those people the-there

00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:25.455
they're prostrate

00:00:25.455 --> 00:00:26.455
 

00:00:26.575 --> 00:00:29.735
at the revelation of the law, it's like well no wonder

00:00:29.735 --> 00:00:32.165
It's like break the law! and see what happens

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:34.865
Break the Universal Moral Law man, and see what happens

00:00:34.865 --> 00:00:37.425
you know i see people in that situation, well as you all do, all the time

00:00:37.425 --> 00:00:39.515
 

00:00:39.515 --> 00:00:42.395
Perhaps me more than you because I'm a clinical psychologist, y'know.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.485
if the people I've seen haven't broken the Universal law

00:00:45.485 --> 00:00:48.460
then you can bloody be sure the people around them have

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.575
It's No Joke! like you make a mistake and things

00:00:50.575 --> 00:00:53.675
will go seriously wrong for you!

00:00:53.675 --> 00:00:56.725
and so...it's no wonder you've been

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.380
Terrified

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.120
of the revelation of the structure that governs our being

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.300
one of the things that is so remarkable about the New Testament is that

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.160
this is a other thing Nietzsche commented on.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.580
he was a real admirer of the Old Testament

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.735
Not so much of the New Testament

00:01:09.735 --> 00:01:12.625
It was a sin for Europe to have glued the New Testament

00:01:12.625 --> 00:01:15.220
onto the Old Testament,

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.260
'cause he thought the Old testament was a really accurate representation

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.720
of the phenomenology of being, its like (points finger up)

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.220
 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.920
Stay Awake, speak properly

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.660
Be honest, or watch the Hell out!

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.795
Because things will come your way,

00:01:28.795 --> 00:01:31.575
that you do just not want to see at all! And it might not just be you.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.605
It might be everyone you know

00:01:33.605 --> 00:01:36.620
and everything about your culture, that is demolished for

00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:39.595
for generations after generations

00:01:39.595 --> 00:01:42.595
Stay awake and be careful

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.515
And I think people only dont believe that when

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.620
they're being Hubristic

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.555
and i think that most people know that deep in their hearts, y'know

00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:53.105
when you get high on your horse, that happens fairly often

00:01:53.105 --> 00:01:55.940
If you have any sense, you'd think.. Jeez, well i'd better  be careful

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.600
tap myself down a fair bit.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.105
Because if I get too puffed up man somethings gonna come along

00:02:01.105 --> 00:02:03.460
and take me out at the knees. And everyone knows that

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.620
Pride comes before a fall. Its like, if you have any-

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:07.455
that's why it says in the Old Testament

00:02:07.455 --> 00:02:10.675
That the Fear of God is the Beginning of Wisdom

00:02:10.675 --> 00:02:13.105
Its like, I've never in all my years as a clinical psychologist

00:02:13.105 --> 00:02:16.095
And this is something that really does terrify me

00:02:16.095 --> 00:02:19.125
I have never seen anyone ever get away with

00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:22.185
anything at all, even once.

00:02:22.465 --> 00:02:25.405
y'know theres that old Idea that God has a book, y'know? and

00:02:25.405 --> 00:02:28.465
Keeps track of everything in Heaven, it's like okay, okay

00:02:28.505 --> 00:02:29.905
Maybe its not a Book.

00:02:30.265 --> 00:02:32.645
 

00:02:32.645 --> 00:02:35.065
But that is a really useful thing to think about because,

00:02:35.065 --> 00:02:38.085
and well maybe you disagree, and think that people get away with things all the time. well

00:02:38.085 --> 00:02:41.460
I tell I've never seen it, what I see instead is that,

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.720
Thing happens, right? Someone twists the Fabric of reality.

00:02:44.725 --> 00:02:47.205
And

00:02:47.205 --> 00:02:49.705
they do it successfully because it doesn't snap back at them that moment.

00:02:49.705 --> 00:02:52.205
And then like two years later, something unravels

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:55.475
and they get walloped, and they think, 'oh my god that's so unfair!'

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:58.265
And then we track it, it like well what happened before that and this?

00:02:58.265 --> 00:03:01.115
 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.155
 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.085
Oh, oh this! Thats where it went wrong

00:03:07.085 --> 00:03:10.120
Its this, because you can't twist the fabric of reality

00:03:10.125 --> 00:03:13.115
without having it snap back at you

00:03:13.655 --> 00:03:16.785
It doesn't work that way, and why would it?

00:03:16.785 --> 00:03:19.965
Because what're'ye going to do? Twist the Fabric of reality? I don't think so

00:03:19.965 --> 00:03:22.975
I think its bigger than you, and i think that one of the things that

00:03:22.975 --> 00:03:25.315
really tempts people was the Idea that

00:03:25.315 --> 00:03:28.285
'well i can get away with it' Its like, Yeah you try

00:03:28.285 --> 00:03:30.995
see how well that works, its like you get away with

00:03:30.995 --> 00:03:31.995
Nothing!

00:03:32.255 --> 00:03:35.335
And that is the beginning of wisdom,

00:03:35.335 --> 00:03:37.865
and its something that deeply terrifies me

00:03:37.905 --> 00:03:40.665
Ever since last september (2017) when

00:03:40.665 --> 00:03:42.955
i've come to a broader public attention One of the things

00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:45.915
i've been terrified of making a mistake, because i certainly know im  more then capable

00:03:45.915 --> 00:03:48.825
of making a mistake, and thank God so far either

00:03:48.825 --> 00:03:51.575
I've haven't made one or no ones found out about it

00:03:51.785 --> 00:03:54.525
So, but its like y'know

00:03:54.525 --> 00:03:57.295
we walk on a very thin and narrow edge

00:03:57.295 --> 00:03:59.965
and we're very lucky when things aren't degenerating

00:03:59.965 --> 00:04:01.655
into chaos or

00:04:01.655 --> 00:04:04.625
rapidly moving to far too much order.

00:04:04.625 --> 00:04:07.085
And its not a easy thing to stay on that line

00:04:07.085 --> 00:04:09.395
and you can tell when you stand on that line

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.620
because things are deeply meaningful and engaging when you're on that line But if you're not existentially terrified

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.915
about the consequences of wavering off that

00:04:17.915 --> 00:04:20.885
you are truly not awake!

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:23.575
and that's what I see in this picture

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.195
look out, man! Because there are rules and if you break them

00:04:29.195 --> 00:04:30.195
god help you.
