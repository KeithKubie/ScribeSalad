This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Squarespace.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.370
What if there was no Big Bang and the Universe
has been around forever?

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:07.480
Huh?

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.600
Hello!

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.770
I’m Ian O’Neill, space producer for Discovery
News, and I’m having a pretty hard time

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.230
wrapping my finite brain around a new model
that suggests the Universe has no beginning,

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.930
no end, no Big Bang, no Big Crunch, no Dark
Matter, no Dark Energy and that the Cosmos

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.039
is swamped in some kind of weird quantum fluid.

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.730
Seems kind of messy.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.750
This may look like some sort of new crackpot
theory, but researchers in Egypt and Canada

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.649
have used sound mathematics and physics to
potentially answer some of the toughest questions

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:36.870
in modern cosmology.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.469
And this is really exciting as ideas like
these have a habit of turning science on its

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.780
head if proven to be correct.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.569
A continuing puzzle surrounding the Big Bang
is that if you shrink the entire universe

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:49.339
down to a point -- known as a “singularity”
-- all known physics breaks down.

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:52.850
Physicists don’t like it when physics breaks
down, so the moment of the Big Bang, when

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.929
the universe was a singularity doesn’t make
any physical sense.

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:59.739
Another puzzle that continues to confound
physicists is that Einstein’s general relativity

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.839
doesn't play nice with quantum physics.

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.460
Gravity, quite simply, does not FIT with our
current quantum models of the universe -- and

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.619
that’s a huge problem!

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.329
The hunt for evidence of quantum gravity is
therefore one of the biggest quests going

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:11.510
on in physics RIGHT NOW.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.770
So, in a new paper published in the journal
Physics Letters B, the researchers propose

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.299
a model for the Universe that solves the “Big
Bang singularity paradox” and ties together

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.159
gravity and quantum dynamics.

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.009
To cut a very long and complex story short,
they revisited equations proposed in the 1950s,

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.409
and melded them with our current understanding
of quantum dynamics and cosmology.

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.060
Although it’s not a complete theory of quantum
gravity, it works quite nicely.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.590
In our classical understanding of the universe,
there MUST be a beginning -- the Big Bang

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.539
-- and there MIGHT be an end -- known as the
“Big Crunch.”

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:41.729
That’s a product of the equations.

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.509
By combining all the observational evidence
and formulating theories to help explain what

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.170
we are seeing, the classical equations spit
out a universe of a finite age -- a universe

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.280
that is nearly 14 billion years old

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.280
But by melding quantum corrections with a
different mathematical approach at describing

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.140
the universe, this new model produces a universe
that has an INFINITE age.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.289
Once compared with our observations of the
cosmos, the theoretical predictions agree

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.249
with our measurements of the cosmological
constant and removes the requirement for introducing

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:11.480
huge unknowns like dark matter and dark energy
-- the two “invisible” quantities that

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.490
we are having a real hard time explaining.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.810
But what does it mean physically?

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.300
Well, if gravitons exist (and that’s a BIG
if), the universe must be filled with a “graviton

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.300
fluid.”

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.531
Gravitons are hypothetical quantum particles
that mediate the force of gravity.

00:02:23.531 --> 00:02:25.930
But the only problem is that we don’t know
if they exist yet.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.670
Although exciting, I doubt the cosmology textbooks
will be re-written quite yet.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.510
Big Bang theory is widely accepted as it is
supported by several lines of observational

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.250
evidence -- from the cosmic microwave background,
thought to be the Big Bang’s afterglow,

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.820
to the Universal expansion that suggests all
galaxies came from a common point.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.410
However, holes in our understanding about
how gravity plays in the quantum world puts

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.590
a huge question mark over many cosmological
and quantum ideas and our current Big Bang

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.760
model could be horribly flawed.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.430
Regardless of whether there was a Big Bang
or not, this is a wonderful example of how

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.690
science works -- new hypotheses are tested
to formulate theories and observational evidence

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.350
tests those theories, regardless of how established
the models of the universe are.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.560
All we need to do now is detect gravitons
in the Large Hadron Collider… no pressure

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.560
physicists!
