00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.640
 . 

00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:00.850
 IN 

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.750
 In the last video I said the result we got for the person 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.770
 of a triangle having sides of a, b, and c lengths 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.810
 is equivalent to the Heron formula. 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.150
 And what I want to do in this video is to show you that it is 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.780
 equivalent to Heron's formula, essentially simply using the 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.990
 multiple algebraic manipulations. 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.590
 The first thing we want to do - let's just put that 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.590
 1 / 2c below the root sign. 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.170
 1 / 2c, this is the same thing as a square root 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.480
 from c square to 4. 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.910
 Take a square root of this and get 1 / 2c. 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.270
 This whole expression is equal to - instead of drawing 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.450
 roots, I will just write the square root of this, 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:48.200
 the c square on 4, multiplied by all. 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.530
 I'll just copy it. 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.040
 All this. 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.610
 Copy and set. 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.160
 So multiplied by all this. 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.160
 And of course, they must be separated. 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.960
 with a square on 4 multiplied by that. 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.390
 And then we have to close the square root. 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.990
 And then, this thing ... 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.460
 Let's just divide c square on 4. 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.960
 This will be equal to the square root. 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.940
 This will be complicated, but I think you will find it 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.620
 to be satisfactory to see how this can turn into something so 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.470
 just like the Heron formula. 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.660
 Square root of c square on 4, multiplied by a square is c 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:32.560
 square, and square to 4, minus square to 4. 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.270
 I just distribute this. 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.600
 I will write it as the numerator of a square on 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.060
 denominator of a square. 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.090
 Multiplied by a square plus a square, minus b 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.950
 a square, the whole square. 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.815
 On - if you pick up the square the denominator - it's 4c per square. 

00:01:49.815 --> 00:01:52.790
 4c per square. 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.840
 And we immediately see that with a square and a square 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.600
 will be canceled. 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.260
 Let me close all the brackets like this. 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.530
 And, of course, this 4 on this 4, this will be 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.520
 reflect in - let me write it this way. 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.490
 It's the same thing as 4 on a square. 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.850
 And instead of writing 16, you will see why 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:09.890
 I write this. 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.880
 Now I can write this again, 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.040
 as ... 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.340
 This will be equal to the square root - 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.460
 I randomly change the colors - from ca to 2 per square. 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.390
 as on 2 per square 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.780
 This is the same thing as this. 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.990
 No? 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.150
 I just write it like the whole thing in a square. 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.360
 If you pick up this square, it's c in a square and square in 2 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.930
 square on 4, minus - I will write this whole thing 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.520
 as a square expression. 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.800
 This is c on a square plus a square, minus 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.360
 b per square, on 4. 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.810
 And we lift the square and the numerator, and the denominator. 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.410
 We pick up the square and the numerator, and the denominator. 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.740
 Now, this may seem a little interesting to you. 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.120
 Let's make the brackets in a slightly different color. 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.775
 Maybe you remember the decomposition of polynomials that if 

00:03:00.775 --> 00:03:03.460
 i have something of the kind of x of a square minus y of a square, that 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.520
 decomposes to x plus y, x minus y. 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.000
 And we will use it again and again. 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.590
 Now if we call ca on 2 - x and we call this big thing 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.110
 y, then we have x per square y y per square. 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.390
 So, we can break it down. 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:27.966
 This whole thing will be equal to the square root of 

00:03:27.966 --> 00:03:34.740
 x plus y, or in this case is ca on 2 plus y, which is 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:40.960
 c on a square plus a square, minus b per square on 4. 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.020
 Multiplied by x minus y. 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.570
 So, this is our x. 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:51.370
 are on 2, minus all of these things here. 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.840
 Or even better, let's just say plus then 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.680
 just write the negative ones. 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:01.980
 So, plus c minus a square, minus a square, plus b per square. 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.140
 All this on 4. 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.180
 All I did here is that I said it was the same thing as that 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.120
 plus this, plus this, multiplied by this minus that, that 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.610
 minus - I just said the negative one. 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.770
 The c minus square, minus a square, plus b per square. 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.470
 All I did was there. 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.610
 Now let's see if we can simplify this, or if 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.870
 we can add these fractions. 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.680
 We can get a common denominator. 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.650
 are on 2, it's the same as 2ca on 4. 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.910
 are on 2, it's the same as 2ca on 4, just 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.160
 we multiply the numerator and the denominator by 2. 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.420
 And now we can add numerators. 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.540
 So, our entire expression now will be equal to the square 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.645
 root of this first expression will become - and I will 

00:04:55.645 --> 00:04:56.460
 I write it this way. 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:07.820
 I will write c on a square plus 2ca, plus a square, minus b 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.820
 a square, all this on 4. 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.900
 This is our first expression. 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.010
 And then our second expression will be - well, 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.190
 everything will be on 4, I will just write 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.070
 this now. 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.965
 Everything on 4. 

00:05:21.965 --> 00:05:27.280
 We can write this by taking a square. 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:36.030
 And then we can write this as b for a square, minus square, 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:43.490
 minus 2ca, plus a square. 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.570
 Just to make sure I have a minus a square here. 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.320
 Plus, multiplied by minus, is still minus a square. 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.420
 I have plus 2ca here. 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.080
 Minus multiplied by minus, this is plus 2ca. 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.580
 I have a minus c per square here. 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.170
 I have a minus c per square here. 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.530
 So, these two things are equivalent. 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.630
 The next thing we need to distinguish, or I hope we can 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.940
 we can see that this here - can get a little 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.690
 scattered - it's the same thing as c plus a square. 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:14.350
 Let me write this. 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:20.860
 This is equal to the square root of, I open the brackets, this 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:29.940
 here is c plus a square, minus b square, on 4. 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.480
 This is this first article. 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.020
 And then the second member. 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.920
 This is the same as c minus a square. 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.120
 So, this whole thing will be simplified to b per square 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:47.470
 minus with, minus a square, all this on 4. 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:48.910
 We have made some progress. 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.830
 As I said, this is a complex task. 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.950
 But we see some clean applications of decomposition on 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.320
 polynomials and see how strange it looks 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.160
 equation can be turned into simple. 

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.090
 Now we can use the same way - we have this one 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.770
 pattern - something of a square minus something else in a square. 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.310
 Something about a square minus something else in a square. 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:08.500
 So, we can break it down. 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.580
 I will do it in the same order. 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.120
 This will be equal to - I will write it 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.040
 a little less so as not to be out of place - 

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.310
 square root. 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:20.000
 This will be decomposed into this plus this. 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:29.510
 So, plus a, plus b, multiplied by c, plus a, minus b. 

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.850
 No? 

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.030
 That's exactly the same pattern I've done here. 

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.470
 This is x of a square, y is a square. 

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:41.760
 Multiplied by c plus a, minus b, all this on 4. 

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.260
 And then we get this. 

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.250
 This will be b plus with, minus a. 

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:50.620
 We will have b plus with, minus a. 

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:53.180
 Let me turn a little to the right. 

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:59.030
 B plus c minus a - it is x plus y - multiplied by 

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:02.640
 b minus c, min a. 

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:09.020
 Or this is the same thing as b minus with, plus a. 

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:13.110
 This is the same thing as b minus with, minus a. 

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:14.140
 No? 

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:14.570
 All right. 

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:20.370
 And all this on 4. 

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:23.910
 Now I can rewrite this whole expression. 

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:25.580
 I do not want to be out of place. 

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:30.305
 I can rewrite the whole expression as - 4e 

00:08:30.305 --> 00:08:32.955
 the work of 2 in 2. 

00:08:32.955 --> 00:08:36.380
 4 is the work of 2 by 2. 

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:40.620
 The whole of our expression is undoubtedly simplified 

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.780
 to the fact that it is equal to a square root - and this is really the last one 

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:50.560
 stage - to this one, which I can just write like 

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:55.780
 a plus b, plus c on 2. 

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.690
 This is the member there. 

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:00.640
 Multiplied by this article. 

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.480
 Multiplied by this article. 

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.340
 Let me write the simplification here. c plus a, 

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:13.200
 minus b, this is the same thing as a plus b, plus c, minus 2b. 

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.490
 These two things are equivalent. 

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:14.700
 No? 

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:19.450
 You have a, you have c, and then b, minus 2b, will be 

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:22.510
 equal to minus b. 

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.750
 No? b minus 2b, this is minus b. 

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:29.690
 So, this next member will be plus plus b plus 

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:34.330
 c minus 2b, on 2. 

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.240
 Or instead of writing it this way, let me write this 

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.570
 on 2, minus 2. 

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:43.920
 And then our next article here. 

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.180
 Exactly the same logic. 

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:55.360
 This is the same thing as a plus b, plus c, minus 2a, 

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.500
 all this on 2. 

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:56.770
 No? 

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:59.960
 If we add minus 2a to a, we get a minus a. 

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.040
 So, we get b plus with, minus a. 

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.820
 These are the same things. 

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.950
 All this on 2 or we can divide the denominators, 

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.130
 just like that on 2. 

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:10.680
 And then one last member. 

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.690
 You may already have recognized the 

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:16.500
 The heroonic formula that is displayed. 

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.570
 I did not mean Heron's rule - the Heron formula. 

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:23.050
 This article is exactly the same thing as 

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:27.570
 plus plus b, plus c, minus 2c. 

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:27.860
 No? 

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.200
 You subtract 2c from c, you get minus c and then 

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.650
 you still have a and b. 

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:34.540
 And then all this on 2. 

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.640
 You can type this on 2, minus 2. 

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.600
 And of course we take the square root 

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.540
 of all these things. 

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:52.230
 If we determine that S equals a plus b, plus c with 

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:55.560
 2, then, this equation is greatly simplified. 

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.800
 This is S. 

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.130
 This is S. 

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:01.705
 That's where S. 

00:11:01.705 --> 00:11:03.940
 And that's where S. 

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.720
 And this is also being simplified a lot. 

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:12.030
 Minus 2b on 2, this is exactly the same thing as minus b. 

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.880
 Minus 2a on 2, it's the same thing as minus. 

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.100
 Minus 2c on 2, this is the same thing as minus c. 

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:23.590
 So, this whole equation for our face now is equal to - will 

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:24.620
 rewrite the square root. 

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:30.670
 The square, square root of S - that's exactly there. 

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:33.550
 From S on 

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:34.500
 I will do it in the same colors. 

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:46.890
 Multiplied by S minus b, this is S minus a, and we are 

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:49.555
 of the last one - S minus c. 

00:11:49.555 --> 00:11:52.390
 S minus c. 

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:56.510
 We have proved that the Heron formula is exactly the same thing 

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:59.410
 like what turned out at the end of the last video. 

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:02.250
 That was quite clear. 

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:05.910
 And we just had to use some complicated algebra, 

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:08.150
 to prove it in reality.
