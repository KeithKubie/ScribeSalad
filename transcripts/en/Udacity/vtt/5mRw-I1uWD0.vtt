00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.850
This simplifies to 16x minus 8.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.000
Don't forget the order of operations.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.880
We can't combine anything inside
the parentheses right now.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.550
So the next thing we should
do is multiply 2 by 8x.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.140
And then 2 by 7.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.660
That gives us 6 plus 2
times 8 X minus 2 times 7,

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.770
which is the same thing
as 6 plus 16 X minus 14.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.475
Because 2 times 8 X is 16,
and 2 times 7 is 14.

00:00:31.475 --> 00:00:35.055
We still can't combine anything
inside the parenthesis.

00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:38.205
So now we should add or
subtract from left to right.

00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:41.585
So let's just write that
without the parentheses.

00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:44.115
We have 6 plus 16x minus 14.

00:00:44.115 --> 00:00:48.090
6 and 14 are like terms that
we can combine to get -8.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.710
And 16x stays the same.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.744
So our final expression is 16x minus 8.
