00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
In the last video we did a
couple of lattice

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.850
multiplication problems and
we saw it was pretty

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:05.460
straightforward.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.810
You got to do all your
multiplication first and then

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.090
do all of your addition.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.460
Well, let's try to understand
why exactly it worked.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.160
It almost seemed like magic.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.540
And to see why it worked I'm
going to redo this problem up

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.950
here then I'll also try to
explain what we did in

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:19.800
the longer problems.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.490
So when we multiplied 27-- so
you write your 2 and your 7

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.210
just like that-- times 48.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.680
I'm just doing exactly what we
did in the previous video.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.560
We drew a lattice, gave the 2
a column and the 7 a column.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.480
Just like that.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.820
We gave the 4 a row and
we gave the 8 a row.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.970
And then we drew our diagonal.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.640
And the key here is the
diagonal as you can imagine,

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.790
otherwise we wouldn't
be drawing them.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.130
So you have your diagonals.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.820
Now the way to think about it
is each of these diagonals

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.280
are a number place.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.980
So for example, this
diagonal right here,

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.980
that is the 1's place.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.220
The next diagonal, I'll do it
in this light green color.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.360
The next diagonal right here
in the light green color,

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.340
that is the 10's place.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.870
Now the next diagonal to the
left or above that, depending

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.700
on how you want to view it,
I'll do in this little

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.950
pink color right here.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.750
You could guess, that's going
to be the 100's place.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.000
And then finally, we have this
little diagonal there and I'll

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.180
do it in this light
blue collar.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.485
That is the 1,000's place.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.630
So whenever we multiply one
digit times another digit, we

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.810
just make sure we put it in
the right bucket or

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:39.660
in the right place.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.790
And you'll see what
I mean in a second.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.790
So we did 7 times 4.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.160
Well, we know that
7 times 4 is 28.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.470
We just simply wrote a 2
and an 8 just like that.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.640
But what did we really do?

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.470
And I guess the best way to
think about it, this 7--

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.340
this is the 7 in 27.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.320
So it's just a regular 7.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.140
But this 4, it's the 4 in 48.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.920
So it's not just a regular
4, it's really a 40.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.050
48 can be rewritten
as 40 plus 8.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.530
This 4 right here actually
represents a 40.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.730
So right here we're not really
multiplying 7 times 4, we're

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.820
actually multiplying
7 times 40.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:27.370
And 7 times 40 isn't
just 28, it's 280.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.450
And 280, how can we
think about that?

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:37.330
We could say that's two
100's plus eight 10's.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.630
And that's exactly what
we wrote right here.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.830
Notice: this column or I'm
sorry, this diagonal right

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.110
here, I already told you,
it was the 10's diagonal.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.820
And we multiplied 7 times 40.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.540
We put the 8 right here
in the 10's diagonal.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.590
So that means eight 10's.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.250
7 times 40 is two 100's.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.590
We wrote a 2 in the
100's diagonal.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.320
And eight 10's.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.610
That's what this 2 8 here is.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.820
We actually wrote 280.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:07.930
Let's keep going.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.510
When I multiply 2 times 4.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.700
You might say, oh, 2 times 4.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.290
That's 8.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.150
What am I really doing?

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.310
This is the 2 in 27.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.520
This is really a 20 and
this is really a 40.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:26.130
So 20 times 40 is equal
to just 8 with two 0's.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.315
Is equal to 800.

00:03:27.315 --> 00:03:28.300
And what did we do?

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.640
We multiplied 2 times 4 and
we said, oh, 2 times 4 is 8.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.090
We wrote a 0 and en
8 just like that.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.000
But notice where
we wrote the 8.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.110
We wrote the 8 in
the 100's diagonal.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.720
Let me use a different color.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.760
We wrote it in the
100's diagonal.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.740
So we literally wrote-- even
though it looked like we

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.580
multiplied 2 times 4 and saying
it's 8, the way we accounted

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.630
for it, we really did 20 times
40 is equal to eight 100's.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.780
Remember, this is the 100's
diagonal, this whole

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:57.900
thing right there.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.180
And we can keep going.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.270
When you multiply 7 times 8.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.100
Remember, this is really 7--
well, this is the 7 in 27,

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.100
so it's just a regular 7.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.890
This is the 8 in 48, so
it's just a regular 8.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.860
7 times 8 is 56.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.180
You write a 6 in the 1's place.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.810
56 is just five 10's and one 6.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.920
So it's five 10's in the 10's
diagonal and one 6, 56.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.020
Then when you multiply 2
times 8 notice, that's not

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.220
really just 2 times 8.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.850
I mean we did write it's just
16 when we did the problem

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.640
over here, but we're
actually multiplying 20.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.520
This is a 20 times 8.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.820
20 times 8 is equal to 160.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.460
Or you could say it's 100,
notice the 1 in the 100's

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.840
diagonal-- and six 10's.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.000
That's what 160 is.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
So what we did by doing this
lattice multiplication, is we

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.120
accounted all of the digits,
the right digits in

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.970
the right places.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.840
We put the 6 in the 1's.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.600
We put the 6, the 5, and
the 8 in the 10's place.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.090
We put the 1, the 8, and
the 2 in the 100's place.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.940
And we put nothing right
now in the 1000's place.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.410
Then, now that we're done with
all the multiplication we can

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.730
actually do our adding up.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.350
And then you just keep adding,
and if there's something that

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.840
goes over to the next place
you just carry that number.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.240
So 6 in the 1's place,
well, that's just a 6.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.610
Then you go the 10's place.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.650
8 plus 5 plus 6 is what?

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.160
8 plus 5 is 13.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.580
Plus 6 is 19.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.060
But notice, we're
in the 10's place.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:34.620
It's nineteen 10's or we could
say it's nine 10's and 100.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.650
We carry the 1 up here,
if you can see it, it's

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.860
in the 100's place.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.510
Now we add up all the 100's.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.860
100 plus 200 plus 800 plus 100.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.120
Or, what is this?

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.750
1,200.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.180
Well you write 2 in
the 100's place.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.180
1,200 is the same thing
as two 100's plus 1,000.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.120
And now you only have 1,000
in your 1,000's diagonal.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.010
And so you write
that 1 right there.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.140
That's exactly how we did it.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.770
The same reasoning applied to
the more complex problem.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.030
We can label our places.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.700
This was the 1's
place right there.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.500
And it made sense.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.080
When we multiplied the 9 times
the 7 those are just literally

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.530
9's and 7's and 63.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.780
Six 10's and three 1's.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.620
This right here is
the 10's diagonal.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.130
Then we got six 10's
and three 1's.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:30.510
When we multiplied 9 times 80--
remember, 787, that's the same

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:35.060
thing as seven 100's plus eight
10's plus seven, just

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.370
regular seven 1's.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.060
So this 9 times 8
really 9 times 80.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.870
9 times 80 is 720.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.360
Seven 100's-- this
is the 100's place.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:52.820
Seven 100's and 20-- two
10's just right there.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:53.860
And you can keep going.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.400
This up here, this is
the 1000's place.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.690
This is the 10,000's.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.020
I'll write it like that.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.050
This is the 100,000's place.

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.060
And then this was the
1,000,000's place.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.850
So we did all of our
multiplication at once,

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.320
accounted for things in their
proper place based on what

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.640
those numbers really are.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.580
This entry right here, it looks
like we just multiplied 4 times

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:24.360
8 and got 32, but we actually
were multiplying 400--

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.180
this is a 400-- times 80.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:35.610
And 400 times 80 is equal
to 3 2 and three 0's.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.280
Is equal to 32,000.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.880
And the way we counted for it--
notice, we put a 2 right there

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.160
and what diagonal is that?

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.830
That is the 1,000's diagonal.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:49.520
So we say it's 2,000
and three 10,000's.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.510
So three 10,000
and two 1,000's.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.005
That's 32,000.

00:07:53.005 --> 00:07:54.990
So hopefully that gives
you an understanding.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:58.510
I mean it's fun to maybe do
some lattice multiplication and

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.000
get practice, but sometimes it
looks like this bizarre

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000
magical thing.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.920
But hopefully from this video
you understand that all it is

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.850
is just a different way of
keeping track of where the 1's,

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.260
10's, and 100's place are.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:09.980
With the advantage that
it's kind of nice and

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.320
compartmentalized, it doesn't
take up a lot of space.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.800
And, it allows you to do all
your multiplication at once and

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:20.760
then, switch your brain into
addition and carrying mode.
