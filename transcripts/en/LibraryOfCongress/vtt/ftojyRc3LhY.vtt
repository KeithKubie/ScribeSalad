&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Dawn Lundy
Martin is the author of four books,

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.710
excuse me, "a gathering of matter
a matter of gathering, Discipline,

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.730
Life in a Box Is a Pretty Life;

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.290
and most recently Good
Stock Strange Blood,"

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.880
published this year
by Coffee House Press.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.170
Dawn received a BA at the
University of Connecticut,

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.590
an MA at San Francisco
State University,

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.410
and a PhD at the University
of Massachusetts, Amherst.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.800
She's also the coeditor of "The
Fire This Time: Young Activists

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.720
and the New Feminism," and a member
of the Black Took Collaborative,

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.460
a multidisciplinary group
that performs and writes

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.550
in hybrid experimental reports.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:13.390
Martin is a professor in
the Department of English

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.810
and the Director for the Center of
African American Poetry and Poetics

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.360
at the University of Pittsburgh.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.670
Selecting Martin's
manuscript discipline

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:40.890
for the 2011 Nightboat Books
Poetry Prize, Fanny Howe said,

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.330
"These poems are dense and deep.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.390
They are necessary
and hot on the eye.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.680
Discipline is what it took to
write such a potent set of poems."

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.390
It is I think an apt description.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.250
Though speaking in generality,
I might wager an extension.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.120
To me, the "I" of Dawn's work
might as well be [inaudible],

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.640 position:56%
a lens totally invested in a nuanced
accurate and interrogated view

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.320
of both Blackness and on a
larger scale [inaudible].

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.930
She is a poet obsessed with
the [inaudible] of words,

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.010 position:56%
both the signifier and signified but
she's also one who loves paradox,

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.610
complication, lineage,
intuitive fragmentary plainness,

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.910
and all things tactile.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.210
In Dawn Wendy Martin, I find
a brave, dedicated voice.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.510
She's one who attenuates
the storm only

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.810
to the man we'd notice how
difficult, how caustic,

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.110
how particulate storms can be.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.410
And it's her intense and strict
instruction to re-circle the poem

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.710
but really the everyday
that makes her so powerful.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.510
So please, without further
ado, let's welcome Dawn.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.660
[ Applause ]

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.000
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Thanks
so much for coming.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.300
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin:
Sure, it's a pleasure.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.310
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I had a great
few days reading your work.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.210
It is really challenging and
eye opening and unsettling.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:58.770
Let's start with -- Tell
us about how you -- Sorry.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.910
Tell us about how you made
space for yourself as a poet,

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.830
how you began to think
of yourself as yes,

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.450
this is something I
can do in this country.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.940
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: How I
made space for myself as a poet.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:21.280
I think that, you know, I've always
been a person who's attracted

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.880
to language.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.640
I was raised in a household
where my mother read to me

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:35.480
in a very persistent, consistent
way, whether I wanted it or not.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.090
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What sort
of poems were you raised on?

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.520
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: You know, so
I was actually raised on the poems

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:47.510
of Paul Laurence Dunbar, who's
a 19th century Black writer,

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:54.830 position:56%
and so he wrote both in conventional
forms, in conventional English

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.080
and he wrote in the
Black vernacular.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.110
And when I was a kid, those
poems that were written

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.110
in the Black vernacular
were the most exciting to me

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.970
because I thought they
were funny and it was funny

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.810 position:56%
to hear my mother read them because.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.520
I mean, we'd speak a kind
of vernacular, I guess,

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.920
sometimes in the household.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.630
It certainly wasn't our kind
of like everyday speech.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.390
So to have that coming
up under the surface

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.030
of my experience attracted
me to language.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:32.540 position:56%
But to make space for myself as a
writer I think was just about trying

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:40.680
to figure out a way to explore the
world, to make sense of my reality.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.340
And because I was raised with
literature, it became a kind

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.580 position:56%
of natural inclination to go towards
literature and writing as opposed

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.530
to the visual arts, which I would
love but I can't draw at all.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:00.420
If I play Pictionary, all
of my, all of the things

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.720
that I draw are stick figures.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.220
So it's intensely frustrating
for anyone who's my partner

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.570
because they're like, that's
the same thing you drew before.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.920
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: So you brought your
own perspectives to your experience

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.960
when you wrote but you also
have to invent your own forms,

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.780
which a lot of other
poets did not have to do.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.250
They wrote poems that look
like the poems they read.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.300
You wrote poems that didn't look
anything like what you read.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.600
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: Right.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.900
I did once, I did once upon a time.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.170
I wrote poems that
looked exactly like most

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.730
of the forms that I had read.

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:36.280
My first series poetry teacher was
Marilyn Nelson [assumed spelling]

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.290
who is a formalist of sorts,
kind of a new formalist.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.560
And so we were writing in
traditional forms, you know,

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.470 position:56%
villanelles and sonnets and you know
she was really, really instrumental

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.660
in teaching me the kind

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.880
of foundational components
of what makes up a poem.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:04.410
And then at some point I
started to get like feel itchy

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:11.030 position:56%
within those constraints and started
kind of edge my way out of them.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.930 position:56%
So that's when the invention
started to come but I actually think

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:19.400
that in order to really innovate,

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.960
one has to know what they're
innovating in response to in a way.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.260
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes,
I totally agree.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.020
Yes. And your friend Walt
Whitman and other people

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.390
that were doing expansive
things in the 19th century

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.030
and then the 20th century too.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.330
But why poetry?

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.730
Why not write essays or fiction?

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.640
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: That's
a really good question.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.590 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Because you have a
lot to say, a lot of critical things

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.740
to say, I can easily see you at
home and other forms, other genres.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.360
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: I do write
essays but my first love is poetry

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.350
and I actually can't say why.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:07:00.110
In some ways as a young person
I was trying to figure out,

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.710
a young person meaning like in
junior high and high school,

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:13.580
trying to process experiences
that were traumatic and drawn

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.200
for some inexplicable
reason to poetry.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.900
At that point, by the
time I got to high school,

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.550
it wasn't as if we were
reading poetry in high school.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.160
It wasn't as if somebody came and
said, oh you should write poems.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.700
No one told any of
us to write poems.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.530
At that point it was kind

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:33.010
of I wasn't listening
to my mother anymore.

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.020
She wasn't reading to me.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:41.430
So I think that part
of the reason I was --

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.120 position:56%
I mean, if I kind of look back,
like I don't know what was happening

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.990
in that moment, to kind
of like be a frustrated,

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:52.670
rebellious 16-year-old
sitting down and writing poems

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:55.530
when I really wasn't
reading that many poems,

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:58.050 position:56%
it feels like a strange thing to do.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:06.350
But now if I look, I think you know
the language of poetry is a kind

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:11.290
of terse figuring out and
it may be what I needed

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:13.030
to survive that particular moment.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:18.760
And maybe somehow instinctually
in a way that is beyond me,

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:26.280
I kind of knew that, but yeah,
it's a difficult question to kind

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:30.160
of have an absolute answer for it,
to really nail down in that way.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.460
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Well,
that's a good answer.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.300
Identity is perhaps your
most fascinating subject,

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:36.030
a subject you return
to again and again.

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:41.230
The I that is me lies forever
in the mute mouth of the image.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:44.320
That's a line you can just
think about for a long time.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.780
This syntax, their syntax,
one definition of this body,

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:53.680
when the I speaks, it speaks into
another speech and this is labor.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.780
Talk about that labor of poetry,

00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:00.160
speaking in this other
language, their syntax.

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:06.530 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: I mean, poetry
already, whether it be conventional

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:10.210
or experimental, whether it
be within a certain tradition

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:14.480
of poetry is already speaking
a very elliptical language.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:20.490
You're telling a story and very
often in a short space and time.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:25.170
And so you're making
it, you know, concise.

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:26.870
You have to take certain leaps.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.340 position:56%
You have to figure out what to leave
in and what to include in order

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:34.480
to make that story happen.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:43.990 position:56%
The labor of the speaker for the
work that I've been doing is a labor

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:47.970
to speak a kind of fragmented self.

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:49.380
That's where it begins.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.770
And I talked about personal trauma.

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:58.370
The way that I think about trauma
and the way that I was able

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:05.590
to process sexual trauma that
happened to me when I was a kid was

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:12.370 position:56%
through attempting to kind of cohere
myself on the page or something

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:16.540
and that became like
an impossible task.

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.120
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Like when
you can't stop doing?

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:22.160
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: Yes,
it's reiterative in that way.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:28.130
One keeps kind of coming back
to this struggle to speak

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:30.750
or cohere and it's impossible.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:36.730
So that's why all of those kind
of stammering around the I,

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:42.750
the labor of the I, the,
yeah the work that it takes

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.470
to speak one's self begins in that.

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:49.500
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You say, every
day it happens or doesn't happen.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:53.230
The I struggles to become a
part of the wreaking body.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.160
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: Yeah.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.460
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: How do
you know when it happens?

00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.980 position:56%
How do you know when the poem works?

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.040
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: How do
I know when the poem works.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.720
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: How do
you know when it's done?

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.020
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: Yeah.

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.320
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You could
fiddle with it forever

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.320
and never publish a book.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.620
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: That's true.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:13.190
I don't -- Some people really,
really struggle to kind of figure

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:16.520
out lie, oh, when is it done
or is this poem like perfect,

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.510
when can put it into the world.

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:24.080
I'm a little bit opposite,
where I kind of like to put it

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.360
into the world a tiny
bit prematurely.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.660
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Nice.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.440
Read one for us, would you?

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.150
I'll let you get a drink --

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:35.300
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: I
like the ragged edges.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.600
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: These?

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.900
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin:
No, of the poem.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.200
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The poem, oh yes.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.500
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: Those, too.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.870
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: This on page 71.

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:44.170
Thank you.

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:51.490
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: Untethered

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:55.860
from happenings rooted
to temporality.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:12:00.120
Untethered from happenings
rooted to temporality.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:04.990
The I is made of many
arches and windows.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:12.330
Enter this structure, the entrances
into the many houses of God and

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:19.040
yet each morning a fireheart
grief coming out of sleep,

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:25.300
the listening to the smoke as it
fills and weeps inside the chest,

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:31.560
choking strength out,
hands weighted, dangling.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:37.540
We wonder where else it
lives before it fills us up.

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:44.290
We assume it comes inside through
the hole that promises invasion.

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:49.190
This layering of forms pushes
you toward abstraction.

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:52.750
We have stolen madness
from the White people.

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:58.320
An angry white man will call
us a crazy bitch in a text.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.910
But we have long done been free.

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:05.340
Coffee is brought to our
bedside on a silver tray.

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.520
We are un-representable.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.080
We sip into the grief mouth.

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:13.770
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Thank you.

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:18.770
The I is made of many
arches and windows.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:27.180 position:56%
Such a paradox to think of ourselves
as being portals, as being parts

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:30.330
of architecture and
then you conclude

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:33.420
by saying we are un-representable
even

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.950
as you try and represent yourself.

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:36.550
That is sort of a paradox
you through again

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:37.850
and again in your poetry.

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:40.150
There's another one here
I'd like you to read.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:46.050
Page 47.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:56.260
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: Always the
I is fissure recklessly yearning

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:01.310
for its whole sense of
wholeness like a potato.

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:07.180 position:56%
We walk backward into a room because
we want to restate our thoughts.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:11.830
All the brown skins are glowing
in this light and no one is afraid

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:18.020
where all joyous but it's difficult
to tell if the joy is real joy

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.890
or if it's just lack of fear.

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:25.260
What kind of understanding
will sink into the body?

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:29.430
It's just one body despite
other previously stated facts

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:32.830
and when it feels something,
it really does.

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:35.860
It changes though and it grows up

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:41.690
and looks completely
different in the face.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:42.990
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Very lovely.

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:47.420
The I is fissure, recklessly
yearning for its whole.

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:53.450
You seem like a poet who is
fundamentally skeptical of language

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:55.860
but doesn't have any other choice.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.160
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: That's true.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.680
It's it paradox.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.100
It's a paradox.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.580
I'm always thinking
about or talking about,

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:03.880
I talk about it with my students.

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.770
I'm like, okay, we know
that language is flawed.

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:10.340
We know that language
sometimes doesn't do the thing

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.390
that we need it to do.

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:16.410
In the example, I -- A very simple
example I give to my students is,

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:21.190
you know, like if you're having
a fight with your boyfriend

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:23.670
or girlfriend or significant
other and you're trying

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:25.950
to convey something to them and
they're trying to convey to you

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:29.550
and you're just like
desperately trying this

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:34.320
to make this understanding
happen in language but, you know,

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.540
it's kind of going like this,
like neither person is able

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:41.020
to really take in the
thing from the other person

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.320
and they're like, oh, yeah, yeah.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.620
Language isn't working.

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:48.810
You know, so I am skeptical
of language but then I think

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:53.930
that in my case it's the
tool that I use in order

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:56.760
to try to get to something.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:00.310
Sometimes I think that
that failure in language is

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:04.210 position:56%
where it's most successful in a way.

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:06.700
And the example I often give is

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:12.040
from Steven Mahler Maye
[phonetic] whose son died, I think,

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:15.980
at 6 years old and he was trying to
write these poems about the death

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:20.000
of his son Anatole [phonetic]
and he just couldn't do it.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.600
So he filled up his notebook
with, you know, kind of fragments,

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:28.990
lots of [inaudible] dashes and then
he would try again and try again.

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:34.870
and I think it was Paul Auster who
first translated those fragments

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:39.510
and published them in a posthumous
collection but when you read

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:42.490
that posthumous collection,
all of those failures,

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:46.600
the grief that you
feel after reading all

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:51.160
of those attempts is so profound.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:55.350
So even, you know, so, yeah,
language, I'm skeptical.

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:58.340
Yes, it sometimes doesn't
convey what we need it to convey

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:05.390 position:56%
but on the other hand, you know, the
art I think of manipulating language

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:10.430
in that process and
sometimes those failures,

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:14.150
you get exactly the feeling
that you need to kind of convey.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:15.450
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:18.030
Yes. You said in one interview,
[inaudible] clarity occur,

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:22.050 position:56%
they do so by happenstance, circling
so close around and around a thing.

00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:24.500
You touch it as if by accident.

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:27.650
You can feel that happen
in your poems

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:29.810
but of course that's
just an illusion.

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:31.580
The poem is not in
fact happenstance.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.310
It's not an accident.

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:34.770
It's fixed on the page.

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:36.210
It's revised.

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:38.740
It's re-seen and yet
it still maintains

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:40.990
that sense of the accidental.

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:45.170
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: The
accidental does sometimes happen.

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:46.680
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And you leave it?

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.270
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin:
Sometimes I do if it works.

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:54.400
If it's an accident that doesn't
work, sometimes the accident,

00:17:54.400 --> 00:18:01.060
I think some of the poets I'm
interested in, like Susan Howe

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:04.470
and Lauterbach and other
kind of poets interested

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:09.750
in the laboratory yeah, you
leave the accident when it works.

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:11.050
Yeah.

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:12.980
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: In one poem
you write about the need

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:16.050
for un-recognizable speech,
resisting the tyranny

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:18.870
of the prosaic, the
beautiful, the poetic utopia.

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:22.940
I love that, the tyranny
of the prosaic.

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:24.450
What do you mean by that?

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:25.840
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin:
What was the last part?

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.170
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The
tyranny of the prosaic,

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:28.840
the beautiful, the poetic utopia.

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:33.480
Those are the things
you're trying to resist.

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.800
It's not fair for me, is it,

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.720
to pick out these fragments
and throw them at you?

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.060
Things you wrote years ago.

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:44.530
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin:
I think it's still --

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:49.700
What I am distrustful
of in some ways is

00:18:49.700 --> 00:19:00.150
when somebody sings a
horrific song into my ear.

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:12.090
So, you know, I admire the
craft of lots of lyric poetry

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:16.300
but sometimes the story feels
like it needs something else

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:20.920
and I don't trust the lyric
quality of that story.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.220
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Too polished?

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.520
Too pretty?

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.820
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin:
It's too polished.

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:26.120
Maybe too pretty.

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.420
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Where does
language go limp, break apart,

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.460
fall into pieces, stammers,
glimpses,

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:32.370
that's what you're looking
for, where does the --

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:36.290
Where do the black
marks make up letters.

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:41.200 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: There was like
a song in the '90s that was turned

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:45.930
into a dance song and it
was like "she's homeless,"

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:47.660
you don't the song,
"she's homeless."

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.790
And then it was like turned into
a dance song and so you'd go

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:53.380
out dancing and, you know, it'd
come on and everyone's dancing.

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:58.030
"She's homeless," which is
like a horrifying thing.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:00.040
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:06.030
You're so caught up in the
beauty and emotion of the music,

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:09.660
you forget to listen
to the actual lyrics.

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:17.600
But yeah, so sometimes I think
like the stammer, the guttural,

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:22.820
the sound, kind of
cacophony of speech, you know,

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:29.980
that has a meaning too,
that has a register.

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:36.130
That gives you a feeling in your
body as a reader, as a listener.

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:38.810
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Maybe
truer in some sense.

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:43.000 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: Maybe, in some
cases, not in every case, I think.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.300
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Read
this poem on page 37.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:58.560
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin:
This one I've read before.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.550
There are poems I'm like, the
first poem that you had me read,

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:04.490
I was like, I haven't
read this in so long.

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:07.350
The proposition that
compels the book.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:11.480
The proposition that compels
the books is already flawed,

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:16.290
hovering somewhere
between memory and fantasy,

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:18.930
repetition and desperation.

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:20.840
I know how you'll cock your head.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:25.930
You'll ask, what is memory but what
I mean is that any existence inside

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:29.990
of both loss and abundance
feels impossible.

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:32.540
You can't have your
cake and eat it too.

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.890
Don't rob Peter to pay Paul.

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:38.220
Somehow after all these
years I'm still alive.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:41.760
I cannot stand to exist
against the [inaudible].

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:46.030
I'd rather be a monster than
live inside of your cereal box

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:49.320
and I was a monster, wasn't I?

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.410
Did I grin when you suffered?

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:55.660
As an estimation of justice,

00:21:55.660 --> 00:22:00.120
that night in question how
an infection entered my pussy

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.820
and got hold.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:05.040
Like you, I am unforgiving.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:10.570
It might be a perversion of my
blood inherited like a sore.

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:14.890
What language my grandmother
spoke I cannot tell you.

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:20.490
On the census records from
1903, the word "laborer."

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:23.200
My mother is crippled
and I will live

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:27.090
in her place [inaudible]
and hegemony.

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:31.310
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The way
that poem moves from talking

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:34.320
about something fairly abstract,
the proposition of a book,

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:38.300 position:56%
down to your body, to your genitals,

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:45.090
there's a strange connection
you draw between those things.

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:46.390
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: So, right.

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:49.630
The poem begins in this, there
are many places in this book

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:51.710
where I'm kind of thinking
about the artifice

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:54.530
and the apparatus of
the book itself.

00:22:54.530 --> 00:23:03.380
I'm particularly thinking about how
Black writers are often compelled

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:06.420
in some way to write about
blackness in a particular way.

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:09.560
So this book is a kind of
resistance in some way of that.

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.740
And so that's where it begins.

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:18.120
And then it goes into this kind
of surreal place when of course,

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.930
you know, nobody asks
what is memory.

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:22.230
I know you'll ask.

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:23.530
I know what you'll ask.

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:24.830
You'll cock your head.

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:26.480
You'll ask what is memory but
most people won't ask that.

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.490
I just want people to
think about that question.

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:38.940
And so then it gets to this kind
of bigger story and lands actually

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:40.990
on the place where
it's supposed to land.

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:45.350 position:56%
It begins in the question of writing
the black book and then it ends

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:48.950
in the actuality of writing
like my grandmother's history

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:52.910
and my mother's history, my
mother's present, actually.

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:54.930
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And that's
an act of resistance?

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:57.550
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: It is a kind
of act of resistance because I,

00:23:57.550 --> 00:24:04.990 position:56%
so in one way I want to say that one
of my basic questions around poetry

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:08.590
and poetics is how you
tell the same story.

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:13.700
How do you tell a story that's
been told over and over again?

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:19.690
How do you write a book
about that has, you know,

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:22.400
as an [inaudible] history, a
family and racial oppression,

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.790
these are books that many
people write these books

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:26.150
and we keep writing
over and over again.

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:30.550
So what are the ways to get
at that story, to see us,

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:34.640
to get us to see it
freshly and newly?

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:41.090
And so really there's this like
meta gesture in this book to say,

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:44.060
to really kind of raise that
question of what does it mean

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:48.670
to include blackness and Black
identity in a book, how do we do it

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:55.830
in a way that's unfamiliar to us,
how do we get us to pay attention

00:24:55.830 --> 00:25:00.900
to it in a different way
because I think that all

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:05.570
of these artistic artifacts
that we as poets and writers

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:10.980
and visual artists put out into
the world help to make reality.

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:15.630
But I think sometimes when we hear
the same note or we hear reality

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:21.750
or history in the same note then
our ear becomes kind of deaf to it.

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:27.930
And so, right, so you know,
resistance but also a kind

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:32.040
of philosophy around
innovation that you have

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:36.330
to keep remaking something
new, you know,

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:41.460
in the words of the modernists,
in order to kind of it

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:47.000
to have a jolting effect
so that we can participate

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:56.850
in remaking reality instead of
I guess becoming a part of the,

00:25:56.850 --> 00:25:59.010
you know, regimes of
oppression or capitalist regimens

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:05.850
or whatever unwittingly, more
active in our art making.

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:07.410
Long answer.

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:09.510
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: No.

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:13.630
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:21.020
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: Ask
Dawn to read this [laughter].

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:26.040
What I will say to
you will not be heard.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.310
It will be unnatural.

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:35.050 position:56%
It will be like something opening
up a row of corpses, proportionless.

00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:40.700 position:56%
I want to tell you my perennial
gracelessness of that epithet hunger

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:44.630
of a joy that is neither
sadness nor joy,

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:48.680
a joy that is a rung
of teeth say something.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:56.360
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The irony there
is of course that we do hear you

00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:01.020
because of the strangeness of
those images, the startling nature

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:03.380
of those words, when
you say we're not going

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:05.480 position:56%
to hear you, we do in fact hear you.

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.090
It is something unnatural.

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:08.700
It is something proportionless.

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:11.940
It's not graceless.

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:21.580
All the protests over the last
few years, maybe the last year

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:26.710 position:56%
and the response from the right make
me really question what you said.

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:31.340
I think a lot of Americans have
never heard this story before.

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:33.330
They're not getting
tired of the story.

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:35.740
They still haven't heard it once.

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.040
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: Which one?

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.550
Which story?

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:43.240
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The story of what
people of color have experienced

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:46.070
in this country over the
last 300 or 400 years.

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:50.830
This idea that we're going
to jump to colorblindness

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:55.410
that they just haven't heard this.

00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:59.010
When they come back and say things
like, well, don't all lives matter,

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:01.150
you just realize they're just,

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:04.830
there's just such an
unbridgeable gulf in this country

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:07.230
between what some people
have experienced and realized

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:09.550
and other people haven't.

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:12.500
It's just exhausting.

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:15.310
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: Yeah,
you know, I wonder if it's

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:19.510
about the kind of moment that's
happening now where there's

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:27.590
like this like linguistic
breakdown, where language,

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:31.390
I think in particular,
like there's a reality,

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:33.540
we all see the same reality.

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:42.400
We see the same action, the
same body doing what it's doing.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:47.430
But we make an entirely
different meaning through language

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:51.700
about that action depending
on our perspective,

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:55.260
depending on our ideology.

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.740
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's
never been clearer I think

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:58.040
than in the last year.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.340
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: Right.

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:03.210
So I mean, I think, you
know, it's hard to figure

00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:08.280
out like what it means to tell a
story in this particular moment

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:14.840 position:56%
because you can tell the story and
then somebody else retells the story

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:20.250
in a way that's completely
unfamiliar to the story itself.

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:22.520
So I don't know.

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.390
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: A story came
out today about how the use

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:27.460
of body cameras on police hasn't
made any difference at all.

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:30.280
I think a lot of us thought that
once we got the actual evidence

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:34.800
that behavior would change
but no, because it's thought

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.320
to determine people's
actions and experience.

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:42.510
It's not images and they can
think whatever they want.

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:44.810
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: It's true.

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:55.140
I do think that there's a way in
which, you know, perhaps like,

00:29:55.140 --> 00:30:01.590
you know, if there's a way out
of -- So my friend and colleague

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:08.390
and collaborator, we're working on
a book together, Erica Hunt writes

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:11.960
about normative language and
she says it produces normative

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:16.250
like realities and so one
of the powers of innovation,

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:26.490
even just messing with syntax,
can perhaps trick us a little bit

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:28.750
into something else, you know,

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:34.600
Like a grammatically correct
sentence is kind of dictatorial

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:38.520
in the way in which
it kind of urges us

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:41.680
into a particular kind of knowing.

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:46.810
So maybe, you know, switching words
around or messing with syntax,

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:52.310
maybe that's a way of kind of
helping us, to trick us and we need

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:55.020
to be tricked, tricked
into see something new.

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.900
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Tricked
into sympathy, into empathy.

00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:59.650
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: Yeah,
exactly, tricked into empathy.

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:01.880
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Could you read
poem number five, tab number five.

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:04.180
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: Sure.

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:22.880
This is actually kind of excerpted
from a notebook or journal.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:28.590
I have been writing all my adult
life about the irretrievable.

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:33.920
Often the same image appears
to me and finds language

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:36.410
in the poem resembling language

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:41.590
in some other poem
stroking the same wound.

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:47.650
The image is of the hand
outstretched, fingers pulsing,

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:52.300
sometimes into blackness,
a wandering depth.

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:58.730
Other times just short of the
thing the hand needs to touch.

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:00.940
The thing disappears.

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:04.260
The hand begs and begs.

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:09.170
I let the repetition occur
across writings as layers,

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:13.850
minute variations on a
writing through time.

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:19.630
Your body is spinning in a room
without furniture, white walls.

00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:25.730
You look out onto a stark
beach, ocean with storm surges,

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:32.510
waves too far back and too far in
against shore, caught at the window

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:36.240
by this smallness of
your own existence.

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:40.380
You have the urge to
wander but cannot.

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:43.490
No feeling of a body present.

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:45.970
Instead, inevitability.

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:50.460
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That image of
the hand stretching out over

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:54.190
and over again, never reaching
what it's grasping for,

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:57.860
that's a very personal
image for you?

00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:00.530
It's an image of your
work as a writer?

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:03.240
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: It's
really kind of a reading

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:06.790
across my work as a writer.

00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:09.960
There's often the thing
that can't be accessed,

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:14.950
the thing that can't be touched,
but the interesting thing

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:20.410
about that particular piece for me,
just now like being reminded of it,

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:26.160
is that I went to see this
psychic -- It wasn't a psychic.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.460
It was a shaman.

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:28.760
I went to see a shaman.

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.490
I don't actually believe
in psychics or shaman

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:34.490
but I got to them all the time.

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:36.110
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: So
you kind of believe.

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:39.470
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: I just want
to see what's going to happen.

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:44.160
I mean, I guess I believe it when
it sometimes in the moment I'm kind

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.460
of like, oh, this is great.

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:46.760
I'm totally believing it.

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:48.060
Anyway, so I go.

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:50.780
I think nothing is going to happen.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:53.620
I go to see the shaman
in Austin, Texas.

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:55.880
A friend of mine said I
should go see this guy.

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.180
He's in a trailer.

00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:59.600
It's only $40, which is amazing.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:00.900
So I go in.

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:06.470
You know, he's like, okay,
you're just going to lie here

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:09.740
and he does this kind of
like guided meditation.

00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:11.200
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Does he touch you?

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.500
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: No, no.

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.660
It's just kind of like
a hovering, you know.

00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:18.470
I can kind of feel his presence
a little bit but not really.

00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:20.260
And he says some things.

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:21.560
He's kind of like, you know,

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:26.120
go to a place where you feel
comfortable or something.

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:27.860
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It
wouldn't be that trailer.

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:29.590
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin:
Well, that's the thing.

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:32.760
I know, it wouldn't be the trailer.

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.940
But so my friend who had done
this went on this whole journey

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:37.240
and she told me about it.

00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:38.700
It was like a psychedelic
trip or something.

00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:40.830
And I was like, wow,
I want to do that.

00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:45.060
And I go and the only image I
have, I have this image of being

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:48.190
in this beach house that
has all white walls,

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:51.960
lots of windows but
there's no way out.

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:57.140
And besides the black dragon that
I saw for the first five minutes,

00:34:57.140 --> 00:34:58.730
that's the only, my only experience

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:05.140
for like the next 40 minutes is
walking around this beach house

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:09.950
with white walls and windows
with like no doors out.

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:16.960
And for some reason in my
journaling or writing about that,

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:24.460
I kind of thought about the way
in my poetry where there is kind

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:28.140
of like unreachable thing that's
something that I'm trying to touch,

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:32.140
something that I'm trying to touch
with language or these images

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:39.460 position:56%
of something that's just beyond also
happening in a way I guess in this

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:44.150
like meditative state,
in this trailer,

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:46.040
guided by shaman in Austin, Texas.

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.940
So I just put the two together.

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:49.240
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Wow.

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:50.540
Let's stand up and turn around.

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:51.880
It's not an intermission.

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:54.220
It's not an intermission.

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:55.520
You cannot leave.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:56.820
Just stand up.

00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:58.120
Turn around.

00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.420
Sit back down.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:21.740
We're all just little humans as if
from a dream, as if without form.

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:28.130
A useable body must
demonstrate its use.

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:31.950
This is what a woman's body
is, an effort in covering

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:37.570 position:56%
or not covering, a way toward exits.

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:39.830
A boy is not a body.

00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:41.210
A boy is a walk.

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:43.170
That is my favorite line.

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:51.280
I just think that is such an
amazingly concise and profound line

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:55.150
about gender, about identity
in just so few words.

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:56.450
A boy is not a body.

00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:58.470
A boy is a walk.

00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:02.410
Awareness of being in a female
body is a tinge of regret.

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:09.020
A body is a piecemeal accumulation.

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:13.110
I've thrown in a bunch of phrases
from all across your poems at you

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:17.490
about what the body
is and the tension

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:20.510
between the body and identity.

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:23.960
Can you talk about that
and your concept of it?

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:28.940
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: Yeah, I mean
I think that a lot of my work is

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:34.230
about trying to work through those
sets of questions around the body

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:39.870
and identity and how we know who
we are, like how we know ourselves,

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:43.060
how we recognize ourselves,
where we feel comfortable,

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:47.340
where we don't feel
comfortable and why.

00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:54.540
And, you know, part of it is
really a kind of a thinking

00:37:54.540 --> 00:38:02.460
through in poetry maybe but
a kind of forwarding maybe

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:07.680
or not forwarding but a thinking
through of Du Bois's notion

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:12.840
of double consciousness but, you
know, not only as it pertains

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:17.270
to blackness but as it
pertains being a human.

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:22.840
I was actually writing about
this today in this essay

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:30.450
that I just finished about how we
know ourselves is really predicated

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:35.900
on how others encounter us.

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:40.570 position:56%
And sometimes that encounter is like
legible, like sometimes you know,

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:44.600
they're kind of like, hi, you know,
friend, I recognize you, I see you,

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:48.450
you know, in that way and
sometimes it's confusing

00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:54.720
and sometimes it's hostile and
sometimes it wrong, you know,

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:59.980
the interpretation of
oneself, but we as people,

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:04.810
as human beings aren't
free from that encounter.

00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:08.880
And that encounter becomes,
I think, and I don't know

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:11.910
if Du Bois says this but this is
what I believe, it becomes a part

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:16.050
of who you are, all of those
encounters become a part

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:19.250
of who you believe yourself to be.

00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:25.080
And so then in some ways
authenticity becomes really kind

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:31.190
of a difficult notion
or something or problem

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:36.230
or is the most authentic self,
a kind of person who has all

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:39.220
of these different perceptions
of oneself incorporated

00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:43.490
into their bodies, like maybe
that's the most authentic self.

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:44.970
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Can anyone do that?

00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:46.760
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: No,
I mean, it makes you crazy.

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:49.560
That's why a lot of
this speaking is crazy.

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.660
It's like mad speech
in some way, you know,

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:58.000
because like it actually
does make you unable

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.170
to articulate who you are.

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:04.310
How do we know when we're
making our own choices?

00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:09.110
So all of these things
I think are questions

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:12.760
that I'm grappling
with in those passages.

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.970
Some of those moments,
I was practicing,

00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:19.950
when I wrote "Discipline," I
was often practicing in a kind

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:24.230
of writing where you write
on the verge of sleep.

00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:29.270
So I would like take naps and
I would write with friends

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:31.720
and so we had this
writing group in Brooklyn

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:34.500
and we would all get together and
write and I would be like lying

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:39.810
on the floor and everyone else was
like around the table, you know,

00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:41.330
writing their longform
prose or whatever.

00:40:41.330 --> 00:40:44.370
And I would be sleeping
or kind of like --

00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:49.700
And as soon as I would kind if
almost fall asleep, I would get up

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:54.760
and write down the language
that would occur to me.

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:56.060
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Was
this to reach some sort

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:58.670
of surreal or subconscious?

00:40:58.670 --> 00:40:59.970
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: I guess so.

00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:07.030 position:56%
Yeah. It's often the strangest --
There's something about that moment.

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:11.360
I mean, you know, for the folks
in the room who are writers,

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:14.410
you probably experience this
where you're about to fall asleep,

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:18.950
like legitimately going
to bed, and you're in bed

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:21.530
and then something comes to you
and you think, ah, that's good,

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:23.220
I have to write that down.

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:27.730
And, you know, if you don't,
you'll never remember it.

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:29.510
If you write it down, it's
often really, really good.

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:32.660
It's like there's something
about that space, I think,

00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:37.560
in one's imagination when you're
loosened from thinking in a way,

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:42.160
where you can get to another
kind of truth, I think.

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:43.920 position:56%
You didn't ask me about that, but --

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:45.220
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: No.

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:46.520
It's fascinating.

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:48.700
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: Some of that
was written in that like state

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:53.420
or like, you know, Alice Notley
talks about writing "The Descent

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:58.140
of Alette," she put herself
in a trance and write, right?

00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:00.240
Yeah, it's kind of --
I wish I could do that.

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:03.550
I wish I could put
myself in a trance

00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:07.190
but there's a similar
something about that moment.

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:08.660
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Did you
ever experiment with drugs

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:10.380
to reach a state like that?

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:11.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: You know what?

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:15.250
I have experimented with drugs
but usually am just high.

00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:18.430
I'm not writing anything.

00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:20.080
I'm just like this isn't working.

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:21.380
I don't do that.

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:22.680
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Okay.

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:24.500
Will you read this poem on page 55?

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:26.800
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin:
Yes, of course.

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:43.640
It's not the word "body"
that's the problem.

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:46.940
It's the physical thingness
of it, the hump.

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:50.950
For thousands of years
there lies behind the race,

00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:55.580
one dreary unrelieved
monotonous chapter of ignorance,

00:42:55.580 --> 00:43:00.240
nakedness, superstition, savagery.

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:04.450
When we encounter the
savage, we are in reverie.

00:43:04.450 --> 00:43:09.290
This is precision joy,
concomitant stroking.

00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:10.590
Are you me?

00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:12.430
Is this our jackal face?

00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:13.730
Oh, I love it.

00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:15.030
I love us.

00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:20.170 position:56%
Let me make a comparison, the jackal
face akin to my father beating me

00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:23.580
with a soup spoon I'm so unruly.

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:29.250
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What's
your reaction, your hmmm?

00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:36.840
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: You know,
there are a bunch of poems in "Life

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:38.970
in a Box" and also in "Good Stock."

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:43.190
I mean, I think this is a gesture
that I make in "Discipline" too

00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:50.780
where the time expanse
is really, really vast.

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:56.350
So that and there are, you
know, the kind of entry --

00:43:56.350 --> 00:43:59.020 position:56%
I'm going to break this poem down
for you, actually, because the entry

00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:04.180
to this poem is that I was
doing a kind of classroom talk

00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:11.320
at Columbia University and the
students were talking about whether

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:12.620
or not -- This is like something

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:14.800
that only would happen
at a graduate seminar.

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:17.870
They were talking about whether or
not you could still use the word

00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:19.560
"body" in a poem, you know.

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:20.860
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Like
it was something --

00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:22.160
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: So that sort
of [inaudible] it's not the word.

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:25.250
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Because it was
so suspect or so contaminated?

00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:26.550
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: Yeah,
it was kind of like, oh,

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:28.540
we know everyone's doing this
thing where they're like talking

00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:30.590
about the body or like
it's like a moment,

00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:32.810
it's like a trending or something.

00:44:32.810 --> 00:44:34.360
The body is trending in poetry.

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:36.450
Can we still use the body?

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:40.170
And so it begins there.

00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:46.400
And then, you know, so it's the
physical thingness of it, the hump,

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:50.960 position:56%
and so then I started to think
about in this moment I was borrowing

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:57.210
from 19th century, 18th
century like scientific racism,

00:44:57.210 --> 00:45:01.630
like that middle part
is borrowed text.

00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:03.950
It's actual text from, you know,

00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:08.660
someone claiming that
this is science.

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:11.890
For thousands of years there
lies behind the race one dreary

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:15.610
unrelieved monotonous chapter of
ignorance, nakedness, superstition,

00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:19.750
and savagery as a way of thinking

00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:25.520
about how certain bodies
are narrated through history

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:30.230
and then it just gets really
base at the end, like, you know,

00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:33.200
what is my body, what do I think
about when I think about my body?

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:37.340
My body feels pain, I know
that for a fact, you know.

00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:44.360
I know the physical kind
of experiences of the body.

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:47.780 position:56%
You know, I can spit from this body.

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:49.470
I can urinate from this body.

00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:50.770
Things like that.

00:45:50.770 --> 00:45:55.500
And then it becomes about, it kind
of gets, goes really big towards

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:58.840
like history and then it gets
really particular towards my own

00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:00.140
personal experience.

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:01.440
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It starts
very abstract and intellectual

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:03.730
and then becomes very
physical and emotional?

00:46:03.730 --> 00:46:05.030
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: Yeah.

00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:06.440
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's what made
your poem work, though, right?

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:08.920
I mean, if it stayed
in that top level,

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:11.260
it'd be very a very arrogant poem.

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:12.560
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: Then
it would be dissertation.

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:13.860
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Exactly.

00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:15.160
A very arrogant poem indeed.

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:18.130
Remember that section "Beloved"
where a baby shrugs a preacher

00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:22.990
and says, in this here place we
flesh, flesh that weeps, laughs,

00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:24.800
flesh that dancing on
bare feet in grass.

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.280
Love it. Love it hard.

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:28.800
She's speaking to people whose
bodies have been so hated

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:32.700
for so long for so many generations
but they need to be taught how

00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:35.140
to love their bodies again.

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:40.920 position:56%
When you say the word of the body is
not the problem, it's the thingness

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:46.620
of it, that's a poem that speaks
to Black people in a different way

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:52.220
than it speaks to White people,
people that are in the hegemony,

00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:55.610
as you call it, people
who are outside of it.

00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:57.780
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin:
I think that's true.

00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:03.790
My good friend Ronaldo Wilson
has a poem called "Poems

00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:09.950 position:56%
of the Black Object," and, you know,
kind of a similar gesture to speak

00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:16.180
from an I speaker that you
are calling a black object

00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:21.870
and that moment from
between [inaudible] talk

00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:25.660
about also makes me think of
Fred Mouton [assumed spelling].

00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:28.660
He has this lecture
that he gives where he's

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:35.410
like quoting Hortense Spillers
about like about, you know,

00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:40.460
to be a black body at a particular
point in history was to really be

00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:47.150
like a, was to really be a kind of
flesh, to be flesh in some ways,

00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:49.870
because the flesh, the meat
of it, the flesh of it,

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:52.260
the what I'm calling
like the hump of it,

00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:56.560 position:56%
what Ronaldo calls the objectness of
it, the thingness of it, you know,

00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:59.550
are kind of all in
conversation with each other.

00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:08.650 position:56%
And I think we see that, we see that
narrative from slavery kind of still

00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:12.560
in our contemporary moment about,
you know, there was that thing.

00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:14.890
Did you see this thing
-- I saw this thing.

00:48:14.890 --> 00:48:21.640
I was glimpsing at Facebook
today and there was this nursing,

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:25.790
new nursing textbook that
was put out by a publisher,

00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:29.320
I can't remember the name, and
it was talking about the ways

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:31.430
in which different
races experience pain.

00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:33.360
This is in 2017.

00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:35.410
So and it broke it down.

00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:38.260
It's like this is how White
people experience pain.

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:40.830
This is how Black people,

00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:43.570
this is the way Native
people experience pain.

00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:45.790
You know, it was, you know, and
of course, they had to apologize.

00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:48.300
But I don't even know how that
made it into the textbook.

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:51.600
Like how many people did
that have to go by in order

00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:53.840
to make it into the textbook?

00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:58.650
So like those narratives, you
know, of the particularities

00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:05.080
of particular kinds of bodies,
flesh, how they become narrated

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:09.610
as things or whatever, you
know, it's a continuous

00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:17.230
and diffuse kind of, the academic
in me would say discursive thing

00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:20.810
that happens still in
this contemporary moment.

00:49:20.810 --> 00:49:24.950
We still have those
resonances [inaudible].

00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:30.220
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You once
said, one of most core beliefs

00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:34.310 position:56%
about what it means to be is that
if you experience trauma and I think

00:49:34.310 --> 00:49:38.450
that in some ways the Black
experience is a kind of trauma

00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:40.410
that it's difficult to be cohesive.

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:45.200 position:56%
That impossibility of being cohesive
makes it hard for me to rewrite

00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:49.970
that I over and over and over
again is a very slippery thing.

00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:54.270
First of all, the parenthetical
statement is just devastating.

00:49:54.270 --> 00:50:00.390
The Black experience
is a kind of trauma?

00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:04.720
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: Yeah,
you know, or, you know,

00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:12.540
it's also like the
relationship between or it's kind

00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:17.060
of like melancholy or something
or melancholia or something.

00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:27.470 position:56%
I think about it as a kind of
trauma because, like we were talking

00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:32.390
about before, like there's no
way to really speak one's self.

00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:37.240
So there is -- So the one
way I think about trauma is

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:41.400
that like pain it has
like no language.

00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:45.370
So when you're in the moment of
experiencing something severe,

00:50:45.370 --> 00:50:51.550
whether it be psychological
or physical,

00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:54.660
you literally cannot speak it.

00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:58.200
Right? It's hard to
speak after the fact.

00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:02.130
And so if you think about the
Black experience in America

00:51:02.130 --> 00:51:09.030
like along those lines,
like what is it that is able

00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:12.050
to give it the language
that it deserves in order

00:51:12.050 --> 00:51:14.150
to really be able to speak it.

00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:21.110 position:56%
Like how do you speak the, like, you
know, a whole, however many years,

00:51:21.110 --> 00:51:27.790 position:56%
however many years of, you know,
historical and contiguous, you know,

00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:30.820
disenfranchisement
from the human race.

00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:34.790
It's too, you know, so I think
that when I say that about trauma,

00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:38.240
like that's not really thinking
about but that's I think

00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:43.170 position:56%
that writing and art is so important
and that's why that language

00:51:43.170 --> 00:51:47.420
that you referenced early about the
circling around and the circling

00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:55.090
around I think that together we
writers and artists are doing

00:51:55.090 --> 00:52:00.540
that work, kind of circling around
this thing, trying to get closer

00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:05.230
to it, really and all of
our different, you know,

00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:08.270
formal enterprises,
genre enterprises,

00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:11.550
and together somehow the layering

00:52:11.550 --> 00:52:16.110
of those meanings will get
somehow closer to the thing

00:52:16.110 --> 00:52:19.130
and hopefully transform
the world that we live in.

00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:24.510
Like that's the hope, I think,
you know, that the hope is

00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:30.140
that transforming culture
and art and working

00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:35.090
in these fields can be a kind of
social justice work that happening,

00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:38.850
you know, kind of insidiously.

00:52:38.850 --> 00:52:43.250
And hopefully it will take
a long time for the regime,

00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:45.920
the current regime
especially, to catch on to it.

00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:48.500
You know, like if we were
in Chile, they would know.

00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:50.370
They would be like,
throw the poets in jail.

00:52:50.370 --> 00:52:54.430
Throw the poets in jail
first, the visual artists

00:52:54.430 --> 00:52:56.400
and the journalists,
get them all in there.

00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:58.420
Then we can really start
to do our work, you know.

00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:02.540
We don't need them
contributing to what people think.

00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:03.930
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Are you hopeful?

00:53:03.930 --> 00:53:05.230
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: Am I hopeful?

00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:07.030
Oh, God. Are you?

00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:08.330
I don't know.

00:53:08.330 --> 00:53:09.960
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I'm
starting to not be.

00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:11.580
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: Yeah.

00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:13.200
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I'm thinking

00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:16.100
of the essays [inaudible]
has written recently.

00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:21.260 position:56%
It really sounds like he's, you
know, kind of throwing in the towel.

00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:27.130
It just seems like what's
happened after Obama is

00:53:27.130 --> 00:53:30.750
such a counter-reaction,
like it's hard to be hopeful.

00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:32.720 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: You know what
makes me hopeful is reading history.

00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:40.010
You know? I think that
when I look at, you know,

00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:48.160
countries that have been through
fascism, kind of countries

00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:58.440 position:56%
that have experience genocided,
people who have lost so much in war,

00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:08.500
and how people kind of come out
of the other side of that better.

00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:09.990
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: So you look
at the great arc of time?

00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:11.290
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin:
Look at the big arc.

00:54:11.290 --> 00:54:12.590 position:56%
That's the thing that gives me hope.

00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:13.890
That's right.

00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:15.190
Yeah.

00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:16.490
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: To have a
long enough perspective.

00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:17.790
Tell us about "Perpetuus."

00:54:17.790 --> 00:54:19.090
Am I pronouncing that name right?

00:54:19.090 --> 00:54:20.390
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: Perpetuus.

00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:21.690
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: This
is your own character?

00:54:21.690 --> 00:54:25.970
We see Perpetuus in "Good
Stock Strange Blood."

00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:28.270
Where is that pad.

00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:32.720
Number nine.

00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:35.270
Who is this character?

00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:40.690
There's a little paragraph
about Perpetuus.

00:54:40.690 --> 00:54:42.980
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: Okay.

00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:48.240
Once I wrote into a being an
imagined figure named Perpetuus

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:54.540
whose name is Latin for
continuous, entire, universal.

00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:57.800
Perpetuus is necessarily
liberated from gender

00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:00.940
and without attachment
to skin or color.

00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:08.130 position:56%
She, it's like a slash between the s
and the h. S/he is only reflection.

00:55:08.130 --> 00:55:12.350
S/he must be called to
arrive and when s/he arrives,

00:55:12.350 --> 00:55:15.790
s/he alters the being of
the one who calls her forth

00:55:15.790 --> 00:55:20.700
and they become what they
have perceived in Perpetuus.

00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:24.010
What is the Black body
but an aching tone?

00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:28.670
Perpetuus is untethered from the
Black experience here on Earth

00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:34.560
but has an outer core that is
as dark as tree in dead night.

00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:39.480
Refusal to adhere to
ontology as fissure or rip

00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:45.500
in the fictional coherence
of culture, America, order.

00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:50.370
To build instead a sonic
register against any resistance

00:55:50.370 --> 00:55:57.430 position:56%
to a white flag against which
fists, male, aggresses a liberation.

00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:00.520
Perpetuus.

00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:01.820
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What --

00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:03.120
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin:
Perpetuus is the character.

00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:09.690 position:56%
So I wrote this libretto for --
Part of this book is from a libretto

00:56:09.690 --> 00:56:14.690
that I wrote for a global
arts collective called How you

00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:22.540
[inaudible] African and we
had this 50-minute video opera

00:56:22.540 --> 00:56:24.400
in the Whitney Biennial
a couple of years ago

00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:28.100 position:56%
and then there was a whole drama
around whether or not we should pull

00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:31.800
or keep it in the Whitney Biennial
in order to critique the kind

00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:35.130
of [inaudible] of that
particular year of the biennial.

00:56:35.130 --> 00:56:36.690
This happened recently too.

00:56:36.690 --> 00:56:38.840
It keeps happening at the
Whitney Biennial, right.

00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:43.880 position:56%
There are some protests against kind
of how things have been included.

00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:47.880
Anyway, so I wrote this libretto
that had three distinct characters.

00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:53.820
And those characters, one was very
tethered and really debilitated

00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:59.760
by their experience in
the racialized body.

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:04.590
There's one mad character whose
body has many arches and windows.

00:57:04.590 --> 00:57:11.570
I imagined that character to
be borne out of the head of,

00:57:11.570 --> 00:57:13.650
there's a play by Adrienne Kennedy.

00:57:13.650 --> 00:57:15.020
Do you guys know this playwright?

00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:18.390
Adrienne Kennedy has a play
called "Funny House of a Negro,"

00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:26.250
which is almost un-stageable and
her protagonist Sarah goes mad

00:57:26.250 --> 00:57:31.010
because she has a Black father.

00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:33.450
That a real reduction of the play.

00:57:33.450 --> 00:57:36.860
You're not sure if she
dies at the end or not.

00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:39.880
But the character that
I imagined being born

00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:46.670 position:56%
out of her head is the one with many
arches and windows because it has

00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:53.020
to be a kind of mutation but
Perpetuus, who is like, you know,

00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:57.120
everything at the same time
is really like the voice

00:57:57.120 --> 00:58:01.950
of like future reason in the work.

00:58:01.950 --> 00:58:07.450
You know, like this, you know,
we don't, it's untethered.

00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:17.930
She's, you know, both and
nothing at the same time.

00:58:17.930 --> 00:58:19.230
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Male,
female, white, black.

00:58:19.230 --> 00:58:20.530 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: Yeah, exactly.

00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:21.830
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: All colors.

00:58:21.830 --> 00:58:23.130
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: Everything.

00:58:23.130 --> 00:58:25.260
So and exist in this kind of
like future state of knowing.

00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:29.810
So in the libretto, Perpetuus comes
in as everyone is kind of like,

00:58:29.810 --> 00:58:32.980
you know, one person is
talking, you know, crazy talk.

00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:37.580
Another figure is like, you
know, I'm dying, you know.

00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:38.880
They won't let me go.

00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:40.180
They have me.

00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:41.480
They won't let me go.

00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:43.940
And then Perpetuus is
like, we are not of them,

00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:47.440
kind of singing this
other song, you know,

00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:53.400
of some kind of future
possibility for beingness.

00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:54.700
That sounds like actually --

00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:56.440
It sounds like I wrote
that on drugs but I didn't.

00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:57.740
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: No.

00:58:57.740 --> 00:59:01.370
No. It sounds like a real vision
of hopefulness, doesn't it?

00:59:01.370 --> 00:59:04.160
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: It is
kind of a vision of hopefulness.

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:05.460
Yeah.

00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:07.110
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: When you
think of the anti-Catholic

00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:12.310
and anti-Irish sentiment in
this country that's now gone,

00:59:12.310 --> 00:59:16.680
pretty much, it is kind of
a model of what could happen

00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:19.160 position:56%
with other repressed groups someday.

00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:20.460
Do you think?

00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:21.760
Am I putting --

00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:23.060
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: That's true.

00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:24.360
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Does that
sound incredibly naive?

00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:25.660
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: I
mean, we could circle back

00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:31.990
around to hating Catholics
and the Irish.

00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:34.520
Who knows what's going to happen.

00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:35.820
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's true.

00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:37.120
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin:
You know, I mean --

00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:38.420
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Bring that back?

00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:39.720
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: If you
think who would [inaudible].

00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:46.790
Yeah, I agree that there may
be some possibility for change.

00:59:46.790 --> 00:59:54.940
I also believe in kind of change
on the infinitesimal level,

00:59:54.940 --> 01:00:00.040
like I think that when change,

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:03.560
sometimes you can't see change
happening because it's happening,

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:09.300
you know, kind of grassroots, small
communities, in our relationships

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:11.500
with people, and our
relationships with each other,

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:16.070
how we talk to people
on the plane, you know.

01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:20.920
I feel like after the after the
election, White people are like,

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:23.440
who are like progressives
are so nice to me.

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:27.470
I was on a plane, I was
like this woman is so nice.

01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:29.420
This is amazing.

01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:31.350
I know, yeah, we have to interact.

01:00:31.350 --> 01:00:32.650
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Like
we're overcompensating?

01:00:32.650 --> 01:00:33.950
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: Right.

01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:36.710
Right. Well, also I think maybe
that's true but I think what's nice

01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:40.090
about it is that like yeah,
we have to interact as humans,

01:00:40.090 --> 01:00:44.900
like we can no longer kind of
afford to, you know, be in our own,

01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:48.730
you know, cocoons and silos
as much as we might like to.

01:00:48.730 --> 01:00:53.250
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Can you tell me
about the Third Wave Foundation?

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:54.550
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: Oh,
the Third Wave Foundation.

01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:56.650
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Speaking
of hopefulness.

01:00:56.650 --> 01:01:01.780
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: Yeah,
when I was a baby poet,

01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:07.730
before I was really, I hadn't
published many poems by then.

01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:10.160
I was working in philanthropy
in New York

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:17.250
and working the feminist
movement in a way or wanting to.

01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:21.050
And I started an organization
called The Third Wave Foundation

01:01:21.050 --> 01:01:26.060 position:56%
which was a young feminist activists
foundation with three friends:

01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:32.030
Rebecca Walker, the writer who's
Alice Walker's daughter and --

01:01:32.030 --> 01:01:38.420 position:56%
I hope she's not watching because
this is the first thing I say about,

01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:45.750
like Alice Walker's daughter,
and my friend Catherine Gund,

01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:52.860
and Amy Richards who's a writer
and Catherine Gund is a filmmaker.

01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:55.240
And so we all got together
and started this organization.

01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:57.480
We really wanted to --

01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:03.830 position:56%
We were extremely hopeful in that
we thought we could, the four of us,

01:02:03.830 --> 01:02:07.170
that we could save feminism

01:02:07.170 --> 01:02:12.280
by getting young people
really excited about it.

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:15.740
And we had this real
debate really about whether

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:19.530 position:56%
or not we should use the word
"feminism" and I was like, you know,

01:02:19.530 --> 01:02:22.600
we have to use the word "feminism"
if we're going to save feminism

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:23.900
or else what's the point.

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:25.200
And they were like, no,
we could use another word.

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:27.010
I said that makes no sense.

01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:32.070
So yeah, that was the goal
was to kind of refresh

01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:35.580
and reinvent feminism because
like young people and we wanted it

01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:38.570
to be a kind of multi-gendered
feminism

01:02:38.570 --> 01:02:42.730
so that young people would get
excited about women's issues,

01:02:42.730 --> 01:02:47.870
excited about gender issues in
a way where when we would go

01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:51.710 position:56%
to college campuses they were really
in critique of the word and the kind

01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:57.380
of legacy of feminism, especially
as it had to do with race.

01:02:57.380 --> 01:03:04.340
So and they had like, you know,
backlashy-type stereotypes

01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:05.880
about what it meant
to be a feminist.

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:08.500
And so we wanted to be
like look, we're normal.

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:11.140
We're fairly attractive people.

01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:14.430
You know, it's fine.

01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:19.800
You know, you're going to be okay
if you believe in gender equity.

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:22.390
It's, you know, like
that kind of thing.

01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:24.130
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's
a hopeful thing.

01:03:24.130 --> 01:03:25.430
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin:
It was a hopeful thing.

01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:26.730
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Is
it still going on?

01:03:26.730 --> 01:03:28.030
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: It is.

01:03:28.030 --> 01:03:32.690 position:56%
It's smaller now but we were, you
know, so we were around for 20 years

01:03:32.690 --> 01:03:38.670
in a big way and we gave
away millions of dollars

01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:43.770
to young activist organizations
all across the country

01:03:43.770 --> 01:03:47.950
and we still give away
money but we do exist.

01:03:47.950 --> 01:03:53.560
We're still a national foundation
but now we're a donor advised fund.

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:56.380
Yeah. I mean, that's like a
very, that's like suddenly I got

01:03:56.380 --> 01:03:59.790
like really like, you know,
like philanthropy talk

01:03:59.790 --> 01:04:02.090
because we're a donor-advised fund.

01:04:02.090 --> 01:04:03.390
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: In one
of your poems you say,

01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:06.160
reviewers want these
poems to be more hopeful.

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:08.420
Obviously, you meant
that in a funny way.

01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:10.870
But and the poems are often dark.

01:04:10.870 --> 01:04:13.570
But the fact that you're writing
them, the fact that they're

01:04:13.570 --> 01:04:17.840
so powerful, the fact that they
disorient us, it is a hopeful act

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:20.410
that you would do that,
that you would publish them,

01:04:20.410 --> 01:04:21.710
that we would read them.

01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:23.500
Those are hopeful impulses.

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:28.200
People who give up don't bother
to write or publish poetry, right?

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:32.260
I mean, you just wouldn't care.

01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:35.560
If you don't care,
you don't critique.

01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:36.860
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: That's true.

01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:38.630
It depends on the --
Yeah, I think --

01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:42.600
For me, I think that the act
of writing is a hopeful act.

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:46.770
You know, even if the content

01:04:46.770 --> 01:04:55.450
of the poems sometimes leans toward
our [inaudible] darkest tendencies,

01:04:55.450 --> 01:05:05.520
you know, I do think that
that active critique,

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:11.830
that active attempting to get close
to something or represent, I guess,

01:05:11.830 --> 01:05:18.420
in a twisted way the reality in
which we live our experiences,

01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:23.850
our experiences as gendered
people, that, yeah, that's hopeful.

01:05:23.850 --> 01:05:27.450
You know, if I write
about, you know,

01:05:27.450 --> 01:05:31.640
my first book which is more
explicitly about sexual trauma,

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:37.350
I guess the first two books,
you know, one hopeful thing is

01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:40.550
that when the work enters
the world and, you know,

01:05:40.550 --> 01:05:45.390
I think it's fairly abstract
writing in some ways sometimes

01:05:45.390 --> 01:05:49.910
but sometimes it really connects
with people and young woman come

01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:54.570
up to me and it connects them
in a really visceral way,

01:05:54.570 --> 01:05:58.190
so that feels hopeful to kind
of connect with other people

01:05:58.190 --> 01:06:05.040
around a set of experiences and
they feel like they're not so alone

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:07.460
in the world and I feel like
I'm not alone in the world.

01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:08.760
That's pretty hopeful.

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:10.060
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That is.

01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:11.360
That's the best thing.

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:12.660
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin:
Yeah, absolutely.

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:13.960
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's been
fascinating to talk to you tonight.

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:15.260
Thank you so much for coming.

01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:16.560
I really appreciate it.

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:17.860
&gt;&gt; Dawn Lundy Martin: Thank you.

01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:19.660
