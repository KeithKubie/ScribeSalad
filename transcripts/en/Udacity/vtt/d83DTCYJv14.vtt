00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.840
Let's first discuss what would seem to be the

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.310
easiest way to impute a missing value in our data

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.180
set. Just take the mean of our other data

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.960
points and fill in the missing values. So, for example,

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.720
let's say that Ichiro Suzuki and Babe Ruth are

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.760
missing values for weight in our baseball data set. Well,

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.670
okay, no problem. We can just take the mean

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.686
of all other players weights and assign that value to

00:00:25.686 --> 00:00:28.170
Ichiro and Babe Ruth. In this case, we

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.610
would assign Ichiro and Babe Ruth both a weight

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.420
of 191.67. Wow, that seems really easy, right?

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.600
There's gotta be a catch. Well, let's first discuss

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.380
what's good about this method. We don't change

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.940
the mean of the height across our sample, That's

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.360
good. But let's say we were hoping to

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.590
study the relationship between weight and birth year. Or

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.440
height and weight. Just plugging the mean height into a bunch of our

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.040
data points lessens the correlation between

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.780
our imputed variable and any other variable.
