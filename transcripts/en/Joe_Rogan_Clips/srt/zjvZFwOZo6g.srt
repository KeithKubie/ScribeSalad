1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,830
The Joe Rogan experience.
That dad is a,

2
00:00:04,831 --> 00:00:08,130
a really interesting breakdown that maybe
that is one of the big mistakes we're

3
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:09,030
making in our culture.

4
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:11,670
When people point to the problems
that we have in this country.

5
00:00:11,671 --> 00:00:15,600
One of the problems we have is our
inability to connect with each other or to

6
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:16,391
recognize that a,

7
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:20,610
we're all sharing this space and time
together and instead wanting to uphold our

8
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:25,611
own religious or ideological ideas as
being the only one way to get going.

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,160
Yeah. The only one way to get through.
And one of the things that I've found,

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,230
these psychedelic experiences,

11
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:36,120
it really makes ideologies seem,
uh,

12
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,500
if not preposterous,

13
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:41,520
at the very least insignificant
in comparison to human
experiences. Absolutely.

14
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:46,220
The experience of, of comradery
and friendship and, and love it.

15
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,020
You realize like, oh, this
is what's important. This is

16
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,590
not enforcing your ideas are pushing them
on other people and forcing people to

17
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:57,650
behave the way you behave,
but instead love,

18
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,260
I'm thinking about religious ideas,
which caused so much division,

19
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:07,090
so much chaos, so much
hatred, so much fear, so much
suspicion in the world today.

20
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:08,200
Um,

21
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,200
is it really what we want to do as human
beings simply to accept a package of

22
00:01:13,271 --> 00:01:17,890
ideas that were believed in by our
ancestors to accept them whole without

23
00:01:17,891 --> 00:01:21,950
question as absolute fact,
which we regard as such a Thursday.

24
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:26,260
The fact that in some cases we're willing
to be deeply unpleasant to people who

25
00:01:26,261 --> 00:01:29,920
hold different views or perhaps even
killed them. Uh, we've had this, you know,

26
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:31,570
this recent event in, in, in,

27
00:01:31,571 --> 00:01:36,310
in Sri Lanka primarily a religiously
motivated terrorist event.

28
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,050
It happens,
it happens all over the world,

29
00:01:38,051 --> 00:01:42,610
that people feel so convinced that the
inherited package of ideas that they had

30
00:01:42,611 --> 00:01:46,030
nothing to do with creating and
that they have never questioned.

31
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,220
They're so convinced that
those ideas are right,

32
00:01:48,221 --> 00:01:52,270
that in extreme cases they are actually
prepared to kill other human beings who

33
00:01:52,271 --> 00:01:56,860
hold different ideas. They are,
they so insecure in their own,

34
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,380
in their own beliefs that,

35
00:01:58,381 --> 00:02:02,260
that they're prepared to go to that
level of actually murdering another human

36
00:02:02,261 --> 00:02:02,920
being halted.

37
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,620
They're so threatened by the other
beliefs that other human beings hold.

38
00:02:05,621 --> 00:02:08,980
So it's an abnegation of our
responsibility as human beings.

39
00:02:08,981 --> 00:02:10,450
We should be questioning things.

40
00:02:10,451 --> 00:02:13,480
We should not be accepting
packages of ideas intact,

41
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:17,860
fully formed and using them to drive
the way we behave towards one another.

42
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,210
That was part of the human story, but
we need to move on from that. I mean,

43
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:23,740
it's a very dangerous
situation in a very complex,

44
00:02:23,741 --> 00:02:27,910
modern world with billions of human beings
on the planet to have these kinds of

45
00:02:27,911 --> 00:02:30,340
energy's being generated where
certain groups of people are saying,

46
00:02:30,341 --> 00:02:34,510
we are absolutely right and you are
absolutely wrong. We are superior.

47
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,800
You are inferior. This is a very,
very dangerous path that we're,

48
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,770
that we are on and it needs to be changed.
Personally,

49
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,090
I know this is not a comment that
will go down well with many people,

50
00:02:46,091 --> 00:02:49,150
but I am strongly opposed to nationalism.
I don't,

51
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:53,380
I don't see any virtue in nationalism.
It is an accident of birth,

52
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:57,730
which nation you are born in. It was
nothing that you did for your own merit.

53
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,470
You didn't earn that you born by
accident in, in a particular nation.

54
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,730
Why should we automatically feel the
other people who were born by accident in

55
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:09,580
that particular nation has
something special in common with us.

56
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:12,610
And that we together are a group who are
much more important than other groups

57
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:16,420
of people. I've been privileged to spend
my life traveling around the world,

58
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,300
living with communities all over,
over the world.

59
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:22,420
And one thing that really comes
across to me strongly, it's, it's,

60
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,620
it should be a cliche and yet it's not,
is that we are all one family,

61
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,890
that humans are intimately
interconnected all around the world.

62
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:34,300
That you can go to the remotest area
of the Amazon jungle and find the same

63
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:38,920
hopes, the same fears, the same dreams
that we have in industrialized cities,

64
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,010
shared by the hunter gatherers in
the, in, in the middle of the Amazon.

65
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:47,011
So our similarities as human beings and
what we share in common at the emotional

66
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:51,910
level and the level of love and at the
level of heart are far more important

67
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,600
than our differences that are defined
by the nation or the political group in

68
00:03:55,601 --> 00:04:00,040
which we, in which we grew up in. And when
I, when I say I'm against nationalism,

69
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,830
I need also to make
clear that does not mean,

70
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,270
and I hope I'm not taken out of context
by others who are listening to this.

71
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:12,040
That does not mean I'm in favor of
world government. I detest governments.

72
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:16,090
That's another thing we need to grow out
off. We don't need governments anymore.

73
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,140
If we have them, they should have
a very minimal role in our society.

74
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:24,760
I think it's possible for the human race
to relate as one family without leaders

75
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:28,300
and governments who are exploiting
the worst aspects of our character,

76
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,550
the lowest common
denominator of our society.

77
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,730
Deliberately encouraging theaters
and hatreds and suspicion.

78
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,760
What responsible leaders should be doing
is encouraging love and unity and their

79
00:04:39,191 --> 00:04:40,270
failure to do that.

80
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,600
In my view disqualifies them from the
leadership role entirely and that's why

81
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:47,920
I've often said I would not,

82
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,810
I would like to see a situation in which
no head of state can be appointed to

83
00:04:52,811 --> 00:04:57,010
that position unless he or she has
first had 12 sessions of Iowasca.

84
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,410
That would be the condition.

85
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,850
Don't even bother applying for
the job if you haven't done this,

86
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:06,070
and we have to be there where you have it.
We have to be,

87
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:08,820
we want to see that you're
drinking every drop.

88
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,890
And we wanted an
experience Shumon presence,

89
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:14,230
who's really going to guide you
through the, through the journey.

90
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:18,280
And I suspect that that would be a
transformative experience for many of our

91
00:05:18,281 --> 00:05:22,480
political class, and that they would start
to question why they do what they do,

92
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,080
why they exploit theories in order
to magnify their own position.

93
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:28,990
They'd start to question that and to
wonder about a different destiny for

94
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:31,990
humanity. But that's a dream, I guess
it's not going to happen, is very, very,

95
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:33,010
very well said.
Yeah.
