00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.210
Algae is the worst, slimy and gross, but one
day it might power the world.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.320
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.089
One of the biggest challenges of the 21st
century is how we power our societies.

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.930
So as we slowly deplete the world’s store
of fossil fuels, scientists are searching

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.840
for something a bit more renewable.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.480
Biofuels show lots of promise.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.640
Many researchers believe by turning to biofuels
we could reduce the amount of greenhouse gas

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.720
emissions while reducing our dependence on
foreign oil.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.461
And for me, the most exciting thing is, there’s
so much variety in the way we can make energy

00:00:31.461 --> 00:00:36.350
from plants or the waste they produce a lot
faster than the geological processes that

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.260
can take millions and millions of years to
make fossil fuels.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.050
You might be most familiar with ethanol.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.050
It’s pretty popular.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.280
A lot of gas today is made up of 10% of the
stuff to cut down on octane and greenhouse

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.429
gas emissions.

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:48.429
So where does it come from?

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:52.160
Just like brewing a beer, ethanol can be made
from any biomass high in carbohydrates.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.309
Most of the ethanol used today is made from
corn.

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.210
It’s not like the corn is burned directly,
the starches and sugars in the corn are actually

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.829
fermented first, producing ethanol.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.300
But there’s some concern that using corn
for fuel might take some away from food production

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.440
and harm food prices worldwide.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.230
So what other plants could we use?

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.040
Unfortunately, not all plants can easily make
ethanol, the cellulose in a lot of plants

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.750
is protected by a sheath of lignin and hemicellulose.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.940
These prevent it from being able to produce
a lot of ethanol.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.830
But scientists are working on it.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.380
Scientists have recently turned to their attention
to switchgrass as a possible biofuel.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.490
It’s a pretty hardy plant that can grow
on land that’s too tough for farming.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.280
But the plant’s not ideal.. yet.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.690
Researchers are working on creating a strain
that produces more biomass, according to a

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.740
study published in the journal Crop Science.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.000
They’re also working on a strain that produces
less lignin so more of that biomass is available

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.440
for use as fuel.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.920
Other plants like soybean or algae produce
oils that can be burned.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.800
Yeah soybeans like the stuff they make into
tofu can also run your truck.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.100
Soybeans are about 18% oil and 38% protein.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.620
So sometimes that protein goes to tofu and
that oil is often sold for use in cooking.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.050
But sometimes, it can be made into fuel.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.700
In a process called transesterification, the
glycerine is removed from the oil, leaving

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.270
soy biodiesel.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.160
That biodiesel can be mixed with regular diesel
or can power a truck on its own.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.340
Fuel made from 100% biodiesel is not surprisingly
called B100.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.129
While it could be great, growing soybeans
takes up a lot of land.

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.980
One biofuels expert says it would take an
area half the size of the US to grow enough

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.370
soybeans to replace petroleum.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.239
On the other hand algae might prove to be
a much smaller solution.

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.189
The Energy Department says it would require
only 15,000 square miles, a few thousand miles

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:32.459
larger than Maryland.

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.549
Yeah, algae, that nasty stuff that grows in
your unused pool in the backyard.

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:42.150
But this isn’t a new thing, research really
kicked off the 1970s during an energy crisis

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.129
and oil prices skyrocketed.

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.569
After prices settled back down, a lot of people
lost interest.

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.439
Algae produces oily lipids and gases, both
of which can be burned as fuel.

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:55.040
But just because algae grows nearly everywhere,
doesn’t mean it’s easy to grow.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.910
Some strains produce more lipids than others
and, like I said it grows everywhere, so sometimes

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.840
strains get polluted by less oily kinds.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.090
And it can take a while to grow.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.700
But scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy's
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory are

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.700
on the case.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.769
They created a supercooker to super heat algae
and water and produce oil in about half an

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:12.769
hour!

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.489
And if cranked up to a large scale production,
might be able to fuel the future at prices

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.019
as low as 2 bucks a gallon! but… more research
is needed.

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.349
Speaking of powering the world with algae,
there’s a whole building in Germany that

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:24.349
runs on it!

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:36.629

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:48.819
