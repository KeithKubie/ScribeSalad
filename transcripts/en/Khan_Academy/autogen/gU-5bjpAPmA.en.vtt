00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.008
 We got in the previous video when 

00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:07.758
 Toussaint Louvreur had been Khin, 

00:00:07.758 --> 00:00:10.665
 On some levels, first by his close associates, 

00:00:10.665 --> 00:00:14.033
 Because they joined Lekelk's side 

00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:17.035
 Or basically because they gave up the rebellion against Lyclerc, 

00:00:17.035 --> 00:00:18.750
 They were convinced that Leclerc was not so bad, 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.250
 He had no intention of returning slavery 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.638
 Or taking civil rights 

00:00:23.638 --> 00:00:26.515
 Of free men of African descent 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.960
 This is another picture of your chalk here 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.143
 This is for Leclerc 

00:00:32.143 --> 00:00:34.995
 So he had to hand over his weapons. 

00:00:34.995 --> 00:00:37.021
 Lefwad has gone to Leclerc 

00:00:37.021 --> 00:00:38.424
 He imprisoned him for your clerical, 

00:00:38.424 --> 00:00:39.279
 Put it on a boat, 

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:40.535
 He sent him to France 

00:00:40.535 --> 00:00:42.366
 He died the following year in 1803. 

00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:47.292
 If he is betrayed 

00:00:47.292 --> 00:00:50.562
 He died in captivity in 1803 

00:00:50.562 --> 00:00:53.170
 It has been on many levels 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.369
 Of the most important leaders 

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:57.546
 Not only in Haitian history, but in general 

00:00:57.546 --> 00:00:59.667
 When I take power as I said before, 

00:00:59.667 --> 00:01:02.390
 He did not avenge the white population 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.594
 And contributed to the support of the Haitian economy 

00:01:05.594 --> 00:01:08.043
 To return and grow 

00:01:08.043 --> 00:01:11.630
 Indeed, he has contributed to the defense of what is now called Haiti 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.550
 But it was already St. Domingue, against the British Royal Navy. 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.400
 I forgot to mention that in the ... 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:26.392
 Defended against the British Navy 

00:01:26.392 --> 00:01:27.865
 Which was at that time 

00:01:27.865 --> 00:01:31.074
 By far the world's dominant marine 

00:01:31.074 --> 00:01:33.675
 This is what earned him reputation 

00:01:33.675 --> 00:01:34.817
 As a great general 

00:01:34.817 --> 00:01:37.005
 On top of being a great leader 

00:01:37.005 --> 00:01:38.797
 In terms of revenge, 

00:01:38.797 --> 00:01:41.374
 In terms of tactics cut and burned, 

00:01:41.374 --> 00:01:44.430
 In terms of not only the invasion of his enemies, 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.318
 So Khin, 

00:01:46.318 --> 00:01:49.200
 And to make it clearer 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.620
 Leclerc deserves the horns of Satan 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.155
 Although we will meet someone else 

00:01:56.155 --> 00:01:58.788
 Worth the horns of a larger demon 

00:01:58.788 --> 00:02:00.532
 Or that he was in fact a loyal subordinate 

00:02:00.532 --> 00:02:02.889
 For someone who deserves the Devil's horns 

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:06.969
 In May 1802 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:12.101
 Napoleon signed a law providing for 

00:02:12.101 --> 00:02:17.012
 Re-slavery where it did not disappear 

00:02:17.012 --> 00:02:25.535
 Slavery did not go 

00:02:25.535 --> 00:02:27.720
 So it was a bit vague 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.214
 There were some areas 

00:02:29.214 --> 00:02:32.040
 Which did not disappear by slavery 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.430
 These include the French colonies in Martonique, 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.620
 In St. Lucia, in Tobago 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.136
 But in Haiti things were 

00:02:45.136 --> 00:02:46.962
 - or St. Domingue at that time - 

00:02:46.962 --> 00:02:48.680
 Things were vague 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.415
 Has slavery really disappeared? 

00:02:51.415 --> 00:02:52.812
 Or has it not disappeared yet? 

00:02:52.812 --> 00:02:54.440
 As it seems, the slaves were free in Haiti 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.229
 So it was not clear what it meant to Haiti? 

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:59.657
 But at the same time 

00:02:59.657 --> 00:03:01.020
 The Haitians did not think that would have happened 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.750
 This was in May 1802 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.577
 To make things clearer 

00:03:06.577 --> 00:03:11.565
 Napoleon sent a secret memo to Leclerc 

00:03:11.565 --> 00:03:13.630
 Provides for the return of slavery 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.308
 When the time is right 

00:03:15.308 --> 00:03:26.724
 Return slavery in time 

00:03:26.724 --> 00:03:29.540
 These two people were not a festival 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.020
 Know the case 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.968
 They knew they needed help 

00:03:32.968 --> 00:03:37.555
 From some of the former generals of Tusan Louverture 

00:03:37.555 --> 00:03:39.623
 The former close men 

00:03:39.623 --> 00:03:41.860
 In order to keep control of Haiti 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.701
 But the intention all the time was 

00:03:43.701 --> 00:03:45.705
 When their hands are supreme 

00:03:45.705 --> 00:03:49.097
 To tighten the screws, to restore slavery 

00:03:49.097 --> 00:03:53.350
 And taking civil rights of free men 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.000
 These men were not fools either 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.450
 You can remember Desaline 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.560
 This was a picture of him 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.452
 He was also a former slave 

00:04:03.452 --> 00:04:06.868
 One of Tusan Louverture's close friends 

00:04:06.868 --> 00:04:09.560
 An influential general 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.625
 As you remember 

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:13.514
 Near the end of the fight against Leclerc 

00:04:13.514 --> 00:04:15.296
 He surrendered against Leclerc 

00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:16.438
 And to some extent you can say 

00:04:16.438 --> 00:04:18.410
 Toussaint Louverture raised 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.955
 But he and some others 

00:04:20.955 --> 00:04:23.155
 Of the former Loftcher followers 

00:04:23.155 --> 00:04:24.170
 They saw the writing on the wall 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.320
 They did not object to the secret memo. 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.350
 They received a statement from Martonique, Tobago and St. Lucia 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.120
 They were told that slavery had been restored 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.768
 French in this period 

00:04:36.768 --> 00:04:39.133
 They were not people you might want to deal with or trust 

00:04:39.133 --> 00:04:42.360
 When it comes to slavery. 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:50.720
 So Dessalin and his comrades carried the weapons again 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.272
 Dessalin had someone else different 

00:04:53.272 --> 00:04:55.265
 About Tusan Louverture 

00:04:55.265 --> 00:04:57.406
 The only similarity between them 

00:04:57.406 --> 00:05:01.220
 That they were influential military men. 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.698
 The big difference between them is that 

00:05:03.698 --> 00:05:12.515
 DiSaline was not going down 

00:05:12.515 --> 00:05:14.496
 He was not afraid 

00:05:14.496 --> 00:05:18.660
 To face eye to eye 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.670
 Here we have a desalsin responsible for what was .. 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.200
 I think you can call it the rebel slave army. 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.923
 On the other hand 

00:05:26.923 --> 00:05:30.555
 Leclerc has 40,000 troops 

00:05:30.555 --> 00:05:33.731
 Which appeared with Napoleon 

00:05:33.731 --> 00:05:36.753
 But Desaline was lucky 

00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:38.660
 Yellow fever that spread .. not lucky 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.910
 I mean people died because of it 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.177
 But this is the heart of the war 

00:05:43.177 --> 00:05:49.370
 For the benefit of people of African descent on the island 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:58.595
 Yellow fever hit the island and killed Leclerc 

00:05:58.595 --> 00:06:02.000
 And killed some 20,000 people 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.870
 Or that the number you read was 24,000 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.750
 Of the actual number of French soldiers 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.430
 Another 8,000 were taken to hospital 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.270
 So there are 32,000 out of service 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.485
 Thus, only 8,000 soldiers remained 

00:06:15.485 --> 00:06:17.910
 Suddenly, the course of the war was completely reversed 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.038
 Change the number in terms of 

00:06:21.038 --> 00:06:27.370
 The type of forces that the rebel army must fight 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:32.030
 But they were not all good at what I think at this point because Leclerc 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.018
 Which I mentioned and gave him two little demon horns 

00:06:34.018 --> 00:06:35.655
 He had been replaced by a person 

00:06:35.655 --> 00:06:44.725
 Worth two large demon horns, named Rochambo 

00:06:44.725 --> 00:06:47.062
 So as not to confuse him with his father 

00:06:47.062 --> 00:06:49.272
 Which has the same name 

00:06:49.272 --> 00:06:52.718
 Who was a hero of the American Revolution 

00:06:52.718 --> 00:06:55.379
 Which fought for France alongside the Americans 

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:56.825
 But his son .. 

00:06:56.825 --> 00:06:59.102
 As I can tell 

00:06:59.102 --> 00:07:00.451
 He seems like a decent man 

00:07:00.451 --> 00:07:03.570
 But his son was actually evil 

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.382
 There are few people in history 

00:07:05.382 --> 00:07:08.990
 Who you can say about them are clearly evil 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:10.700
 He is one of them 

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.736
 He was somewhat desperate, 

00:07:12.736 --> 00:07:16.812
 Yellow fever has infected his forces 

00:07:16.812 --> 00:07:21.205
 He will go to fight hostile enemies 

00:07:21.205 --> 00:07:25.011
 He did things, he was buried. 

00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:28.284
 Let me write these things because they are evil 

00:07:28.284 --> 00:07:33.035
 The Africans are buried 

00:07:33.035 --> 00:07:34.070
 Or rather I should say African Americans 

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:37.605
 Former slaves are buried, or people of African descent 

00:07:37.605 --> 00:07:48.170
 Bury them alive in the pits of insects 

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:58.825
 It also boils people alive in molasses 

00:07:58.825 --> 00:08:01.650
 I have read that he is having a party 

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:08.178
 Inviting prominent people of different races 

00:08:08.178 --> 00:08:11.199
 And be in place 

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:12.920
 At midnight he announces it 

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.097
 All men will be killed 

00:08:15.097 --> 00:08:19.322
 So this man has a cruelty 

00:08:19.322 --> 00:08:20.264
 His limits were harsh 

00:08:20.264 --> 00:08:24.355
 On men who can catch them 

00:08:24.355 --> 00:08:26.000
 Especially people of African descent 

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.618
 The only positive aspect of his cruelty 

00:08:29.618 --> 00:08:33.657
 For the first time he united 

00:08:33.657 --> 00:08:37.419
 African populations on the island 

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:47.834
 So he united the former slaves and slaves 

00:08:47.834 --> 00:08:56.545
 And the unity of different races 

00:08:56.545 --> 00:09:03.160
 That was in 1803 

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.090
 I had already said it 

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:11.140
 We are still at war with Britain 

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:14.269
 And Britain as I mentioned before 

00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:18.308
 Owns the most dominant maritime in the world 

00:09:18.308 --> 00:09:25.777
 Freely dominant 

00:09:25.777 --> 00:09:29.538
 This man, despite his wickedness and cruelty 

00:09:29.538 --> 00:09:31.348
 He needed reinforcements from Napoleon 

00:09:31.348 --> 00:09:34.360
 If he wants to face the Disalline 

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.390
 Let me be clear on this point 

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.369
 Disalline as I mentioned 

00:09:39.369 --> 00:09:42.150
 He was not hesitant to face an eye. 

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.132
 In one incident 

00:09:43.132 --> 00:09:48.144
 Rochambo buried 500 rebel prisoners alive, 

00:09:48.144 --> 00:09:52.898
 Desaline has hanged 500 French prisoners 

00:09:52.898 --> 00:09:54.446
 It was not a person I thought 

00:09:54.446 --> 00:09:58.540
 To avoid bloodshed 

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:01.610
 This is something different from Tusan Louverture. 

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:02.470
 Is a bit of a lesson 

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:04.703
 If you are fighting an enemy, 

00:10:04.703 --> 00:10:11.835
 If you get rid of the most important leaders of enemies 

00:10:11.835 --> 00:10:16.558
 You will end up becoming a leader 

00:10:16.558 --> 00:10:19.089
 More like yourself and your cruelty 

00:10:19.089 --> 00:10:22.620
 If you betray them reasonably 

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.330
 But anyway enough of my comment. 

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.470
 If the stage is prepared. 

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:28.340
 War with Britain 

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.940
 Britain controls the sea, especially the Caribbean 

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.515
 This man needs reinforcements to meet 

00:10:34.515 --> 00:10:42.160
 A strong leader of the former slaves of the rebels 

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.890
 But Napoleon is known to reduce his losses 

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:47.380
 He did it with his troops in Egypt 

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.247
 Is actually someone who does not care 

00:10:49.247 --> 00:10:50.833
 I think, about the individual 

00:10:50.833 --> 00:10:54.280
 But more concerned about himself and his strength 

00:10:54.280 --> 00:11:02.818
 So Napoleon left them hanging 

00:11:02.818 --> 00:11:03.800
 Napoleon saw the writings on the wall 

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.655
 He did not have the ability to penetrate the British fleet 

00:11:06.655 --> 00:11:07.706
 At the same time 

00:11:07.706 --> 00:11:09.550
 Napoleon is fighting that number of wars in Europe 

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:11.720
 As you remember, the French Revolution 

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.090
 Which precipitated the occurrence of the bankruptcy of France 

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.748
 Napoleon abandoned this man 

00:11:16.748 --> 00:11:18.431
 And they deserve what they deserve 

00:11:18.431 --> 00:11:22.402
 Napoleon abandoned his control of all his colonies 

00:11:22.402 --> 00:11:25.150
 Or any presence in the hemisphere 

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.166
 That was to raise funds 

00:11:27.166 --> 00:11:31.346
 He also sold Louisiana to the Americans 

00:11:31.346 --> 00:11:33.746
 When I say Louisiana, I do not mean 

00:11:33.746 --> 00:11:36.930
 Only Louisiana is currently 

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:37.900
 Which were so large 

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.800
 There where she was born 

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.342
 Talking about the bulk 

00:11:41.342 --> 00:11:44.180
 Which now accounts for one-third of the United States 

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:48.118
 Sold all this 

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:49.472
 He was clearly desperate 

00:11:49.472 --> 00:11:56.330
 He sold it for $ 15 million 

00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:03.350
 This is equivalent to 60 million franca 

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.405
 I have been told that this amount is equivalent to today 

00:12:05.405 --> 00:12:08.803
 About $ 10 billion 

00:12:08.803 --> 00:12:10.377
 So this is .. 

00:12:10.377 --> 00:12:12.582
 If someone said 10 billion dollars 

00:12:12.582 --> 00:12:14.793
 You can own one-third of the United States 

00:12:14.793 --> 00:12:16.850
 You will say it is a very good character. 

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:19.100
 Currently 10 billion dollars 

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:22.874
 15 million dollars in 1803, 10 billion dollars today 

00:12:22.874 --> 00:12:24.730
 And yet it was not much, and Napoleon was desperate 

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.383
 He realized that he could no longer maintain 

00:12:27.383 --> 00:12:28.935
 Something too far away 

00:12:28.935 --> 00:12:30.485
 When Britain took over the seas 

00:12:30.485 --> 00:12:34.463
 He was busy with his problems in Europe 

00:12:34.463 --> 00:12:36.410
 So it was a good deal for Americans 

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:38.580
 Frankly, if not sold to the Americans 

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.860
 It is possible for the British or even the Americans 

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.890
 To take it from him 

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:47.572
 The result of Napoleon's preoccupation 

00:12:47.572 --> 00:12:53.107
 Disraelin had the ability to destroy Rochambo 

00:12:53.107 --> 00:13:00.410
 And the Declaration of Independence of Saint-Domingues 

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:09.250
 On January 1, 1804 

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:12.922
 Desaline declared independence .. 

00:13:12.922 --> 00:13:15.760
 The new State called Haiti 

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.640
 The indigenous name of the island 

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.010
 It means the land of mountains 

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:24.349
 There is a final note 

00:13:24.349 --> 00:13:27.100
 Because you may be aware or not, 

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:31.261
 Haiti is a very, very poor country 

00:13:31.261 --> 00:13:35.230
 In addition, after the dislain there happened many .. 

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:37.158
 - I will make a video about it - 

00:13:37.158 --> 00:13:39.280
 Guided tours of the heads of dictators one by one 

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.120
 People have passed through many wise men 

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:41.834
 But I want to make it clear 

00:13:41.834 --> 00:13:45.330
 They had started a terrible food. 

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.645
 Although disalline 

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:51.507
 Independence was declared in 1804 

00:13:51.507 --> 00:13:58.899
 The French did not recognize Haiti until 1825. 

00:13:58.899 --> 00:14:03.224
 Recognition of the French 

00:14:03.224 --> 00:14:04.933
 The only reason not to recognize .. 

00:14:04.933 --> 00:14:07.982
 And you can wait, well who cares about recognition 

00:14:07.982 --> 00:14:10.995
 Who cares about the thinking of the former colonialist? 

00:14:10.995 --> 00:14:12.890
 But that they got recognition 

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.050
 The French have blocked the Haitian trade 

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:16.000
 They did not allow any trade 

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.740
 To move forward with Haiti 

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:20.130
 So it was on the front of the gun. 

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:24.230
 And so they get recognition 

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:39.402
 Haiti must pay 90 million francs to France 

00:14:39.402 --> 00:14:41.911
 And to clarify the amount of this money 

00:14:41.911 --> 00:14:47.702
 This is a small island or half island 

00:14:47.702 --> 00:14:49.870
 Which freed its slaves recently 

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:54.392
 They were forced to condemn France 

00:14:54.392 --> 00:14:58.527
 As they were forced before 

00:14:58.527 --> 00:15:00.140
 The United States and Great Britain 

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:01.291
 So you can realize 

00:15:01.291 --> 00:15:03.518
 Even former enemies agree 

00:15:03.518 --> 00:15:08.100
 When it comes to persecuting a poor island 

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:09.582
 So they had a religion for France 

00:15:09.582 --> 00:15:13.950
 Which is equivalent to 1.5 times 

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:18.240
 What the United States paid to buy Louisiana 

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.530
 This was 60 million franca 

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:20.720
 They got all of Louisiana 

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.830
 France now tells Haiti that they owe it 90 million francs 

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:27.332
 Which is roughly equivalent 

00:15:27.332 --> 00:15:31.233
 14 or 15 billion dollars today 

00:15:31.233 --> 00:15:33.580
 This was on the population 

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:36.230
 Who reached almost half a million freed slaves 

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:37.970
 So it is a terrible amount of debt 

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:39.982
 To be clear, this is not something. 

00:15:39.998 --> 00:15:45.458
 This was not the craziest colonization of the early nineteenth century 

00:15:45.458 --> 00:15:46.173
 Forced to do this .. 

00:15:46.173 --> 00:15:58.720
 This debt was not repaid with interest until 1947 

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.480
 They continued to pay the debt 

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.272
 To make matters worse 

00:16:03.272 --> 00:16:09.740
 The reason for the debt as they said was the loss of property 

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.820
 This is what France said about why 

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:17.713
 Haiti's debt to France, is the loss of property 

00:16:17.713 --> 00:16:20.840
 It is mentioned in the list of lost property 

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.300
 Land and slaves. 

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.014
 Since the slave obtained his freedom 

00:16:26.014 --> 00:16:28.942
 It owes France a large amount of money 

00:16:28.942 --> 00:16:31.277
 Since France lost the right to own it 

00:16:31.277 --> 00:16:32.890
 This was only to make matters worse 

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:33.687
 In fact I was shocked 

00:16:33.687 --> 00:16:35.248
 When I first learned this number 

00:16:35.248 --> 00:16:38.189
 They continued to pay the debt 

00:16:38.189 --> 00:16:43.360
 In a small poor country located here .. 

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.061
 They must continue to pay the debt 

00:16:45.061 --> 00:16:50.207
 To a developed Western state until 1947 

00:16:50.207 --> 00:16:53.246
 For their freedom.
