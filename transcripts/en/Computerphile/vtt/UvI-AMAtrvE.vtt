00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
Today we're going to revise logic gates

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.180
first of all

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.180
AND, OR and NOT

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.140
Let's take a look to AND, first of all

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.140
I am going to write out a so called a truth table

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.380
in my old way which it might be slightly different

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.620
to the way other people lay it out

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.580
I like to lay these things out as in a sort of

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.700
square matrix

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
Let's call here on the left

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.540
input A

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.860
into my "AND" gate

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:34.620
and up at the top I'm going to talk about input B. 
It has two inputs and one output and the output

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:42.570
from the gate is represented inside this
square area here. So, the A input we're working

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.010
in binary as ever

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.070
can take on values of 0 and 1 so can be
okay - AND is very simple.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.020
It says the outcome is true which is
normally denoted by a 1 nowadays in binary,

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.449
the outcome is true only if both of
the inputs are true of course that's

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.250
what and means in English that must be true 
and that must be true

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.420
so let's do 1 and 1 first of all, 1 and 1 is like true and true

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.890
yes the outcome is true but if you take
0 and 0, given that 0 means false then

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.850
the AND can't be true because you're saying 
it's false and it's false

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.290
so the outcome is false - it's a zero 
and equally if one of them is true and one

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.430
of them is false

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.820
the outcome still is false because the
outcome of an AND gate, for it to be true,

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.180
both of them have got to be true. 
So you end up with a result matrix here look

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.420
with three 0s

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.549
in it and only one 1. Now, just this once I
won't do it for all of the others but

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:48.800
just this once I shall say, feel free to
write it down like this with a f and a t,

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.090
standing for true and false, but it's
still the case that under AND logic

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.740
for the outcome to be true

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.280
you must have a couple of true inputs here.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.900
So that's exactly the image of that
using fs and ts rather than 1s and 0s.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.030
If you're an electronics engineer
and you're building some electronics to do

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.489
these logic functions, what you would
draw is your AND gate with two

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:22.540
inputs A and B one output and yeah the
thing to remember is that the AND is a

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.489
fairly rounded kind of shape at the
front. But the point here is that the

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.769
outcome of doing A and B together can be
written in lots of ways you can write it

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:39.130
as A AND B. Sometimes if you look in
logic textbooks you'll find that they use

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.769
a thing looking like a little spike down
on the baseline that is the mathematical

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.510
logicians favorite way of saying AND
but it's the same thing as writing A N D.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:56.350
Very occasionally you'll also see A dot B.
That dot is like the one that

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.370
some of you will have been taught at high
school to denote multiplication rather

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.829
than using the multiplying symbol.

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:09.760
It was noted early on that AND is a bit
like doing multiplication. Because if you

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.480
say, what happens if I just multiply the
two inputs

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:22.359
instead of doing this AND nonsense. Well 0
times 0 is 0, 1 times 0 is 0, that 1 multiplied by 1,

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:24.190
1 times 1 is 1!

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.270
You get the same outcome there as if
you'd be multiplying the 1s

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.680
and 0s with each other and that is why
AND is sometimes called: logical product.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.590
OK now we've got the notation
established, we can go ahead fairly

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.200
quickly now on the other possibilities
here.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.580
Let's take a look at the OR gate. 
Well, for this which is the so-called

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.580
INCLUSIVE OR, if you want to give it it's 
full name.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.930
The rule is that the outcome is true if
either or both of the inputs are true.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.270
1 INCLUSIVE ORed with 1 - 1 OR 1, 
well, they're both true,

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.920
so the outcome is true. 1 ORed with
0, if either one of them is true

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:07.850
the outcome is true

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.270
so you put a 1 there. Similarly 0 ORed with 1

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:17.030
well, one of them is true so the outcome is
true and only 0 ORed with 0 gives

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.830
you a 0 or a false.

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:25.700
So it's called an inclusive OR because
it includes this situation here where

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.220
they really are both true to start with
writing it down in... what an electronics

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.900
engineer likes to see

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:40.340
Here you come, fast back go faster tail fin there 
and it slips around like this

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:49.490
There is your OR gate with the A and a B
inputs here it comes the output and again

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:57.200
we can either write it down as A ORed with B 
or we could say A notice it's

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.200
the opposite way around to the AND it
looks like a little V on the baseline

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.330
so you can write it like that or many
people noted very early on when studying

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.220
mathematical logic that OR does more or
less behave like addition

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:22.340
not quite, I mean look at it 0 plus 0 is 0, 
0 plus 1 is 1, 1 plus 0 is 1, 1 plus 1

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:30.000
ah... really referring back to the binary
adder video I did a week or two ago

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.630
1 added to 1 should really put down
a 0 and carry a 1 but here it's

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.790
as if the carried bit's retained and held
inside but as far as logicians are concerned

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:45.110
a lot of them like to call this the
logical sum. Whereas AND is the logical product.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.229
To complete these three

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:53.870
there's a very familiar indeed now, 
there is a very special one and that's our

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:59.840
good old friend NOT, it's special in that
it doesn't take two operands, it only

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:07.070
takes one operand. NOT is a simple
inverter, give it a 0 - it will turn it

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.960
to a 1, give it a 1 -

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.970
it'll turn it to a 0. So we've only
got one input let's call it a day.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:19.130
What's the outcome? Well, the outcome is a single
column now. It's not a square.

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:24.050
Because what you're saying is, if you apply NOT
to 0 - you get a 1, if you apply NOT to 1 -

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:30.919
you get a 0. It just flips it, as simple as that. 
And the circuit diagram, electronics

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:35.930
type notation which is a triangle with
a little circle at the end and what

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.460
comes out of here.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.600
Well, there's lots of... ways of writing
NOT A, you can write it as NOT A,

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:47.450
sometimes you'll see it written as
twiddle A. Sometimes you'll see that some

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:51.320
logicians like to use a thing like this
little bent crowbar to denote

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:57.260
NOT so that can also be used to call the
output NOT A. Those three

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.910
taken together are what's called
logically sufficient to do anything you

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:07.500
want in logic AND, OR and NOT taken
together. Dr. "Heartbleed" - bless his cotton socks -

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.210
has done even more advanced stuff
with you now which I just mention.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:16.160
If you want to glue a NOT gate onto the
output of an OR gate say, so you do the

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.240
INCLUSIVE OR but then the moment you
get it's result you flip its direction

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.320
you turn it over instead of just taking
that and gluing it onto there

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:31.790
you're allowed to abbreviate by putting
the circle on the end of the OR gate

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:37.490
it's still got the A and B inputs and
it's still got output but notice the

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.220
moment you do the OR you turn it the
other way around

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:46.070
that's what the circle says so that is a
NOR gate and I know for a fact that Dr.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.070
Bagley has done that with you in one of
his videos

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.220
we'd like to thank

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.520

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.150
they've got over a hundred thousand
titles to choose from and if you'd like

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:01.590
to try one out for free

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:07.710

today I'd like to recommend red mars by

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:09.090
Kim Stanley Robinson

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:12.690
there's been a lot of hype recently
about visiting in colonizing Mars and

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:16.380
Kim Stanley Robinson really captures
what this might be like to do it... it

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:20.640
feels very realistic not the sort of
utopian vision you get in some science

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.180
fiction

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:25.470
so check out red mars go to audible.com/computer file

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:28.560
try it out for free and thanks once
again to them for sponsoring this

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:33.479
computer video will be useful to refresh
our memory of how an or gate works

00:08:33.479 --> 00:08:39.719
so that's an order and he has two inputs
which were labeled as A and B
