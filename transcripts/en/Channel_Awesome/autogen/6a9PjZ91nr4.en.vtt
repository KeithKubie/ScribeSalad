think they sort of found their formula
 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.149
think they sort of found their formula
and their serve going with it which is

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159
and their serve going with it which is
 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.639
and their serve going with it which is
kind of the problem with it is that you

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649
kind of the problem with it is that you
 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.880
kind of the problem with it is that you
are starting to pick up the formula but

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890
are starting to pick up the formula but
 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.950
are starting to pick up the formula but
I had argue we're picking up in the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960

smart choices and then three they make

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340
smart choices and then three they make
 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.159
smart choices and then three they make
the same dumb ass choices in the first

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:28.169
the same dumb ass choices in the first
 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:31.580

here but they're not quite as dumb but
 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.110
here but they're not quite as dumb but
the downside to that too is they

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120
the downside to that too is they
 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.010
the downside to that too is they
at the scares are also pretty damn good

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.409
too
but they're not as good as three it's

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:42.419
but they're not as good as three it's
 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:44.780

three did so so so sort of take that for
 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.300
three did so so so sort of take that for
what it is I'm in my opinion you can

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.310
what it is I'm in my opinion you can
 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.010

too much but it involves a kitchen knife
and something happens to this kitchen

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:36.070
and something happens to this kitchen
 

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:40.560
and something happens to this kitchen
knife and they draw it out for a good

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:40.570
knife and they draw it out for a good
 

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:43.050
knife and they draw it out for a good
period of time and you know that

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:43.060
period of time and you know that
 

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:44.910
period of time and you know that
something is going something else is

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:44.920
something is going something else is
 

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.790
something is going something else is
gonna happen with this kitchen knife and

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800
gonna happen with this kitchen knife and
 

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:51.090
gonna happen with this kitchen knife and
you're just waiting for it and waiting

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:51.100
you're just waiting for it and waiting
 

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.699
you're just waiting for it and waiting
for it and it is such again I don't get

00:10:53.699 --> 00:10:53.709
for it and it is such again I don't get
 

00:10:53.709 --> 00:10:55.079
for it and it is such again I don't get
away because it's so good but it is such

00:10:55.079 --> 00:10:55.089
away because it's so good but it is such
 

00:10:55.089 --> 00:10:59.220
away because it's so good but it is such
an ingenious setup because every time

00:10:59.220 --> 00:10:59.230
an ingenious setup because every time
 

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:00.809
an ingenious setup because every time
someone

00:11:00.809 --> 00:11:00.819
someone
 

00:11:00.819 --> 00:11:04.619
someone
you know gets close to this kitchen

00:11:04.619 --> 00:11:04.629
you know gets close to this kitchen
 

00:11:04.629 --> 00:11:09.629
you know gets close to this kitchen
knife you're going oh but here's the

00:11:09.629 --> 00:11:09.639
knife you're going oh but here's the
 

00:11:09.639 --> 00:11:13.229
knife you're going oh but here's the
downside the payoff is not good enough

00:11:13.229 --> 00:11:13.239
downside the payoff is not good enough
 

00:11:13.239 --> 00:11:15.869
downside the payoff is not good enough
and when they do give you the payoff

00:11:15.869 --> 00:11:15.879
and when they do give you the payoff
 

00:11:15.879 --> 00:11:19.409
and when they do give you the payoff
it's too early you could have held on

00:11:19.409 --> 00:11:19.419
it's too early you could have held on
 

00:11:19.419 --> 00:11:23.489
it's too early you could have held on
this knife pretty much throughout the

00:11:23.489 --> 00:11:23.499
this knife pretty much throughout the
 

00:11:23.499 --> 00:11:24.929
this knife pretty much throughout the
entire movie especially when you see

00:11:24.929 --> 00:11:24.939
entire movie especially when you see
 

00:11:24.939 --> 00:11:26.849
entire movie especially when you see
what happens to some other characters in

00:11:26.849 --> 00:11:26.859
what happens to some other characters in
 

00:11:26.859 --> 00:11:28.829
what happens to some other characters in
the movie I'm like you could have used

00:11:28.829 --> 00:11:28.839
the movie I'm like you could have used
 

00:11:28.839 --> 00:11:31.859
the movie I'm like you could have used
that plot point later and you could have

00:11:31.859 --> 00:11:31.869
that plot point later and you could have
 

00:11:31.869 --> 00:11:34.979
that plot point later and you could have
had people's stomach turning every

00:11:34.979 --> 00:11:34.989
had people's stomach turning every
 

00:11:34.989 --> 00:11:36.929
had people's stomach turning every
single time they're in the kitchen

00:11:36.929 --> 00:11:36.939
single time they're in the kitchen
 

00:11:36.939 --> 00:11:39.449
single time they're in the kitchen
and it could have made people just

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:39.459
and it could have made people just
 

00:11:39.459 --> 00:11:41.579
and it could have made people just
cringe throughout the entire film every

00:11:41.579 --> 00:11:41.589
cringe throughout the entire film every
 

00:11:41.589 --> 00:11:43.109
cringe throughout the entire film every
time someone will go in the kitchen

00:11:43.109 --> 00:11:43.119
time someone will go in the kitchen
 

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:45.359
time someone will go in the kitchen
but they do it wait they give it away

00:11:45.359 --> 00:11:45.369
but they do it wait they give it away
 

00:11:45.369 --> 00:11:46.650
but they do it wait they give it away
way too early and they give it away at

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:46.660
way too early and they give it away at
 

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.809
way too early and they give it away at
just the wrong point and they don't

00:11:48.809 --> 00:11:48.819
just the wrong point and they don't
 

00:11:48.819 --> 00:11:50.279
just the wrong point and they don't
really do anything with it and it's just

00:11:50.279 --> 00:11:50.289
really do anything with it and it's just
 

00:11:50.289 --> 00:11:52.379
really do anything with it and it's just
like oh oh

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:52.389
like oh oh
 

00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:56.519
like oh oh
what an ingenious setup but that's what

00:11:56.519 --> 00:11:56.529
what an ingenious setup but that's what
 

00:11:56.529 --> 00:11:58.049
what an ingenious setup but that's what
I'm talking about is how it will have

00:11:58.049 --> 00:11:58.059
I'm talking about is how it will have
 

00:11:58.059 --> 00:12:00.900
I'm talking about is how it will have
some setups there so oh you know that

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:00.910
some setups there so oh you know that
 

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:04.999
some setups there so oh you know that
the Kinect thing was ingenious um and

pretty cleverly but again there's a lot

00:13:15.639 --> 00:13:15.649
pretty cleverly but again there's a lot
 

00:13:15.649 --> 00:13:19.410
pretty cleverly but again there's a lot
of wait when did this how did that so

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:19.420
of wait when did this how did that so
 

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.090
of wait when did this how did that so
we'll see if it adds up

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:22.100
we'll see if it adds up
 

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.160
we'll see if it adds up
I'll be honest a lot of this depends on

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:24.170
I'll be honest a lot of this depends on
 

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:25.809
I'll be honest a lot of this depends on
what it's just like lost a lot of it

00:13:25.809 --> 00:13:25.819
what it's just like lost a lot of it
 

00:13:25.819 --> 00:13:27.429
