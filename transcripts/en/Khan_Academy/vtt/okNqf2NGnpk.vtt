00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.670
I want to make a little
clarification for the last

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:03.200
three videos.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.600
They've all been of the form:
determine whether the

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.160
statement is always, sometimes,
or never true, and

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.940
explain why.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.800
And then this was the actual
statement that they gave in

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.860
the last problem.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.840
And to be frank, I think these
problems are written-- They're

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.680
not completely well
constructed.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.800
Because when they say the
statement, the assumption is,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.540
that this whole thing over
here is this statement.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.010
That this whole thing
is a statement.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.480
Not just this first part.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.080
Not just the 3x is greater
than or equal to x.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.090
So if you assume that this whole
thing is a statement, we

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.150
saw in the last video that
this is never true.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:49.230
I mean 3x is greater than or
equal to x only if x is

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.450
greater than or equal to 0.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.590
We saw this in the last video.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.880
It is not true for
all real numbers.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.980
3x is greater than or equal
to x is not true

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.910
for all real numbers.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.690
This is not true for
all real numbers.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.230
And the reason why I say that
this was kind of a strangely

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:18.230
constructed question is I think
the goal of the problem

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.630
writer is that they wanted
us to write sometimes.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.620
Which is what we did
in the last videos.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.110
But if you say sometimes, you're
actually interpreting

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.430
this as the statement,
not the whole thing.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.330
You could say that 3x is greater
than or equal to x

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.620
sometimes for certain
real numbers.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.380
Sometimes.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.110
This is true.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.190
You can say this is
true sometimes.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.690
But this whole thing, 3x is
greater than or equal to x for

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.610
all or numbers, is not
sometimes true and

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:46.300
sometimes not true.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.240
This is never true.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.620
You can never say it's
for all real numbers.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.640
It's not like this is true on
Monday and then on Tuesday

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.550
this becomes not true.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.260
And then on Wednesday
it becomes true.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.230
This is never true.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.400
Because the statement for all
real numbers just won't work.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.040
You can't say for all real
numbers 3x is greater than or

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.490
equal to x.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.460
I hope I'm not muddying
up the issue here.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.730
But I want to make
it very clear.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.570
Because the statement is
a false statement.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.660
This is a false statement.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.640
So if you really want to think
about it, if you view this

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.780
whole thing as a statement, this
statement is never true.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.180
It's not like it's true on
Monday and then all of a

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.660
sudden not true the next month
after that or all of a sudden

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.990
it becomes true again.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.740
No, it's never going
to be true.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.420
I don't care how long you wait
or how far in the past you go,

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.015
this statement will never be
true that 3x is greater than

00:02:34.015 --> 00:02:36.380
or equal to x for all
real numbers x.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.385
The problem writer wanted us to
circle sometimes because as

00:02:40.385 --> 00:02:42.130
I already stated-- and I'm
maybe getting a little

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.710
repetitive here --because I
think they wanted us to think

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.440
about the statement as 3x is
greater than or equal to x.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.053
So my general opinion-- I mean,
3x is greater than or

00:02:51.053 --> 00:02:55.230
equal to x sometimes for
some real numbers.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.770
But not for all real numbers.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.750
So you'd say sometimes if
this was the statement.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.250
And you would say never
true if this whole

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.510
thing was the statement.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.060
I hope I'm not muddying up.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.060
But it's always important
because I think sometimes some

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.210
of the hardest questions in
algebra are, to some degree,

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.410
strangely constructed questions
where the answer

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.480
writer was, or the question
writer was, trying to get you

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.270
to go in some direction.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.790
And I actually looked at what
they wanted and that's why I

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.140
wrote and said sometimes.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.540
But, if you really think about
it, the answer is never.
