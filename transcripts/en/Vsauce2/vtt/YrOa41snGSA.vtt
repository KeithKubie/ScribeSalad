00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.290
The plant pregnancy project illustrates the
impact humans have on plants by encouraging

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.860
them to care for plants as lovingly as pets
or babies.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.929
And tandem is a water-saving concept for public
men's rooms where a sink is combined with

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:15.929
a urinal.

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:16.929
Vsauce!

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:17.929
Kevin here.

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:22.319
This is MindBlow.

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:26.159
Uniqul allows a user to buy things with their
face.

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:31.089
The world's first facial recognition payment
system simply requires the customer to confirm

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:34.250
their purchase by clicking okay on a tablet.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.230
The system recognizes your face and access
your information from its database and cuts

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.110
down transaction time to less than 5 seconds.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.820
They're preparing to test the system in Helsinki
and in case you're wondering about differentiating

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.640
identical twins they're going to need to enter
a pin password.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.000
The IH2 Azzurra Hand is the first robotic
hand on the market that is human-sized and

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.970
able to replicate real human hand functions
at human-like speeds.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.150
Created by Italian-based company Prensillia
- it can grasp different items at different

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.659
weights with both power and precision grasps
as well as advanced digit manipulation and

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.170
sensing abilities.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.780
And its uses range from prosthetics to humanoid
robotics and various research applications.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.280
Akira Miyawaki is creating forests to reduce
tsunami damage.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.700
The 1000 year Kibonooka project features dense
deep rooted trees planted in large mounds

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.369
created by using debris from previous tsunami
destruction and locating these along the shores

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.389
in Japan so that they can greatly reduce the
negative impact of future tsunamis by reducing

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:42.960
the energy potential of the wave.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.229
This app lets you know in realtime which restaurants
have available seating.

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.719
The system collects data throughout the dining
experience from seating and ordering to paying

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:56.340
the bill by working with the restaurant's
point of sale system - giving real time exact

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.359
updates depending on the actual situations
happening inside the restaurant - giving users

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:05.950
in Japan the ability to choose a restaurant
based on seating availability.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.830
Here's the design for the fold out solar charger
for the Volvo V60 Plug In Hybrid.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.830
So yeah.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.610
Boxed is furniture in a suitcase.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.390
The adaptable furniture designed by Tyrone
Stoddart has the ability to be a coffee table,

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.590
a desk, two stools, and a lamp.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.430
It then can all be broken down and put back
into its case to be carried off to a new location.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.950
Fiberio is a touchscreen that senses fingerprints
freeing users from having to carry any other

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.500
type of identification.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.360
The fiber optic plate the screen uses gives
it the ability to both display images and

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.860
sense fingerprints at the same time.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.740
Applications for this could be in the workplace
where based on your fingerprints the system

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.390
would only allow you to access data that you
are given cleared for.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.090
Bones of a new dinosaur were found in Utah
and they look kinda like a cow and a triceratops

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.300
had a baby.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.080
The Medi robot created by the University of
Calgary was made to sooth children getting

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.080
vaccines.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.690
The robot plays with the kids, high fives
them and teaches them relaxation techniques

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.510
for before during and after their shots.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.860
And apparently he also does Tai Chi.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.200
ERO is a concrete recycling robot that disassembles
concrete structures using water jets to crack

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.610
the surface of the concrete and then suck
up the debris.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.980
The ERO makes the destruction of concrete
cleaner and more effective because previous

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.950
systems created huge dusty mounds of concrete
and metal to be sorted through and it also

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.590
saves a lot of water by recycling it back
through itself.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.130
Finally here's female tungara frog attracted
to a potential mate and that is actually a

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.440
robotic version of her male counterpart.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:55.630
I am going to leave you with a gymnastic robot
landing a quadruple backflip off of a bar

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:51.160
- and as always thanks for watching.
