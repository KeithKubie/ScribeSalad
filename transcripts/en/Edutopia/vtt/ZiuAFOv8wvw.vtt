00:00:08.716 --> 00:00:11.086
&gt;&gt;Teacher: The assassin's going
to start winking at people,

00:00:11.626 --> 00:00:14.716
and when they wink at
someone, that person dies.

00:00:14.716 --> 00:00:16.876
And the detective's job is to find

00:00:16.876 --> 00:00:20.766
out who the assassin is before
everyone in the room dies.

00:00:21.046 --> 00:00:25.316
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In every middle school in
Louisville, Kentucky, the day begins

00:00:25.636 --> 00:00:26.996
with a healthy dose of fun.

00:00:26.996 --> 00:00:32.386
For twenty minutes each morning,
students and teachers engage

00:00:32.386 --> 00:00:37.346
in a series of games and discussions
designed to engender empathy

00:00:37.346 --> 00:00:39.256
and encourage collaboration.

00:00:39.256 --> 00:00:41.196
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Speak up for your
friend and let somebody know.

00:00:41.196 --> 00:00:43.386
&gt;&gt;Narrator: These morning
meetings are a key component

00:00:43.386 --> 00:00:46.576
of the district's social
emotional learning initiative,

00:00:46.636 --> 00:00:49.976
called CARE for Kids,
which has been spearheaded

00:00:49.976 --> 00:00:52.256
by Superintendent Shelly Berman.

00:00:52.596 --> 00:00:56.226
&gt;&gt;Sheldon: There's a pretty complex
puzzle that we have to put together

00:00:56.226 --> 00:00:57.996
to have to have a successful school.

00:00:58.646 --> 00:01:03.216
But a foundational element
of that puzzle is the culture

00:01:03.216 --> 00:01:04.226
and climate of that school.

00:01:04.846 --> 00:01:07.056
And when students feel safe--

00:01:07.276 --> 00:01:09.656
&gt;&gt;Principal: Hello, sweet girl,
you have a good day, okay?

00:01:10.096 --> 00:01:13.486
&gt;&gt;Sheldon: When they feel that that
culture and climate supports them,

00:01:13.556 --> 00:01:16.896
when they feel cared about, not
only by the adults in the school,

00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:21.036
but by other students in the
school, they can do their best.

00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:22.336
&gt;&gt;Good morning, Casey.

00:01:22.476 --> 00:01:23.436
&gt;&gt;Good morning, Tessa.

00:01:24.236 --> 00:01:25.436
&gt;&gt;Sheldon: We have morning meetings,

00:01:25.436 --> 00:01:27.146
which are really community
building meetings.

00:01:27.146 --> 00:01:29.976
Students greet each other
and there's eye contact

00:01:29.976 --> 00:01:30.976
and handshakes and things.

00:01:31.476 --> 00:01:32.656
&gt;&gt;[in Spanish] Buenos dias, amigo.

00:01:32.656 --> 00:01:34.566
&gt;&gt;[in Spanish] Buenos dias, amiga.

00:01:35.076 --> 00:01:37.496
&gt;&gt;Sheldon: And then there's
sharing about each other's lives.

00:01:37.676 --> 00:01:38.426
&gt;&gt;What you do?

00:01:38.696 --> 00:01:40.166
&gt;&gt;I had a football game.

00:01:40.546 --> 00:01:42.666
&gt;&gt;Did you all win?

00:01:42.756 --> 00:01:43.026
&gt;&gt;No.

00:01:43.026 --> 00:01:46.776
&gt;&gt;Our friend's house
burnt down this weekend.

00:01:46.776 --> 00:01:51.006
&gt;&gt;My gosh, were they able to find
somewhere to stay after it happened?

00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:53.596
&gt;&gt;Uh-huh, they're living
in this one hotel.

00:01:53.596 --> 00:01:54.536
I forgot what it's called.

00:01:55.076 --> 00:01:58.416
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The homestead student
body president, who acts as a mentor

00:01:58.416 --> 00:02:02.936
to this sixth grade class, has seen
dramatic changes since the CARE

00:02:02.936 --> 00:02:06.376
for Kids initiative came to
his school two years ago.

00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:10.076
&gt;&gt;Paul: Before CARE for Kids,
it was mainly a disaster

00:02:10.076 --> 00:02:14.116
because we had a whole lot of
bullying going on around here,

00:02:14.116 --> 00:02:17.376
kids getting scared to
come to school, people,

00:02:17.636 --> 00:02:20.776
they're hitting people,
more violent stuff.

00:02:20.776 --> 00:02:22.826
And now that CARE for
Kids has came along,

00:02:23.336 --> 00:02:25.686
it had changed the whole
atmosphere in the school building.

00:02:25.686 --> 00:02:26.556
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Should look like fair.

00:02:26.676 --> 00:02:28.976
That means you want everybody
to have a fair chance.

00:02:29.176 --> 00:02:31.886
&gt;&gt;Paul: It's teaching kids
how to care for one another,

00:02:32.006 --> 00:02:35.966
how to be a bigger person
and how to resolve conflicts.

00:02:36.046 --> 00:02:39.606
&gt;&gt;I'm going to get
everybody to move, ready?

00:02:39.956 --> 00:02:46.626
When the cold wind blows, it
blows for whoever has on shoes.

00:02:48.146 --> 00:02:52.736
&gt;&gt;When you give us activities where
we able to move, get all our noises

00:02:52.736 --> 00:02:55.466
out before school and stuff, it
gets us more hyped about learning.

00:02:55.806 --> 00:02:56.616
&gt;&gt;Two more minutes, you guys.

00:02:56.796 --> 00:03:00.066
&gt;&gt;Bill: We have increased our
attendance, our pupil attendance,

00:03:00.146 --> 00:03:04.266
every single pupil month, as
compared to the previous year,

00:03:04.386 --> 00:03:09.436
so created an environment, I think,
of less problems in the classroom

00:03:09.436 --> 00:03:11.036
and in the school in
terms of behavior,

00:03:11.536 --> 00:03:14.266
and a sense of students
wanting to be at school.

00:03:14.506 --> 00:03:17.566
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Look at the name on
your piece of paper and think

00:03:18.096 --> 00:03:20.846
of something nice to
say about that person.

00:03:21.196 --> 00:03:22.436
&gt;&gt;It isn't touchy feely stuff.

00:03:22.836 --> 00:03:23.586
&gt;&gt;Good morning, Storm.

00:03:23.776 --> 00:03:24.816
&gt;&gt;Good morning, Diedre.

00:03:24.816 --> 00:03:25.436
&gt;&gt;I like your humor.

00:03:25.956 --> 00:03:32.226
&gt;&gt;Sheldon: It's core social skills,
that give students the experience

00:03:32.876 --> 00:03:36.476
and the knowledge and talent to
work effectively with others.

00:03:36.946 --> 00:03:37.986
&gt;&gt;Thanks for always being nice.

00:03:39.376 --> 00:03:40.496
&gt;&gt;Sheldon: This is serious work.

00:03:41.166 --> 00:03:44.566
It's serious work to create a sense
of community and it's serious work

00:03:44.596 --> 00:03:48.446
on the students' part to be able
to manage themselves in a way

00:03:48.646 --> 00:03:52.306
that is constructive, and that's
the most important contribution

00:03:52.306 --> 00:03:52.786
that they learn.

00:03:52.976 --> 00:03:55.996
&gt;&gt;Teacher: How did it feel to say
something nice about someone else?

00:03:56.166 --> 00:03:57.596
&gt;&gt;Student: It felt good,
'cause I actually got

00:03:57.596 --> 00:03:59.216
to say something positive
about somebody.

00:04:00.086 --> 00:04:02.886
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay, we've been
discussing bullying all week long.

00:04:03.146 --> 00:04:06.276
What are some ways that
we can stop the bullying?

00:04:06.536 --> 00:04:09.616
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Teachers who conduct
the morning meetings draw on CARE

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:12.556
for Kids curriculum
materials and participate

00:04:12.636 --> 00:04:15.486
in several training
sessions throughout the year.

00:04:15.516 --> 00:04:18.366
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And I think that's what
I see you all, if you struggle

00:04:18.366 --> 00:04:21.206
with anything, is the language,
because it is so different

00:04:21.206 --> 00:04:22.676
than corrective language.

00:04:22.756 --> 00:04:26.186
It's all, the negative or,
"Don't do that, don't do this.

00:04:26.276 --> 00:04:29.896
This is what you did wrong,"
whereas the language in CARE

00:04:29.896 --> 00:04:33.386
and in developmental designs
is all about self regulation,

00:04:33.386 --> 00:04:35.506
about acknowledging what you've done.

00:04:35.506 --> 00:04:38.006
It's all in a positive,
it's non confrontational.

00:04:38.226 --> 00:04:40.156
So is that what you all
see, is the language,

00:04:40.156 --> 00:04:41.486
as probably the biggest change?

00:04:41.486 --> 00:04:45.256
&gt;&gt;Narrator: There's also a CARE for
Kids leadership team in each school,

00:04:45.616 --> 00:04:48.776
which includes the principal
and key staff mentors

00:04:48.906 --> 00:04:50.526
who mentor their colleagues.

00:04:50.526 --> 00:04:52.336
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Maybe they'll
become more engaged.

00:04:52.816 --> 00:04:56.166
As far as the one young man
that, you know, we had discussed

00:04:56.166 --> 00:04:59.556
and he's sometimes, you
know, has an issue...

00:04:59.556 --> 00:05:03.376
&gt;&gt;We need to politely ask him to
take a break out of the classroom--

00:05:03.376 --> 00:05:06.286
&gt;&gt;Joanna: Tell Jasmine what
you think is special about her.

00:05:06.456 --> 00:05:08.016
&gt;&gt;I like when you share with me.

00:05:08.636 --> 00:05:10.036
&gt;&gt;Thank you-- Caroline.

00:05:10.396 --> 00:05:12.576
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The morning meetings
and other elements of CARE

00:05:12.576 --> 00:05:15.736
for Kids have helped
promote academic gains

00:05:15.736 --> 00:05:20.566
and reduced disciplinary problems
since it was adopted in 2007.

00:05:21.066 --> 00:05:24.796
&gt;&gt;Joanna: Jasmine, tell us something
that's really special about you.

00:05:24.996 --> 00:05:26.646
&gt;&gt;I like to ride my bike.

00:05:26.906 --> 00:05:30.826
&gt;&gt;Joanna: The whole morning meeting
not only sets a really good tone

00:05:30.826 --> 00:05:34.006
for the students, but
it sets a tone for me.

00:05:34.116 --> 00:05:36.276
&gt;&gt;Thanks for filling my bucket.

00:05:36.276 --> 00:05:38.496
&gt;&gt;Joanna: How did they fill
your bucket today, Jasmine?

00:05:39.366 --> 00:05:41.306
&gt;&gt;Because they was real nice to me.

00:05:41.766 --> 00:05:44.976
&gt;&gt;Joanna: And what happens when
your bucket keeps filling up?

00:05:46.406 --> 00:05:48.696
&gt;&gt;My heart starting dancing.

00:05:48.876 --> 00:05:50.846
&gt;&gt;Because people are?

00:05:51.066 --> 00:05:51.266
&gt;&gt;All: Nice.

00:05:52.116 --> 00:05:53.666
&gt;&gt;Saying nice things to her.

00:05:54.126 --> 00:05:57.066
&gt;&gt;Joanna: When I see them first
thing in the morning, and the smiles

00:05:57.066 --> 00:06:00.976
on their faces, they're excited,
they want to be here, I'm ready.

00:06:01.216 --> 00:06:03.506
My bucket is full.

00:06:05.626 --> 00:06:07.536
