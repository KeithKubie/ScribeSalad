00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.980
Dr. Wiseman,

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:02.020
Ahaha, thank you

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.240
What have we got today, what are we doing?

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.020
Okay, today we're going to talk about reading numbers

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.480
I don't mean like numerology,

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.420
like reading the stars or anything

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.720
I mean, actually seeing a number and reading it and speaking it,

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.600
and the processes that happen when you are doing that.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.200
If we're gonna talk about reading, then we probably should think about

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.720
words quickly because we know a whole lot about how we read words.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.250
There are two different processes in the brain when we read words. We can either

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.489
read words that we're familiar with which are legal words

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:32.809
and those are ones that we have like a
long-term memory representation of

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.460
so words that you can find in the dictionary 
Brady: Go on, give me some

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.989
Dr Wiseman: cat, lamppost, elephant, tutu

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.469
that's a really interesting mental image
I just got there

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.180
I don't know where that came from those
are just four of the many words are

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.100
available to you

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.130
and we know that people can read those
because they see it and they recognize the

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.070
kind of shape of it

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.250
and then they produce the noise they
produce the phonological form of that word

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.100
however when you're reading something
that's a non-word like

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.970
BLWRGAHLMARJJ

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.869
you're actually doing something very different
because you can't recognize it and then produce it

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.189
you're actually looking at it

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:11.240
letter by letter so we know there are
two different routes that you can take

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.360
when reading words and non-words.
Now if we think about it there is actually an

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.969
equivalent to this with numbers

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:21.020
now your reaction to me saying that is
what's a non-number because

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.229
there's no such thing as a dictionary
of numbers and there are infinitely

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.090
many numbers I've checked it on
Wikipedia if you go to the list of

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.740
numbers Wikipedia article it will tell you

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.080
that is an incomplete list, so there are, actually I've double checked an infinite number of numbers

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.291
Brady: if we're going to allow things like BLWRGAHLMARJJ

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.200
there's probably an infinite number of words. 
Dr W: BLWRGAHLMARJJ is a non-word

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.619
so that falls outside of the scope
there is no numerical equivalent to

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:46.520
BLWRGAHLMARJJ

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.869
so what are we actually looking at?
the equivalent

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.270
is whether or not the numbers that
you're reading

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.319
are familiar, or meaningful to you, or whether or not they're

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:03.179
unfamiliar, or meaningless to you.
The thing that happens in your brain when you read

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:04.609
a number that you're familiar with

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:07.909
is different to what happens when you
read a number

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.420
that you are unfamiliar with
Brady: so it's the same as with words?

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.040
Dr W: exactly exactly there are multiple
different routes that you can choose to read a number

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.500
so if you ask me how you define a familiar number, the answer is

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.610
poorly. It's super subjective. There are
numbers that are familiar to me

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.650
that to me that will mean absolutely nothing to you and
vice versa there are

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.760
a massive set of numbers that culturally we all find familiar

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.810
so for example the the year 2015 thats
familiar to all of us

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.080
but if I was to pick the number

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.470
1804 that probably doesn't mean much to
you

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.870
no? that's because it's my birthday
how dare you not know when my birthday is

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.000
Brady: What, as in the 18th of the 4th?
Dr W: exactly, so that number however

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.140
is very familiar to myself I think the
number 1066

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.400
is probably a familiar number to most
people

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.090
however having had that assumption very
confidently around a lot of people I

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.480
realize that some people's knowledge of
history

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.490
is not exactly as good as you might imagine 
Brady: I guess numbers that are

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.500
like titles of films and things like that 
Dr W: exactly

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.020
Brady: lower numbers are better for this?
Dr W: I have done some research on this and I

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.810
basically made this survey and got people to just type in a load of numbers they liked and then

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.590
assessed whether or not they thought they were familiar or random the distribution

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.190
was the case that a lot of the lower
numbers were very much more familiar to people

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.200
and then as you went up in magnitude the
frequency of familiar numbers that you got

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.700
decreased however there were like
nice peaks

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.880
you get peaks for numbers that look like
years

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.140
so I wanted to know when the
kind of future would end I think I did

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.370
this a couple years ago

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.980
so 2013 was a familiar number to people 14 15 16 was

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.580
but 2017 people decided was not familiar to them so 
Brady: four years?

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.840
Dr W: yes four years that's the end of the future and

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.200
people don't care about it after after
that it appears

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.180
obviously now you're sitting there thinking well 2017 is highly familiar to me

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.210
that's because that's two years away and
you're in the future now so there are other things

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.950
90210 is a familiar thing to people
and

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.520
that's interesting itself because it began
as a zip code but

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.790
it probably doesn't mean a zip code to most people probably means the TV program

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.020
there's a whole load of reasons for 
numbers to be familiar to us

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.250
okay okay let's
explore this so I said there were

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.290
multiple different routes

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.720
I'm going to give us a start number
so this is the number that we are going

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.710
to be reading

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.830
the most basic thing we can do with it
is we can take it

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.590
and turn into its Arabic numeral form
so that is

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.720
when we're reading it out we get out at the end
1 9 8 9

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.930
it has no other meaning beyond it's
just a string of digits and they

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.590
don't interfere with or talk to either
either

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.650
the other digits around it very straightforward obviously now the next thing we can do is

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.620
we can turn into its number word form. Now this is probably going to be a bit contentious.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.040
I'm going to turn into the word form
nineteen hundred and eighty nine

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.520
I say contentious because I think that
when you read that number that is

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.960
probably not the first thing you go to
when you read it as a word

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.060
so with the first one you haven't
done any processing on it you've just gone

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.430
digit by digit and turned into its phonological form whereas with this second way of

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.210
processing it what you have to do is work
out exactly

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.770
which digit you're reading and also the
position of that digit within the number

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.360
so this nine gets read out as nine whereas this
nine gets

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.610
joined to the one and becomes the number nineteen. 
On the mathematical route

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.730
this means we might come up with some mathematical facts about the number

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.410
so when you read that number you might
say I know that that number

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.460
is greater than a 1000 I know that that
number

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.980
is odd there's a whole load of things you might notice. That number

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.450
represents a kind of an amount of
something

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.690
it has a meaning

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.600
beyond the first two levels we talked about 
Brady: it has constituent parts and ...

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.919
Dr W: exactly, it has rules that it adheres to.
Up until, like, quite recently

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:05.070
all models of number reading have really just focused on these

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.140
these three levels we call this one
surface reading and this one is a deeper

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.410
semantic reading of it. What you have
to do is not just

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.730
turn into a phonological form you've also
had to appreciate

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.080
kind of the meaning behind and what it actually
relates to

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:24.360
there is a fourth level and this is
kind of something that we've only

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.730
recently started trying to put into

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.669
models of number reading and that
fourth level is something called

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:31.110
encyclopedic look up

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.280
and this is what happens when the number
that you're reading

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.270
has some position in your long-term
memory that is

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.700
when the number the you're reading means
something to you

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.860
when you've come across it before in some
circumstance

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.380
so, this number you may have realized

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.810
looks quite a lot like a year for
example 1989

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.080
to me the reason I've chosen it is
because that

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.320
is a personal important to me because
that's when my sister was born

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.360
that's my sister yeah, yay!

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.820
there is also a cultural significance to
this year

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.650
at the moment Taylor Swift's incredible
new album

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.140
is called 1989
Brady: is that 'cos she was born in 1989?

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.630
Dr W: I assume so
Brady: is Taylor Swift your sister?

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.640
Dr W: (sharp intake of breath) I've chosen this method to tell everyone that yes

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.060
Taylor Swift is my younger sister. 
So there is this

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:27.780
more cultural and kinda shared reason for
this number to be familiar

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.990
to me, you Brady I know, and

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.320
probably millions and millions and
millions of other people that have

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.310
caused this album to be at the number one
spot for 10 weeks running or something

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:37.820
like that see you get this

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:42.840
cultural significance: Taylor.
Now there are lots of models of number reading

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:48.560
and they haven't really incorporated all
of these these these levels

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.620
together before

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:53.050
and the reason it's interesting

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:57.630
is because we can kinda prove that these
levels exist

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:00.780
it might like I say it might be kinda
obvious to you

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:05.010
that you can read these numbers like
this and you're probably not aware of

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:10.220
you doing all of these different things
but people that are aware of this

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:14.160
are researchers who look at patients
with aphasia

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.229
aphasia is a language disorder that

00:08:17.229 --> 00:08:20.310
is often caused by a brain trauma and

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:24.310
by language disorder I mean its affects your
ability to

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:28.669
affects your ability to read sometimes
it affects your ability to speak

00:08:28.669 --> 00:08:32.430
but that's all it does it doesn't
affect your

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:36.140
understanding of what you're
reading, or what you're trying to say

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.180
some people get a specific

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:42.209
effect of aphasia on their ability to
read numbers

00:08:42.209 --> 00:08:45.840
it can kind of take out some of these pathways

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.990
Brady: but not all of them?
Dr W: not all of them which is the really really

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:53.470
cool and interesting thing.
In this paper they do this case study

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:58.710
and they look at a man who is 43 and he
suffers a brain trauma and then he

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.140
he develops aphasia as a result of
that this guy

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.290
his ability to do that digit by digit
reading

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:08.520
had been lost and so when he was
shown a number that

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.810
he was unfamiliar with he couldn't read
it out loud that means

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:15.910
this pathway here been taken out this
part way here

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:19.580
had been taken out as well so no longer
could he rely

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.430
on just sounding out numbers or
producing number words

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:27.280
so he was very interested in racing
rally cars in particular, so he was

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.510
shown this number

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:31.670
he said "number of cars that win"

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:36.060
"it was my first car, it begins with a P, Peugeot, Renault, it's Peugeot!"

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.390
four oh three, five hundred, no, five oh four

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:44.760
so that's how he managed to get to it
because 504 is a brand of Peugeot car

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.190
that according to this man wins.

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:53.190
It's the car that wins and so that shows
you exactly how he managed to read it out loud

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:56.530
he went through this encyclopedic stage

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:59.960
and found this memory representation of
the number

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.150
and was able to read it out loud
Brady: so if you'd shown him

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:07.500
505 he would never ... he would have had no chance .. he couldn't even say it

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.380
Dr W: no, he wouldn't be able to do it

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:11.600
Brady: he wouldn't even have been able to say "that's a 5"

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.580
"that's a zero, that's a 5"
Dr W: he would read this unfamiliar number out

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.890
as the similar familiar number if you see what I mean

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:22.080
Brady: so if I showed him 505 
he might have said 504!

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.080
Dr W: Yes exactly yeah, so there was one example
the patient is

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.450
is French and apparently in France the

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:31.550
the common thing for doctors to check
your breathing is to ask you to say the

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:32.510
number 33

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:36.610
and so that makes it a familiar number
to him and he was shown the number

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:40.400
330 which was unfamiliar to him

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.920
and he sat looked at it and he said "33?"

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.400
because he was desperately trying to
read it out and so he

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.590
took this encyclopedic route and that
was the closest number that he could

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:51.750
find was 33

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.579
Brady: you didn't cross out the mathematical branch

00:10:54.579 --> 00:10:59.179
Does that mean if I showed him two numbers he
would know which was bigger than the other or ...

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:02.639
Dr W: yes it does mean that,
he was able to do that

00:11:02.639 --> 00:11:05.809
he still had the mathematical ability

00:11:05.809 --> 00:11:10.100
and he was still able to tell which of
two numbers were

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:14.869
larger. If he was shown equations, he tell
you whether the equation was correct or not

00:11:14.869 --> 00:11:18.439
you read in a mathematical way, you kind of
access this set of facts

00:11:18.439 --> 00:11:22.589
but you still have to read it out loud
this patient yes was able to

00:11:22.589 --> 00:11:25.889
form comparisons understand inequalities

00:11:25.889 --> 00:11:29.429
but he had still lost

00:11:29.429 --> 00:11:32.899
this branch so he couldn't read the
numbers out

00:11:32.899 --> 00:11:37.959
Brady: so he knew that 10 plus 10 equals 20 is correct 
but couldn't say it out loud

00:11:37.959 --> 00:11:40.089
Dr W: couldn't say it out loud, no,
couldn't get to it

00:11:40.089 --> 00:11:43.339
unless for some reason 20 was very familiar
to him

00:11:43.339 --> 00:11:47.529
the number nineteen he read initially as
the "that's the age my daughter that"

00:11:47.529 --> 00:11:49.649
"the age of my daughter" before finally getting to

00:11:49.649 --> 00:11:53.429
19 so if he'd have been able
to do some maths that

00:11:53.429 --> 00:11:57.189
got to nineteen then yes but he would
have been using this route and not this

00:11:57.189 --> 00:11:59.089
route to say it

00:12:02.769 --> 00:12:04.110
it's twice a day really that I

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:07.810
a good chunk a spare time when I take
the dogs out for a walk and that'd seem

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:11.019
like a great chance to catch up on some
the latest books

00:12:11.019 --> 00:12:15.410
but reading and walking at the same time
has its pitfalls

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:19.339
don't worry

00:12:19.339 --> 00:12:23.550
help is at hand crack out the phone and
and download an audiobook from

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:27.709
audible.com
now audible has a staggering range of books

and you can have your choice piped into
your ears

00:12:31.529 --> 00:12:36.120
with just a few taps if your thumb
there are plenty I could recommend but I'm not

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.560
above being a bit biased

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:42.329
so why not look at these ones by people
who actually star in numberphile videos

00:12:42.329 --> 00:12:45.529
and I'll put the titles of their books below
in the video description

00:12:45.529 --> 00:12:51.489
now if you go to audible, and you use the URL
audible.com/numberphile

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:55.440

and happy puppies what more could you ask
check them out thanks to audible

00:13:19.839 --> 00:13:24.089
and never walk into a tree again

00:13:24.089 --> 00:13:28.000
I'm gonna do a 'not equal to' just in case you were still thinking that maybe Taylor

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:28.699
might be my sister
