So, to review everybody,

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.610
we have a server that wants
to communicate with a device.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.670
Now, you already know how
to create an Android app.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.910
You're learning that now, obviously.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.630
And, we just covered
downstream messaging,

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.640
where the server sends messages to
the device, so we're good there.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.440
But you probably want to look in to
how to build a server at some point,

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.610
because I didn't teach you that.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.530
You also might be wondering about when
the device wants to send a message

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.790
to the server.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.850
Although I didn't cover it, Google
Cloud Messaging does support this and

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.650
you can learn more
from the documentation.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:33.470
So check out the links and

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.750
the instruction notes everybody and
good work.
