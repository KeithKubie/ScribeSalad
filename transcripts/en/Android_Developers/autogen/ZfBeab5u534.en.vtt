00:07:59.980 --> 00:07:59.990
of boiled down I think to three main
 

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:02.680
of boiled down I think to three main
areas screen considerations input

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:02.690
areas screen considerations input
 

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.320
areas screen considerations input
considerations and kind of building and

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:05.330
considerations and kind of building and
 

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.180
considerations and kind of building and
setting up your apk so that when it's

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:07.190
setting up your apk so that when it's
 

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:10.030
setting up your apk so that when it's
tributed it works across the most

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:10.040
tributed it works across the most
 

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.390
tributed it works across the most
devices possible and you know for

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:13.400
devices possible and you know for
 

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.240
devices possible and you know for
certain devices there's certain areas

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:16.250
certain devices there's certain areas
 

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.280
certain devices there's certain areas
that maybe there's more considerations

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:18.290
that maybe there's more considerations
 

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:21.250
that maybe there's more considerations
you have to think of or or deal with but

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:21.260
you have to think of or or deal with but
 

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.600
you have to think of or or deal with but
if you're going for the largest

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:22.610
if you're going for the largest
 

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:24.520
if you're going for the largest
compatibility across all these different

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:24.530
compatibility across all these different
 

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:26.470
compatibility across all these different
types of large screen devices you're

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:26.480
types of large screen devices you're
 

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.030
types of large screen devices you're
gonna have to kind of look at each area

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:28.040
gonna have to kind of look at each area
 

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.390
gonna have to kind of look at each area
so let's you know how do you handle this

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:31.400
so let's you know how do you handle this
 

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.610
so let's you know how do you handle this
with one apk let's kind of touch into

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:33.620
with one apk let's kind of touch into
 

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:34.870
with one apk let's kind of touch into
this right I mentioned it's only it's

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:34.880
this right I mentioned it's only it's
 

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.600
this right I mentioned it's only it's
the same apk across all these devices

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:37.610
the same apk across all these devices
 

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:42.520
the same apk across all these devices
how would you handle this so high very

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:42.530
how would you handle this so high very
 

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.110
how would you handle this so high very
high level you handle this

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:44.120
high level you handle this
 

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.199
high level you handle this
with configuration changes so in Android

00:08:46.199 --> 00:08:46.209
with configuration changes so in Android
 

00:08:46.209 --> 00:08:48.790
with configuration changes so in Android
if you're not familiar anytime the

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:48.800
if you're not familiar anytime the
 

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.369
if you're not familiar anytime the
system detects a device configuration

00:08:51.369 --> 00:08:51.379
system detects a device configuration
 

00:08:51.379 --> 00:08:53.619

change it's gonna automatically restart

00:08:53.619 --> 00:08:53.629
change it's gonna automatically restart
 

00:08:53.629 --> 00:08:57.670
change it's gonna automatically restart
your activity and restart it with new

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:57.680
your activity and restart it with new
 

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.650
your activity and restart it with new
resources that allow your app to kind of

00:08:59.650 --> 00:08:59.660
resources that allow your app to kind of
 

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.509
resources that allow your app to kind of
change and adapt for that new

00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:01.519
change and adapt for that new
 

00:09:01.519 --> 00:09:04.449
change and adapt for that new
configuration so the most important task

00:09:04.449 --> 00:09:04.459
configuration so the most important task
 

00:09:04.459 --> 00:09:06.220
configuration so the most important task
for you as game developers to kind of

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:06.230
for you as game developers to kind of
 

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:08.499
for you as game developers to kind of
consider is handling these configuration

00:09:08.499 --> 00:09:08.509
consider is handling these configuration
 

00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:11.230
consider is handling these configuration
chains configuration changes

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:11.240
chains configuration changes
 

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.059

default Android system will do this

00:09:22.929 --> 00:09:22.939
default Android system will do this
 

00:09:22.939 --> 00:09:24.850
default Android system will do this
automatically so a lot of you if you're

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:24.860
automatically so a lot of you if you're
 

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.319
automatically so a lot of you if you're
not doing it right now you're probably

00:09:26.319 --> 00:09:26.329
not doing it right now you're probably
 

00:09:26.329 --> 00:09:28.299
not doing it right now you're probably
just living with Android doing it

00:09:28.299 --> 00:09:28.309
just living with Android doing it
 

00:09:28.309 --> 00:09:31.239
just living with Android doing it
automatically for you it does this by

00:09:31.239 --> 00:09:31.249
automatically for you it does this by
 

00:09:31.249 --> 00:09:32.980
automatically for you it does this by
invoking on save instance State before

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:32.990
invoking on save instance State before
 

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:34.960
invoking on save instance State before
it will restart your activity which lets

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:34.970
it will restart your activity which lets
 

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:37.389
it will restart your activity which lets
you kind of save some information that

00:09:37.389 --> 00:09:37.399
you kind of save some information that
 

00:09:37.399 --> 00:09:38.650
you kind of save some information that
you need to kind of restart your

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:38.660
you need to kind of restart your
 

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.139
you need to kind of restart your
activity but for a lot of resource heavy

00:09:41.139 --> 00:09:41.149
activity but for a lot of resource heavy
 

00:09:41.149 --> 00:09:44.410
activity but for a lot of resource heavy
games this is not ideal because if we

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:44.420
games this is not ideal because if we
 

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.540
games this is not ideal because if we
really slow to restart the activity and

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:46.550
really slow to restart the activity and
 

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:49.780
really slow to restart the activity and
reallocate all those resources and in

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:49.790
reallocate all those resources and in
 

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:51.639
reallocate all those resources and in
the case of like dynamic resizing on

00:09:51.639 --> 00:09:51.649
the case of like dynamic resizing on
 

00:09:51.649 --> 00:09:53.319
the case of like dynamic resizing on
Chromebooks it can happen you can get a

00:09:53.319 --> 00:09:53.329
Chromebooks it can happen you can get a
 

00:09:53.329 --> 00:09:55.299
Chromebooks it can happen you can get a
lot of configuration change events you

00:09:55.299 --> 00:09:55.309
lot of configuration change events you
 

00:09:55.309 --> 00:09:58.509
lot of configuration change events you
know at least one per frame so it's

00:09:58.509 --> 00:09:58.519
know at least one per frame so it's
 

00:09:58.519 --> 00:10:00.429
know at least one per frame so it's
better to kind of think about and handle

00:10:00.429 --> 00:10:00.439
better to kind of think about and handle
 

00:10:00.439 --> 00:10:01.929
better to kind of think about and handle
this yourself so you know exactly how

00:10:01.929 --> 00:10:01.939
this yourself so you know exactly how
 

00:10:01.939 --> 00:10:04.119
this yourself so you know exactly how
your game is going to behave anytime a

00:10:04.119 --> 00:10:04.129
your game is going to behave anytime a
 

00:10:04.129 --> 00:10:08.049
your game is going to behave anytime a
configuration change happens so now I've

00:10:08.049 --> 00:10:08.059
configuration change happens so now I've
 

00:10:08.059 --> 00:10:09.129
configuration change happens so now I've
kind of touched on the high-level

00:10:09.129 --> 00:10:09.139
kind of touched on the high-level
 

00:10:09.139 --> 00:10:11.530
kind of touched on the high-level
aspects of configuration changes let's

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:11.540
aspects of configuration changes let's
 

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.540
aspects of configuration changes let's
see I would use them to adapt you know a

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:13.550
see I would use them to adapt you know a
 

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.090
see I would use them to adapt you know a
game across these devices starting with

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:16.100
game across these devices starting with
 

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.439
game across these devices starting with
kind of the screen considerations I

00:10:17.439 --> 00:10:17.449
kind of the screen considerations I
 

00:10:17.449 --> 00:10:21.400
kind of the screen considerations I
mentioned earlier so on devices like

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:21.410
mentioned earlier so on devices like
 

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:23.590
mentioned earlier so on devices like
Chromebooks and Samsung decks your game

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600
Chromebooks and Samsung decks your game
 

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.929
Chromebooks and Samsung decks your game
by default is going to be launched into

00:10:25.929 --> 00:10:25.939
by default is going to be launched into
 

00:10:25.939 --> 00:10:27.579
by default is going to be launched into
a windowed environment or it can be

00:10:27.579 --> 00:10:27.589
a windowed environment or it can be
 

00:10:27.589 --> 00:10:29.319
a windowed environment or it can be
dynamically resize which is something

00:10:29.319 --> 00:10:29.329
dynamically resize which is something
 

00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:30.970
dynamically resize which is something
that you know a lot of mobile developers

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:30.980
that you know a lot of mobile developers
 

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:35.259
that you know a lot of mobile developers
don't really consider and on devices

00:10:35.259 --> 00:10:35.269
don't really consider and on devices
 

00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:37.290
don't really consider and on devices
upcoming like the Samsung Galaxy fold

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:37.300
upcoming like the Samsung Galaxy fold
 

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.519
upcoming like the Samsung Galaxy fold
you know the screen and aspect ratio

00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:39.529
you know the screen and aspect ratio
 

00:10:39.529 --> 00:10:41.280
you know the screen and aspect ratio
will change whenever the user opens

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:41.290
will change whenever the user opens
 

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:43.840
will change whenever the user opens
advise from the smaller screen to the

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:43.850
advise from the smaller screen to the
 

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:47.169
advise from the smaller screen to the
larger internal screen so each of these

00:10:47.169 --> 00:10:47.179
larger internal screen so each of these
 

00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:48.460
larger internal screen so each of these
cases is going to fire off a non

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:48.470
cases is going to fire off a non
 

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:53.829
cases is going to fire off a non
configuration changed event so to handle

00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:53.839
configuration changed event so to handle
 

00:10:53.839 --> 00:10:55.419
configuration changed event so to handle
this you simply need to declare in your

00:10:55.419 --> 00:10:55.429
this you simply need to declare in your
 

00:10:55.429 --> 00:10:57.940
this you simply need to declare in your
manifest all the configurations

00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:57.950
manifest all the configurations
 

00:10:57.950 --> 00:10:59.829
manifest all the configurations
you want to handle yourself dynamically

00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839
you want to handle yourself dynamically
 

00:10:59.839 --> 00:11:02.769
you want to handle yourself dynamically
encode so in this example we're

00:11:02.769 --> 00:11:02.779
encode so in this example we're
 

00:11:02.779 --> 00:11:04.060
encode so in this example we're
declaring that we want to handle screen

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:04.070
declaring that we want to handle screen
 

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:10.690
declaring that we want to handle screen
size changes in orientation changes so

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:10.700
size changes in orientation changes so
 

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.970
size changes in orientation changes so
then in your code now your activity is

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:12.980
then in your code now your activity is
 

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.920
then in your code now your activity is
going to invoke on configuration change

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:14.930
going to invoke on configuration change
 

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:17.290
going to invoke on configuration change
whenever the screen size changes or the

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:17.300
whenever the screen size changes or the
 

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.569
whenever the screen size changes or the
orientation changes or whatever other

00:11:19.569 --> 00:11:19.579
orientation changes or whatever other
 

00:11:19.579 --> 00:11:21.670
orientation changes or whatever other
else configuration that you declare that

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:21.680
else configuration that you declare that
 

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.730
else configuration that you declare that
you want to handle so for example in

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:24.740
you want to handle so for example in
 

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.040
you want to handle so for example in
this case you could scale your OpenGL

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:27.050
this case you could scale your OpenGL
 

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:29.680
this case you could scale your OpenGL
content to match the new aspect ratio or

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:29.690
content to match the new aspect ratio or
 

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:32.530
content to match the new aspect ratio or
resolution to prevent things like

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:32.540
resolution to prevent things like
 

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.139
resolution to prevent things like
inaccessible UI elements or change your

00:11:35.139 --> 00:11:35.149
inaccessible UI elements or change your
 

00:11:35.149 --> 00:11:37.420
inaccessible UI elements or change your
input areas so they make sense on the

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:37.430
input areas so they make sense on the
 

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:41.170
input areas so they make sense on the
new screen so that's maybe how you'd

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:41.180
new screen so that's maybe how you'd
 

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.730
new screen so that's maybe how you'd
handle that kind of that case with

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:42.740
handle that kind of that case with
 

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:47.050
handle that kind of that case with

you know Android has had api's to

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:29.180
you know Android has had api's to
 

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.960
you know Android has had api's to
support keyboards Mouse and controllers

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:31.970
support keyboards Mouse and controllers
 

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:33.910
support keyboards Mouse and controllers
for a while but again a lot of game

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:33.920
for a while but again a lot of game
 

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.590
for a while but again a lot of game
developers don't consider using them

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:35.600
developers don't consider using them
 

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.970
developers don't consider using them
because they just assume it's going to

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:36.980
because they just assume it's going to
 

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:40.900
because they just assume it's going to
be a touchscreen device so the other

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:40.910
be a touchscreen device so the other
 

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:42.400
be a touchscreen device so the other
thing to kind of keep in mind is that

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:42.410
thing to kind of keep in mind is that
 

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:44.769
thing to kind of keep in mind is that
many these devices are convertibles so

00:15:44.769 --> 00:15:44.779
many these devices are convertibles so
 

00:15:44.779 --> 00:15:46.180
many these devices are convertibles so
they can switch configurations

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:46.190
they can switch configurations
 

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:48.430
they can switch configurations
on-the-fly so like a good example as a

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:48.440
on-the-fly so like a good example as a
 

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.780
on-the-fly so like a good example as a
pixel book where it can be in a

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:49.790
pixel book where it can be in a
 

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:51.910
pixel book where it can be in a
clamshell laptop mode and then you

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:51.920
clamshell laptop mode and then you
 

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.820

player can switch it to a tablet in the

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:54.830
player can switch it to a tablet in the
 

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:57.220
player can switch it to a tablet in the
middle of gameplay right so really try

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:57.230
middle of gameplay right so really try
 

00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:00.340
middle of gameplay right so really try
to anticipate all the different ways

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:00.350
to anticipate all the different ways
 

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:01.960
to anticipate all the different ways
that a play the configurations could

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:01.970
that a play the configurations could
 

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:05.050
that a play the configurations could
change during gameplay and support kind

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:05.060
change during gameplay and support kind
 

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:09.640
change during gameplay and support kind
of on-the-fly control scheme changes and

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:09.650
of on-the-fly control scheme changes and
 

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:11.680
of on-the-fly control scheme changes and
again we come back to kind of

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:11.690
again we come back to kind of
 

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:13.240
again we come back to kind of
configuration changes right how do you

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:13.250
configuration changes right how do you
 

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:15.400
configuration changes right how do you
detect this and how do you handle it so

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:15.410
detect this and how do you handle it so
 

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:18.850
detect this and how do you handle it so
the best way is to kind of specify in

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:18.860
the best way is to kind of specify in
 

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:20.860
the best way is to kind of specify in
your manifest configuration changes

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:20.870

around you know input devices such as
 

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:27.220
around you know input devices such as
keyboard and handle these on the fly and

keyboard and handle these on the fly and
 

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:29.110
keyboard and handle these on the fly and
switch the control schemes based on what

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120
switch the control schemes based on what
 

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.519
switch the control schemes based on what
configuration change events you're

00:16:30.519 --> 00:16:30.529
configuration change events you're
 

00:16:30.529 --> 00:16:35.350
configuration change events you're
getting inside of your code so you know

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360
getting inside of your code so you know
 

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.030
getting inside of your code so you know
there's many ways to do this but one of

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040
there's many ways to do this but one of
 

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.050
there's many ways to do this but one of
the ways you can do it is basically

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:38.060
the ways you can do it is basically
 

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:39.940
the ways you can do it is basically
query input manager at startup for

and kind of pull the system to see what

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:44.060
and kind of pull the system to see what
 

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:47.019
and kind of pull the system to see what
hardware input devices are available and

00:16:47.019 --> 00:16:47.029
hardware input devices are available and
 

00:16:47.029 --> 00:16:49.000
hardware input devices are available and
also make sure they're usable right

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:49.010
also make sure they're usable right
 

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:51.880
also make sure they're usable right
because just because an input device

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:51.890
because just because an input device
 

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:53.920
because just because an input device
might be available it might not be

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:53.930
might be available it might not be
 

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.079
might be available it might not be
usable because it could be a Chromebook

00:16:56.079 --> 00:16:56.089
usable because it could be a Chromebook
 

00:16:56.089 --> 00:16:58.300
usable because it could be a Chromebook
for example where it's in tablet mode

00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:58.310
for example where it's in tablet mode
 

00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:59.829
for example where it's in tablet mode
and the keyboard is there but it's not

00:16:59.829 --> 00:16:59.839
and the keyboard is there but it's not
 

00:16:59.839 --> 00:17:02.370
and the keyboard is there but it's not
usable because on the back of the device

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:02.380
usable because on the back of the device
 

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:04.419
usable because on the back of the device
so it's really important to kind of

00:17:04.419 --> 00:17:04.429
so it's really important to kind of
 

00:17:04.429 --> 00:17:07.000
so it's really important to kind of
consider this and adjust this on the fly

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:07.010
consider this and adjust this on the fly
 

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:08.949
consider this and adjust this on the fly
and just adapt to whatever is usable

00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959
and just adapt to whatever is usable
 

00:17:08.959 --> 00:17:11.770
and just adapt to whatever is usable

a little bit later and if you don't

00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:19.880
a little bit later and if you don't
 

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.329
a little bit later and if you don't
think keyboard support makes sense for

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:22.339
think keyboard support makes sense for
 

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:24.490
think keyboard support makes sense for
your game fair enough there's a lot of

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:24.500
your game fair enough there's a lot of
 

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:25.900

consider that improves accessibility if
 

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.290
consider that improves accessibility if
you do add keyboard support so things

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:32.300
you do add keyboard support so things
 

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.950
you do add keyboard support so things

automatic quality control system you

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200
automatic quality control system you
 

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.380
automatic quality control system you
should try to test it on these different

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:30.390
should try to test it on these different
 

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:33.140

to you you usually think about these
 

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:17.849
to you you usually think about these
things when building your game which are

00:39:17.849 --> 00:39:17.859
things when building your game which are
 

00:39:17.859 --> 00:39:23.579
things when building your game which are
basically hard constraints but that's

00:39:23.579 --> 00:39:23.589
basically hard constraints but that's
 

00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:25.950
basically hard constraints but that's
not true and it shouldn't be like that

00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:25.960
not true and it shouldn't be like that
 

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:28.170
not true and it shouldn't be like that
because nowadays you need to support a

00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:28.180
because nowadays you need to support a
 

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:31.170

that makes sense in your game and the

00:40:27.809 --> 00:40:27.819
that makes sense in your game and the
 

00:40:27.819 --> 00:40:29.400
that makes sense in your game and the
plain intentions and by the plain

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:29.410
plain intentions and by the plain
 

00:40:29.410 --> 00:40:30.660
plain intentions and by the plain
intention I mean that for example if

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:30.670
