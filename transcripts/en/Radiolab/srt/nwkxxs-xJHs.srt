8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,400
hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich
Radiolab. We're talking about, well,

9
00:00:31,401 --> 00:00:34,550
what are we talking about? We're
talking about sports games. Games. Yeah.

10
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:35,170
You know what,

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,530
what we're really talking about is a
fundamental behavior of everyone on earth,

12
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,960
including like wolves and
cats, wolves and cats.

13
00:00:41,961 --> 00:00:44,600
I was with you broadening more than I
would broaden, but that's, you know,

14
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,240
well go in there. Come on.
Like what a little bullets do.

15
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:52,070
They don't play a football? No, but
they tussled yes. You mean like,

16
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,210
like they play? Yes. Like
human babies. Yeah. Okay.

17
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,990
Babies and young children spend almost
all of their time playing seems so

18
00:00:59,991 --> 00:01:02,630
natural. We don't even think about it.
So let's just go with that thought.

19
00:01:02,631 --> 00:01:03,860
This is Alison Gopnik.

20
00:01:03,861 --> 00:01:07,040
She's a developmental psychologist at
the University of California at Berkeley.

21
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:11,090
Big Sports Fan. Yeah. Baseball
Oakland Fan. Professionally though,

22
00:01:11,091 --> 00:01:13,730
she studies kids and she's got
an interesting idea. She says,

23
00:01:13,731 --> 00:01:16,690
if you look at kids, how
they play over time. Yes.

24
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,470
You see that at the center of their play.

25
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:23,210
There's this really interesting tension
that exists. Tension of what kind? Well,

26
00:01:23,211 --> 00:01:26,510
you can actually hear it. So we'll get
back to Alison and just one moment.

27
00:01:26,511 --> 00:01:28,460
Here's a four year old girl named Rosa.

28
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,450
Yes. Listen to her. Describe
her imaginary friend to her dad.

29
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,420
And how does um, her
mind, you know, Antarctica

30
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,720
[inaudible] the moon. Um, what,

31
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,890
what was she doing in the Antarctic
in Antarctica? You know how she,

32
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,540
what do you use to be
boring? To Keep what?

33
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,990
Warren, why don't

34
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:04,830
she got lacquered? See I
was scared for too long.

35
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,610
How to skate and what prompted her
to move from Antarctica to the moon.

36
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:12,210
Okay.

37
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:17,210
Don't one doctorals high and now she's
thinking she wants to move back to me and

38
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,433
talk

39
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,880
it. Preschool children,

40
00:02:19,881 --> 00:02:23,160
you start seeing this wonderful
flowering of pretend play.

41
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:28,510
The children are becoming Ninjas and
princesses and superheroes at first says

42
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,030
Ellison. This is what
plays all about venting,

43
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,890
making a crazy psychedelic connections,
complete improv. You get this period.

44
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,930
Just explore. Just innovate

45
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,810
came down from the team. We don't

46
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,670
know spice host mice of course,

47
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:53,420
but if you fast forward just a couple
of years, so not four anymore with six,

48
00:02:53,421 --> 00:02:54,254
six year olds,

49
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,410
the vibe totally changes because
now it's all about rules.

50
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,920
Just the freezer. Get the Taggart,

51
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:08,110
the freezer tacky your
routing yes. Taps you.

52
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,133
Yeah.

53
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:18,080
Okay. Actually brave is free

54
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,150
with six year olds. It just sounds
really different. You hear a lot

55
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,073
this,

56
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,800
a lot of yelling about what's
allowed, what isn't allowed.

57
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,040
Last time you started out with the ball.

58
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,070
In some ways I think the
school age children are
practicing being in a society,

59
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,920
they're practicing having laws,
they're practicing having rules.

60
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,320
I don't know yet.

61
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,430
Sort of, uh, developing
a theory of sociologists.

62
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,020
So you've got these two modes of play.

63
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,660
You got the three year old
inventor who's like, okay,

64
00:03:53,661 --> 00:03:54,830
I'm just going to make this happen.

65
00:03:54,831 --> 00:03:56,780
I'm going to create
something new in the world.

66
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,080
Then you've got the six year old enforcer

67
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,200
[inaudible].

68
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,620
You can't just create what you want.
The world is bigger than we are.

69
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:06,910
We need rules.

70
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,550
And one of the things that's really
interesting about the games that seem to

71
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:15,551
stick is that the greatest games like
baseball are games that let us experience

72
00:04:17,601 --> 00:04:20,090
the world in both those ways at
the same time. In other words,

73
00:04:20,091 --> 00:04:22,460
like a good game is a kind of weird,

74
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:27,260
constantly shifting war between the three
year old in us and that the six year

75
00:04:27,261 --> 00:04:27,590
old,

76
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:32,590
I think she's probably correct because
there are games which suffer from a lack

77
00:04:33,171 --> 00:04:36,900
of the tension she's describing this
one game in particular. Okay. With that,

78
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,950
I didn't know whether
you've played it lately,

79
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:43,090
but we heard about it from this Guy
Brian Christian brighter. Yeah. Yeah.

80
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,920
It was on a recent show
talking about robots,

81
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:49,810
but he also mentioned this little
a moment. Yes, it's a moment.

82
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,350
So yeah, at the World Checkers
Championship in Glasgow,

83
00:04:53,351 --> 00:04:58,351
Scotland in 1863 it is James
Wiley against Robert Martins,

84
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,790
the two best checker players in the world.

85
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:04,180
Wiley Wiley playing a 40 game series,

86
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,320
all 40 games opened with the same three
or four moves and all 40 games were

87
00:05:09,321 --> 00:05:13,340
draws. Really? Yes. Not only that,

88
00:05:13,341 --> 00:05:17,270
21 of the 40 games are
the exact same game,

89
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,990
meaning that move from move
from move, they were precise.

90
00:05:20,991 --> 00:05:24,770
Duplicates of each other start to finish.
Every single move was the same. Yeah.

91
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,190
Yep. You know, can you imagine?
It's like a month of checkers.

92
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,960
How exactly does that happen? We'll see.

93
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,960
These guys were professional
checkers players. Yes.

94
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,170
So they studied moves that
other competitors had made.

95
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,280
They would write them down and memorize
them and they became a kind of catalog.

96
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:44,660
So at, at a certain point, every move
you saw on the checkerboard, you'd think,

97
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,561
oh yeah.

98
00:05:45,561 --> 00:05:50,510
That one checkers had hit this point
where the conventional wisdom about what

99
00:05:50,511 --> 00:05:55,511
was the proper move to play had gotten
to this point where there was now

100
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:01,180
basically a perfect game of checkers
and with the world title on the line,

101
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:06,440
both players played that perfect
game over and over and over.

102
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,120
They stuck to the script.

103
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,310
So this was really rock bottom
for the checkers community.

104
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,220
Yeah, so there you go. That's why
no one plays checkers anymore.

105
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,120
Some people play jackers I played, I
played jackers. What? No you don't.

106
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:22,950
Checkers is fine. As long as you
don't play it for too long too. Well,

107
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,090
you're a lame checker player.
You could play checkers forever.

108
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,153
Well then what's the point?

109
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,190
I mean why would you play a game that's
been gobbled up stead but by the way,

110
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:35,510
this thing that you just said
killed checkers. Yeah. This concept

111
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:39,420
has a name it's called called the book

112
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,993
[inaudible].

113
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:51,890
The danger is that the entire game
stays in book the whole time and that

114
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:57,540
dangerous has, Brian is not specifically
confined to checkers. Occasionally.

115
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:01,830
Very rarely in the chess world you'll
see two grandmasters play the exact same

116
00:07:01,831 --> 00:07:04,230
game that another pair of
grand masters played, you know,

117
00:07:04,231 --> 00:07:08,940
a year before and they'll get booze and
jeers all over the Internet and as a

118
00:07:08,941 --> 00:07:12,410
result now chess, let me, let me
talk about chess. Okay. Chess.

119
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,970
The book in chess is huge.

120
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,720
It started in the 16th century and for
hundreds of years players were keeping

121
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:20,000
track

122
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,350
moves and counter moves and counter
counter counter counter moves until by the

123
00:07:24,351 --> 00:07:28,480
1950s of course like to library.

124
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:33,640
It actually was a library in the Moscow
central chess club. And who's this? Uh,

125
00:07:33,641 --> 00:07:35,110
this is uh, Fred Friedl.

126
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,680
He's a chess analyst and one of the few
non Russians to have seen this room.

127
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,670
Yes, the huge musty room.

128
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,080
All these shelves and there were little
boxes and the boxes contained little

129
00:07:47,081 --> 00:07:47,914
cards,

130
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:53,650
index codes from each of these cards
documented a particular game of chess from

131
00:07:53,651 --> 00:07:55,870
the past. And for awhile
this was all a secret.

132
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,540
There were about three or
four players in the world,

133
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,870
all Russian who had access to one.
One of these guys had a big game.

134
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,380
They would go to this library and say,
all right, I've got this opponent,

135
00:08:05,381 --> 00:08:09,130
he's a Polish guy. [inaudible]
something rather, give me all this game.

136
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,320
And suddenly you have a few hundred cards
which you and your team could study.

137
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:18,220
This is how they prepared by memorizing
literally thousands of moves,

138
00:08:18,221 --> 00:08:20,260
tens of thousands, maybe
hundreds of thousands.

139
00:08:20,261 --> 00:08:25,261
But where Fred comes in is in the 80s he
convinced the Russian Federation to put

140
00:08:25,481 --> 00:08:26,380
this online

141
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:33,440
where anyone could study it and add
to it and suddenly this book explodes,

142
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,830
which is for some people,

143
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,310
distressing people tend to boom me
sometimes when I come into the trust

144
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,810
tournament today, they
will point to me and say,

145
00:08:47,811 --> 00:08:52,040
that's him Frederick the man who ruined
chess because here's the modern game.

146
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,560
When two players sit down at one
of these tournaments to face off,

147
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,290
they've already consulted
Fredrick's database,

148
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,000
which he's named Fritz Trust plays old
call fritzy now and because of fritzy

149
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,260
they walk into these games with so
much of the book in their heads,

150
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,790
that whole portions of the game
are very checkers, like very rote.

151
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,210
You'll see this if you watch
grandmasters play speed chess,

152
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,530
that's Brian Christian again.

153
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,320
They'll just hammer out the first
dozen or so moves, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam,

154
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:25,730
Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam with
barely any thought memory. Yeah,

155
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,670
it used to be two, three, four,
five, six moves. No big deal.

156
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,780
Nowadays it is 16 moves, 20 moves.

157
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,440
There does seem to be a kind
of creep that's happening.

158
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,920
The book is getting bigger and bigger,

159
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,700
but inevitably in every chess game there
is a moment which puts the book in its

160
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:45,810
place and if you watch a game,

161
00:09:45,811 --> 00:09:48,690
is there a chess tournament coming
up that like a big one? Yes.

162
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,610
Next Thursday I'm going to Romania where
some of the top players are playing.

163
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,860
If you watch a game as I was able to do,

164
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,960
because you can watch these
games online. Okay, yeah.

165
00:09:57,961 --> 00:10:02,630
We're going to watch a chess tournament
online. You will see that moment. Yes.

166
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,680
That's, it's not like, you know,

167
00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:07,770
Jordan's scoring 40 points while he
has a fever and it's not like that,

168
00:10:07,771 --> 00:10:12,080
but if you know what to look
for, it's quite profound. Okay.

169
00:10:12,081 --> 00:10:14,660
It's 8:30 AM I'm here with my little man.

170
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,320
They high and somewhere in Romania,

171
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,520
two grand masters are about to sit down
at a table to do battle and I will watch

172
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:26,150
it virtually the batch I
watched with Magnus Carlsen,

173
00:10:26,151 --> 00:10:29,480
the world's top player versus
a Kuru Nakamura, the u s champ.

174
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:30,723
I call up Frederick.

175
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:33,770
Hello Frederick to give me the play by
play cause I actually don't know much

176
00:10:33,771 --> 00:10:34,604
about chess.

177
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:40,010
Well his program Frisk can tell you how
many times each move has occurred in the

178
00:10:40,011 --> 00:10:42,440
entire recorded history of chess.

179
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,003
What does that mean?

180
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:49,260
It's like his computer can look at the
board and say that that move you just

181
00:10:49,261 --> 00:10:50,094
made.

182
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:54,420
That has happened before and I will tell
you exactly how many times before it

183
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:58,130
started. Here we go with one white moves,

184
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,900
it's d for to d

185
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,080
white phone, two squares forward.

186
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:07,110
My database tells me that there are
1,775,000 games in which this occurred.

187
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:13,300
Then we have two black counters with
it's pond going from c four to east six.

188
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,000
Now we've got two ponds facing
each other, middle of the board,

189
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:19,530
and according to Fred's database. This
exact configuration has occurred in

190
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,730
514,518 games.

191
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,740
A million and a half down to
half a million smaller. Yes.

192
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:30,200
Lose three white moves in other parts.
335,000 plants and another pond.

193
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,320
149,000 smaller moves. It's
nice. 114,000 black moves,

194
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,330
especially at 91,000 west. Again,

195
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:41,480
white pontics of black bond just
have our first casualty people.

196
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,270
2,428 games. What was that again?

197
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:48,350
2,400 Oh last time response.

198
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:52,100
2,613 games like the ship
flies across the board.

199
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,930
2001 and 25 games. [inaudible]
moves another pond up.

200
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:00,960
1,200 weight queen does a little thing
where you 181 games 381 get lower.

201
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,480
Yes. Black bishop retreats. 19 games,

202
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,840
thank t one nine white lose another
pond which has occurred in 11 games.

203
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,580
Gay Black Bishop Retreats, 11
games. White Bishop advances.

204
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,420
We've down to 10 game 10 woo black
fish and falls back even further.

205
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,460
And we have nine game. Black
bishop takes white fish pies,

206
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:25,060
game white pawn retaliates taking
black bishop oh five game and then

207
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:28,350
[inaudible]

208
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,780
white rook and white kings switch places.

209
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,270
No, there are no more games.

210
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:39,180
You have a position which has
never occurred before. Indian verse

211
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,393
ever.

212
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,150
No. In the universe.

213
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:48,390
Not In the history of this university
and this is what is known as the novelty,

214
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,200
the novelty, the novelty, you

215
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,590
and in chest notes. If
you read chess notes,

216
00:13:01,591 --> 00:13:05,520
you will see the charts after this
move. The annotator writes out to,

217
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:09,950
yeah, out of book,

218
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:15,770
I buy a book which means no more book.

219
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,720
Both sides now are on their own

220
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:25,730
and everyone we talked to who plays
chess told us that when you get to that

221
00:13:25,731 --> 00:13:30,731
moment and you feel you're alive
in a way that you're not normally.

222
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,520
That's Frank Brady,

223
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,860
he's an author and a professor at St
John's international harbor of the World

224
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,510
Chess Federation. You're totally in it.

225
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:42,140
Your mind is in some
ways not even operating.

226
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,020
It's like you're back to being
three again. What are you saying?

227
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,590
I'm saying this is one of the reasons
we watch sports for these kinds of like

228
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,740
zero moments position,
which was never occurred.

229
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:55,610
India the same time the zero is happening
inside all of these rules which are

230
00:13:55,611 --> 00:13:57,830
like our lives. This is
what else was saying.

231
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,700
Games let us experience the world in
both those ways. At the same time.

232
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:05,990
The Pacers could fail. For example,
here's one 1999 Nix Pacers.

233
00:14:05,991 --> 00:14:09,170
Larry Johnson has the ball, nicks
are down by three final seconds.

234
00:14:09,171 --> 00:14:13,300
He has no shot best. You think he could
do his tie but he has no shot. Yeah,

235
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:16,520
and then somehow you twist the shimmies.
He moved to the left, throws it up.

236
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,393
It's fine.

237
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,180
[inaudible]

238
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,420
that was like, what? What?
I mean that's in the rules,

239
00:14:24,421 --> 00:14:28,770
but nobody could have imagined that
position, which was never occurred. India,

240
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,030
I don't know about. Never went. No mind
you sure? Yeah. This is a hockey moment.

241
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,020
It's Wayne Gretzky,

242
00:14:34,021 --> 00:14:37,260
early nineties he's playing
chutes for the goal of the plaque.

243
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,010
It's something somebody who starts flying
through the air, like a tennis ball.

244
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:45,720
When you get ski, turns around and
lacks the flying out of the air.

245
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:50,860
[inaudible]

246
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,980
to smacked it out of the air.

247
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,800
The universe would have to be extremely
old to have a previous version of that.

248
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:03,350
Frank, do you have a number one
favorite novelty in chess? Well,

249
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:08,150
my number one favorite would be Bobby
Fischer's game of the century and went and

250
00:15:08,151 --> 00:15:08,984
when did that happen?

251
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:14,060
We're jumping to 1956 Bobby is 13 years
old and you see the Bobby Fischer of

252
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:19,190
legend at this point, or just
a 13 year old 13 year old kid.

253
00:15:19,191 --> 00:15:21,290
He got invited to this tournament.

254
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:25,640
It was an all adult invitational
tournament and frank
says all the world's best

255
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:26,241
were there.

256
00:15:26,241 --> 00:15:31,241
And this was kind of Bobby Fischer's
first official match in the big leagues,

257
00:15:31,261 --> 00:15:35,800
so to speak. Exactly. And to set the
scene, it was October warm Indian summer.

258
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,660
We were at the Marshall
Chess Club in Manhattan,

259
00:15:37,661 --> 00:15:40,540
which to speak Stodgy brownstone
with lots of Mahogany.

260
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,520
And Bobby Fischer in his t-shirt sits
down to play a fellow named Donald Bern,

261
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,640
a guy who looked apart a very urbane
sophisticated jacket, bow tie,

262
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,070
always had a cigarette
between two fingers.

263
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,210
Imagine who had been hard for him to
take this kid seriously and he was not

264
00:15:57,211 --> 00:15:59,310
doing all that well. From the beginning.

265
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:03,960
Bobby Fisher was making what looked like
dumb errors he was losing. For example,

266
00:16:03,961 --> 00:16:04,920
midway through the game,

267
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:09,450
Bobby made this move where he moved
as night to the rim of the board,

268
00:16:09,451 --> 00:16:13,170
which is usually strategically speaking
is not the greatest place to move your

269
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,600
night cause you know if your
nights chuffed against the edge,

270
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:19,640
it's boxed in and the night could
be taken and people should watt.

271
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,100
What is it that he blunder? Come
on kid. Yeah, this is crazy.

272
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,700
But then Bobby Fisher does
something truly crazy.

273
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:32,170
What he leaps so far out of the book and
offense that people are still talking

274
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:35,100
about this move. 50 years
later on the 18th move,

275
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,690
he allowed Byrne to take his
queen. He just said, here,

276
00:16:39,691 --> 00:16:43,300
take my queen now in chess.
That's like crazy. Yeah.

277
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:46,920
In chess it's almost impossible to
where the gay or if you lose your queen,

278
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,360
it's like what? That's got to be wrong.

279
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,860
That must be a stupid blunder that it
seemed like maybe he was throwing in the

280
00:16:52,861 --> 00:16:53,694
towel.

281
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,670
So a crowd gathers grumb of people hanging
around to watch this kid get put in

282
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:01,410
this place and Bern did what
anyone would do in that situation.

283
00:17:01,411 --> 00:17:04,830
He took the queen, but
maybe four moves later.

284
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:07,870
Just at the moment you would think
he would have Bobby Fischer in a

285
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:10,680
stranglehold. Bobby started checking

286
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,150
king, he was chasing
burn all over the board.

287
00:17:13,151 --> 00:17:15,490
People began to see that
there was some combination,

288
00:17:15,491 --> 00:17:18,160
but it was a long
combination and you know,

289
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:21,180
20 moves later burn was done. Both.

290
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:24,730
He was checked by [inaudible] and frank
says if you analyze the game you see

291
00:17:24,731 --> 00:17:28,990
that it all began and in a way
ended when he sacrificed as queen.

292
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:32,830
What was the last game from that
moment? Burn didn't take the queen.

293
00:17:32,831 --> 00:17:36,190
He was lost. This bird took
the queen. He was lost the way.

294
00:17:36,191 --> 00:17:40,630
Are you saying he essentially
checkmated him 20 moves at a time? Yes.

295
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:44,650
It was unstoppable. It was forceful.
So it's like he wrote a new book,

296
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:49,090
he stuck the guy in his book. I love
that. So it's Kinda interesting.

297
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:52,060
You can start the game in book,

298
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,370
so to speak and you're kind of
locked into a set of moves. Yeah,

299
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:57,240
the game ends kind of
the same way. Same Way.

300
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:01,710
That's destiny [inaudible] but then
in the middle you just get a peak at

301
00:18:01,711 --> 00:18:04,650
something infinite, infinite.

302
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,110
Although we were wondering like is that
middle space really infinite by applying

303
00:18:09,111 --> 00:18:09,560
the rules?

304
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,010
I mean we asked Frederick if people
play chess for hundreds and hundreds of

305
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:16,970
years, venting new moves into that
empty space. Would they ever fill it up?

306
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,340
And he said no,

307
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:24,670
because the number of chess games that
are possible is vastly more than the

308
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:30,041
number of atoms in the universe is a
silly little number compared to the number

309
00:18:31,101 --> 00:18:32,570
of testing the numbers.

310
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:37,100
How many alums either in the universe
or what 10 to the power of 82 the last

311
00:18:37,101 --> 00:18:40,820
time I counted up, no, 78 82 zeros.

312
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:45,050
10 to the power of 78 I think
70 accurate and there are more.

313
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,960
There's abilities within
a 40 move chess game,

314
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,540
10 to the power of 120 approximately.

315
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,740
And he says if he were to try to get
all that information into fritzy his

316
00:18:54,741 --> 00:18:55,280
database,

317
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,020
we would have to dismantle an entire solar
system just to store the information.

318
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:03,770
And he says you'd have to dismantle
another one. Just to plug it in.

319
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:09,570
[inaudible]

320
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,510
and what he says about chess, if
you could say that about hockey,

321
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:15,600
you could see that about baseball.
You could say that about curling,

322
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:18,930
but you can not say that about
checkers. Like clear. So check inside.

323
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,070
Every game has this kind of strange
thing. It has a field of play,

324
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:26,220
small little box. It'd be a board,
it could be a field, whatever.

325
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,340
And then you step into
it and there's like a

326
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,550
[inaudible]

327
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,383
I assume system

328
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:46,970
[inaudible].

329
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:51,230
Thanks to Alison Gopnik, she wrote the
wonderful book, the philosophical baby,

330
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:54,560
and Frank Brady, who is the author
of end game, Bobby Fischer's,

331
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:59,030
remarkable rise and fall. And also Brian
Christian who wrote the book the most.
