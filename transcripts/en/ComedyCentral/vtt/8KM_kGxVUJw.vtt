TUNING IN FOR, YOU GET IN THIS

00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:01.847 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUSINESS WITH THE IDEA THAT

AND SOMETHING TO EXPRESS AND TO
RECEIVE FEEDBACK FROM THAT IS

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.523 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE GREATEST FEELING YOU COULD
ASK FOR, AND I THANK YOU.
