00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.846
&gt;&gt; The first graph was correct. let's see why. Let's solve this inequality for y

00:00:04.846 --> 00:00:09.938
so we can get the boundary line. First, we subtract 4 x from both sides, then we

00:00:09.938 --> 00:00:14.960
divide each term by 3 to get y is greater than or equal to negative 4 3rd x plus

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.640
4. This inequality is in slope intercept form so I can graph the line that

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.732
represents the boundary. The y-intercept is 4, and my slope is negative 4 3rd.

00:00:24.732 --> 00:00:29.549
Down 4, right 3. That will get me to my next point. This is the boundary line

00:00:29.549 --> 00:00:34.649
for the inequality. I draw it solid, because the symbol is greater than or equal

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.759
to. So, points on this line do satisfy this inequality. Next, I choose a test

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:45.221
point, like the origin, to determine which region to shade. This region or this

00:00:45.221 --> 00:00:50.973
region. Plugging in zero for x and zero for y, I get, 0 is greater than or equal

00:00:50.973 --> 00:00:56.039
to 4. We know this is not true. So, points in this region do not satisfy the

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.498
inequality. We want points in this region, so we shade above. Amazing work if

00:01:01.498 --> 00:01:03.115
you got that one right.
