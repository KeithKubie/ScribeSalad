Hey guys Matt here for Science or Fiction.

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.640
Don’t you just get tired of seeing pseudoscience
plastered all over the internet like it’s

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.700
actually true?

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.080
Storms triggering earthquakes???

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.000
Hahaha that’s so dumb--what a crackpot,
flat earth, non-scientific headline!

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.200
What kind of &nbsp;basement blog would --Oh

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.040
Can certain weather really cause earthquakes?

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.460
Is there such a thing as “earthquake weather?”

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.380
CBS SF Bay Area reported: No.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.699
On the other hand, The California Department
of Conservation said… also no, and they

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.380
expanded by saying “Earthquake weather”
is a common misconception dating back

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.320
to ancient Greece.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.160
Ha, nice job, Socrates.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.200
And the U.S. Geological Survey said earthquakes
are statistically as likely to occur in hot

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.410
weather as cold or rainy weather.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.180
So basically no, no, and no.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.380
So I guess that settles it.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.780
Short video this time.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.040
There are NO legitimate sources claiming weather
affects earthquakes...

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.800
EXCEPT this New York Times article.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.080
Nature, and Newsweek, and National Geographic?

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.560
What's going on?

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.860
First, a little middle-school refresher on
earthquakes: Earthquakes are caused when the

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.390
slowly moving tectonic plates that cover the
earth shift to the point that the rocks between

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.200
them--known as a fault-- break and cause seismic
waves that ripple across the ground, which

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.570
we feel as an earthquake.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.420
Now, what about those headlines and the weather
connection?

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.930
Well, the New York Times reported that the
sudden plummeting of air pressure--which can

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.040
happen when a storm quickly moves in--causes underground water and air to rush toward the surface.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.420
This potentially reduces friction between
tectonic plates, possibly making an earthquake

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.770
more likely.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.710
The New York Times points to part of a study done in Taiwan, which is one of the most seismically

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.490
active regions in the world.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.230
The researchers found a very strong correlation
between typhoons and tiny, miniature earthquakes

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.450
called “slow quakes,” which may have a
role in reducing the grinding pressure between

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.760
tectonic plates, you know, like a chaperone
between high schoolers at prom.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.670
Anyway, the pressure from the typhoons appeared to be enough to trigger a fault that was already

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.380
under strain, resulting in a tiny slow quake.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.600
In addition a researcher who studied the past
50 years of Taiwan’s weather and earthquake

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.459
records, found that earthquakes of a magnitude
6 or higher were 5 times more likely to occur

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.739
within 4 years of a major storm.

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.379
This is possibly in part because storm-caused
erosion removes pressure from atop faults

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.750
and allows the faults to shift faster.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.099
So, weather may actually affect earthquakes.

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.879
It’s so crazy that that’s not crazy.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.040
Kind of cool.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.010
Now, it’s important to note that there doesn’t
appear to be more or fewer earthquakes because

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.600
of weather.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.360
Weather can only possibly shift the earthquake
timeline a little at most--not nearly enough

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.689
to be predictive of future earthquakes.

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:42.099
And these studies so far are not conclusive.

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.489
Sorry Socrates.

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.900
But if they were, that truly would be groundbreaking.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.540
I stand by this pun.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.700
Now if you’re someone who's unhappy that science is still perfecting how to predict earthquakes,

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.760
