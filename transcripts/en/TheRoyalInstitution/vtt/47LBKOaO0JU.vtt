00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.020
Now, if we will consider the problem of the
day.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:13.160
We want to discuss going beyond the physics
that we've had so far.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.340
To try to find some of those new bits of modern
physics

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.660
which carry us very far indeed from the style
of classical times.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.940
But I want to do this with the aid, let me
say, of one device,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.900
as though I were taking a ship.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.780
This is of course not a ship, but it is one
single kind of device,

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.280
which occurs in the world many, many times.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.180
Over and over again, in all sorts of connections,

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.180
with all sorts of shapes and sizes and purposes.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.360
And by looking at this one device, I think
I can show,

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.620
what the physicist has found in his voyages
well beyond the map.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.399
Now, you may recognise what these objects
are.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.460
You see a spring with a weight on it.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.980
Another spring with a weight.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.720
A piece of elastic band with a weight.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:09.780
A pendulum.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.700
A couple of other springs.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.880
I'm going to call them all by the rather ugly
but still nice technical term - oscillator.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.700
All of these are oscillators.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.740
And of course there are many more kinds of
oscillators in the world.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.940
And we will show you some of them and talk
a little bit about how they work.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.140
The oscillator comes in many forms

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:43.430
and physicists can recognise in nearly all
of them certain common properties,

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.420
certain qualities in common.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.440
Let me talk a little bit about a few of them
and you will see what I mean.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.030
And of course, those of you who studied some
physics,

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.180
will be quite familiar with this account.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.400
Let me look first at the pendulum.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.100
Now if you look at any of the other oscillators,
except the two pendulums,

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.200
you will see really two essential parts.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.740
An elastic band or spring and the mass or
weight that is on the end of it.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.280
Here the supporting string, while an essential
part, does not change at all.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.160
I can't stretch it and all under this load.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.640
It's just a stiff string, it doesn't change
it's length.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.520
There is nothing springy about the pendulum.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.200
And yet when I let the pendulum go, it comes
back.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.460
What is the spring that is pulling the pendulum
ball back to the centre?

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.660
Anybody?

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.100
Inertia.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.099
That's interesting. Inertia I think would
make it keep on going.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.260
Why would it go back to the centre?

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.140
If it started out this way, inertia would
alone keep it going the same way.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.780
Would it not?

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.100
Gravity. 
- Gravity.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.320
And gravity is the pool of what?

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.820
It's not a word that makes it go up and down,
it's a thing.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.560
What is that thing? Yes?

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.600
Pull of the Earth. 
- It is the Earth.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.760
The Earth is the missing spring, just as you
say, gravity we call it.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.909
But I'd like you to think of it as a physical
thing.

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:13.000
It's part of the pendulum. Without the Earth,
the pendulum would not work very well.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.579
On the moon the pendulum would work quite
differently

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.680
from what it does on Earth.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.740
So gravity, provided by the Earth, provides
the spring, the second part of the pendulum.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.420
Let me show you one more difference between
the pendulum and the other oscillators.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.260
And I think this difference is easy to see.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.040
Notice this oscillator going up there in a
kind of ragtime rhythm?

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.320
Rather fast.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.580
Let me put another mass on it, loading it
down more heavily.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.200
Of course it stretches to accommodate the
mass

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.660
but then it will oscillate again, a new, about
a new position, no change.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.460
But notice. What would you say about the rhythm?

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.460
Slower, isn't it?

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.620
More stately, perhaps waltz time now.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.600
And I could keep on going.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.140
But if I try this pendulum.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.500
You see it's rhythm.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.600
And this one matches it pretty well.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.720
And if I put a heavy load on this, much heavier
than the one that is there already,

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.960
I don't think it will very much change the
rhythm. Let's try it.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.459
Maybe a little because it's hanging a little
further down than the main ball,

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:17.560
but it's pretty close, yes?

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.260
Yet I loaded it with a much heavier ball than
was on there to begin with.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.880
So the pendulum, somehow, doesn't show the
effects of putting more mass on.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.860
Indeed we can check that very carefully. It
does not.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.240
How can that be? After putting more mass on,
must have more inertia,

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.880
must be harder to move, but what about the
spring that moves it?

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.360
Which is the pull of the Earth.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.620
What happens when we put more mass on?

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.000
The spring pulls harder, yes?

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:49.060
The Earth pulls more and the two go in perfect
step

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.509
and therefore the time to go to and fro, which
we will call the period

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:55.060
because the motion is periodic.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.080
One trip is exactly like the next trip, and
exactly like the next trip,

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.380
with very small differences.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.080
So we'll call the period of the pendulum that
time it takes to go back and forth.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.169
And the period of these gravitational ones,

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.980
where the spring is missing and is invisible
so to speak,

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.060
or is all around us, beneath us,

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.560
does not depend on the mass.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.860
Whereas here the period definitely depends
on the mass of the pendulum.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:27.270
Let us look a little further at a couple of
other examples, which may be interesting.
