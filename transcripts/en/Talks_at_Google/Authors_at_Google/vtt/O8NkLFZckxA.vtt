[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.292 --> 00:00:08.228
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.190
DIANA DARKE: So
first of all, let

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.830
me explain why I even have
a right to a voice on Syria.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.120
I've studied Arabic back
in the '70s at Oxford,

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.090
and have basically devoted
the rest of my life

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.380
to the Middle East.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.162
So I began with 10 years working
for the British government.

00:00:31.162 --> 00:00:32.870
So I saw the Middle
East through the lens

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.580
of the British government.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.740
And then I switched
to British industry.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.160
So I saw the Middle East through
the lens of British industry.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.530
And then I became
completely independent

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.430
and started writing.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.160
And so I've now written what?

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.100
About 16 books about
the Middle East,

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.260
mainly travel
guides, very detailed

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.690
cultural and social
travel guides.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:54.705
So that's been my focus.

00:00:54.705 --> 00:00:58.560
So I would call myself a Middle
East travel writer, ultimately.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.500
And so the reason I wrote this
book was because I was actually

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.470
in Syria back in 2004,
commissioned to write a very

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.720
detailed guidebook to Syria.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.750
And by chance, I found it
was possible for a foreigner

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.960
like me to come in and buy
a chunk of a UNESCO World

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.010
Heritage site.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.600
And I thought, "That's crazy.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.790
How can that possibly be?"

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.510
If that really is
going to be possible,

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.770
then I'm going to do it.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.140
So of course, that was
before the revolution.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.060
So I embarked upon
a scheme, which

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.280
I'm going to take you
through now on a journey,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.310
basically, into Syria,
to show you the Syria

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.020
that I have learned to know.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.290
I've known Syria
since the 1970s,

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.940
but obviously I
only became deeply

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.060
embedded in Syrian
society after buying

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.250
this house and everything
that happened there.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.450
So the book is the journey
of the house, and interwoven

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.110
with that is the story of the
Syrian Revolution, how it grew

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.740
up, the complexities
of Syrian society,

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.390
with a lot of
background knowledge

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.620
about Islamic philosophy,
Islamic literature.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.760
All of that is
woven into the story

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.581
to give you a rich appreciation
of what Islamic culture is all

00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:12.080
about.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.050
Because I do feel it's
very deeply misunderstood

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.370
in this country.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.110
So to do that, I'm going to
first of all show you a map.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.800
Geography is incredibly
important in Syria.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.450
It's vital to understand where
Syria is, on the Eastern shore

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.910
there of the Mediterranean,
which tells you really

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:32.930
all you need to know.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.230
Syria has always
been on a crossroads.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.320
In all directions, it has
been a trading nation.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.960
It has been the
crisscrossing of so many

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.830
different civilizations, going
right back to the earliest

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.420
times of man's history.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.670
Every single civilization
has crisscrossed

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.890
across this region,
and that is what

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.030
has formed the Syrian identity.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.270
It means that Syria
over the centuries

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.600
has become multicultural,
multireligious,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.280
and multiethnic.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.260
And that's what's resulted
in this very, very

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.060
complex Syrian society.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.560
It's a kind of mosaic.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.320
There are so many
different elements to it.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.810
And in this map,
the darker areas

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.850
there are the areas currently
of conflict and displacement.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:17.900
And the reason for that--

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.550
so the areas that
are not colored in

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:20.630
are basically desert.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:21.830
That's how Syria works.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.290
It has an eastern
area with desert,

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.830
which is where Syria's
oil and gas fields are.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.310
But the rest of the area is
actually surprisingly green,

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.420
with mountain
chains, and forests.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.640
And the population,
needless to say,

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.680
is of course mainly
concentrated therefore

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.100
into those more agricultural
and and livable areas.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.660
Very, very little
of the population

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.760
actually lives in
those desert areas.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.620
Because Syria is not
a tribal society.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.450
It's very important
to understand that.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.062
There's a massive difference
between Syria and Iraq.

00:03:54.062 --> 00:03:56.480
Iraq is a very
tribal society, which

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.820
is one of the reasons it
disintegrated so badly

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.440
after the American invasion.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.000
But Syria has never
been like that.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.960
It's a very cohesive society,
very blended on many levels.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.920
So just to show a
bit of the geography,

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.550
Damascus, the capital, is right
down here, very, very close

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:14.990
to the Lebanese border.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.649
And that tells you, reminds you,
that of course this whole area

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:21.920
was under the Ottoman
Empire for 400 years.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.880
And this whole area
was the province

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.400
of Syria, which included
Lebanon, Israel,

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.550
Jordan, and Palestine.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.020
All of that area
was that was what

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.690
was called Natural Syria,
Greater Syria, which

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.600
of course then got carved up
after the First World War,

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.710
with all these, as you can see,
very unnatural-looking borders.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.470
So historically,
Damascus therefore

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.260
has always had very
close links to Lebanon,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.840
just like Aleppo
right up in the north

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.990
there has always had very
close links to Turkey.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.320
And Aleppo, when it got
caught up in the war,

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.830
it was natural for it to
redevelop its trading routes

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.530
and relocate its
factories into Turkey,

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.140
just like so much of the
industry and businesses

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.500
around Damascus
relocated to Lebanon.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.330
Then, it's important
to understand

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.410
how the different communities
fit together here.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.080
Because they don't
necessarily fall neatly

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.110
into little categories.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.900
So when people talk
about partitioning

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.810
Syria and this kind of thing,
it's just not going to work,

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.190
because Syria's not like that.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.050
It's much more blended.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.470
So although loosely
up in the north

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.450
you have what's generally
referred to as a Kurdish belt,

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:42.030
because about 15% of the
Syrian population is Kurdish,

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:47.500
and they've taken advantage of
the lawlessness, if you like,

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.290
of the last six years to carve
out a territory at the top

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.290
there for themselves.

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.870
Because the Syrian army,
President Assad's army,

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.090
simply withdrew, just
left the vacuum there.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.980
So naturally the
Kurds, who'd always

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.410
been aspiring to a
kind of autonomy there,

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.140
just filled the vacuum
and started creating

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.180
their own zones up there.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.420
But of course Turkey
was absolutely

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.920
not going to stand
for that, which

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.680
is why Turkey has now
entered the Syrian War,

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.220
and has carved out what it's
calling a safe zone right up

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.320
in the north there, to make sure
that the Kurds can't take over

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.292
that territory.

00:06:24.292 --> 00:06:25.500
And they're making very sure.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.640
And this fits in well with
President Trump's promise

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.570
to build big, beautiful safe
zones in Syria, which he'll get

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.190
the Gulf countries to pay for.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.990
So that will be
interesting to watch,

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.050
whether he succeeds
in doing that.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.550
And of course, the
other big players

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.270
in the Syrian war at the
moment are Russia and Iran.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:50.200
Now, Russia's interest in
Syria is economic and military.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.190
It has always supplied
the Syrian armed forces

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.520
with their weaponry, going
right back to the '50s.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.470
But economic because
it has signed already

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:06.930
a huge oil deal for the
as-yet unexcavated oil

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.020
offshore there on Syria's
Mediterranean coast.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.260
So it signed a 25 year
deal to have the rights

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.110
to drill for oil there.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.810
And of course, Syria has
also given it the opportunity

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:21.450
to reenter the world stage.

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:25.830
And Iran, Iran's huge
interest in the Syrian War

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:30.390
is to expand the Shia
Crescent, as it's

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:36.300
known, across into southern
Lebanon, into Hezbollah,

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:41.460
its financed and trained
armed militia, which

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.980
is a very, very powerful
player in Lebanon

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.020
and in Lebanese
politics these days.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.780
So you've got all these
different complexities.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.760
The overwhelming
population of Syria

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.840
is Sunni Arab, which is
the conventional mainstream

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:59.070
Arab grouping, largely a
very tolerant kind of Islam

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.650
completely opposite
to ISIS, which is what

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:03.000
has of course taken hold there.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:10.680
And ISIS, when ISIS appeared on
the scene and took over Raqqa,

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.400
their headquarters, which you
see the big lake up there,

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.570
and that river is the Euphrates
River running off into Iraq,

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.620
Raqqa is the first
town after that lake.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.650
And when ISIS, nearly
three years ago now,

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:28.680
it's worth remembering
just how long ago that was.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.190
Three years ago, when
ISIS took over Raqqa,

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:34.382
everybody thought,
including Assad himself,

00:08:34.382 --> 00:08:35.590
"Well, what does that matter?

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:37.299
It's a provincial backwater.

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:38.970
Nobody cares at all."

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:42.600
But they were very
clever in doing that.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:49.020
Because by taking over Raqqa,
they were very cleverly

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:53.370
taking control of the main
water source for Syria,

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:55.290
the main hydroelectric
dam, which

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:59.407
is on that lake, and
of course, very quickly

00:08:59.407 --> 00:09:01.740
took over the oil and gas
fields, which, as I mentioned,

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.024
were in that eastern area.

00:09:03.024 --> 00:09:04.440
So right from the
start, they were

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.190
able to exert an unnatural
degree of control

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:12.050
over Syria's infrastructure.

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:13.890
And then the
Christian population

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.040
is about between 10% and 15%.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.110
It's very difficult to
get accurate figures.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:22.030
And they are scattered
all over the country.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.630
And then you have other
strange minorities,

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.490
like the Druze,
who are scattered

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:29.850
in these areas to the south,
but also across the cities.

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:33.600
Just like the Kurds are also not
just in the north but scattered

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.110
all around.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.890
So it's a very blended society.

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.980
So nowhere illustrates
this blending more

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.040
to my mind than the
old city of Damascus,

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.930
which is where I bought
my house, obviously.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:50.370
And this map is in the
book, and it shows the walls

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:53.550
around the old city, which are
still intact, six kilometer

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:56.760
circumference, and
all the gateways,

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.670
the Roman gateways there, eight
of them all around the edges,

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:04.020
are still intact,
are still in use.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.810
You can get a sense as you
walk through Damascus of layer

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.480
upon layer of civilization.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.320
And so everywhere
has built on top

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.840
of the previous civilization.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.120
So the military
headquarters for example,

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.420
that castellated building up
in the top left hand corner

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.930
has always been the military
headquarters of the city.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:28.550
So back in Roman times, it
was the Roman castrum, where

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:30.410
these troops were garrisoned.

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.950
Then in the Middle Ages, it was
the place from which Saladin

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.260
masterminded the Crusades.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.830
And in more recent history, it's
been used by the Assad regime

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:42.290
as a military prison.

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:45.700
And the street running
across the center

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.740
there is the biblical
street called Straight,

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.450
which is the street
that St. Paul was

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:53.180
let along when he was blinded
and fell from his horse.

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.490
He was led along
that street and up

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:58.370
into the Christian
quarter, where

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:00.830
he was cured of his sight.

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:03.770
And that the spiritual
heart of the center

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:08.750
is that big mosque image there,
in the center at number 11.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:11.750
That has always been the
spiritual heart of the city.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:15.170
So it began as a temple
to a weather god,

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:17.000
under the Arameans.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.680
And then when the
Greeks came, they

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.260
turned it into a temple of Zeus.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.830
And then the Romans turned
it into a temple of Jupiter.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:27.110
And then the
Christians turned it

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:29.450
into a cathedral of
John the Baptist.

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:33.140
And John the Baptist's head is
still buried in that building.

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:36.330
And then when the Muslims
came in the 7th century,

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:40.580
they too wanted to use that same
space as their spiritual place

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:41.660
of worship.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.030
And so they came to an
arrangement with the Christians

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:45.710
to share the building.

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:50.000
And so they entered through
the same main entrance,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.500
the old temple entrance.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.600
And the Christians turned
one way and the Muslims

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.010
turned the other.

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:57.050
And that arrangement
only came to an end

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:58.670
when they ran out of space.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:00.830
And then the Muslims
said to the Christians,

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:03.530
"Right, we would like now
to take over this whole area

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:06.800
and make it into our
main mosque of the city.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:11.000
And in exchange, we'll give you
land for four new churches."

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.230
So that's what happened.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:14.540
And to this day,
those churches are

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:17.900
amongst these 17 churches
in the Christian quarter

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:21.500
there in the top section,
which are all still working,

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.130
all still functioning
in Damascus now.

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:25.850
And so on a Sunday
morning, you hear

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:28.430
church bells ringing
out across the city,

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:30.280
mingling with the
call to prayer.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:34.280
That is how Damascus has always
been-- incredibly blended.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.430
And the house which
I bought back in 2005

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:40.400
is down there, at
number one on the map.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:45.870
And that is in a
Sunni-Shia mixed area.

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:49.550
So the building I've
just been describing,

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:52.860
that spiritual heart of
Damascus, looks like this now.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.170
This is the mosque that
the Muslims built back

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:56.590
in the 7th century.

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:58.740
And you can see straight
away how blended that

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.480
is, just looking at
it, with the dome

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:05.280
there, which is reminiscent
of the Byzantine style

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.990
of architecture,
and the gable there

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:09.640
taken from the
Hellenistic period.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.510
And then the tall
minaret there, which

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:15.030
could be a bell tower
or a church spire,

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.760
is in fact called
the Jesus Minaret.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.440
Because local
tradition has it that

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.690
on the final day
of judgment, Christ

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:23.940
will descend from that minaret.

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:27.510
So this is very typical of
the natural blending of all

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:29.750
the traditions in Damascus.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:33.180
And it's normal at Christmas
and Easter for Muslims

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.450
to go into the churches, and
it's normal for Christians

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:37.755
to go into the mosques.

00:13:37.755 --> 00:13:40.387
All the mosques in Syria
are open to everybody.

00:13:40.387 --> 00:13:41.220
You can go in there.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:44.009
I spent hours in the
courtyard of this mosque,

00:13:44.009 --> 00:13:44.800
just sitting there.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.470
You can have a picnic.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:47.910
People just enjoy themselves.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.110
Children run around, treat
it like a playground.

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:55.500
It's a very, very relaxing,
like a kind of a safe haven.

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.410
This is the same building
in the depths of winter.

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:02.530
Because it's easy to forget that
Damascus is actually very high.

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:04.530
It's at 800 meters.

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:08.880
And so in the winter, I took
this picture actually just

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.270
in winter of last
year, in January,

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:15.150
when the temperature
dropped to minus 15.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.630
So snow of this
type is not unusual.

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:24.630
And the reason I'm showing it to
you is that in Damascus itself,

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.030
there is no actual fighting
going on at the moment.

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:28.830
The fighting is
all in the suburbs.

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:31.920
The center is safe, because
it's so tightly under the grip

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.345
of the Assad regime.

00:14:34.345 --> 00:14:36.690
But the infrastructure
problems, which

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:41.105
I explained are largely
to do with ISIS,

00:14:41.105 --> 00:14:43.220
affect even the
center of Damascus.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.480
So even in the center,
where there's no fighting,

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.450
they still only have about three
or four hours of electricity.

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:53.760
They have almost no gas,
almost no no heating fuel.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.960
And the water supply
gets regularly blockaded

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.410
by rebel groups up in the
hills, in the mountains where

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:03.430
the main source comes from.

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:06.450
And so at this point,
all these water tanks,

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:09.450
those red tanks there are
water tanks on the roof.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.530
And all of them
burst at that time,

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:13.740
which was an absolute
catastrophe for people

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.560
living in Damascus.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.430
But the way Syrians
deal with this,

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:22.530
and this is another very
important thing, is they laugh.

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:25.980
They have this incredible
uncomplaining aspect to them.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:29.040
They just accept whatever
is thrown at them,

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.630
and they don't let
it get them down.

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:32.400
They actually laugh about it.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:36.420
So a friend of
mine rang recently,

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:40.680
and was laughing
and saying, "Oh, I

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.390
was woken up at
3:00 in the morning

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:45.930
by the sound of the water
pump pumping the water up

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:47.190
onto the roof.

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:48.690
And so I leapt out
of bed and rushed

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:50.340
to the shower, because
I knew that that

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.006
was going to be the
only time that month

00:15:52.006 --> 00:15:54.150
when both the water
and the electricity

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:55.320
were both on together.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.820
So it was going to
be my only chance

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:58.110
to wash my hair that month."

00:15:58.110 --> 00:15:59.530
And they just laugh about this.

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:04.830
They just don't complain at all.

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:07.740
Now, this is the facade
of that same mosque.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.830
And I'm showing you this because
this is one of the earliest

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:13.440
examples of Islamic art.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:17.220
And you can see straight
away that the imagery

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:21.060
of it, the iconography is
also very blended aspect.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:24.450
They've taken in aspects of
Christianity and the earlier

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:26.430
Hellenistic civilizations.

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:30.060
But what it's aiming to
do, like most Islamic art,

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.700
is to project a
vision of paradise.

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:37.080
And say the iconography tends
to be trees, and gardens,

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.480
and fantasized
buildings and rivers.

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:44.990
But the echoes of
Christianity come in

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:46.890
with the triple arched window.

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:49.500
You know, the echoes
of the Trinity there,

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:53.070
and the columns here, taken
from the classical sites, which

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:55.890
they'll have seen all
over Syria as well.

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:58.807
And the damage that is
from a random shell.

00:16:58.807 --> 00:17:00.390
As I mentioned, the
center of Damascus

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:02.280
is basically safe, but
every now and again

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.069
a random shell is fired
in from the suburbs that

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:06.960
just happens to land somewhere.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.210
And this one landed
on that facade.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:11.130
But it's been repaired already.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:14.160
The quality of Syrian
craftsmen is phenomenal,

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.740
and it's been repaired to
a very, very high standard.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:21.099
I checked when I was last there,
and it has been all repaired.

00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:23.640
So unfortunately, the
suburbs of Damascus--

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.579
completely different story.

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:28.830
They've just been pulverized
by the Assad government

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:31.260
for having the temerity
to stand up against him

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.650
and to ask for freedoms
and for reforms

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:38.880
to his highly corrupt system,
which is completely gripped

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.430
by a security state, basically.

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:44.310
For the last 45,
50 years, Syria has

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:46.960
been under the grip
of the Assad family,

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:51.220
and there's been no such
thing as free speech, largely.

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:52.720
I mean, if you
dared to criticize

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.690
the system in any way, you'd
be plucked off the streets

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:58.090
and you'd disappear into prison.

00:17:58.090 --> 00:17:59.980
And so people learned
to be quiet, basically.

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:02.290
They learned to be silent.

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:04.240
And so I refer quite
a lot in the book

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.440
to the silent majority.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.600
Because at the
moment, most Syrians

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.650
fall into that category.

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:10.090
They are the silent majority.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:12.921
They're not with Assad,
and they're not with ISIS,

00:18:12.921 --> 00:18:13.420
obviously.

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:16.150
They are stuck between
these two extremes.

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:19.670
And that's what's so tragic
about their situation.

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:23.350
So at this time, when all the
suburbs were being pulverized,

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:27.230
this is when a lot of my friends
started to lose their homes.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:29.380
And so this is
the point at which

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:35.964
I offered them my house to
come and stay as a safe haven.

00:18:35.964 --> 00:18:37.630
Now, of course this
is the sort of image

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:39.880
that the media is
always showing us.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:44.950
And the media is a topic I
want to touch on, because it

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:46.622
is important to understand.

00:18:46.622 --> 00:18:48.580
Because almost all our
perceptions about what's

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:50.417
going on in Syria
come from the media,

00:18:50.417 --> 00:18:51.500
whether we like it or not.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.400
And so it's all a question
of what media we look at,

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.470
and what we allow
to influence us.

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:59.680
And of course, ISIS
have a head of media.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.500
He's a 33-year-old
Syrian-American.

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:05.980
He's a genius, and
they pay him a fortune

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:09.200
to produce very, very
clever images like this,

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:14.020
which project this massive sense
of power, of the power of ISIS.

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:17.410
And of course, here they're
using the stage building

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:21.520
of the Roman theater in
Palmyra to project this image

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.250
onto the world stage
of their power.

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:28.330
And so they've lined up a
group of Syrian soldiers there.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:30.520
And behind them
are teenagers, who

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.070
are about to be the soldiers.

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:37.800
And they've been sending
out 90,000 tweets a day,

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.720
with something like
30,000 Twitter accounts.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.890
Very, very active.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:45.280
And they completely
were way, way ahead

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.460
of any other force
involved in this war.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.760
So they were able to
project the amount of power

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:55.390
that they had quite
disproportionately.

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:59.080
And of course, what they were
seeking to destroy in Palmyra

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.760
is precisely what
I've been explaining

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:04.060
about this blended
multicultural society.

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.790
Because Palmyra, a
caravan city in the middle

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:09.910
of the desert there, all
along the trading routes,

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:13.210
because it's been Rome on
its eastern fringe there,

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:16.720
it's where Rome blended with
the Babylonian and Mesopotamian

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.520
cultures and with
the Persian cultures

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.240
and with the ancient
Egyptian cultures, and that

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:26.620
resulted in a special
fusion of the cultures

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:30.640
to create the Palmyran
civilization, which is unique.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.140
It had its own language.

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:35.200
They had their own style
of dress, their own hair

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.440
styles, their own
jewelry, all of which

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.630
shows in their statues.

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:44.230
And that's precisely of course
what ISIS wanted to destroy.

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:47.250
So of course, that
building that we just saw

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:49.750
was blown up like that in
an image, which they then

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.120
tweeted all around the
world, to again show

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.736
how powerful they were.

00:20:54.736 --> 00:20:56.110
But of course,
it's not only ISIS

00:20:56.110 --> 00:21:00.520
who's been using the Syrian
War as a propaganda tool.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.700
Russia and Putin have.

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:04.690
It's been an
absolute gift to him.

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:06.370
And if you watch
Russian TV, which

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.330
I do quite a lot these
days, RT on Freeview,

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.680
you know channel 1, 3,
5, anybody can get it.

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:18.160
It's such an eye opener to see
how misinformation is done.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.610
Very, very clever.

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:25.240
So of course when Russia took
retook Palmyra from ISIS.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.370
They immediately saw
what a propaganda coup,

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:30.190
this was because the world
has always been fascinated

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:33.410
by the mystique of Palmyra.

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:39.220
And so Russia bused in a special
orchestra for this victory

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:42.850
concert in the very same
building, the Roman theater,

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:45.640
that ISIS was doing
its staged beheading.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.850
Russia is now doing its
staged victory concert.

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:51.520
It forced people to come into
the audience, along with some

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.380
of its own soldiers.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.410
And then Putin has himself
put in on a video link

00:21:56.410 --> 00:22:00.130
to project himself to the
world as the savior of Syria,

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:02.260
the defender of terrorism.

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.860
And it's very clever
stuff, and it works.

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.400
Because what we
didn't hear about at

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.850
all is what was going on
in Palmyra before Russia

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:11.370
and before ISIS.

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:15.490
Because these pictures
are from 2013, well

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:19.660
before any of that
happened, when in fact

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:23.500
this damage was caused by
the Syrian government itself,

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:29.060
because it was firing on a small
group of rebels who had set up

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:32.080
a small headquarters inside
the temple of Ba'al, which

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.900
has big, high walls, so
it's quite fortified.

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:38.056
So it made a natural
defensive spot.

00:22:38.056 --> 00:22:39.430
But the Syrian
government thought

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:42.070
nothing of going up onto the
hill that overlooks the site

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:44.620
and shelling its own
cultural heritage

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:46.900
and causing all
this destruction.

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:50.170
And you can see here, these
are Syrian tanks moving around

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:52.390
within the ruins, heavy trucks.

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:54.880
They put a multiple
rocket launcher

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.650
in the temple of Diocletian.

00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:58.120
They didn't think
twice about it.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:02.500
But these pictures were taken
very secretly on the ground

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.750
by Syrian activists
who recorded it.

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:07.360
Because of course Assad
has been very, very careful

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:10.720
to make sure that journalists
don't get in to Syria.

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.210
These days, you have
Russian journalists

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:16.930
and Iranian journalists,
who cover the angles

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:17.950
that they want covered.

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:20.650
And it was very, very clear
during the Aleppo campaign

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:22.660
that that's precisely
what was going on.

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:24.940
The Assad regime doesn't
invite journalists

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:27.790
in unless it's got something
that wants to show them,

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:31.570
which it did just before
the fall of Aleppo.

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:33.670
Because it wanted
to show them exactly

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:36.400
at that moment how
the city was falling

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.107
and how they were providing
was humanitarian aid.

00:23:39.107 --> 00:23:40.690
And then, of course,
it makes them all

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:43.180
go out again before
the ugly end game,

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:46.390
when it then bombs the place
completely into smithereens.

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:48.580
So it's very, very
tightly controlled.

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:52.630
I mean, Syria has for the
last five years in a row

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:55.090
topped the bill of the
most dangerous place

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:55.870
for journalists.

00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:58.780
Because there is
no free journalism

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:01.600
from international outlets.

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.540
So Syrian activists have
trained themselves up.

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:07.270
They have people
who were not at all

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:11.590
in that field who have
become photo journalists

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:14.170
and activists on the ground.

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:17.571
So this is another one of
Syria's UNESCO World Heritage

00:24:17.571 --> 00:24:18.070
sites.

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:20.170
This is the Krak de Chevaliers.

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:23.650
It's the world's best
preserved crusader castle,

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:27.120
and it's got caught up in the
conflict for the same reason

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.540
that Palmyra got caught up--

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:31.060
its strategic location.

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:33.647
Because the reason it's
there in the first place,

00:24:33.647 --> 00:24:35.980
just like the reason Palmyra's
there in the first place,

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:39.910
is because of the trade
trade routes converging.

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:42.250
Here, the castle
is guarding what's

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:45.910
called the Homs Gap, which is
a natural break in the mountain

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:50.530
chain, the only break from
the inside interior desert

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:51.850
to the coast.

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:54.850
And so strategically it's
a very important place.

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:57.415
And so at the start of the
revolution , a group of rebels,

00:24:57.415 --> 00:25:00.160
and with the full consent
of the local villagers,

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.860
took up a position inside.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:04.930
And of course the
Syrian Air Force

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:08.170
immediately came and
bombarded it from above.

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:11.770
And it's one of those many
ironies in the Syrian War,

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:13.930
that so much of its
cultural heritage

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:15.310
has come through unscathed.

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:18.045
I mean, this castle was
never taken throughout.

00:25:18.045 --> 00:25:19.420
It was built in
the 12th century.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:22.630
It was never taken, it was
never damaged until now,

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:25.990
when it got bombed by
its own government.

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:28.690
Other sites get caught up
for their strategic location.

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:32.560
So this is a monastery right
up on the top in the Qalimun

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:33.970
mountains at 2,000 feet.

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:37.420
It's 2,000 meters high.

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:40.750
Right on the border
between Lebanon and Syria.

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:44.500
And so this ministry,
the Syrian government

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:48.430
came in and kicked out
the monks and took over.

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:51.070
And again, you can see how the
monastery there was originally

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:54.370
a Greek temple, all the
style, the size of the blocks.

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:57.370
All of this is Hellenistic
masonry with the columns there.

00:25:57.370 --> 00:26:01.300
So it's another example of an
ancient site which has evolved

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:02.984
with each new civilization.

00:26:02.984 --> 00:26:04.400
So the monks have
been kicked out,

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.000
and it's been turned
into an army barracks.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.250
Because strategically, they
want to come on the high points

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:12.610
up there.

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:14.740
But you then get
cases like this.

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:17.170
This is another
church in Ma'loula.

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:18.970
And some of you may
have heard of Ma'loula.

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:21.400
It's always paraded in
the press as the place

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:25.990
where the language of Christ,
Aramaic, is still spoken.

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:29.380
But Ma'loula is of no
strategic interest to anybody.

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.980
It's tucked into a little
cleft down in the mountains.

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:35.350
It doesn't command
anything at all.

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:38.830
And this is a classic case
of media manipulation.

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:43.630
Because the timing of this was
just before, if you remember,

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:45.220
there was that big
chemical attack,

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:48.610
chemical weapons attack
in the east of Damascus.

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:53.200
And that almost led Obama to
intervene in the Syrian case.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.210
And it really did
look at one stage

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:57.460
as if Obama was going to enter.

00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:59.680
His red line had
been crossed, and he

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:04.330
was going to actually
intervene and bomb Assad.

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:07.094
And Assad was so worried at that
point that this might really

00:27:07.094 --> 00:27:09.010
happen, and that this
would be the end of him,

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:13.060
that he engineered a crisis
here in Ma'loula, knowing that

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:16.510
the world would pay attention
to what happens in Ma'loula.

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:20.740
And so he engineered
an attack like this,

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:23.140
and then showed it to
the media, and showed

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:27.250
his own army coming in
to save the inhabitants,

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:30.760
and the nuns and the
monks in the village.

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:33.250
This is a monastery,
a famous monastery

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:34.930
that's been burned out.

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:40.064
And he said, "Look,
if you get rid of me,

00:27:40.064 --> 00:27:41.230
look what's going to happen.

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:43.780
Terrorism will run
over the whole country.

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:47.320
I am the only defender
of the minorities here."

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.650
And of course, it worked.

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:49.150
It worked.

00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:50.410
Obama backed off.

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:53.830
The parliament here didn't
vote to go along with it.

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:56.680
And afterwards, the
nuns in the village

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:59.680
actually said "The
army, the Syrian army,

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.060
sold us to the media."

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:02.194
It was a clear case.

00:28:02.194 --> 00:28:03.610
And again, this
is another example

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:07.000
of where Western journalists
were invited in to be shown.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.080
"look, look.

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.490
Look at this destroyed church.

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:11.680
Look what will happen
if you get rid of me."

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:12.910
And it's very effective.

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:14.770
It works.

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:15.880
And this is in Homs.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.550
This is another church
in Homs, again bombarded

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:19.600
by aerial bombardment.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.102
You may remember
it so long ago now.

00:28:21.102 --> 00:28:22.810
This seems to have
been going on so long,

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:25.960
that in 2012, when
all this was going on,

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:29.650
this is where Marie Colvin, the
Sunday Times journalist, where

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:33.040
she was killed, when the
center of the old city of Homs

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:36.190
was being aeriel
bombarded and completely,

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:37.420
completely destroyed.

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:39.190
And that was the first
of the many starve

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:43.150
or surrender sieges,
basically, where the whole area

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:44.860
was completely destroyed.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:52.270
So to get down to the personal
level now with the house,

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:55.690
I'll just show you a
few images of the house.

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:58.000
This, as the map
showed, is in the center

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.320
of the old city of Damascus.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:02.380
So this is within the
UNESCO World Heritage site.

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:04.330
It's a courtyard house.

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:07.630
Damascus has the world's
largest collection

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:11.330
of old residential
Ottoman architecture.

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:13.060
So this house dates back.

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:14.830
It's blended, like
everything in Syria.

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:18.890
It's blended between the 17th,
18th, and 19th centuries.

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:22.780
Different sides of the courtyard
are from different centuries,

00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:25.540
because it's been
continuously inhabited

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:29.840
so it's already come through
wars, invasions, earthquakes,

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.790
fires, all of that.

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:34.990
And so the city has been
constantly being rebuilt.

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:37.630
And so you can see it looks
in a pretty sorry state here.

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:41.170
It was actually inhabited
when I bought it.

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:45.700
And it was just about
possible to live there.

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:49.570
So this is now
August of 2005 when

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:52.110
the temperature is 40 degrees.

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:57.160
And so I was semi-camping
in the house,

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:59.560
waiting for the
bureaucracy to kick in.

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:02.740
So this was my first real
exposure to Syrian bureaucracy

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:04.390
and how everything works.

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:07.120
And Syrian bureaucracy
is like a labyrinth.

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.040
It combines the
worst of the Ottoman

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.930
and the worst of the French.

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:16.810
And so my task now
was to find myself

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:20.710
a bank manager, who turned
out to be a Christian lady.

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:22.750
I had to find
myself a lawyer, who

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:25.210
turned out to be a Sunni Kurd.

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:27.100
I had to find myself
an architect, who

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:29.710
was a Sunni Arab.

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:32.380
And the architect and
I gathered together

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:36.310
a team of about 15
Syrian craftsmen

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:39.550
to embark on the
restoration project, which

00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:42.190
took three years.

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:44.390
So this is what we had
to do at the start.

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:48.400
We had to rip off all of those
walls around the courtyard,

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:52.870
were covered with a
white, uniform cement

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:54.490
masking everything underneath.

00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:56.290
And that in the
book becomes a kind

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:58.300
of metaphor for
the Assad regime,

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:02.560
which has been suffocating
the true nature of Syria

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:05.990
and its true identity
for the last 50 years.

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:08.590
And so the first thing we
had to do was pull that off.

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:14.260
And what we found underneath
was these mud bricks, which

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:16.390
I call the mud of Mesopotamia.

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:19.960
Because this mud and
this style of house

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:23.320
goes right back to the
earliest Mesopotamian times.

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:27.140
It's evolved to be perfectly
adapted to the climate.

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:29.620
And these mud bricks keep
the heat in the winter

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:32.170
and the heat out in the summer.

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:35.410
And so this is like
a perfect eco-house.

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:38.690
In fact, this arch
here is the open iwan,

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:41.320
as it's called, that
faces onto the courtyard,

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.750
always north facing, so
that when you sit there

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:46.420
in the summer, the sun never
shines directly into it,

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:48.490
and it always
catches the breezes.

00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:51.070
So it is perfectly
evolved for the climate.

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:54.140
You don't need air
conditioning in these houses.

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:57.410
So this is in the depths
of the restoration.

00:31:57.410 --> 00:32:00.265
This is absolute chaos, as
you can see, everything.

00:32:00.265 --> 00:32:02.500
It doesn't look as
if anything is ever

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:04.370
going to get any better.

00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:06.820
But the extraordinary
thing about this period

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:09.850
was that all of us
really enjoyed ourselves.

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:12.710
We all knew what we
were striving for.

00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:14.380
So again, this is
the state that Syria

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:15.640
is locked in at the moment.

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:17.400
It's completely chaotic.

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:20.140
It doesn't look as if it's
ever going to get any better,

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:22.660
and yet the people inside
Syria who have stayed

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:24.970
behind are remarkably cohesive.

00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:26.950
I've seen it firsthand.

00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:28.830
And so here is the
electrician, who

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:32.440
is coming across with the kettle
to have one of our many tea

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:33.040
breaks.

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.460
You can see all
the glasses there,

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:39.430
the tea glass glasses lined up
along the side of the fountain.

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:41.200
And this is some
of the detailing

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.360
of the interior and the rooms.

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:45.610
So you can see
this dates to 1700.

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:47.530
This is what I call
the [? Ajami ?] room.

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:50.446
This is hand painted
wooden lacquer work.

00:32:50.446 --> 00:32:51.820
And you can see
again how they've

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:54.730
taken in elements from
earlier civilizations.

00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:57.360
That gold acanthus
leaf up in the corner

00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:02.490
there is straight off the
Hellenistic blocks of Palmyra.

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:04.780
And the iconography
again is gardens--

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:09.370
gardens, flowers, little
birds hidden in the trees.

00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:12.460
And on those green
panels, that is not

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:14.410
inscriptions from the Quran.

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:21.370
That is a Sufi poem, Sufism
being the mystic Islam.

00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:23.060
Syrian Islam is
very close to that.

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:27.020
It's a very kind of moderate,
tolerant version of Islam.

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:30.640
And this is a Sufi poem
invoking blessings on the house

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:33.040
and on the owner.

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:35.560
And this is another
detail of the interior.

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:38.740
This is what I refer to as
the secret ceiling, which

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:42.580
comes to represent a
tapestry of Syrian society,

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:46.576
the way all the different
elements are blended together.

00:33:46.576 --> 00:33:49.380
And again, you
can see hark-backs

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:50.950
to the earlier civilizations.

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:54.060
So things like that, that
is the rose of Palmyra,

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:57.330
taken straight off the
carved blocks of Palmyra.

00:33:57.330 --> 00:33:59.340
And you can see how
strangely familiar

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:03.240
that looks in some ways, because
that top and bottom borders

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:07.020
there could be taken straight
from a William Morris catalog.

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:11.400
It could be curtains, curtain
material or wallpaper.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:12.690
And that's no accident.

00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:17.190
That's because British
architects went out to Palmyra

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:20.960
and did detailed drawings
back in the 18th century

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.460
of the patterns that
they found in Palmyra,

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:26.219
brought them back to this
country, published them,

00:34:26.219 --> 00:34:29.250
and that stimulated the
neoclassical revival

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:33.330
in this country, which is
why we see this kind of thing

00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:36.340
all over our country
houses all across Britain.

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:41.400
And here again,
this would have been

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:46.020
covered with the white uniform
cement that I'm talking about.

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:49.739
But in removing that, of
course, you cause damage.

00:34:49.739 --> 00:34:53.909
And if you can see that hole
up there, just to the left,

00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:57.360
there's a big hole in
the stonework there.

00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:00.270
I took a very conscious
decision with the restoration

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:02.610
of the house not
to over-restore,

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:06.720
not to aim for some sort
of unnatural perfection,

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.160
but to leave that kind of thing.

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:11.190
Because if you like,
it's a kind of scar,

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:15.910
just like Syria will have
to take in many, many scars

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:19.440
and absorb them, and look them
in the eye, actually, and say,

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:21.840
"Right, this is damage
which has been done,

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.360
but we have to now
absorb that and make it

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:28.020
part of our future identity."

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:30.330
And in the blending again
that I've mentioned,

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:33.420
right at the very top there,
quite difficult to see,

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:35.280
but there is actually
what we would

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:38.520
think of as a Jewish
star of David,

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.850
in two interlocking triangles
right at the top there.

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:44.040
But in Damascus,
that has nothing

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.320
to do with a specifically
Jewish symbol.

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:49.350
That is actually locally
known as shield of Solomon.

00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:54.590
And again, it's just a
symbol to protect the house.

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:58.060
So at the end of three years,
this is what we ended up with--

00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:00.160
everything perfectly restored.

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.870
Wherever there were
things missing,

00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:05.470
like for example the
little bronze heads there

00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:07.600
in the fountain, we
would go to salvage

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:11.560
yards around the outskirts
of the city and source

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:12.610
them from there.

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:15.820
So the only new things
that came into this house

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:19.010
were the infrastructure,
just as in Syria,

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:20.310
that's what has to happen.

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:24.760
The faulty wiring, if you
like, and the faulty drains

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.790
and plumbing, all of that
has to be ripped out.

00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:32.860
Just like in the Assad regime,
the corrupt and malfunctioning

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:36.580
bureaucracy of the security
state, of the torture

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:39.520
systems, all of
that and the people

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.410
who've got their
fingers in all the pies

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:43.750
at the top, all of that
has to be ripped out.

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:46.480
And then Syria can
be what it should be,

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:53.190
this multilayered, very, very
beautiful and complex society.

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:56.260
But moving on now
to ISIS again, one

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:58.600
of the things that's been
happening all over Syria

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:01.270
is looting of the
cultural heritage.

00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:05.440
And ISIS has again seen
in the cultural heritage

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:07.570
an opportunity to make money.

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:11.530
And of course, it's making
money because the oil

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:15.520
that it's been controlling, it
has tacit under the table deals

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:17.110
with the Assad regime.

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:20.500
So Assad continues to buy
oil from his own oil wells

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:23.710
through ISIS, and then
they just take a rake off.

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:26.350
Just like with the
cultural heritage

00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:29.200
here, they take a
rake off of 20%,

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:32.950
and the stuff gets fed onto
the international art market.

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:35.080
But every now and
again, when they dig up

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:38.170
something so massive,
like this 7th century

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:40.360
BC Assyrian statue,
of course that's

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:43.510
far too huge to be passed
off on the art market.

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:46.150
So they use it instead
for propaganda purposes,

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:48.280
and they publicly
smash it to bits,

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.230
and then tweet it
all around the world

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:53.230
to, again, make themselves
seem so powerful.

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:55.360
And they force the
local population

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.710
to come and watch this.

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:59.600
So if you can see the expression
on that little boy's face,

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:03.070
who's being made to watch his
own cultural heritage being

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:07.240
destroyed like that,
it's just pure agony.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.760
Because Syrians care
very, very deeply

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.230
about their cultural heritage.

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:16.030
It's like having part
of their soul erased.

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:20.560
And Aleppo, this is Aleppo
before the fall of it,

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.030
obviously.

00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:27.340
So this is as it used to be,
Syria's commercial hub, one

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:29.770
of the most famous souks in
the whole of the Arab world,

00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:32.170
and then afterwards
when it caught fire.

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:34.210
And the reason it
caught fire was

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:37.510
because, again, the government,
the Syrian government,

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:41.290
shelled a rebel headquarters
in the old city.

00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:44.050
And it hit an
electricity substation.

00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:47.020
That caught fire, spread
through all the shops.

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:49.615
And overnight, 40,000
people were made bankrupt.

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:54.760
But of course, what
we don't hear about

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:58.480
is what Syrians are doing
on the ground about this.

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:01.810
And this is a picture of
two archeology students

00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:03.730
from Aleppo University.

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:05.500
And nobody's paying
them to do this.

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:06.730
They are volunteers.

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:08.440
And they are, of
their own accord,

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:11.110
building a protective
wall in front

00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:14.590
of the shrine of Zechariah,
the tomb of Zechariah, who's

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:16.180
the father of John the Baptist.

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:20.260
And his tomb is inside
the Aleppo Umayyad mosque.

00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:22.270
And this is happening
all over Syria.

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:25.330
Syrians on the ground
are trying to protect

00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:29.260
in whatever way they can
their own cultural heritage.

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:31.180
And the same thing
here, this is right down

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:34.521
in the south, another one of
Syria's UNESCO World Heritage

00:39:34.521 --> 00:39:35.020
sites.

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:38.890
This is Basra, one of the
world's best preserved

00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:40.810
Roman amphitheaters.

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:42.820
And you should never be
misled by what people

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:44.137
look like in the Syrian War.

00:39:44.137 --> 00:39:46.720
Because you could look at that
group of people there and think

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:49.210
there were a bunch
of jihadi extremists,

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:51.490
but in fact, the guy in
the middle with a red beard

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:53.540
is the local
history teacher, who

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:56.800
set up a revolutionary
antiquities department.

00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:01.300
And the people around him are
in charge of the local militias,

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:04.060
where they have gathered
together the local population

00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:05.230
to protect the city.

00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:07.780
Because when they saw
what happened in Palmyra,

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:12.660
they all vowed that this was
not going to happen to Basra.

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:14.630
And so to end with
now, just this

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:18.650
is a picture of some of the
families who were in my house

00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:21.200
as I mentioned, when
they lost their own homes

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:24.150
around the outside.

00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:26.330
I invited them to move in.

00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:28.670
And so I had five families,
different families,

00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:29.690
living in the house.

00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:31.065
Obviously I wasn't
there anymore.

00:40:31.065 --> 00:40:33.030
I'd come back to this country.

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:35.300
And of course it's
very difficult.

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:38.480
Five families who don't
know each other, all

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:41.180
having to share the same house.

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:43.400
Some were virtually illiterate.

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.140
Some were university educated.

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:47.330
So it's not a natural blend.

00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:49.852
They've only got one
kitchen, two bathrooms,

00:40:49.852 --> 00:40:51.560
and there are lots of
arguments about who

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:53.450
was paying the electricity,
to who was paying the water.

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:54.770
Because believe
it or not, people

00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:56.270
are still expected
to pay the bills,

00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:58.550
even in the middle of the war.

00:40:58.550 --> 00:41:02.060
So there was a lot of
arguing and aggravation

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:03.817
in the first couple of months.

00:41:03.817 --> 00:41:05.900
But then all that settle
down, when they gradually

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:07.460
got used to each other.

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:09.900
And the wonderful thing
was that they ended up

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:10.815
the best of friends.

00:41:10.815 --> 00:41:12.440
And so these four
children are actually

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:15.890
from four different families,
who have stayed very, very

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:17.460
close to each other.

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:19.220
And this is one of
the things about war.

00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:21.050
One has to realize
that although all we

00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:24.860
see on the screens the whole
time is the awfulness of war,

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:27.950
the damage, war pushes
you out of your comfort

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:32.060
zone in a way that can be
actually very productive.

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:36.080
And a lot of my friends in
Syria, about half of whom

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:37.930
are still inside the
country, the other half

00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:41.460
are scattered around
Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon,

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:43.720
and some of them have
made it to Germany,

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:49.631
they all feel that this has
been an incredible experience

00:41:49.631 --> 00:41:50.130
for them.

00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:52.004
They've all done things
that they would never

00:41:52.004 --> 00:41:52.940
have dreamt of doing.

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:55.970
So they've got themselves
new qualifications.

00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:58.640
They've entered fields they
would never have done before.

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.327
A lot of the women,
for example, I

00:42:00.327 --> 00:42:04.220
mean, there are far fewer
women, with far too many women

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:07.710
almost in Damascus these days.

00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:11.870
Because so many of the men
have left or been killed.

00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:14.390
And so the women are
finding themselves,

00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:17.060
rather like with the world
wars in this country,

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:19.730
being forced to go out and do
things that they would never

00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:20.990
have done ordinarily.

00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:24.620
So there have been many, many
positives to the whole thing.

00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:29.710
So I just want to end by saying
that the book actually supports

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:33.080
a special charity for a
special fund for Syrian higher

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:37.430
education, so that Syrians
who've had their university

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:41.310
studies interrupted can
continue them outside of Syria.

00:42:41.310 --> 00:42:44.280
Because the vital thing is
that at the end of all of this

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:48.830
that there must be an elite
of highly trained Syrians

00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:50.600
who can bring the country back.

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:54.350
Because Syria is such a
gifted society, and so many

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:56.810
of our inventions come from
that part of the world,

00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:58.820
going right back
to the alphabet,

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:02.330
the first musical notation
was invented there, so

00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:03.980
many scientific inventions.

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:10.140
The list is almost endless--

00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:14.390
the division of minutes
into 60, 60 minutes

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:17.090
in an hour and 60 seconds.

00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:18.615
Massive numbers
of things actually

00:43:18.615 --> 00:43:19.990
come from this
part of the world.

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:23.150
It's a highly creative society.

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:26.390
Steve Jobs was an
obvious example,

00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:29.960
whose birth father was Syrian.

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:32.520
They have a natural
adaptability.

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:35.150
It's part of the culture,
part of the identity

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:36.920
because they've always
had this blending.

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:39.650
It's a real argument for
multiculturalism, in my view.

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:42.740
It shows that because
of all that blending,

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:44.790
you can become a
much richer society.

00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:47.540
And that's how Syrian
society always has been,

00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:49.580
and remarkably still
is, although you

00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:51.020
don't hear about it.

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:53.000
It's still very, very cohesive.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.760
And so it deserves
all our support.

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:59.990
So try to remember when you hear
the news, that in the middle

00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:03.670
there is this silent
majority of the vast majority

00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:05.420
of the Syrian population
who are currently

00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:09.530
stuck between Assad
and ISIS, who of course

00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:11.340
never have fought each other.

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:13.350
That's the massive
irony in this.

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:14.930
They've never fought each other.

00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:16.970
They've just been
intent on wiping out

00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:19.490
the moderate Syrian
opposition in the middle.

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:23.900
And that's why we're in this
tragic situation at the moment.

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:26.870
But as I said, it's not it's
not entirely without hope.

00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:29.900
Because I do think that there
will be a massive rebirth

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:31.550
at the end of all of this.

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:33.820
Thanks very much.

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:36.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:36.624 --> 00:44:37.790
SPEAKER 1: Thanks very much.

00:44:40.385 --> 00:44:41.510
Thank you very much, Diana.

00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:44.510
This is an incredible talk on
a very, very timely subject.

00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:46.430
And we have a few
minutes for questions

00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:48.085
if anyone would like to ask one.

00:44:51.686 --> 00:44:53.060
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for the talk.

00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:54.894
I actually had two
maybe linked questions.

00:44:54.894 --> 00:44:56.560
The first is, after
the death of someone

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.790
like Assef Shawkat, the
sanctions against Rami

00:44:58.790 --> 00:45:03.267
Makhlouf, what does the
inner circle around Assad

00:45:03.267 --> 00:45:03.850
look like now?

00:45:03.850 --> 00:45:05.991
Like, how strong is he?

00:45:05.991 --> 00:45:09.130
And perhaps there's a link
to that-- after the gassing,

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:12.050
if the Americans and coalition
forces had intervened

00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:14.950
at that point, do you think
we could have toppled Assad

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:17.530
and would something
better be in his place?

00:45:17.530 --> 00:45:20.170
DIANA DARKE: Well, just to
start with the last one,

00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:23.050
I have been consistently
of the view that we should

00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:26.260
have intervened, actually
even before that,

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:28.360
the chemical attack.

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:32.860
I think we should have gone in
right in the summer of 2011,

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:35.470
when the Syrians were
begging us to come in,

00:45:35.470 --> 00:45:37.540
and when we'd gone into Libya.

00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:40.870
And so that's what gave them
the courage to actually stand up

00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:43.780
and to go out on all their
peaceful demonstrations.

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:45.430
Because, again, it's
worth remembering

00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:48.280
that for the first four to
six months, it was peaceful.

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:50.440
The demonstrations
were peaceful.

00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:53.020
But they just got shot.

00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:54.245
They just got gunned down.

00:45:54.245 --> 00:45:55.870
Peaceful demonstrators
got gunned down.

00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:59.380
That's what turned the whole
thing into an armed uprising.

00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:02.170
But then when the Free Syrian
Army rose up spontaneously

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:05.680
that first summer in
2011, mainly made up

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:08.020
of defectors from
Assad's army, they

00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:09.340
were begging us to come in.

00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:10.000
"Come in.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:10.750
Please help us.

00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:14.169
Make a safe zone along the
Turkish border where we can go

00:46:14.169 --> 00:46:15.460
and where we can be protected."

00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:19.600
If we had done that,
then, ISIS would never

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:23.290
have existed, because ISIS
didn't come along until 2013.

00:46:23.290 --> 00:46:26.000
The vacuum was
there for two years.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.590
But we did nothing.

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:30.580
And so ISIS would not have been
able to get its toehold there

00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:32.500
in Syria.

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:35.239
It meant The whole refugee
crisis would not have existed.

00:46:35.239 --> 00:46:37.030
There would be no need
for all those people

00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:39.970
to come to Europe, to
destabilize Europe, and all

00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:43.090
the terrorism and
everything that we now

00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:44.170
associate with Syria.

00:46:44.170 --> 00:46:46.690
None of that needed to happen.

00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:48.160
And as for his
inner circle, this

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:49.810
is a very, very
interesting question.

00:46:49.810 --> 00:46:53.567
I mean, so many people
have said "Surely, surely,

00:46:53.567 --> 00:46:55.150
somebody is going
to assassinate him."

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:01.450
After that bomb in which
Assef Shawkat was killed,

00:47:01.450 --> 00:47:03.760
that was the moment at which
a lot of my Syrian friends

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:04.540
thought, "Right.

00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:05.070
That's it.

00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:06.790
I've got to leave,
because we know now

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:08.140
it's going to get really ugly.

00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:12.280
Because his retaliation for
that is going to be massive."

00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:14.290
And so that is actually
when most of my friends

00:47:14.290 --> 00:47:17.050
left and went to Turkey or
wherever, where they have now

00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:20.860
carved out entirely new
lives for themselves.

00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:24.400
But the interesting thing is
now, as the war has wound on,

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:27.310
and Assad has-- the only
reason Assad is still

00:47:27.310 --> 00:47:30.700
there, of course, is because
Iran has been supporting him

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:32.530
to a massive degree.

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:33.850
They've been lending him money.

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:38.740
They've been training up this
massive paramilitary force

00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:40.100
and the national defense forces.

00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:42.280
100,000 people.

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:44.530
They're doing the
fighting, and Hezbollah.

00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:47.590
The Syrian army itself
has been so weakened.

00:47:47.590 --> 00:47:49.030
It's really, really weak.

00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:50.230
It would have fallen.

00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:52.240
But even with all
that help from Iran,

00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:53.880
it would still have fallen.

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:56.710
And Russia could see
that, which is why it then

00:47:56.710 --> 00:48:01.270
came into the war as well,
just over a year ago,

00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:02.830
to make sure that
Assad didn't fall.

00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:06.460
I mean, the man would have been
gone by now if it hadn't been.

00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:07.990
And this is without our help.

00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:09.230
We did nothing.

00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:11.230
They got very little
help, the moderate rebels.

00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:12.830
We did nothing.

00:48:12.830 --> 00:48:15.520
And Assad had all
the help from Iran,

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:18.320
all that help from Russia.

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:21.010
It's a miracle, frankly, that
there's still anything left

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:22.900
of the Syrian opposition.

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:23.870
But it is still there.

00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:25.360
And it's not going to go away.

00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:29.530
So all this stuff
about maybe Assad

00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:32.710
is the lesser of two evils
is just so shortsighted.

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:34.270
There's no way.

00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:37.090
And people forget that
the deaths in Syria,

00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:40.300
close to half a million, it's
very difficult to document them

00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:43.070
and the UN stopped
counting so long ago,

00:48:43.070 --> 00:48:45.760
but the deaths,
95% of the deaths

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:47.810
have been caused by
the Assad regime.

00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:49.540
People imagine it's all ISIS.

00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:52.620
ISIS has been responsible
for a tiny number of deaths.

00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:55.855
It's all got
disproportionately--

00:48:55.855 --> 00:48:58.240
We see it through
this lens of terrorism

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:00.340
now, that we're all so
frightened of the terrorism

00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:02.710
that we think that
ISIS is the problem.

00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:03.850
ISIS isn't the problem.

00:49:03.850 --> 00:49:06.370
ISIS is the result
of the problem

00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:09.530
that we didn't deal
with right at the start.

00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:14.950
Yeah, but so tragically his
group is being held in position

00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:17.720
by Iran and Russia.

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:19.330
And they're not
going to go away.

00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:21.730
SPEAKER 1: So what's next
for Syrian people who

00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:23.290
have gone to Europe?

00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:27.584
What would be required to entice
these people to return to Syria

00:49:27.584 --> 00:49:28.750
to help rebuild the country?

00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:30.430
DIANA DARKE: Every
single Syrian I

00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:33.790
know would go back to Syria like
a shot if it was safe for them

00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:34.570
to do so.

00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:35.340
Every single one.

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:39.940
I mean, it's remarkable how
they have such a deep connection

00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:42.676
to their homeland, huge.

00:49:42.676 --> 00:49:44.800
I mean, I've got friends
who've now been in Germany

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:46.000
for two to three years.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.740
They've been taught German.

00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:49.135
They've tried to integrate.

00:49:49.135 --> 00:49:51.750
It's very difficult to get work.

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:52.720
They would go back.

00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:53.700
They want to go back.

00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:57.300
They're so closely in touch
with everything that's going on.

00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:01.030
And so that is what gives
me hope, to be honest,

00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:03.040
that it will rebuild.

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:03.870
It will rebuild.

00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:06.090
And let's hope
that Trump manages

00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:09.270
to build some big,
beautiful safe zones

00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:11.755
and gets the Saudis
to pay for them.

00:50:11.755 --> 00:50:14.130
Because that would be terrific,
if he could achieve that.

00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:15.500
And Pigs might fly.

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:17.310
We'll see.

00:50:17.310 --> 00:50:18.840
SPEAKER 1: And on
that note, please

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:22.220
join me in thanking Diana
Darke for her fabulous talk.

00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:24.970
