The body is incredible and taking information from the outside world through

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.820
our five senses and making sense of it so that we can respond appropriately.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.161
We're able to do this because of three types of neurons. First, we have sensory

00:00:12.161 --> 00:00:16.648
neurons. Sensory neurons receive information from sense organs, for example the

00:00:16.648 --> 00:00:21.830
eyes, the tongue or the skin. Everything that we can see, touch, taste or feel

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.900
is because of our sensory neurons. So the sensory neurons send sensory

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.765
information to our brain and spinal cord. Take this for example, when I saw

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:36.600
Sputnik, the sensory neurons in my eyes were firing. When I was petting him,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.450
the sensory neurons in my skin were firing because I could feel how soft he

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.724
was. The sensory neurons send the message to the brain where the brain

00:00:43.724 --> 00:00:48.197
processes it. The motor neurons carry commands from our brains to our muscles

00:00:48.197 --> 00:00:52.715
to allow us to act appropriately. So my motor neurons allowed me to bend down

00:00:52.715 --> 00:00:57.520
and pet Sputnik. Finally, we have the Interneurons. The interneurons connect

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.870
the neurons to other neurons. Some interneurons connect sensory neurons to

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.935
motor neurons, or else some interneurons connect to neurons in the brain.

00:01:05.935 --> 00:01:11.674
Interneurons outnumber our sensory and our motor neurons, 10 to 1. So that's

00:01:11.674 --> 00:01:15.172
right, sensory neurons are responsible for all the incoming information that

00:01:15.172 --> 00:01:19.754
goes to our brain. Our brain interprets it and our motor neurons allow us to

00:01:19.754 --> 00:01:25.174
carry out appropriate behaviors. Our interneurons connect motor neurons to

00:01:25.174 --> 00:01:28.505
sensory neurons and also neurons to parts of the brain.

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:30.908
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thanks Susan, you want to give them a quiz on this?

00:01:30.908 --> 00:01:32.369
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes. Let's quiz.
