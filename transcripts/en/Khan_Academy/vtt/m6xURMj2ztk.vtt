00:00:00.647 --> 00:00:02.170
- [Voiceover] Represent the following data

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.545
using a box-and-whiskers plot.

00:00:05.545 --> 00:00:09.064
Exclude the median when
computing the quartiles.

00:00:09.064 --> 00:00:11.771
Alright, let's see if we can do this.

00:00:11.771 --> 00:00:13.187
So, we have a bunch of data, here,

00:00:13.187 --> 00:00:14.953
and they say if it helps,
you might drag the numbers

00:00:14.953 --> 00:00:16.078
to put them in a different order.

00:00:16.078 --> 00:00:18.076
So, we can drag these numbers
around, which is useful,

00:00:18.076 --> 00:00:20.249
because we will want to order them.

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:22.057
The order isn't checked with your answer,

00:00:22.057 --> 00:00:24.518
and I'm doing this off of
the Khan Academy exercises,

00:00:24.518 --> 00:00:26.376
so I don't have my drawing tablet here.

00:00:26.376 --> 00:00:27.977
I just have my mouse, and I'm interacting

00:00:27.977 --> 00:00:30.067
with the exercise, which
I encourage you to do too,

00:00:30.067 --> 00:00:31.856
because the best way to
learn any of this stuff

00:00:31.856 --> 00:00:33.828
is to actually practice
it, and at Khan Academy,

00:00:33.828 --> 00:00:37.447
we have 150,000 exercises
for you to practice with.

00:00:37.447 --> 00:00:39.507
Anyway, so, let's do this.

00:00:39.507 --> 00:00:41.398
Let's order this thing,

00:00:41.398 --> 00:00:44.243
so we can figure out the range of numbers.

00:00:44.243 --> 00:00:45.427
What's the lowest and what's the highest?

00:00:45.427 --> 00:00:48.364
Let's see, there's a seven here.

00:00:48.364 --> 00:00:50.708
Then, let's see, we have some eights.

00:00:50.708 --> 00:00:53.321
We've got some eights goin' on.

00:00:53.321 --> 00:00:54.945
Then we have some nines,

00:00:54.945 --> 00:00:58.252
actually we have a bunch of
nines, we have four nines here.

00:00:58.252 --> 00:01:00.632
We have some nines, and then, let's see,

00:01:00.632 --> 00:01:02.166
13 is the largest number.

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.963
There we go, we've ordered the numbers.

00:01:03.963 --> 00:01:06.241
So, our smallest number is seven, and this

00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:07.518
is what the whiskers are useful for.

00:01:07.518 --> 00:01:10.336
For helping us figure out
the entire range of numbers.

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:12.058
Our smallest number is seven.

00:01:12.058 --> 00:01:16.155
Our largest number is
13, so we know the range.

00:01:16.155 --> 00:01:17.583
Now, let's plot the median,

00:01:17.583 --> 00:01:20.235
and this'll help us once getting

00:01:20.235 --> 00:01:21.873
this center line of our box,

00:01:21.873 --> 00:01:24.020
but then also we need to
do that, to figure out

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.094
what these other lines are,

00:01:25.094 --> 00:01:26.891
that kind of define the box.

00:01:26.891 --> 00:01:29.576
To define the middle two
fourths of our number.

00:01:29.576 --> 00:01:31.676
Of our data, or the middle two quartiles.

00:01:31.676 --> 00:01:33.094
Roughly the middle two quartiles,

00:01:33.094 --> 00:01:35.718
it depends how some of
the numbers work out.

00:01:35.718 --> 00:01:37.980
But this middle line is going

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.403
to be the median of our entire data set.

00:01:40.403 --> 00:01:42.217
Now, the median is just the middle number.

00:01:42.217 --> 00:01:45.268
If we sort them in order, median
is just the middle number.

00:01:45.268 --> 00:01:46.838
We have 11 numbers here.

00:01:46.838 --> 00:01:49.549
So, the middle one is gonna
have five on either side.

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.606
It's just gonna be this nine.

00:01:51.606 --> 00:01:53.873
If we had 10 numbers here,

00:01:53.873 --> 00:01:56.113
if we had an even number of
numbers, you actually would

00:01:56.113 --> 00:01:58.761
of had two middle numbers,
and then to find the median,

00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:01.279
you'd found the mean of those two.

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:02.730
If that last sentence was confusing,

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.832
watch the videos on
Khan Academy, on median,

00:02:05.832 --> 00:02:08.468
and I go into much more detail on that.

00:02:08.468 --> 00:02:10.097
But here, I have 11 numbers,

00:02:10.097 --> 00:02:11.774
so my median is going
to be the middle one.

00:02:11.774 --> 00:02:13.794
It has five larger, five less,

00:02:13.794 --> 00:02:16.265
it's this nine, right over here.

00:02:16.265 --> 00:02:18.687
If I had my pen tablet, I would circle it.

00:02:18.687 --> 00:02:19.760
So, it's this nine.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.883
That is the median.

00:02:21.883 --> 00:02:26.208
Now, we need to figure out
what number is half way,

00:02:27.254 --> 00:02:28.718
what number is the median

00:02:28.718 --> 00:02:31.224
of the numbers in this bottom half?

00:02:31.224 --> 00:02:32.751
They told us to exclude the median

00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:34.516
when we compute the quartiles.

00:02:34.516 --> 00:02:35.456
So, this was the median.

00:02:35.456 --> 00:02:36.629
Let's ignore that.

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.068
So, let's look at all of
the numbers below that.

00:02:38.068 --> 00:02:40.972
So, this nine, eight,
eight, eight, and seven.

00:02:40.972 --> 00:02:42.055
So, we have five numbers.

00:02:42.055 --> 00:02:44.615
What's the median of these five numbers?

00:02:44.615 --> 00:02:46.081
Well the median's the middle number.

00:02:46.081 --> 00:02:47.237
That is eight.

00:02:47.237 --> 00:02:50.693
So, the beginning of our second quartile

00:02:50.693 --> 00:02:52.526
is gonna be an eight, right over there.

00:02:52.526 --> 00:02:54.913
We do the same thing
for our third quartile.

00:02:54.913 --> 00:02:57.059
Remember, this was our median
of our entire data set.

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:58.210
Let's exclude it.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.476
Let's look at the top half
of the numbers, so to speak.

00:03:01.476 --> 00:03:04.119
There's five numbers here, in order.

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:06.894
So, the middle one, the
median of this is 10.

00:03:06.894 --> 00:03:09.622
So, that's gonna be the
top of our second quartile.

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:10.887
Just like that, we're done.

00:03:10.887 --> 00:03:14.819
We have constructed our
box-and-whisker plot.
