00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.959
 
Rick you have noticed one of the most

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:12.969
Rick you have noticed one of the most
 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:14.910
Rick you have noticed one of the most
wonderful and consistent patterns in the

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:14.920
wonderful and consistent patterns in the
 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.070
wonderful and consistent patterns in the
whole universe the universe is very good

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080
whole universe the universe is very good
 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.560
whole universe the universe is very good
at making spinning disks our solar

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570
at making spinning disks our solar
 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.929
at making spinning disks our solar
system is a disk and all the planets go

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:21.939
system is a disk and all the planets go
 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:23.850
system is a disk and all the planets go
around in basically the same plane and

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860
around in basically the same plane and
 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.130
around in basically the same plane and
they all go around in the same direction

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140
they all go around in the same direction
 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.499
they all go around in the same direction
why should that be their disks all over

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:28.509
why should that be their disks all over
 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:29.729
why should that be their disks all over
the place I mean think about the rings

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:29.739
the place I mean think about the rings
 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:31.589
the place I mean think about the rings
of Saturn the rings of Saturn are also

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599
of Saturn the rings of Saturn are also
 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.690
of Saturn the rings of Saturn are also
very very thin and they all go around in

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700
very very thin and they all go around in
 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.450
very very thin and they all go around in
the same direction galaxies spiral

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460
the same direction galaxies spiral
 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.099
the same direction galaxies spiral
galaxies are one big disk with

00:00:38.099 --> 00:00:38.109
galaxies are one big disk with
 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:39.860
galaxies are one big disk with
everything moving around a common center

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870
everything moving around a common center
 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.000
everything moving around a common center
disk seemed to be something that the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010
disk seemed to be something that the
 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.430
disk seemed to be something that the
universe likes to make and in fact that

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440
universe likes to make and in fact that
 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.829
universe likes to make and in fact that
really is true and it has to do with a

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839
really is true and it has to do with a
 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:48.270
really is true and it has to do with a
number of things it has to do with the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280
number of things it has to do with the
 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.040
number of things it has to do with the
force of gravity and something called

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050
force of gravity and something called
 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.649
force of gravity and something called
the conservation of angular momentum now

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:52.659
the conservation of angular momentum now
 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:55.169
the conservation of angular momentum now
gravity is very good at bringing stuff

00:00:55.169 --> 00:00:55.179
gravity is very good at bringing stuff
 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:57.419
gravity is very good at bringing stuff
together and bringing it together so it

00:00:57.419 --> 00:00:57.429
together and bringing it together so it
 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:00:59.189
together and bringing it together so it
becomes denser and denser and begins to

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199
becomes denser and denser and begins to
 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.189
becomes denser and denser and begins to
fall into the center our solar system

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199
fall into the center our solar system
 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:04.320
fall into the center our solar system
formed out of a giant cloud of dust and

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330
formed out of a giant cloud of dust and
 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.850
formed out of a giant cloud of dust and
gas about four and a half billion years

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860
gas about four and a half billion years
 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.370
gas about four and a half billion years
ago it was actually many trillions of

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380
ago it was actually many trillions of
 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.380
ago it was actually many trillions of
miles across at first but it had to get

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390
miles across at first but it had to get
 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.630
miles across at first but it had to get
much smaller in order for the densities

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640
much smaller in order for the densities
 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.580
much smaller in order for the densities
to get high enough in the temperatures

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590
to get high enough in the temperatures
 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.100
to get high enough in the temperatures
also to get warm enough inside to give

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110
also to get warm enough inside to give
 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.920
also to get warm enough inside to give
birth to the Sun actually ignite a star

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930
birth to the Sun actually ignite a star
 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.450
birth to the Sun actually ignite a star
so you have this collapsing cloud of

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460
so you have this collapsing cloud of
 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.850
so you have this collapsing cloud of
dust okay well you can sort of

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860
dust okay well you can sort of
 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.380
dust okay well you can sort of
understand that gravity wants to bring

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390
understand that gravity wants to bring
 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.360
understand that gravity wants to bring
all that together but why does it start

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370
all that together but why does it start
 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.150
all that together but why does it start
to spin up there's something called the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160
to spin up there's something called the
 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.880
to spin up there's something called the
conservation of angular momentum and and

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890
conservation of angular momentum and and
 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.740
conservation of angular momentum and and
that basically says that if anything has

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750
that basically says that if anything has
 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.080
that basically says that if anything has
any spin at all even just a little bit

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090
any spin at all even just a little bit
 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.720
any spin at all even just a little bit
of motion as gravity brings it together

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:39.730
of motion as gravity brings it together
 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.970
of motion as gravity brings it together
and makes it smaller that spin is

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980
and makes it smaller that spin is
 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.670
and makes it smaller that spin is
accelerated it's sped up and probably

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680
accelerated it's sped up and probably
 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.530
accelerated it's sped up and probably
the example most people know best of all

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540
the example most people know best of all
 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.090
the example most people know best of all
you can actually feel this if you want

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100
you can actually feel this if you want
 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.640
you can actually feel this if you want
to do this but an ice skater if you've

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650
to do this but an ice skater if you've
 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.130
to do this but an ice skater if you've
seen an ice skater do a spin usually

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140
seen an ice skater do a spin usually
 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.150
seen an ice skater do a spin usually
what they do is that they have their

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160
what they do is that they have their
 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.130
what they do is that they have their
arms outstretched and they're spinning

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140
arms outstretched and they're spinning
 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.110
arms outstretched and they're spinning
around relatively slowly and then they

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120
around relatively slowly and then they
 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.510
around relatively slowly and then they
bring their arms in and they spin faster

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520
bring their arms in and they spin faster
 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.160
bring their arms in and they spin faster
and faster it's kind of amazing that any

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170
and faster it's kind of amazing that any
 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.660
and faster it's kind of amazing that any
person can keep their balance when they

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670
person can keep their balance when they
 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.480
person can keep their balance when they
do that that is an application of the

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490
do that that is an application of the
 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.669
do that that is an application of the
conservation of angular momentum you

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679
conservation of angular momentum you
 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.979
conservation of angular momentum you
have an extended body your arms are out

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989
have an extended body your arms are out
 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.410
have an extended body your arms are out
and you're spinning slowly in order to

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420
and you're spinning slowly in order to
 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.890
and you're spinning slowly in order to
conserve the energy in that spin as that

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900
conserve the energy in that spin as that
 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.319
conserve the energy in that spin as that
body becomes smaller the spin goes

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:19.329
body becomes smaller the spin goes
 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:20.580
body becomes smaller the spin goes
faster and faster

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590
faster and faster
 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.130
faster and faster
and so what happens in these clouds is

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140
and so what happens in these clouds is
 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.830
and so what happens in these clouds is
that a cloud usually has just a tiny

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840
that a cloud usually has just a tiny
 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.690
that a cloud usually has just a tiny
little bit of a drift velocity it's

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700
little bit of a drift velocity it's
 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.760
little bit of a drift velocity it's
going around the galaxies or maybe a

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770
going around the galaxies or maybe a
 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.860
going around the galaxies or maybe a
nearby star exploded and it's kind of

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870
nearby star exploded and it's kind of
 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.110
nearby star exploded and it's kind of
all moving in one direction the cloud

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120
all moving in one direction the cloud
 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.030
all moving in one direction the cloud
itself has a little bit of velocity as a

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040
itself has a little bit of velocity as a
 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.030
itself has a little bit of velocity as a
cloud as a whole particles inside that

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040
cloud as a whole particles inside that
 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.400
cloud as a whole particles inside that
cloud could be going any which way but

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410
cloud could be going any which way but
 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.530
cloud could be going any which way but
as the cloud begins to come together

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540
as the cloud begins to come together
 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.380
as the cloud begins to come together
under gravity any little bit of spin

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390
under gravity any little bit of spin
 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.070
under gravity any little bit of spin
gets accelerated actually becomes faster

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080
gets accelerated actually becomes faster
 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.040
gets accelerated actually becomes faster
and so as the cloud collapses any little

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050
and so as the cloud collapses any little
 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.470
and so as the cloud collapses any little
directional drift becomes a spin and the

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480
directional drift becomes a spin and the
 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.530
directional drift becomes a spin and the
cloud itself begins to spin around okay

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540
cloud itself begins to spin around okay
 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.660
cloud itself begins to spin around okay
so that gets you a spinning cloud and

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670
so that gets you a spinning cloud and
 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.640
so that gets you a spinning cloud and
why does it collapse down into a disk

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650
why does it collapse down into a disk
 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.920
why does it collapse down into a disk
and this is an interesting bit of

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930
and this is an interesting bit of
 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.540
and this is an interesting bit of
physics that has to do with things like

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550
physics that has to do with things like
 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.759
physics that has to do with things like
collisions in the case of a very large

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769
collisions in the case of a very large
 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.070
collisions in the case of a very large
cloud that's forming a star it might not

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080
cloud that's forming a star it might not
 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.360
cloud that's forming a star it might not
even be that things are colliding

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370
even be that things are colliding
 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.400
even be that things are colliding
directly but gravitationally they're

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410
directly but gravitationally they're
 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.380
directly but gravitationally they're
influencing them as they as you go by as

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390
influencing them as they as you go by as
 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.240
influencing them as they as you go by as
you go by different parts of mass they

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250
you go by different parts of mass they
 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.640
you go by different parts of mass they
tug on each other with their gravity so

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650
tug on each other with their gravity so
 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.979
tug on each other with their gravity so
this whole cloud is spinning and things

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989
this whole cloud is spinning and things
 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.960
this whole cloud is spinning and things
begin to interact gravitationally they

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970
begin to interact gravitationally they
 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.300
begin to interact gravitationally they
begin to collide with each other the

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310
begin to collide with each other the
 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.979
begin to collide with each other the
particles have motion in every direction

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989
particles have motion in every direction
 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.840
particles have motion in every direction
some are going up and some are going

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850
some are going up and some are going
 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.819
some are going up and some are going
down and as they start to hit each other

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829
down and as they start to hit each other
 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.190
down and as they start to hit each other
that's kind of balanced out this bed

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200
that's kind of balanced out this bed
 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.900
that's kind of balanced out this bed
that up and down is sort of canceled out

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910
that up and down is sort of canceled out
 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.479
that up and down is sort of canceled out
but everything has the same motion as

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489
but everything has the same motion as
 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.190
but everything has the same motion as
the cloud is spinning so that's

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200
the cloud is spinning so that's
 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.420
the cloud is spinning so that's
basically the only thing that's left

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430
basically the only thing that's left
 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.240
basically the only thing that's left
over at the end everything gets canceled

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250
over at the end everything gets canceled
 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.740
over at the end everything gets canceled
out is all these things collide and

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750
out is all these things collide and
 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.140
out is all these things collide and
interact but the spin of the cloud is

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150
interact but the spin of the cloud is
 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.970
interact but the spin of the cloud is
still there and so over time you

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980
still there and so over time you
 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.030
still there and so over time you
collapse down into a disk so the only

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040
collapse down into a disk so the only
 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.460
collapse down into a disk so the only
reason you make disks is because of this

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470
reason you make disks is because of this
 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.380
reason you make disks is because of this
law of conservation of angular momentum

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390
law of conservation of angular momentum
 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.509
law of conservation of angular momentum
and the idea that gravity brings things

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519
and the idea that gravity brings things
 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.580
and the idea that gravity brings things
together have those two things working

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590
together have those two things working
 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.770
together have those two things working
side by side and you get a disk and

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780
side by side and you get a disk and
 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.990
side by side and you get a disk and
that's why our solar system formed that

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000
that's why our solar system formed that
 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.970
that's why our solar system formed that
way the planets then formed out of that

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980
way the planets then formed out of that
 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.400
way the planets then formed out of that
spinning disk of gas so it makes sense

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410
spinning disk of gas so it makes sense
 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.210
spinning disk of gas so it makes sense
that they're all going in the same

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220
that they're all going in the same
 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.460
that they're all going in the same
direction they all formed out of the gas

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470
direction they all formed out of the gas
 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.100
direction they all formed out of the gas
going around the Sun in that way

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:18.110
going around the Sun in that way
 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.350
going around the Sun in that way
