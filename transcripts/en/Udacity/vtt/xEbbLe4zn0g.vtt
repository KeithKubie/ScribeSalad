00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
The answer here is 3 to the power of N/2

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.160
is the same as 3 to the power of Â½ to the power of N,

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.290
which is the same as the root of 3 to the power of N,

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:17.070
which, if you use a calculator, is 1.733 to the power of N.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.540
Instead of 2 to the power of N assignments,

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.830
we now only have to check 1.733 to the power of N.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.700
We have just squashed the exponent of our algorithm

00:00:26.700 --> 99:59:59.000
using a smart search tree instead of brute force.
