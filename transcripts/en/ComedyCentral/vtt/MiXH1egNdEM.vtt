You started stand-up in New
Jersey, lives in New York?

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:30.530 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I lived in New
York for four years.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.265 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Well how come it
says lives in New York,

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:34.601
it should be a D and not an S.

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:36.636
- Did you guys get
this from my MySpace?

00:00:36.636 --> 00:00:38.638
- Where are my writers
getting this information?

00:00:38.638 --> 00:00:40.640
When I answered the door

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.377 align:start size:88% position:13%
I was assuming that
you were from New York.

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:45.945
- I mean,

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:47.981

inside of me, absolutely.

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:49.449
- Let's talk some more.

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:50.283
- Okay.

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:04.798
- You have a web series.

00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:06.166
- Yeah I had one.

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.500 align:start size:81% position:19%
- And when you
pitch a web series

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.469

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.871
- Yeah the internet offices,
there's all these companies

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:13.106
that are doing web series.

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:14.574
- So if I wanted
to do a web series

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:17.143 align:start size:94% position:6%
I don't go to the offices
of Safari or Firefox.

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:19.946
- Yeah you do not go
to the Firefox offices.

00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:20.880
- Don't go there.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.681
- You don't go to Google.

00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:22.816
- Don't go to Google.

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:24.551 align:start size:88% position:13%
- You find these
little, little branches.

00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:26.886 align:start size:84% position:16%
- When you said
branch, I looked over,

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:28.321
I see these grapes here,

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:31.558
and they're kind of
a branch of grapes.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.528
I will break this branch.

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:40.733
- Are they fake?

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:42.402
- No these are real.

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:47.373 align:start size:84% position:16%

college baseball?

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:53.279
Thank you.

- There you go, I'm
gonna feed you grapes.

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:58.051
Sean, I hit you in
the eye, I apologize.

00:01:58.051 --> 00:01:59.619

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.088
