00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.160
The most important resources in a computer are space

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.700
and time. Space in memory for storage, and time

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.290
on central processing unit for computation. We may tend

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.470
to think about these things separately, but there are important

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.570
interactions between the two. And just as understanding the

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.600
relationship between space and time is important for any good

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.535
physicist. Understanding the relationship between efficient use of memory

00:00:22.535 --> 00:00:24.910
and then the CPU, is important for any good program.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.500
This interaction will be the subject of this lesson, as we

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.119
look at cache systems and that all important abstraction of virtual memory.
