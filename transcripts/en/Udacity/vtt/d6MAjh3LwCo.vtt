00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.270
The idea for how to rank web pages

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.370
is the same idea as how we measured popularity of people.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.080
Instead of thinking about friendships as the way to measure popularity,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.310
what we're measuring, is links on the web.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.650
When one page has a link to another page,

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.990
that indicates that this more likely that this other page is popular.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.860
Just like when someone is a friend,

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.030
it indicates that the person they are friends with is more likely to be popular.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.400
The goal in ranking web pages is to get a measure

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.800
of how popular a page is based on the other pages that link to it.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.960
We have the same issue with popularity, that not all links are the same--

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.880
that a link from a page that is really important counts for a lot more

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.080
than a link from a page that is not important.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.120
If the NY Times has a link to your page,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.350
that counts for a lot more than if your mom sets up a web page

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.820
and puts a link to your page in it,

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.820
unless your mom is Lady Gaga, in which case her link probably counts for more.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.160
Another way of thinking about this-- is what we're trying to model--

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.930
is a random web surfer.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.030
Our random web surfer has some set of pages that they know about.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.500
Those pages have links to other pages.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.940
Some pages might have a lot of links.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.170
Some pages might just have one link.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.140
Some pages might have no links.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.020
One way to think about this-- is that we're trying to model a random web surfer.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.190
The web surfer starts knowing about some pages.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.560
She picks one page at random. Let's say she picks this page.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.790
And then, when she's on that page, she picks a random link, and follows that link.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.500
Oops, this was a bad starting page, it actually has no out links.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.800
So, then she picks another random page. Let's say she picks this one.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.340
She follows the link from that page, and now she got to the page with no links again.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.080
Let's say she picked a better starting point. Let's say she randomly picked this one.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.910
Now she's got 2 links to follow. She randomly picks one of those. She follows it.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.380
She gets to a new page. She randomly picks a link from that page.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.660
In this case, it only had 1. In this case, it seems we have a bit of a problem,

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.330
because all of the starting pages eventually lead into this one,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.620
which has no outgoing links.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.430
We'll think about how to solve that problem later.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.030
We can think about what our random web surfer is doing--it is picking random pages,

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.340
following links. What we want to measure is the popularity of the page.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.310
That's the probability is that she reaches that given page

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.110
starting from these random pages.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.280
If you did this over-and-over again, and you counted the number of times you reached

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.320
these pages, that would give you a measure of that page's popularity.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.720
This is very similar to the popularity function.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.820
We're going to define a function that we'll call the rank of a page.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.700
Like the way we defined the popularity function, it's going to have 2 inputs.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.570
It is going to have a timestep, and it's going to have the page,

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.170
which we will use the URL for.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.540
The output of rank will be some number, except we'll define for timestep 0--

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.610
this is our base case--we're going to define--all the ranks have value 1--

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.620
we'll actually change that shortly,

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.690
but we'll start out thinking of all the ranks having value 1

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.390
like we did with the popularity scores.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:13.690
Then we'll define the value of the rank at timestep T for any given URL,

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.630
just like we defined the popularity score.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.770
It's going to be the sum of all the pages that are friends with this page,

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.140
and what it means for our web page to be friends with another web page

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.540
is that it has a link to it.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.780
This is going to be for all the pages that exist, that have some like to that URL,

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.110
or its friends.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.520
We are going to go through each of those pages--

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.990
we'll call them in-links instead of friends.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.750
We're going to go through those,

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.890
and we're going to sum up the ranks that we got for those pages at time T minus 1.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.860
This is our first model popularity of web pages.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.900
This is exactly the same as the model we had on popularity for people.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.870
It's not going to work that well yet.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.940
One of the reasons it's not going to work that well is some pages might have lots of links--

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.750
and if a page has lots of links, the value of each one of its links should be diminished.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.990
It shouldn't have the same value as a page that only 1 link that links to this URL.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.820
Maybe that should be the same case for friend popularity.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.060
If someone has lots of friends, each friend is less valued.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.600
Whereas, if someone only has a small number of friends,

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.000
has lots of time for each friend.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.870
This is the way we're going to model web popularity.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.260
We don't want to just give the same score to each link.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.210
We're going to change this by dividing by the number of out links.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.600
If a page has many outgoing links,

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.880
the value of the page that it links to, is less for each page.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.020
A page that is just a long list of links won't have that much influence on the rankings.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.650
If a page only has a few outgoing links,

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.720
well, then they are worth more.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.860
What we're going to do is divide this by the number of out links from P.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.300
Each of the P pages--these will be the value of P--

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.700
as they go through the in links of URL,

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.580
we're going to sum up the rank that we got on the previous timestep

00:05:02.580 --> 99:59:59.000
and divide that by the number of out links.
