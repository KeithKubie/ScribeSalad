In Unit 4, you mentioned that you would tend to store the secret key

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
in a completely separate machine from the one you were developing on

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and you mentioned the concept of a production machine.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Some of our students were wondering if you could go into that a bit more of that. &gt;&gt;Sure. Sure.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We can definitely talk about that--there's a few little edge cases, nothing major,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that we'll just talk about here on the white board and it should help you out.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
How to have a distinction between production and development.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The way we've always structured stuff on my project is we'll have a file.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Usually we call it like--production.py, and depending on the framework we're using,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
sometimes this kind of notion is built in--when you launch your program locally

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
you say something like dev_app whatever--I don't know--let's not complete it

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and you can give a bunch of configuration options.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Often you can give it a configuration file as well.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This isn't always the case--sometimes what we do is in a simple case

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
we just have production.py and we'll have the devel.py.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
These are both basically have a bunch of global variables--things like secret keys

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
that you're going to use for your cookies or the passwords--that sort of thing.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
We'll have one that's only use in production and one that's only used in development.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And this one maybe included in our repository and this one may only exist in our servers,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
or you know may exist in our repository but generally we don't like that stuff

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
getting shared around, especially if it's open source.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
For example, Reddit's open source, so we don't include production.py publicly,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
but I think we do included devel.py for you guys to use locally.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And then when we deploy code on our own machines, we just symlink

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:54.000
to config.py whichever one we want--so I think our apps by default, look for devel.py and--

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and if it's not there, uses config.py which may symlink to like production.py.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
We also have a bunch of different configuration files--if whether you're an app server or

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
whether you're a database or--because we have all these different machine that serve

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
different purposes--so I put all my stuff in one module and then we have this--

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
complicated symlink set up when we do deployment that basically says this app server

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
is doing this job, therefore it should use this file

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and you can copy to place the symlink that you can do all sorts of clever stuff.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Sometimes, it's built into the framework. At Hipmunk, it's built into the framework.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000
We just say ff.py is the name of our main executable and I can just say--

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
dash dash dash dash config equals and always specify one of these files and that was great.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
There's no easy correct answer or simple thing.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Store your globals and different files if you want to keep them secret and when you're deploying it

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
kind of figure it out how to decide which value you want to use--hope that helps.
