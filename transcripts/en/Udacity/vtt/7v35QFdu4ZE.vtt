00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.316
Probably the easiest case would be when the two countries are exactly equal, so

00:00:04.316 --> 00:00:08.342
if this dot equals other country then I can immediately return zero, otherwise

00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:11.758
if this dot area is less than other country dot area I want to return a

00:00:11.758 --> 00:00:15.540
negative number, I will just go with minus one otherwise if this dot area is

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.444
less than, I mean greater than OtherCountry.area, I want to return a positive

00:00:19.444 --> 00:00:28.870
number. I think one'll do. Otherwise their areas must be exactly equal, in

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.461
which case, I'll use the string compareTo method on the name, and return the

00:00:32.461 --> 00:00:37.540
result of that. Once I fix my syntax errors, I want to check that this actually

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.570
works the way I'd expect. So I'm going to get out my code pad. And make some

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.200
new countries. El Salvador should come before Belize. So If I compare El

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.392
Salvador to Belize, I should get a negative number. So far, so good. Certainly

00:00:52.392 --> 00:00:56.281
the opposite direction should be positive. And Belize compared to Belize should

00:00:56.281 --> 00:01:00.399
give me a zero. And just to make sure that I'm breaking ties, let's compare

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.140
Belize to a made up country, with the exact same area. Alright, negative 11

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.990
sounds good to me. So long as compareTo doesn't return zero, with two countries

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.053
that are clearly different countries. Now, to make sure the work wasn't all for

00:01:14.053 --> 00:01:17.164
nothing, I want to show you that now we can sort all of the Central American

00:01:17.164 --> 00:01:22.384
countries. Using the Arrays.sort method now if I run this, now I've tempered

00:01:22.384 --> 00:01:26.290
with the two string method a little bit just to make this easier to see, I get

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.511
the countries in order by their areas, sorting is actually an interesting task,

00:01:30.511 --> 00:01:34.291
when many people have studied for years but we just managed to do it in one

00:01:34.291 --> 00:01:40.350
line of code array for interfaces.
