00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.139
On any given set there are a thousand different
things for the cast and crew to keep in mind

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.940
in order to prevent continuity errors and
other mistakes, so it’s no wonder that some

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:15.940
things slip through the cracks.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.160
With TV shows expected to pump out content
at a faster rate than movies, it’s even

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.390
more likely that even the best shows overlook
a detail or two.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.039
Fortunately in this age of streaming, binge
watching, and over analyzing, nothing gets

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.050
by the Internet.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.090
Here are 10 Shocking Mistakes In Hit TV Shows
The Simpsons

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.020
Before you go getting all judgey about your
favourite shows making mistakes, bear in mind

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.320
that most continuity errors go unnoticed by
most viewers.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.840
For example, how many times do you think you’ve
seen the classic opening credit sequence of

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.840
the Simpsons?

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.690
The original opening was used for almost 20
seasons and contained a mistake you probably

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.110
saw hundreds of times but never noticed.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.609
When Homer gets of his car and is almost run
over by Marge, you can see a bunch of things

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.649
in the back right corner of the garage, but
when it cuts to the next shot, the bike, tools,

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.519
rake and all the other clutter are replaced
by a couple boxes.

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.900
Friends&nbsp;
Remember The One Where Rachel Wears a Vanishing

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.900
Necklace?

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.700
At the beginning of this scene Rachel can
be seen wearing one of her typically fashionable

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.680
accessories around her neck, but when Ross
shows up with his new girlfriend, it disappears,

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.610
then reappears briefly before vanishing completely.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.110
It was early in the series, when Rachel was
still dabbling in the dark arts, nobody talked

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.080
about it much.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.730
Game of Thrones
Speaking of magic necklaces, anyone who saw

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.080
the season 6 premier of Game of Thrones learned
that Melisandre has a pretty special necklace

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.080
herself.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.850
When she removes it, we see that it’s what
provides the old witch with her beautiful

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:35.850
facade.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.740
With no more books from George RR Martin to
guide them, the show runners really seem to

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.660
be laying down the track as they go, especially
when you consider Melisandre was shown without

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:49.510
a necklace while bathing in season 4, and
she is clearly no crone.&nbsp;

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.770
Walking Dead
When you see promotional stills for movies

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.071
or TV shows, they may look like they’re
taken right from the footage but most of the

00:01:56.071 --> 00:01:59.360
time they’re actually taken by still photographers
who are on set during filming.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.751
They’re often one step behind the real camera
crew catching the scene, as you can see in

00:02:02.751 --> 00:02:06.600
this Walking Dead scene where the stills photographer
doesn’t move in time, and his reflection

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.090
is visible as he documents himself ruining
the shot.&nbsp;

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.379
Fresh Prince of Bel Air
In the pilot episode of Fresh Prince of Bel

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.280
Air, Will makes himself at home in his new
digs by dancing to Soul II Soul and hanging

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.510
a Malcolm X poster.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.019
As he punches staples into the wall, you can
see the flimsy set walls waver.

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.870
Either the crew didn’t think the show would
last long enough to make the sets a little

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.190
more permanent, or Uncle Phil and Aunt Viv
have some serious structural issues to take

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.190
care of.&nbsp;

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.510
How I Met Your Mother
In Subway wars, the gang tests one another’s

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.299
knowledge of New York City transit by seeing
who can find the quickest route to a downtown

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:40.299
restaurant.

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.220
In the first scene, Ted uses Bing to bring
up a map on his laptop.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.150
No the mistake isn’t that he’s using Bing,
Microsoft clearly payed for that placement,

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.730
the mistake is the location visible in the
top right corner of the browser.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.489
The map may show New York City streets, where
the show takes place, but Bing reveals that

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.069
they’re actually in Los Angeles, California,
where the show is filmed.&nbsp;

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:04.420
That 70s Show
You know what the best part of That 70s show

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.420
was?

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.420
Those 90s toys.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.590
Not to get all Big Bang Theory on them, but
in the episode where Eric tests Red’s Star

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.450
Wars knowledge by having him identify characters
from the toys, the figures are not era appropriate.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.230
Star Wars fans and toy collectors will be
able to instantly identify these as 90s reissues,

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.719
not the 1977 collection Eric would have.

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:25.510
Contrary to popular belief, it wouldn’t
have been that hard to track down a couple

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.569
original figures for this scene, and it would
have been a nice throwback for people who

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.430
actually remembered playing with them in those
innocent, pre Jar Jar days.&nbsp;

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.560
Buffy The Vampire Slayer
It’s so hard to find good demons these days.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.150
In the season 3 premiere of Buffy the Vampire
Slayer, our hero finds herself fighting a

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.560
whole gaggle of demons from another dimension,
luckily for her they don’t seem to be trying

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.560
very hard.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.860
At one point Buffy throws a spin kick that
clearly doesn’t make contact, but seeing

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.540
nice soft mat lying just off the platform
the demon decides to throw himself on it all

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.540
the same.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.239
It must of been a comfy mat, as we can see
the demon just chilling there for the next

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:57.239
couple shots.

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:03.400
In later seasons they would learn to keep
these things off frame.&nbsp;

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.680
Breaking Bad&nbsp;
As far as famous pizzas go, it goes the cheese

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.650
pizza Buzz eats in Home Alone, then the pie
Spiccoli orders to class in Fast Times at

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.069
Ridgemont high, followed closely by the extra
large pepperoni Walter White roofs in Breaking

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:16.069
Bad.

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:18.710
Brian Cranston famously landed the pizza in
the perfect place on the first take.

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:22.079
It was such a funny image that they decided
to leave it there for the remainder of the

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.670
episode, though it moves around the roof a
little depending on the shot, and even gains

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.270
some extra pepperoni at one point.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.590
It’s presumably just out of frame when the
cousins enter the house, but it should have

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.280
been briefly seen as the axe is taken out
of the trunk.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.750
People loved this gag so much the owners of
the actual house have had issues with people

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:43.560
throwing pizzas on their roof.&nbsp;

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.950
The Flash&nbsp;
Filmmakers and TV directors often use editing

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.560
tricks that make scenes more dramatic but
don’t really make sense if you think about

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.950
them in real space and time.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.310
For example, in this scene from The Flash
where Barry is in the crosshairs of Hot and

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.760
Cold and Eddie saves his skin may look cool
but let’s take a closer look.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.380
Shots of The Flash and the impending doom
coming his way establish lots of clear space

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.240
around them with police cruisers off in the
distance, yet Eddie seems to come out of nowhere

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.240
with the shield.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.240
Where did he come from?

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.500
How did Hot and Cold not see him?

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.910
Either the director hoped we’d be too into
the moment to catch this altered geography,

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.780
or Eddie has some secret powers we don’t
know about.&nbsp;

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.680
So are we mistaken in calling of these mistakes?

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.870
What accidents have you noticed in your favourite
show?
