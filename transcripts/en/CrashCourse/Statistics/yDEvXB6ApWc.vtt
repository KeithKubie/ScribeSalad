00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.620
Hi, I’m Adriene Hill, and Welcome back to
Crash Course Statistics.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.620
Last week I ordered a pair of gold lame pants with DFTBAQ embroidered on them.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.700
The delivery guy said they could come by the next day at exactly 11am on the dot!

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.020
Just kidding. That never happens.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.000
Instead of an exact time, the pants guy gave me a range of times...he said they’d be

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.470
there sometime between 8am and 2pm.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.939
A lot of anticipation…

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.210
We’ve focused a lot on point estimates, like the mean, which are our best guesses,

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.649
but we can give ourselves a little more wiggle room.

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:34.800
Let’s talk about Confidence Intervals.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:44.000
INTRO

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.420
It’s useful to give pregnant mothers a “due
date” when their children will most likely be born.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.340
But it might be more accurate to say that
doctors expect the baby to come around the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.160
due date, not exactly on it.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.820
And...when pollsters claim that a candidate
will get around 30% of the vote, plus or minus 2%.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.640
We can represent the “around” part with a confidence interval.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.180
You may have seen the term “confidence interval” paired with a percentage like 95%.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.090
A “confidence interval” is an estimated
range of values that seem reasonable based

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.560
on what we’ve observed.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.560
It’s center is still the sample mean, but
we’ve got some room on either side for our uncertainty.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.620
So when the delivery guy says my pants are coming between 8 and 2--he’s reflecting

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.080
his uncertainty...the very LARGE  frustrating uncertainty, about when he’ll be there.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.980
For example, a dentist thinks the mean number of cavities the average person has in a 5

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:39.300
year span is greater than 1 and wants to calculate a 95% CI to see if there’s evidence that he's right.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.740
He rounds up a random sample of 100 patients from around the country, and finds that this

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.710
group has a mean of 3 cavities with a standard deviation of 0.5 cavities.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.230
The way we choose that confidence range is related to the distribution of sample means.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.880
The dentist’s estimate of the sampling distribution looks like this:

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.880
And instead of grabbing just the mean, the dentist can include a range of the most common

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.000
95% of the sample means that we expect from this estimate of the distribution of sample means.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.140
So now we have a 95% confidence interval from 2.902 to 3.098 cavities.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.560
Giving a range of numbers instead of just an estimate for the mean better represents

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.320
the fact that there’s some uncertainty and
variation when we estimate population parameters--like

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.560
the mean, proportion, or regression slope--from a sample.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.840
The interpretation of this confidence interval is a bit more complex.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.470
To understand what a confidence interval really is, we have to ask ourselves “what if?”.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.520
If the dentist’s sample was taken again, we wouldn’t expect that the mean and standard

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.480
deviation of cavities would be exactly 3 and 0.5.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.390
They’d probably be a little different.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.180
Which means that our 95% confidence interval would be different than the one we got before.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.630
And if we did it 100 more times with the same sample size, we’d get 100 slightly different

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.840
confidence intervals.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:05.030
The 95% in a 95% confidence interval tells
us that if we calculated a confidence interval

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:11.530
from 100 different samples, about 95 of them would contain the true population mean.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.120
Our “confidence” is in the fact that the
procedure of calculating this confidence interval

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.800
will only exclude the population mean 5% of the time.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.740
That definition implies that it’s possible
that the confidence interval that we created

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.210
doesn’t include the true population mean.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.270
We have no way of knowing for sure.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.040
But the confidence intervals usually contain the true population mean.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.060
Now that we know what a confidence interval is, it might be useful to calculate it.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:44.640
A 95% CI is the range that contains the middle 95% of the values of our estimated sampling distribution.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.020
And to get that range, we can use a z-score.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.930
A z-score tells us the distance between the
mean of a distribution and a data point in

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.240
standard deviations.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.000
Previously, we’ve used z-scores to help us find percentiles.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.930
And we want the middle 95% of the data.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.739
So we want our cutoffs to be at the 2.5th
percentile and the 97.5th percentile so that

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:10.599
95% of the values are within our range, and
5%--2.5% on either side--are not.

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:15.610
To calculate the 95% confidence interval for a sample of 49 chocolate cakes with a mean

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:22.550
of 3,000 calories and a standard deviation
of 500 calories, we can use a z-score of 1.96

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:30.370
(which we got from a table) to calculate the
97.5th percentile, and a z-score of -1.96

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.969
to calculate the 2.5th percentile.

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:37.110
But we need to turn our z-scores back into
calorie values.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.949
To do so, we multiply by the standard error,
71.4 calories and add the mean of 3,000 calories

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.520
to get the 95% confidence interval for our
sample.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.760
We think it’s likely that the real population mean for number of calories in a chocolate

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.080
cake is in that range, though we’re not sure.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.120
What we can have confidence in, is that if we’re in a situation where we’re constantly

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:03.389
taking samples like this and we assume that the true mean is inside of every Confidence

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:06.059
Interval, we’ll only be wrong 5% of the
time.

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:10.849
For example, a gummy worm factory periodically checks whether their bagging machines are

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:12.400
calibrated correctly.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.110
So each week, they take a sample of 100 bags of gummy worms, measure the mean weight and

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.260
standard deviation, and calculate a 95% confidence interval.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.069
They use the Confidence interval to make a decision about whether to pay an expensive

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:27.320
repair man to come repair the gummy worm bagging machine.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.069
They want their bags of gummy worms to have around 10oz of gummy treats, and decide that

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:37.659
as long as the confidence interval contains
10oz--their ideal weight--they’ll assume

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:38.979
their machine is fine.

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:43.279
Decisions based on their confidence intervals will lead them to call an unnecessary repairman

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.960
only 5% of the time.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.140
Many researchers use confidence intervals to see if they contain a certain value of interest.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.900
A researcher may want to know if say a certain number of calories in cake is plausible.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.300
If the sampled value were to fall within their CI it would seem possible, but it’s not

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.160
possible to rule out even if it’s outside the interval.

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:08.380
Because you don’t know if you got the 95%
of CI’s that contain the true mean or the

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:09.409
5% that don’t.

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:15.240
You don’t always need to use a confidence
interval of 95%, we can calculate other confidence intervals too.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.360
You can calculate a 99% confidence interval, or really any percentage confidence interval.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.160
But if you try to calculate a 100% confidence interval, it’ll always be negative infinity

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:29.619
to positive infinity, which just shows that the larger you want your confidence percentage

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:32.599
to be, the wider your interval will be.

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:37.479
You can be more hopeful that your confidence interval contains the true population mean,

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:39.080
but it’s not going to be that helpful.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.789
So there’s a balancing act going on.

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:44.669
You want a confidence interval that’s narrow enough to be useful, but wide enough that

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:50.089
the true population mean will usually be inside a confidence interval of that percent.

00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:52.059
We can’t always have large samples.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.089
It’s often the case that there’s not enough time or money to collect 100s of data points

00:06:56.089 --> 00:06:57.979
to calculate a confidence interval.

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:03.129
With small sample sizes, the distribution
of sample means isn’t always exactly normal,

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:08.649
so we often use a t-distribution instead of
a z-distribution to find out where the middle

00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:10.479
95% of our data is.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:17.060
The t-distribution, like the z-distribution,
is a continuous probability distribution that’s unimodal.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.120
It’s a useful way to represent sampling
distributions.

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:24.240
The t-distribution changes its shape according to how much information there is.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:30.059
With small sample sizes there’s less information so the t-distribution has thicker tails to

00:07:30.059 --> 00:07:34.479
represent that our estimates are more uncertain when there’s not much data.

00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:39.689
However as we get more and more data, the t-distribution becomes identical to the z-distribution.

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:44.880
Generally, sample sizes that are greater than 30 are considered “large enough” because

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:50.029
scientists generally believe that sampling
distributions where the sample is 30+ are

00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:55.620
close enough to normal...though 30 is an arbitrary cutoff just like 0.05.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:59.380
However, when we’re estimating population proportions, like the proportion of people

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:03.800
who are color blind, the general rule is that your sample size need to be big enough so

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:10.500
that on average, you’d expect to get at
least 10 colorblind, and at least 10 non-colorblind people.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.660
For similar reasons, most people consider that “close enough”.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:18.830
Since about 8% of males are colorblind, if
I only had a sample of 50 males, on average

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:23.280
I’d expect around 4 males per group to be color blind, so my sample size wouldn’t

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.180
be quite big enough to assume it’s normal.

00:08:26.189 --> 00:08:29.200
Instead I’d use the almost normal t-distribution.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.080
If a drug that’s being developed claimed to reduce the proportion of colorblind males

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:37.740
born to mothers who took it, we could take a sample of 50 male infants to see if the

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.820
proportion of colorblindness is different from 8%.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:45.320
Though colorblindness isn’t usually life threatening, it can be inconvenient, so you

00:08:45.329 --> 00:08:49.880
decide to calculate a confidence interval
to see if it’s likely to be effective.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:55.370
After randomly selecting 50 male infants from mothers who took the drug, you calculate the

00:08:55.370 --> 00:09:01.019
sample proportion of colorblind infants, which is 6%, and calculate the distribution of sample

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:08.400
proportions which has a mean of 6%--the same as the sample mean--and a standard error of 0.033.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.860
Since our sample size isn’t big enough to assume that the distribution of sample proportions

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:17.820
is shaped like the z-distribution, we can
use the t-distribution to calculate the range

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.160
of our 95% confidence interval.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.569
I mentioned before that the t-distribution’s
shape changes with how much data we have.

00:09:24.569 --> 00:09:29.399
We’ll talk more in detail later as to how
to choose the right t-distribution, but for

00:09:29.399 --> 00:09:30.430
now, we’ll use this one:

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:35.019
While t-score tables do exist, it’s often
easier to have a statistical program calculate

00:09:35.019 --> 00:09:41.209
the t-values that correspond to the 2.5th
and 97.5th percentiles, since there are many

00:09:41.209 --> 00:09:43.149
different t-distributions.

00:09:43.149 --> 00:09:51.540
Your computer tells you that the t-values
corresponding to those percentiles are 2.01 and -2.01.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:56.380
And to convert to a raw score from a t-score, we again use this formula, just with a t-score

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:57.990
instead of a z-score.

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:04.920
Our confidence interval for proportion of
colorblind males is -0.6% to 12.63%.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:11.320
8% is inside our confidence interval, so it’s
not too much of a stretch to think that 8%

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:17.520
could be the true population proportion, even though we only observed a sample proportion of 6%.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:21.320
Based on this confidence interval we don’t
have any evidence to conclude whether this

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.120
medicine is effective or not.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.980
So since the company researching the drug
is pretty cautious, they decide not to go

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:27.640
ahead with it.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:32.340
One place you may have seen confidence intervals “in the wild” is in the news during election season.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:36.100
When newscasters report results from exit
polls they’ll usually say something like

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:40.240
“Candidate A is tracking at 64%, with a margin of error of 3 %” or you may see a

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.240
chart like this:

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.660
The margin or error is usually telling you how far the bounds of the confidence interval

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:50.850
are from the mean, and is represented by this part of the confidence interval formula:

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:55.300
The margin of error, just like a confidence interval, reflects the uncertainty that surrounds

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.890
sample estimates of parameters like the mean or a proportion.

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:03.160
If a poll shows that a Presidential candidate is tracking at of 64% of the vote, plus or

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:07.350
minus 3%, we shouldn’t be surprised if it turns out that the true vote was 61%, since

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:10.660
that’s within the margin or error.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:15.410
You can think of values inside the margin
of error or confidence interval as values

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:20.020
that might be reasonable estimates of the
true population parameter.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.200
Confidence intervals quantify our uncertainty.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.420
They also demonstrate the tradeoff of accuracy for precision.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:30.860
A 100% confidence interval will always contain the true population mean, but it’s useless.

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:35.420
We have to sacrifice a little bit of accuracy in order to gain more precision.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:40.940
A 99% confidence interval will give us a more useful range since it won’t be infinitely

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:45.820
long..., but It’s now possible that our
confidence interval won’t contain the true mean.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:48.700
And you’ve probably encountered this tradeoff in your daily life.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.900
Say you’re running a marathon (like everybody does) and you want to load up your iPhone

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:56.209
with music, but you don’t know how long
you’re going to take, you could buy 150

00:11:56.209 --> 00:12:00.870
songs on iTunes, which is expensive, or you
could buy only 70 and have a chance of running

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:01.870
out of music.

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:05.120
You increase your risk of not having enough, but then again you’re saving yourself from

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.260
having to buy 80 extra songs…

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.470
Maybe it's time for a streaming service?

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:14.690
Confidence intervals demonstrate this delicate balancing act... and help us understand how

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:19.120
to hit the sweet spot of information vs. accuracy.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.860
Thanks for watching, I’ll see you next time in my gold lame pants.
