00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.090
&gt;&gt; Good morning everybody.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.930
Good morning copyright
experts and authors.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.450
My name is Maria Pallante.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.400
I'm the United States
Register of Copyrights.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.220
It's a great privilege
and pleasure

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.230
to welcome you here
today to hear

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.520
about authors' attribution
and integrity.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.900
My staff and I have
been looking forward

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.660
to these discussions
for a long time.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.030
Moral rights are something
that we haven't talked a lot

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.350
about in the United
States in recent years.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.600
And so today, this
symposium marks the beginning

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.360
of a very important conversation
that will eventually extend

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.410
to a formal public process.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.430
I want to extend a very warm
welcome to all of our panelists

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.050
who are here today, including
those of you who have come

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.710
from other cities to be
part of this conversation.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.220
I'm very pleased
that we'll be hearing

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.580
from a wide range
of perspectives.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.980
Legal, scholars,
industry representatives,

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.160
and perhaps most importantly
authors, composers and artists.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.530
I want to thank my staff for
the very hard work that went

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.600
into pulling this together
in the Office of Policy

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.830
and International Affairs,

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.010
headed by my colleague Associate
Register, Karyn Temple Claggett.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.460
And I also want to
thank Sandra Aistars,

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.790
who's sitting here to my left.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:41.880
And all of her colleagues

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.880
at George Mason University
Law School in the Center

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.500
for the Protection of
Intellectual Property.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.040
Not only for collaborating on
this particular symposium today

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.290
but for being one of our very
important academic partners.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.580
This is the, I think,

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.400
third academic partnership
we have along

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.260
with Stanford University School

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.040
and George Washington
University Law School.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.870
And it means everything
to us to be able

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.720
to collaborate in academia.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.080
As Register, I have
advised Congress

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.250
to undertake a comprehensive
review of our copyright law.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.440
That started in 2013.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.230
And I have noted in testimony
that unfortunately the rights

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.010
of individual authors
have been lost

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.370
in the conversation while they
should really be the focus.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.010
Members of the House Judiciary
Committee and the witnesses

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.010
who testified before the
Committee also identified moral

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.280
rights issues.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.310
Including attribution and the
ability of creators to reuse,

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.160
excuse me, refuse certain
uses of their works,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.340
as some of the most
important aspects

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.220
of a well-functioning
copyright system.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.330
The United States is, of course,

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.360
obligated to recognize
authors' moral rights

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.560
under several existing treaties.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.800
Some, however, have begun
to question the strength

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.750
of moral rights protection
in the United States,

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.500
in light of recent and
perhaps not so recent case law.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.510
So today, we will explore
a number of questions.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.590
We'll take a look at the current
state of moral rights protection

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.110
in the United States, and
we'll compare our framework

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.040
with that of other countries.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.210
We'll take a deeper look
at attribution rights

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.240
and how they are
covered under US law.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.200
And we'll consider whether
the law could be amended

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.960
to better protect
authorship attribution.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.100
Authors, composers and artists
will share how they value

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.090
and protect moral rights.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.340
Issues related to how
licensing arrangements

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.590
and contracts are used

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.260
to supplement statutory
rights will also be raised.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.650
And of course, we'll
be looking forward

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.000
to hearing everybody's thoughts

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.820
in the discussion aspects
of today's symposium.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.500
Today marks only the
beginning of our conversation.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.040
After we reflect on
what we hear today,

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.520
the Copyright Office will
issue a notice of inquiry,

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.120
beginning a more formal process,

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.060
including written
public comments.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.730
Although at this
time I don't know

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.780
and won't prejudge the ultimate
outcome of these inquiries

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.110
to come, I can assure you
that, as with all of our work,

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.030
the process will be very
public and very transparent.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.450
Finally, moral rights
have been addressed

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.760
by previous Registers
of Copyrights.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.420
And I am very pleased

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.360
to recognize my two
previous predecessors,

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.190
the Honorable Marybeth Peters
and the Honorable Ralph Oman,

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.370
both of whom are here today.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.970
So thank you very much for
coming and I'd like to turn it

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.970
over to Sandra Aistars.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.170
Good morning everyone.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.990
I'm Sandra Aistars.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.160
I'm a clinical professor

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.300
at George Mason University
School of Law.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.380
And I work with my colleagues
at the Center for Protection

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.510
of Intellectual Property
on copyright issues

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.320
on a day-in-day-out basis.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.720
But I'm also the daughter
and the granddaughter

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.110
of artists and authors.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.180
My father is a painter
and a writer.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.580
My grandfather was an author and
my grandmother an opera singer.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.660
Among my other relatives
and friends,

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.900
I can count many
additional poets and painters

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.760
and writers and rockers.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.180
These people have shaped
my view of the world.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.450
The relationship
that a creator has

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.000
with his work is
profound and personal.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.560
I know by firsthand observation

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.850
from my very earliest days
how closely integrated

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.480
with the artist's personality
and identity his creation is.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.650
It's not for nothing
that artists often refer

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.600
to their work as their babies.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.320
I grew up in the thick of art.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.330
My childhood was permeated by
turpentine fumes and the tunes

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.350
of the Metropolitan Opera
Saturday afternoon broadcast,

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.520
as my father painted in
his studio and I chewed

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.800
on the railing of my playpen.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.450
I have later fond memories of
participating in naming parties

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.150
for my father's paintings.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.940
He was much influenced by
the abstract expressionists,

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.820
so this was one opportunity to
let my creative juices flow,

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.110
with little to stand in
the way of my genius.

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.380
I was never one for
names like Untitled

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.950
or Abstract Number Five.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.190
Instead, I preferred
to name his paintings,

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.520
among other things, Green Pizza.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.480
And I don't know if my acumen
in naming work combined

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.330
with my father's good
sense of humor gave

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.860
that particular painting
a boost, but I can vouch

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.930
for the fact that it won
awards and sold immediately.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.590
But I also remember
vividly the bonfires

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.600
that my father would hold
to get rid of paintings

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.100
that he did not feel proud of.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.060
These extremes of
christenings and cremations

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.690
of works are part of my DNA.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:44.310
But I think they're also
understandable to any of you,

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:48.520
even those who don't make their
livelihood in a creative world

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.970
and those who have not
grown up with same sorts

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.010
of influences that I have.

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:54.460
These experiences bring

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:58.600
into laser focus the emotional
impact creative works have

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.840
on our lives.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:00.850
Whether we're the creators

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.890
or the beneficiaries
of those works.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.010
You would think that all

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:07.600
of these influences
throughout my life would lead

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.790
to my having formed
very concrete views

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:13.190
on moral rights issues,
but that's not the case.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:17.300
And perhaps that's because the
idea of moral rights has been

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.450
so foreign to us in
the United States.

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.210
In preparing for
this presentation,

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.510
I dug into the academic
literature on this topic.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.850
And I want to quote to you
the introduction of an article

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:31.510
by Susan Liemer, which
aptly illustrates the state

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:34.660
of our current understanding
of moral rights in the US.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:39.830
She writes, "In 1997, a sculptor
named Jan Martin won a lawsuit

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.200
against the city
of Indianapolis,

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.720
using a little known federal
statute called the Visual

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.350
Artists Rights Act.

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.470
The court found the city
violated certain rights

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.590
that the statute
granted to Mr Martin

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:51.770
when bulldozers destroyed
his sculpture

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:54.240
in the name of urban
development.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.980
During the damages phase of
the lawsuit, the court refused

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.860
to award to Mr Martin the
enhanced damages available

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.660
under the statute
because, after all,

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.260
the city had been
unaware of the statute.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.020
The Seventh Circuit had
no problem affirming the

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:08.410
District Court.

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.710
How is it possible
that ignorance

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:13.980
of the law was a valid excuse?"

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.950
So, so much for the principle
that we learned in civics class,

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:20.500
long before some of us went to
law school to learn it again.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.540
That ignorance of
the law is no excuse.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.860
This is one of the reasons why
I'm honored to be partnering

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.790
with the US Copyright Office
in organizing this symposium.

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:32.040
In order to take what might
be the first strides towards a

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.800
deeper understanding
of how we value

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.890
and how we implement
moral rights protections

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:38.890
for artists in the US.

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:42.570
I'm eager to hear the varied
perspectives of the speakers

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:44.710
and to learn from the
diverse sets of experiences

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:47.160
across industries
and internationally.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.540
Whether there are issues

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.180
that would benefit
from further inquiry.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.370
My initial perspective
is that discussions

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:55.310
about moral rights
encompass many

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:56.640
of the most compelling issues

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.990
that arise concerning
creativity in the digital world.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:01.510
Indeed, some scholars
have commented

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:02.990
that moral rights
are really an avatar

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:06.280
for discussing basic
copyright tenants.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.560
But I'm particularly
intrigued by these discussions

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.080
because by examining
copyright from a moral rights,

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.940
rather than a purely
economic perspective,

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.320
I believe we move towards
a fuller understanding

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.700
of the creator's
relationship with his work.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.730
Before we begin today's
proceedings I'd also

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:25.070
like to take the opportunity
to thank numerous people

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:27.320
at George Mason Law
School who've contributed

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.450
to making this event possible.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.070
My colleagues at the
Center for Protection

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.450
of Intellectual Property who
provided economic, intellectual

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:36.760
and moral support
for this endeavor.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:40.140
In particular, thanks to Devlin
Hartline, Kristina Pietro

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:43.010
and Matt Barblan, my
students in the Arts

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:44.470
and Entertainment
Advocacy Clinic,

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:46.130
who helped prepare
the moderators

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:47.330
for these discussions.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.270
And the members of the Journal
of International Commercial Law

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.220
who will publish
these proceedings.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.220
Particular thanks there
go to Gabrielle Peters,

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.760
the current outreach and
symposium editor of the journal,

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.390
and Tyler Del Rosario,

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.820
the incoming outreach
and symposium editor.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.350
To Taylor Hoverman, the
current editor and chief,

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.840
and Tanya Secor, the
incoming editor and chief.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.710
And to Stephen Veit,
the incoming managing

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:10.190
and publications editor.

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:13.810
I encourage all of you to take
a moment today during the breaks

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:16.720
to stop by, familiarize
yourselves with the journal

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.470
and with the students, and to
consider submitting an article

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:21.460
for publication in the future.

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:22.920
Thank you for being here.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.510
And thank you for contributing
your thoughts and experiences.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:30.970
[ Applause ]

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.140
&gt;&gt; And so with that I'd like
to invite Karyn Temple Claggett

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.720
up to moderate the first panel.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.460
And if the first panel
could please come up.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:41.550
&gt;&gt; Our first panel today
is entitled Overview

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:42.760
of Moral Rights.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.910
And I think some
might question us

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.280
in the United States
Copyright Office

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:50.140
and CPIP focusing a
whole day on moral rights

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:53.110
and even questioning whether
we actually have enough to talk

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:55.090
about for a whole
day with respect

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:57.010
to moral rights in
the United States.

00:10:57.010 --> 00:11:00.120
Because of that we wanted
to start with an overview

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.010
of moral rights so that
everyone can have a kind

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:05.870
of a basic understanding
of what moral rights are.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:08.240
How different countries
have implemented throughout

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:08.830
the world.

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:12.560
And exactly how the United
States has implemented them,

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.030
as well.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:16.850
I'm not going to go through
everyone's bio in much detail.

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.470
You guys have that in
your conference materials,

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:23.190
but I'll just briefly mention
everyone in terms of their title

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:24.580
and where they come from.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:27.630
First, I have June Besek who
is the executive director

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:30.430
of the Kernochan Center
for Law, Media and the Arts

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:32.800
and a lecturer at Columbia
Law School in New York,

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.740
where her research
and teaching focuses

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.270
on copyright and related rights.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:39.430
Next, I have Daniel Gervais.

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:42.880
He is a professor of law at
Vanderbilt University Law School

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.350
and director of the Vanderbilt
Intellectual Property Program.

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:48.810
He is also editor in
chief of the Journal

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:51.220
of the World Intellectual
Property and editor

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:55.180
of www.tripsagreement.net.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.450
Next, I have Mark Schultz.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:00.210
He is the director of
academic programs and cofounder

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:02.880
of the Center for the Protection
of Intellectual Property

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.120
at George Mason University
School of Law.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.920
He also serves as an
associate professor of law

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.980
at Southern Illinois University.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.790
And finally, last but
not least, I have an alum

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.850
of the copyright office, Eric
Schwartz, who is a partner

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:17.900
at Mitchell Silberberg &amp; Knupp.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.230
He has over 25 years
of experience

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:23.130
as a copyright attorney,
providing counseling on US

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:24.610
and foreign copyright laws.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:27.800
Including rights, ownership
and enforcement issues.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.760
So we clearly have a very
excellent panel today.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.470
To kind of give you
a basic background

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:35.420
of moral rights before
we go into more detail

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:38.400
about how they are actually
considered in the United States.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.870
And what we might need to do to
amend or strengthen them here.

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:44.100
I'm going to start
off first with June.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.500
And I know, June,
you have some slides,

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.350
so I'll put those up real quick.

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.240
Hopefully.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.240
All right.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.800
So the first question we have

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.090
for you is just a
general basic one.

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:55.090
What are moral rights?

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:57.140
And can you briefly
describe them?

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:57.890
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:00.670
I just have to say that
I love the question

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:02.630
about whether we have enough
to talk about all day.

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:03.490
I mean we're lawyers [laughter].

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:05.200
You know we can talk about --

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.880
in this case we even
something to say all day.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:11.170
But any case, moral rights
are rights that an author has

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:15.370
in her work that are separate
and apart from economic rights.

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:18.100
They're accorded to the author
because her work is seen

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.900
as a manifestation
of her personality

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.980
and expression of
her inner self.

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:26.990
Her baby, as I think the
term was that Sandra used.

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:30.530
The term comes from the
French term droit moral,

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:33.680
but that term doesn't
really translate very well.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.920
Because the word moral has
a different connotation

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:36.880
in English.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.990
And some have suggested calling
them instead personality rights

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:42.230
or spiritual rights.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:46.060
Moral rights belong to the
author, the creator of the work,

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.440
and not to a licensee
or to an employer.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.660
They can't be transferred
to somebody else,

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:53.850
although in some cases,
they can be waived.

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:56.340
The most commonly
recognized moral rights

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.550
in the world are the
right of attribution,

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:00.830
also known as the
right of paternity.

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:03.300
But you can see why I
prefer not to use that term.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.510
But this is the author's right
to have her name associated

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:07.730
with the work she creates.

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:10.890
In other words, the right
to claim authorship.

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.160
The second right is
the right of integrity.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.690
The author's right to
prevent unauthorized changes

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:19.540
that would result in
distortions, mutilations,

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.150
or other modifications
of the work.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:25.810
And then the third is
the right of disclosure,

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:28.530
right of divulgation,
also termed.

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:31.090
And this is an author's
right to determine whether

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:34.160
and under what circumstances
the work will be introduced

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:34.950
to the public.

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.190
For those of you
familiar with Harper &amp; Row

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:41.810
against the Nation that,
that language is reminiscent

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:43.970
of how the Supreme Court
describes the right

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:46.670
of first publication
in the United States.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:48.980
And then finally there's
the right of withdrawal.

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.480
Some countries like France
provide authors with the right

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.370
to withdraw their
works from the public,

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:59.330
if they feel the works no
longer represent their deepest

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.060
convictions, their
deepest beliefs.

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.630
In essence, this
right allows an author

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:13.470
to retract economic rights that
she's licensed to third parties.

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:18.150
However, it's rarely recognized
for a couple of reasons.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:21.630
One is that it really
has to be based

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:23.700
on a deep-seated conviction,

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.790
which is probably actually
related to the other reason.

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:28.690
Which is the author
has to bear the costs,

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:31.190
and it can be very
expensive to do this.

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:34.410
So it's a rarely
exercised right.

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:36.910
Now I just want to mention

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:40.170
that the top two rights are the
ones most commonly recognized

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:40.760
around the world.

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.540
And the other two
certainly exist

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.070
but they're not as prevalent.

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:46.510
At least not in those
precise terms.

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:52.340
[ Inaudible Response ]

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:55.130
&gt;&gt; So the next question I
guess is you talked generally

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:57.040
about moral rights
and what they are.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.200
Can you give a little
bit of background,

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.210
in terms of how did the
concept develop historically?

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:05.800
What is the foundation or
basis for moral rights?

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.440
Why do people think that those
were important to have separate

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.180
and apart from economic rights?

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:16.070
&gt;&gt; I think a lot of us think
of moral rights as kind

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:17.910
of like an established
body of law.

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:20.750
But like many things, they
really developed piecemeal,

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:25.050
primarily in Europe
until they were codified

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:27.370
in the early 20th century.

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:29.470
There were two principal
theories

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:31.180
on which moral rights
were based.

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:32.720
The first is called
the monist theory.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.550
And it braces the view that
authors' works are an embodiment

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:38.700
of their inner selves
inextricably interwoven

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:41.470
with other rights.

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:45.760
And not all of the rights of an
author are commercial objects.

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.290
Under this theory, economic
rights are really a subset

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:50.800
of moral rights, but as I said,
they're deeply intertwined.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.120
And then there's something
called the dualist theory,

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.070
and both of these are

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:56.510
from different philosophical
lines of thought.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:59.130
But under the dualist
theory, an author's personal

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:01.500
and economic interests
are separate and distinct,

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:04.580
and can be protected by
different bodies of law.

00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:09.420
So you can modify a creative
work and you can sell it

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:12.030
or transfer it, but the
personality rights remain

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:13.830
with the author.

00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:17.910
Now because countries took
different legal approaches

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:20.710
to moral rights, some embodied
them in the copyright law

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:24.390
but others embodied them in
separate parts of their laws.

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:27.890
But by the early '20s, there
was sufficient similarity

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:30.940
between laws that
countries began to urge

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.410
that these become part
of the Berne Convention.

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:34.220
Which, as you probably know,

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:38.280
is the principal international
copyright treaty and provides

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.000
for minimum rights and
national treatment.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.720
And essentially what people
wanted was for moral rights

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.230
to become one of these minimum
rights that had to be included.

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:50.150
And I'm not going to
talk a lot about Berne.

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:51.700
But I just want to mention that,

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:55.000
in order to have moral
rights be part of Berne,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.540
the countries had
to make compromises.

00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:58.960
So the ones with
the strongest body

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.130
of moral rights essentially
agreed

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:05.660
that it would be sufficient,
if these rights were not

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:09.120
in a specific body of law,
whether copyright or another.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.190
They didn't have to be
codified, but they could be

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.470
in other places in
countries' laws.

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:16.810
And this was done so that
countries like the UK,

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:21.660
Australia, could join without
it having to amend their laws,

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:24.230
if they believed that they
had sufficient rights.

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:28.840
And this will come up later when
we talk about how the US joined.

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:32.590
So the moral rights are now
embodied in Article 6bis

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.180
of the Berne Convention.

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:35.730
And I'll leave it up there,

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:38.790
but I know that we'll
talk about that more.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:40.510
There are other provisions.

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:42.630
This is just 6bis one.

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:44.390
Just a couple more
things I want to mention.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:45.810
How long moral rights last?

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:48.140
Well they last at least as
long as the economic rights,

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:51.150
but some countries
have moral rights

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:53.390
that are essentially perpetual.

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:56.250
And I guess that leads
me to the next point,

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:57.760
which I know Daniel's
going to discuss,

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.270
which is Berne members
vary as to the scope

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:02.090
and duration of moral rights.

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:05.390
And some of the finer points
we'll talk about later.

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:07.640
I think the last thing
I want to mention,

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:08.930
if you could just
advance that slide.

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:10.220
I want to talk about
one more right,

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:11.640
which isn't really
a moral right,

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.200
but it's reminiscent
of a moral right.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.570
It's an economic right,
but it's considered an

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:17.680
author-friendly right.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:20.300
And it's something
that can't be waived.

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.330
It provides that an author
has the right to share

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:25.730
in the proceeds from
the sale of her work,

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:27.620
even after the first sale.

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:29.000
And this is -- oh, one more.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.560
Sorry. This is embodied
in Article 14ter

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.970
of the Berne Convention.

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:35.570
And we call it, in this
country, resale royalties.

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:38.570
And the Copyright Office
recently had a report

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:42.500
on resale royalties recommending
that they be embodied in US law.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:43.870
One last point.

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:45.850
Which is that this
is a little different

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:51.580
from other Berne rights
because it is not mandatory.

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:57.310
But it is a right that countries
can grant to other nationals,

00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:59.600
based on whether those
nationals' country allows

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.930
for this right.

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:03.400
So with that, I think
I'll end and turn it over

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.480
and move to the next question.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.790
&gt;&gt; Yes. And I think we'll
jump around a little bit.

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.530
I'll turn it next to Mark.

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:11.000
Just to ask the question
about kind

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.740
of contrasting the difference
between moral rights,

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.330
as we've discussed,
and economic rights,

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:19.060
which is what we're
more familiar here

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:20.770
with in the United States.

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:21.200
&gt;&gt; Certainly.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:26.310
Thanks. So moral rights are
a somewhat uncomfortable fit

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:28.640
within our system of
intellectual property rights.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:32.330
So I emphasize uncomfortable
but not impossible.

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:35.230
That's because moral
rights have evolved

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:38.520
from a largely different
moral and philosophical ground

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.120
than traditional
American copyright.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.570
According to legal
historian James Willard Hurst,

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:48.070
in matters of property, the US
has preferred dynamic rather

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:52.270
than static property, property
in motion or at risk rather

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.930
than property secure
and at rest.

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:57.570
This preference reflected
the values of a country

00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:01.600
that seeks change and growth
over status and security.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.970
And so this preference for
property in motion over property

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:07.440
at rest was reflected
in numerous departures

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.050
from European property
institutions.

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:13.200
We abolished primogeniture
and entail.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.930
We disestablished churches.

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:17.280
We forbade titles of nobility.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:20.680
And we certainly never viewed
people's status as tied

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:25.020
to the land like Europeans
once did in medieval times.

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:28.160
Americans were concerned with
protecting private property,

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.970
chiefly for what
it could do rather

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:35.490
than an identity it conferred or
how it was tied to an identity.

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:38.390
And so Americans were
largely concerned

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:43.970
with protecting people's
method of making a living

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:47.870
and their investments rather
than their status or holdings.

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:51.620
Now this focus on property, for
what it can do, has led many

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.870
to contend that the founders
had a utilitarian view

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:56.240
of intellectual property,

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.750
and this contention's
actually an anachronism.

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:03.140
While the founders were likely
mostly aware of Jeremy Bentham

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:06.450
and utilitarianism, as it
was emerging at the time,

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:08.180
they weren't utilitarians.

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:11.540
The founders' views on property,
including intellectual property,

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.800
were instead fostered in a
natural rights philosophy.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.110
The utilitarian justification

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:20.430
for IP is a 20th century
development, albeit,

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:23.200
a very early 20th
century development.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.890
And so the natural rights view
sees life, liberty and property

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:29.420
as inextricably intertwined.

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:32.890
And a natural rights
foundation justifies copyright

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:37.520
because it enables creators to
flourish, to survive and thrive,

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.960
conditioned on the need of
others to survive and thrive.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.000
And so this focus has led
to a focus on copyright,

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.570
as a property right, that
facilitates the ability

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:49.080
to make a living
and to fully exploit

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.630
and commercialize creations.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:54.200
Thus, copyright embodies
Hurst's description

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.630
of Americans' preference
for property

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:58.540
in motion rather than at rest.

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:01.040
And reproduction right,
the derivative works right,

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.060
the distribution right,

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:05.240
and public performance
rights enable creators

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.750
to secure an economic return.

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:10.810
And one way in which they
secure a return is being able

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:13.500
to freely alienate
their works to others

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.860
who similarly employ them
to survive and thrive.

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:22.710
So, in our system, we prefer
property rights unencumbered.

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:27.250
Unencumbered from the ability
to easily alienate them

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:30.450
because we are focused on
this ability to make a living.

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:33.160
And anything that encumbers
property rights reduces their

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:37.240
value and reduces the
ability to fully exploit them.

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:40.110
And the utilitarian
view similarly focuses

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:41.550
on property in motion.

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:45.890
Social utility is maximized when
the production, dissemination

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:49.560
and use of works is efficiently
facilitated by copyright.

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.890
Once again, property in motion.

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:55.630
Now under either the natural
rights or utilitarian view thus,

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:58.160
moral rights are a
somewhat uncomfortable fit.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.920
They appear to represent
property at rest rather

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.330
than property in motion.

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:04.480
Property based on status rather

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.740
than fostering either
flourishing or efficiency.

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:11.210
Still these moral foundations,
either natural rights

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:14.420
or utilitarianism can justify.

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:19.320
They don't necessarily dictate
that moral rights can't be part

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:23.190
of our system of copyright.

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:28.570
You can make a flourishing-based
argument for moral rights,

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:31.720
particularly I think with
respect to attribution.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.310
It certainly enables
creators to make a living.

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:37.980
And it certainly likely helps
them develop a reputation

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.190
that allows them to
flourish and encourages them

00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:42.180
to fully exploit their works.

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:44.650
And if you're maximizing
social utility,

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:47.930
well that's usually easy, kind
of to tell a just-so story

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:51.050
about how social
utility is maximized

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:53.220
because creators will
be more likely to create

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.790
with these rights in mind.

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:59.320
And moreover, one has to
concede that we've come far

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.800
from our foundations
and natural rights

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:05.060
or even early 20th
century utilitarianism.

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:07.080
By adopting the Berne
Convention,

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.620
we've essentially embraced
a legal transplant,

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:13.610
and that legal transplant
has European roots.

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:16.670
And thus, when we look at
things like a copyright term

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:19.710
and other aspects of our
current copyright law,

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:24.130
we certainly have departed
from this natural rights base,

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:26.970
copyright or utilitarian
copyright,

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:31.370
to embrace a copyright
that does include these --

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:36.580
that is founded essentially on
these features of European law.

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:42.440
So thus, I'd say that
although moral rights are an

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.780
uncomfortable fit within
a copyright founded

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:48.940
on natural rights
and/or utilitarianism,

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.390
they can be made to fit.

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:53.030
And indeed, in our
modern statute,

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:56.460
we have several justifications
for copyright.

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:57.410
Thank you.

00:25:57.410 --> 00:25:58.350
&gt;&gt; Thank you Professor Schultz.

00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:59.570
And you alluded to the fact

00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:03.190
that we have adopted
some European roots,

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:05.050
in terms of our IP system.

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:08.960
We've kind of become part of
the international discussion,

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:13.060
in terms of having standards
across the board globally.

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:16.220
And so my next question is
actually to Professor Gervais.

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:18.120
What international
standards do we have

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:19.850
that are governing
moral rights now?

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:22.650
I think June alluded to one.

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:25.600
&gt;&gt; Yes. Well, the Berne
Convention clearly is the

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:26.580
most important.

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:28.630
Article 6bis that was

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:31.320
on the screen earlier
has three paragraphs.

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:35.160
The first one is the one
that has the two moral rights

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:38.000
that June identified
as the most common,

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.550
and perhaps the most important,
attribution and integrity.

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:46.420
Beyond that there are -- in
the Berne Convention itself,

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:47.790
there are other moral rights.

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:50.690
The droit de suite that June
mentioned is arguably a type

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:53.130
of moral right, but there's
certainly another one

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:54.650
in 10bis paragraph three.

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:57.800
Sorry for the numbers here.

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:01.230
But it's essentially of
the same nature as 6bis.

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:06.120
So Berne is really about
attribution and integrity.

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:08.560
What has changed in the last --

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:13.620
so the Berne Convention was last
revised on substance in 1967.

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:16.170
And then four years later
they added an appendix

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:17.380
for developing countries.

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:23.630
But in 1971, the internet
wasn't all that developed then,

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:25.170
and there were other issues

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:27.990
that have changed a
little bit since then.

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:32.010
And one of the things that
has changed beyond technology

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:35.250
and that I really
want to underline is

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:42.620
that the performers'
protection level has changed.

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:46.100
So the Berne rights
are about authors only,

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:50.900
but this morning Sandra was
talking about opera and singers.

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:55.000
Performers have acquired
internationally the same level

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.640
of recognition as authors
in international treaties.

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:04.640
So Article Five of two
more recent treaties --

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.340
these names are a
little mouthful

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:09.050
but the WIPO Performances
and Phonograms Treaty

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:14.850
from 1996 has a moral right for
essentially music performers,

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:18.460
which is recognized
in many countries.

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:21.910
And the US actually is
part of that treaty.

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:25.780
And then -- I just
thought I'd mention that.

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:27.970
And then there's
the Beijing Treaty

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:31.840
on Audiovisual Performances,
much more recent, 2012.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:35.800
Which also in Article
Five has a moral right

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:38.790
for audiovisual performers
we understand

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:41.620
that the president has sent
the treaty to the Senate.

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:45.300
So that's also relevant,
I think.

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:46.820
So basically international.

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:47.890
If you look at standards --

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:51.560
those are the ones I would
identify as most important ones.

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.020
You noticed that I didn't
mention the TRIPS Agreement?

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:57.600
Because it does mention moral
rights but essentially to say

00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.200
that they're not
enforceable at the WTO.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:03.300
I think a little later
we'll hear why, from,

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:05.520
I think, Eric or someone else.

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.200
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And so you mentioned

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:10.770
that essentially right now we
have three different treaties

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:13.080
that expressly obligate
member countries

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.610
to recognize moral rights.

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:15.560
The Berne Convention.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:19.030
The WPPT. And the
Beijing Treaty.

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:22.410
How have different countries
actually implemented those

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:24.760
rights in their national laws?

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:28.840
&gt;&gt; Well, so that's a great
question because when you talk

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.840
about moral rights -- and both
June and Mark alluded to this --

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.210
it's a little bit like
the Zika virus, right?

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:35.590
It comes --

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:39.790
&gt;&gt; I guess you're going to
explain that [laughter]?

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:42.300
&gt;&gt; Well, yes.

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.490
No. But you'll see what I mean.

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:47.070
It, you know, it comes
from foreign countries.

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:49.660
Ideally it should be
entirely eradicated,

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:51.260
but at the very least,
it should be kept

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.590
out of the United States.

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:54.410
All right?

00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:55.200
So --

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:55.860
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:56.970
&gt;&gt; When you look around
the world, though,

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:59.440
you realize there are many ways
of implementing moral rights.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:02.120
It's not like there's
one package and you have

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:06.320
to buy the one package and
say this is the only way.

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:09.500
So first of all, the
right of withdrawal

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:14.630
that June rightly
mentioned is very uncommon

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:15.790
in foreign countries.

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:19.470
And in countries where it
exists, it's very rarely used.

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:22.190
Because as June mentioned it --
for example, you're an author.

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:25.750
Your book is in the bookstores
and you want to take it out.

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:27.530
Well you can in France,
but you'll have

00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:29.740
to compensate the
publisher for all the losses.

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:32.800
So you really have to
want to get your book

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.350
out of the bookstores.

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:37.920
So that right is really like
a good croissant, right?

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.510
You hear a lot about it
but you never find it.

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:42.870
[ Laughter ]

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:44.420
So that leaves the other three.

00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:47.560
And so the right of
attribution is implemented

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:48.620
in several different ways.

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:52.780
Many common law countries
have implemented it.

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:59.150
And for example, if you're
obligated like law professors,

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:02.610
for example, by rules
concerning plagiarism,

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:04.810
that in a way is a
right of attribution.

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:09.720
Some countries have
used passing off.

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:13.220
And many countries that don't
have fair use but fair dealing,

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:15.100
have fair dealing subject

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:18.310
to mentioning the source
unless it's not reasonable

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:19.230
in the circumstances.

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:21.770
For example, Canada.

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:25.030
So that right is implemented
in many different ways.

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:27.590
The right of integrity --
here's the interesting thing.

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:30.290
If you read the debates on 106A,

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:33.060
which is the Visual
Artist Rights Act

00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:34.490
that Sandra mentioned.

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:37.840
There was some concern in
Congress about destruction

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.670
of originals of art,
works of art.

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:43.580
And that's the one right that's
not in the Berne Convention.

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:46.650
So we're very good at protecting
that one right that's not

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:48.130
in Berne -- well, not
very good, anyway.

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:52.140
But and in fact that right
was specifically discussed

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:53.740
at the Berne Convention
revision.

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:56.080
And countries said yeah, it
would be nice to have a right

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.730
against the destruction of
originals, but there isn't one.

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:01.710
So the right of integrity,
though, is implemented

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:02.800
in several different ways.

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:05.660
So some countries just state it,
and some countries define it.

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:06.850
They'll define how.

00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:11.810
For example, the right would
be in French, Canada would be

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:14.600
and again an example
that's not too far away.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:18.260
And finally the right
of disclosure.

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:21.900
This right of divulgation
isn't that different, frankly,

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:23.970
from the right of first
publication, which has existed

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:26.390
in common law copyright
since, what?

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:28.390
Early 18th century, at least.

00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:31.900
A couple of more
things, if I may.

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:34.320
So the things that
differ from one country

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.740
to another is waivability.

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:38.950
Some countries have
complete waivability.

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:40.380
Countries like Germany
and Austria

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:43.540
that have the monist system,
where the right is one package,

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:45.450
the economic and moral
rights are together.

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:47.450
Obviously you can't transfer

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:50.340
or waive the whole
package, typically.

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:55.190
But in countries that separate,
like the Berne Convention does,

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:57.380
the economic rights
and moral rights.

00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:01.410
Then you have a little more
leeway as to how you do that.

00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:03.180
There's a lot of
differences also,

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:06.010
so it may be the last point
to mention on enforceability

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:09.170
after the death of the author.

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:13.580
So some countries -- so
the Berne Convention says,

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:15.580
if you join Berne and you
don't have a moral right.

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:19.300
You can stop at the death of
the author, which was introduced

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:20.140
for common law countries.

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:23.480
But even if you don't and
you make them last as long

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:24.460
as the economic rights.

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:27.310
There are conditions
in some countries.

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:30.130
And it really depends, if
you look at it as a privacy

00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:33.330
or interest or personality
right, I guess,

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:34.550
or a property interest.

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:39.180
And I think Mark was
completely on the point there --

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:40.880
and I said this was
my last point,

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.180
but the last thing is this.

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:45.730
Perpetual moral rights
scares people.

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:47.570
Well, if you look
at the actual cases.

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:48.810
First of all, there
are very few countries

00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:49.980
that have perpetual
moral rights,

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:52.570
but let's say France
always come up.

00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:56.130
Most of the cases fall
in the sort of title --

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:59.390
the heirs of Bach
or Victor Hugo.

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:01.380
They just can't prove
that they have the right,

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:03.610
so the court will very
often dismiss the case.

00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:04.830
Not because there's
no infringement.

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:05.510
They don't get there.

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:07.290
They just say well, we're
not sure you're the person

00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:08.210
to exercise the right.

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:14.550
So that's another scarecrow that
I think can remain in the field.

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:16.920
&gt;&gt; And I was actually going
to follow up on that because

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.310
that was -- it's not really
a question we were going

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:20.720
to discuss when we were
talking about this panel,

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:25.370
but you alluded to
litigation about moral rights.

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:28.150
And I guess one of the questions
I would have is those countries

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:29.850
that do have stronger
moral rights,

00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:32.520
such as France or
other countries.

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:35.280
Is there a lot of
litigation over issues

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.640
of attribution or integrity?

00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:39.860
And what type of
litigation do you see?

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.560
What are people arguing
when they're trying

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:44.340
to actually raise their
moral rights in court?

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:46.680
&gt;&gt; Well, there is
some litigation.

00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:48.080
It's a small percentage.

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.220
I don't have the number
but a small percentage,

00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:52.220
obviously of all
copyright litigation.

00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:55.500
If you open a -- let's say
a French copyright textbook,

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:59.330
you won't find that many pages
on infringement of moral rights.

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:03.270
Very often it's a licensee
making unauthorized changes.

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:07.980
Or a licensee producing
a version of the work

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.530
without the author's name.

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:12.050
Or the author's name is so
small that you can't find it.

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:16.310
Those are the kind of cases
that you see, and they're easy

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:20.470
for a court because those are
pretty clear-cut violations.

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:24.530
The one case that, of course,
many American law students learn

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:29.060
about is the John Huston case,
where John Huston's heirs --

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:30.290
his wife, in fact --

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:36.060
was in court in France and said
you cannot show the colorized

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:37.900
version of my husband's movie

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:41.240
because he specifically
wanted it in black and white.

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:42.670
And the court agreed.

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:45.580
And so the colorized
version, as I understand it,

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:48.160
was not actually
shown in France.

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:53.030
But as you can see, those
are not that common.

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:55.820
Most publishers have no
interest in publishing a book

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.880
without the author's name on it.

00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:59.380
Oh, this is a secret.

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:00.540
You know, Stephen King novel

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:01.950
but no one should know
it's Stephen King.

00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:03.160
There's really no interest.

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.440
It's exactly the opposite.

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.650
You want to know
who wrote the book.

00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:07.430
If you're the consumer, you
want to know who wrote the book.

00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:08.350
The publisher wants you to know.

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:11.470
So there's not that
misalignment usually

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:13.990
between the licensee
and an author.

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:15.070
&gt;&gt; And just one follow-up.

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:17.980
And anyone from the
panel can join as well.

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.990
But you kind of gave the analogy

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:22.100
of moral rights being
the Zika virus earlier

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:25.360
and that the United States
should stay away from it.

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:28.730
I guess following up on your
point that there isn't a lot

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:31.180
of litigation over moral rights
in some of those countries

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:33.790
that have stronger or
more specific laws.

00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:35.940
Does that suggest if
the United States were

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:39.920
to adopt something along
the lines of what France has

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:40.880
or what other countries have,

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:43.990
in terms of more specific
moral rights provisions.

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:47.830
Would you expect to similarly
not have a significant amount

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:50.000
of additional litigation
on those issues?

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.770
&gt;&gt; Well, you know the litigation
virus is not the Zika virus

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:56.400
and maybe there's --

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.580
&gt;&gt; There's another one.

00:36:58.580 --> 00:36:59.310
&gt;&gt; That one here.

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:04.690
But so I think there might
be some test cases that need

00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:09.550
to be brought to have a
little bit more clarity.

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:13.760
But frankly, many other
countries have had moral rights

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:14.960
for many, many years.

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.720
And again, you don't
see it all that often

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.870
because that misalignment
between the author

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:23.270
and the person exploiting
the work is rarely obvious

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:26.070
or present, in fact.

00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:29.500
So, no I do not expect that --
actually attribution, as I said,

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:33.940
if you're in this context that
requires say, not to plagiarize,

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:36.160
your, you know, attribution
would come naturally.

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:42.390
Most people would find
attribution is fairly compatible

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:43.870
with their practice.

00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:48.150
And integrity -- you know the
Berne Convention says honor

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:50.430
a reputation.

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:52.640
The real question's
how do you define that?

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:57.590
As I recall the Berne debates,
someone suggested changing

00:37:57.590 --> 00:38:01.590
that for spiritual
interests or something.

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:03.990
What it shows you that countries
were not quite sure what they

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:05.670
were trying to get at.

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:08.470
But it's a fairly fuzzy concept,
so I think there's plenty

00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:12.410
of room for the US to define
the cases as say, Canada does.

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:15.090
You really have to have
a very objective case.

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:17.270
It's not oh, my feelings
are hurt.

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:18.260
It's not that.

00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:20.750
You need a lot more than
that to make the case.

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:23.690
So that would be a matter of
how the legislation, I suppose,

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:27.690
is changed to fully
implement integrity.

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:30.480
&gt;&gt; And then I think
maybe going back to June

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.130
and going down the line.

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:35.000
And then I have a
question for Eric.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.970
But we mentioned
that Article 6bis

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:39.220
of the Berne Convention
obligates member countries

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:42.040
to recognize essentially
attribution and integrity.

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:44.100
But you mentioned that
there were other rights

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.520
that are considered
moral rights.

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:49.210
Why weren't those other
rights also included

00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:50.660
in the Berne Convention?

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:53.670
Any ideas as to kind of why
they didn't think that they rose

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:55.920
to the level of the
type of protection

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.600
that it's now obligated
for the rights

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:01.730
of attribution and integrity?

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:03.010
June or --

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:05.740
&gt;&gt; Well, I'll just start by
saying I don't think the right

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:08.990
of withdrawal was ever
as recognized as widely,

00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:10.990
so that's probably why
that isn't in there.

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:13.040
And the same might be
true of divulgation,

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:18.850
although it also is duplicated
in part by economic rights.

00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:25.110
So I think that it wasn't
seen as necessary as,

00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:26.390
you know, the other two.

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:29.220
So in terms of -- you know what
happened was a certain number

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:32.380
of countries had similarities
enough in their law,

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:34.160
and those laws were
on the books.

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.560
And these were the two that
were really the, you know,

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.930
the ones that prompted
people to move forward.

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:40.290
And that's why they became part

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:43.390
of the Berne Convention
back then.

00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:44.520
&gt;&gt; Anyone else want to any --

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:45.240
&gt;&gt; No.

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:47.840
&gt;&gt; So we've talked a lot about,
I guess, the European basis

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.090
in Europe, and now I want

00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:52.190
to turn a little bit more
focus to the United States.

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:55.040
And ask Eric how has the
US considered moral rights?

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:59.220
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you.

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:04.060
And Sandra injected a
little bit of personal story

00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:06.690
into this morning's discussion.

00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:08.960
And I probably should do
the same because I arrived

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:12.440
at the Copyright Office
on April 1st 1988.

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:16.660
Just in time to work on Berne
Implementation Act for my boss,

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:19.590
for Ralph Oman who's here to
assign me my first assignment.

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:23.570
Which was to do the first and
only study on moral rights

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:27.750
in the United States and which
we delivered in March of 1989.

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:29.930
And then to work on the
Visual Artist Rights Act.

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:31.820
So part of my preparation
here --

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:35.030
I really don't think I'd given
a lot of thought to moral rights

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:36.850
for some period of time.

00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:40.890
But that flurry of activity, in
the late '80s and early '90s,

00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:44.540
was something that I
certainly had a front row seat,

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:46.290
along with others in the room,

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:48.870
looking at Marybeth
and others here.

00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:55.840
I schemed this as sort of
seven steps, I suppose.

00:40:55.840 --> 00:41:00.260
And I'll be brief because we,
you know, are limited in time.

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:03.280
The first was what
I'll call the prequel.

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:06.020
Considering US accession
to Berne,

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:10.300
which the '76 Act was sort of
a partial step in the direction

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:12.600
with copyright term
and so forth.

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:16.860
But in 1985, the US State
Department convened a group

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:18.750
of experts, the Ad
Hoc Working Group --

00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:23.120
and by the way, I've prepared
a little chronological order

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:24.580
of the history here.

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:26.390
Especially for students
and others

00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:28.250
who may be unfamiliar with it.

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:29.480
And Irwin Karp and a group

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:32.780
of experts studied four
basic subject areas

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:37.310
on US compatibility with
Berne, including moral rights.

00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:41.090
The final report was
issued in April of 1986

00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:42.940
and reprinted in
Senate hearings.

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:48.760
And I've given you
the citations.

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:54.290
And the best way to summarize
it is to read the conclusion

00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:56.320
of chapter six of moral rights

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.330
and the final Ad
Hoc Working Group.

00:41:58.330 --> 00:42:02.070
And remember, their task was to
"identify those basic provisions

00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:04.860
of US law relevant
to US adherence

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:08.370
to the Berne Convention and
to analyze their compatibility

00:42:08.370 --> 00:42:10.210
with Berne" closed quotes.

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:11.880
Here's what they concluded.

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:14.580
"Given the substantial
protection now available

00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:17.680
for the real equivalent of
moral rights under statutory

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:21.470
and common law in the United
States, the lack of uniformity

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:24.140
and protection of
other Berne nations,

00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:26.680
the absence of moral
rights provisions in some

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:30.440
of their copyright laws, and
the reservation of control

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:33.810
over remedies to each Berne
country, the protection

00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:37.130
of moral rights in the
United States is compatible

00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:38.510
with the Berne Convention."

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:43.270
So that was the prequel in 1986.

00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:47.730
Then came US accession for
real of the Berne Convention

00:42:47.730 --> 00:42:49.660
for the remaining
couple of years.

00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:53.270
US accedes on March 1st 1989.

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:56.530
A lot of House and Senate
hearings on the subject.

00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:58.850
Round table discussions.

00:42:58.850 --> 00:43:01.760
Irwin Karp and others
at Columbia Law School.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:05.000
And I've given you the citations
for that of experts talking

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.160
about moral rights, explicit
moral rights under the US.

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:13.790
Is it necessary for the US
to amend its law to accede

00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:15.630
to the Berne Convention?

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:21.010
The first -- there was by
the way a bill, HR2400,

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:23.120
which would have granted
explicit moral rights

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:26.020
to film directors
and screenwriters.

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:27.810
There was, in the
first iteration

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:31.150
of the Berne Implementation
Act, explicit moral rights taken

00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:34.440
for the most part from the
language of Article 6bis,

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:35.870
the right of attribution.

00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:38.200
And Barbara Ringer
always scolded me never,

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:40.290
ever call it the
right of paternity.

00:43:40.290 --> 00:43:43.060
And the right of integrity.

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:45.790
And that was ultimately stripped

00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:48.770
out of the Berne
Implementation Act.

00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:52.420
And this was the
legislation that was necessary

00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:54.120
for the US to accede to Berne.

00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:57.090
And what the US did then
and often still does

00:43:57.090 --> 00:43:59.940
with most treaties is
first we amend our law.

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:01.290
Then we accede to the treaty.

00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:04.860
So this was the implementation
act, which was going just ahead

00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:07.370
of our accession to the treaty.

00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:11.080
The House and Senate ultimately
concluded after hearings

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:15.020
and consultations with US
agencies, trips to Geneva

00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:18.620
with WIPO, of foreign
governments and experts,

00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:22.970
that explicit new moral rights
legislation was not necessary

00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:24.760
for Berne implementation.

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:27.280
And I've given you the
language from the House report

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:33.940
on Berne implementation and
the Senate reports from 1988.

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:37.570
And reading the House
report, based on a comparison

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:40.320
of its laws with those
of Berne member countries

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:43.290
and on current status of
federal and state protections

00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:45.760
of the rights of
paternity and integrity --

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:48.610
they clearly had not
spoken to Barbara --

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:51.520
the committee finds that current
United States law meets the

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:53.940
requirements of Article 6bis.

00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:55.190
And the Senate report.

00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:58.020
More or less the
same thing but laying

00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:00.560
out the common law principles.

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:03.440
Such as liable defamation,
misrepresentation

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:05.900
and unfair competition.

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:07.970
Which have been applied
by courts

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:11.900
to address authors' invocation
of the right to claim authorship

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:16.060
with the right to object to
distortion, concluding the same.

00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:18.210
That no new rights
were necessary --

00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:22.080
and this was important --
citing Dr Arpad Bogsch,

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:25.180
who was then the Director
General of the WIPO.

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:27.100
That the United States
may become a member

00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:30.630
of the Berne Convention without
making any changes to US law

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:33.820
for the purposes
of Article 6bis.

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:38.350
And truth be told, Dr Bogsch
wanted the US so badly

00:45:38.350 --> 00:45:39.860
to join the Berne Convention,

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:44.650
he would have pretty much said
anything for the US to join.

00:45:44.650 --> 00:45:47.750
Remember the US was
the 89th member --

00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:50.050
I believe that's
right -- of Berne.

00:45:50.050 --> 00:45:53.080
And there are now
what, 160 countries.

00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:58.490
So it was really important to
the WIPO and for the importance

00:45:58.490 --> 00:46:01.170
and still preeminence
of Berne for the US

00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:03.060
to join the Convention.

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:10.360
The House reports and the
legislation also made clear

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:12.870
that Berne was not
self-executing.

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:15.970
So that there couldn't
be lawsuits claiming

00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:21.150
that notwithstanding Title 17
or other federal and state laws

00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:23.120
that the US was not in
compliance with Berne.

00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:28.440
Or that there would be redress
in federal or state courts based

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:31.260
on the actual language
of Article 6bis.

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:37.150
So sort of sealing that off,
the House and Senate language.

00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:39.960
The ultimate Berne
Implementation Act made very

00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:44.140
clear that Berne was
not self-executing.

00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:49.100
But the mid-1980s -- you know
a lot of changes going on.

00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:52.640
And the nature in technology
for dissemination of works,

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:56.080
especially motion pictures
and television programs.

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:59.400
A lot of alterations being
made for post-theatrical.

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.550
Especially for students
in the room.

00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:03.300
Think about a time when --

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:07.010
really films until that time
are only shown in theaters.

00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:09.670
And now you have the
explosion of videos,

00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:11.800
cassettes and home-viewing.

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:16.410
And suddenly post-theatrical
alteration is a huge issue.

00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:19.870
And since where the motion
picture industry is mostly

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:22.290
living in a work
for hire regime,

00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:26.180
the creative artists are saying
but we've given up our rights

00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:28.780
for these post-theatrical
alterations.

00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:30.730
And attribution.

00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:32.250
Yes, there are guild agreements.

00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:34.040
Yes, there are personal
contracts.

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:37.200
But there's also
alterations going on.

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:39.060
There was the colorization
of black

00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:42.190
and white movies,
which begins in 1986.

00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:44.490
There was time compression,
which is the fitted

00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:46.060
into broadcast time slots.

00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:50.710
You may not notice but sometimes
films are actually sped up

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:53.700
and compressed to fit
into the broadcast time.

00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:56.530
There was panning and scanning
to make the aspect ratio

00:47:56.530 --> 00:47:58.690
of what's a theatrical
screen fit

00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:01.240
onto a television
screen and so forth.

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:04.650
A lot of high-profile hearings.

00:48:04.650 --> 00:48:05.690
Steven Spielberg.

00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:07.540
George Lucas.

00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:08.420
Sydney Pollack.

00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:08.980
Woody Allen.

00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:11.800
Dozens of directors and
writers were all at hearings.

00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:16.460
If you ever -- I know that Ralph
testified at many hearings.

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:19.570
And usually we would watch the
entire room empty out as all

00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:22.250
of creative artists left
the room and the House

00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:24.930
and Senate members, while
the copyright office went

00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:27.490
into to testify moral
rights right behind them.

00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:30.880
It was a huge high-profile
issue at the time.

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.530
And the question was
what to do about it?

00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:35.880
So Congress asked for a study.

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:41.320
One year to study technological
alterations to motion pictures.

00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:45.260
It was Mr Castameyer and
Mr Moorhead, the House

00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:49.590
and Senate Chair and
Ranking Minority Member.

00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:53.770
Which Ralph and Bill
Patry and I co-authored

00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:57.330
and delivered March of 1989.

00:48:57.330 --> 00:48:58.860
The timing's interesting.

00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:03.800
The US has acceded to the Berne
Convention on March 1st 1989.

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:07.810
We'd already acceded by the
time we turned in the study.

00:49:07.810 --> 00:49:09.710
Take a look, if you're
interested.

00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:12.820
Chapter five of the
study is the summation

00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:15.040
of moral rights legislation.

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:19.350
And then just you know a couple
of other points in the history.

00:49:19.350 --> 00:49:22.030
So the spinoff on the
moral rights issue,

00:49:22.030 --> 00:49:25.900
in the motion picture area,

00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:30.300
was the National Film
Preservation Act of 1988.

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:32.840
Notwithstanding that moral
rights had been taken

00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:36.220
out of Berne Implementation
Act, directors and writers

00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:37.000
and others went

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.420
to an Appropriation
Subcommittee Chair Sid Yates

00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:43.720
and got an amendment to the law

00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:46.920
to create a National Film
Preservation Board here

00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:48.960
in the Library of Congress.

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:51.690
That films would be
selected to a registry.

00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:56.940
And those films on that registry
couldn't be or would have

00:49:56.940 --> 00:49:59.980
to have a pejorative label
that they were altered --

00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:02.790
if they were materially
altered --

00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:08.460
without the permission of the
creative artists, the directors,

00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:12.180
cinematographers,
and screenwriters.

00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:17.110
And so that was sort of a
brief moment of creation

00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:20.370
for that industry
of moral rights.

00:50:20.370 --> 00:50:23.320
But the legislation
had a three-year sunset

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:25.650
and expired in 1991.

00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:29.650
It was reauthorized to focus
on film preservation issues,

00:50:29.650 --> 00:50:31.440
which still exist to this day.

00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:33.800
It's been reauthorized,
and I've been a member

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:36.490
of that board since 1989.

00:50:36.490 --> 00:50:39.870
But then Congress not
wanting necessarily

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:43.820
to leave moral rights
behind in the US decided --

00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:45.960
and those steadfast
in the position --

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:49.820
that no new moral rights
were required for Berne --

00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:53.940
adopted the Visual Artist Rights
Act as sort of a subcategory

00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:56.580
of PG and S works,
the pictorial, graphic

00:50:56.580 --> 00:51:00.030
and sculptural works --
foresaw a subclass of that

00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:05.400
and creating a right of both
attribution and integrity.

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:07.730
And because there was
a particular interest

00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:11.140
on Senator Kennedy's staff
for a right of destruction,

00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:14.590
also a right of destruction.

00:51:14.590 --> 00:51:18.320
So after all of that and
after Berne implementation

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:21.030
where the industries -- and
it's not just motion picture,

00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:23.520
magazine, book publishers
and others

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:26.130
and to the questions
about litigation.

00:51:26.130 --> 00:51:28.670
I think a lot of it was the
unknowns in the industries.

00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:31.090
Where industries
were just, you know,

00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:34.050
you have these very
labor-intensive industries.

00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:35.510
And the fear of --

00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:37.530
with deadlines and the
publishing industry --

00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:42.380
what's going to happen if
these issues arise from one

00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:45.640
of the many creators,
photographers or others?

00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:46.280
What will it do

00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:48.200
to our publication
deadlines and others?

00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:49.200
And it was just that.

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:51.800
It was a question
mark and an unknown.

00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:55.620
But the feeling for Berne
implementation was we're fine

00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:57.810
because of all the
reasons given.

00:51:57.810 --> 00:52:00.890
But you know the courts giveth
and the courts taketh away.

00:52:00.890 --> 00:52:05.850
And in 2003 -- and I'm sure the
next panel will talk about it --

00:52:05.850 --> 00:52:07.340
you have the Dastar case.

00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:09.140
Which was, you know,
at the intersection

00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:12.220
of copyright and trademark.

00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:16.860
Here you have a case where the
term of copyright has expired.

00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:19.020
And the Supreme Court
in Dastar rules

00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:22.840
that once copyright has
expired, works may be reproduced

00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:26.050
and disseminated, even
without attribution.

00:52:26.050 --> 00:52:27.660
The court reasoned that federal

00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:30.930
and state trademark laws
requiring a designation

00:52:30.930 --> 00:52:35.310
of quote unquote "origin"
pertain only to the origin

00:52:35.310 --> 00:52:38.440
of the physical copy,
not to the origin

00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:42.140
of the intangible subject
matter of the copyright.

00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:46.150
So you know whatever we were
talking about in that panoply

00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:50.190
of other rights and trademark
law Lanham Act and everything,

00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:53.910
certainly were significantly
scaled back by that case.

00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:59.250
And then I suppose the final
word in all of this was TRIPS.

00:52:59.250 --> 00:53:00.820
Yes. The US felt --

00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:05.090
the US government felt somewhat
confident in its position

00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:07.440
on Article 6bis of Berne, but --

00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:08.290
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I was
going to ask --

00:53:08.290 --> 00:53:10.080
and that was going
to be my question.

00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:13.520
We talked about the fact that
we have these obligations

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:14.880
in separate panels.

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:19.150
But we didn't talk about the
fact that the TRIPS Agreement,

00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:23.280
for whatever reason, actually
does obligate member countries

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:27.300
to recognize Articles 1 through
21 of the Berne Convention.

00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:31.120
But for some reason does not
obligate member of states

00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:37.280
to actually recognize Article
6bis, which is a question.

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:40.430
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, so then,
in the timeline of it all,

00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:43.060
Berne -- excuse me TRIPS.

00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:45.980
It more or less completed
in December of 1991,

00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:47.300
for all intents and purposes.

00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:52.580
It doesn't go into force
until January of '95 and TRIPS

00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:56.700
in January of '96, although
my friend Jane and I disagreed

00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:59.710
about the implementation
date, I remember.

00:53:59.710 --> 00:54:05.100
But the US government's position

00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:07.690
and others is TRIPS
is a trade agreement.

00:54:07.690 --> 00:54:15.670
These others are copyright
conventions and agreements.

00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:19.410
And in a trade agreement
involving trade in goods,

00:54:19.410 --> 00:54:22.880
only economic rights
should prevail.

00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:24.230
And though -- you know TRIPS,

00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:29.680
like all trade agreements was
heavily negotiated, US, EU,

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:32.690
Japan, Australia, and
many other countries.

00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:35.680
The US is a newly-minted
member of Berne by this point.

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:41.250
This is now in the early
1990, and the feeling is

00:54:41.250 --> 00:54:43.390
that there is no
dispute settlement

00:54:43.390 --> 00:54:44.450
in the Berne Convention.

00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:46.440
But there clearly is
dispute settlement

00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:49.290
in the TRIPS agreement, which
means that across the goods

00:54:49.290 --> 00:54:50.500
and services of TRIPS --

00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:53.160
and you've got you know one of
the TRIPS experts in the world,

00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:56.240
Daniel here, so you know you
should be answering this,

00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:58.530
not I -- but the
insurance policy is

00:54:58.530 --> 00:55:02.440
so you don't have dispute
settlement on moral rights.

00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:06.690
That is if the US is not in
compliance in a trade agreement.

00:55:06.690 --> 00:55:09.700
And so you limit the
TRIPS Agreement just

00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:11.430
to the economic rights.

00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:14.760
Read Article 9 one of TRIPS.

00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:18.950
And yes, members -- the US wants
to, and so do many countries,

00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:22.990
import, by reference, all
of articles 1 through 21

00:55:22.990 --> 00:55:25.060
into the Berne Convention.

00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:28.700
But members shall not
have rights or obligations

00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:31.700
under the agreement in
respect of the rights conferred

00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:34.440
under Article 6bis
of that convention

00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:36.960
or of the rights
derived therefrom.

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:39.760
That's Article 9 one
of the TRIPS Agreement.

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:44.180
So it strips out -- countries
can have moral rights,

00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:45.780
and many countries do.

00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:52.700
And the US, you know, by this
time does in section 104A

00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:55.820
with the -- excuse me, 106A,

00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:58.660
with the Visual Artist
Rights Act.

00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:03.010
And we do with a panoply of
other rights such as they exist.

00:56:03.010 --> 00:56:06.780
And certainly in the '90s
before Dastar, more vigorous,

00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:10.080
let's call it, but
at least not subject

00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:13.920
to trade dispute is the moral
rights provisions of Berne.

00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:19.780
So that's sort of the nutshell
history of US until, as Daniel

00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:23.380
and June mentioned, you know
you have the digital treaties

00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:26.510
in 1996 and then the
Beijing Treaty, which has not

00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:29.770
yet been implemented in the US.

00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:30.570
&gt;&gt; Thanks Eric.

00:56:30.570 --> 00:56:33.970
And I do want to save some time
to turn it over to the audience

00:56:33.970 --> 00:56:36.510
to see if we have any
audience questions.

00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:39.240
But Daniel, did you have any
-- did you want to add anything

00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:40.380
on the TRIPS point [inaudible]?

00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:42.030
&gt;&gt; Well, you -- no.

00:56:42.030 --> 00:56:45.090
You got the official
version [laughter].

00:56:45.090 --> 00:56:47.880
&gt;&gt; Did you want to add an
unofficial version, I guess?

00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:51.190
I'm scared to ask, but --

00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:53.360
&gt;&gt; Yes. It may be true the
US government was confident

00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:56.000
that US was complying with 6bis.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:01.460
But maybe not all that
confident, I suppose.

00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:03.640
The other argument
-- I mean to say

00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:05.410
that these are not
trade-related rights

00:57:05.410 --> 00:57:07.210
when you can pull
movies out of theaters.

00:57:07.210 --> 00:57:09.640
You know, as they did in that
one case in France, of course,

00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:11.710
was the argument used by
the Europeans to say see,

00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:13.350
it's very related
and then you know.

00:57:13.350 --> 00:57:16.280
So it was kind of a
discussion that I think

00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:20.550
in the end no one was going to
die in the trenches for 6bis.

00:57:20.550 --> 00:57:22.730
And the French government
got an earful

00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:26.210
from many people once
they showed the draft.

00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:29.440
But TRIPS was not
negotiated on behalf of Europe

00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:32.860
by a French negotiator but
by a Danish negotiator.

00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:36.080
And who knows.

00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:37.950
Maybe that made a difference.

00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:41.600
One thing, though, is it's
a very small footnote,

00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:43.910
but Eric said there's no
dispute settlement in Berne?

00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:46.080
There is, but no
one's ever used it

00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:49.030
because it's the International
Court of Justice in Article 33.

00:57:49.030 --> 00:57:52.350
And the reason no one's -- well
first of all, the US would have

00:57:52.350 --> 00:57:53.740
to accede to jurisdiction
in the case.

00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:58.620
But also no one knows what
it would do with an IP case.

00:57:58.620 --> 00:58:00.660
So no one's ever tried,
but I just thought I'd --

00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:00.940
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:02.040
&gt;&gt; I'd footnote that.

00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:04.050
&gt;&gt; No. there -- the US
would never concede --

00:58:04.050 --> 00:58:04.250
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:05.310
&gt;&gt; To the jurisdiction.

00:58:05.310 --> 00:58:05.750
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:07.650
And the Asphalt Jungle
case is interesting

00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:10.500
because that happens
in '86, I believe.

00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:12.950
The Huston estate.

00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:15.950
And here you have
an agreement signed,

00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:20.750
a work-for-hire language
in California.

00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:25.450
The choice law on the
agreement is California law.

00:58:25.450 --> 00:58:28.800
What the French television
station was going

00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:31.440
to do was show the -- as
only the French could do --

00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:34.100
show the film first
in black and white.

00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:35.030
Then in color.

00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:38.810
Then have a discussion of
the merits or lack thereof

00:58:38.810 --> 00:58:42.230
of the color version and
the black and white version.

00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:47.100
And the injunction was
to prevent the screening

00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:52.470
of the colorized version by
the screenwriter Ben Maddox

00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:55.780
and the estate of Huston.

00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:58.600
Notwithstanding that
it was work-for-hire,

00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:00.860
and they'd signed a choice
of law in California.

00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:03.410
And the French court, as
a matter of public order,

00:59:03.410 --> 00:59:06.390
rules that the moral
rights sort of override all

00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:08.100
of the other provisions.

00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:11.860
I think that added to the sense
whether or not streaming a film,

00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:15.160
you know, in color or something
was that big of an issue

00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:17.210
for the motion picture
producers.

00:59:17.210 --> 00:59:19.850
It sort of added
to the uncertainty

00:59:19.850 --> 00:59:24.260
about what might happen for
works that have been created.

00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:27.750
And in this case, created
under work-for-hire agreement

00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:30.160
and the choice of
law in a contract

00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:34.480
that said it's clearly
a Californian law.

00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:40.000
That raised at least the
level of fear in some

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.250
of the creative industries.

00:59:41.250 --> 00:59:42.660
Not all, but in some.

00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:44.740
&gt;&gt; And June, did you
have a extra point too?

00:59:44.740 --> 00:59:46.970
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I just wanted to go
back to the point about concern

00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:51.700
about litigation, if the US
implemented moral rights.

00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:53.630
Now among the chief opponents

00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:56.310
of putting moral
rights in the statute.

00:59:56.310 --> 01:00:00.580
When the Berne Convention was
passed were magazine publishers,

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:03.870
newspapers and the
motion picture people.

01:00:03.870 --> 01:00:07.010
And during the course
of the Berne hearings,

01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:10.090
a number of international
experts said well, you know,

01:00:10.090 --> 01:00:11.850
we have magazines, and
we have newspapers,

01:00:11.850 --> 01:00:13.630
and we have motion
pictures in our country.

01:00:13.630 --> 01:00:15.340
And this has not been a
problem even though we have

01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:16.280
moral rights.

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:18.060
But the response
to that was yes,

01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:21.620
but the United States is a
much more litigious country.

01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:22.820
And I think that's true.

01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:25.100
And I think we have to
be realistic about that,

01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:27.700
if we're going to go ahead at
some point with moral rights.

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:30.600
I mean this is a country where
you can buy a cup of coffee

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:34.270
and put it between your legs
on the car seat and then sue

01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:36.210
because you get burned.

01:00:36.210 --> 01:00:39.150
And sue successfully
because you can get burned.

01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:40.920
And I think that that
does reflect something

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.980
about our society.

01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:47.200
So if we were to go ahead
and create moral rights

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:48.880
at some point broad,
in other words.

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:51.610
I think it's important
that they be very specific

01:00:51.610 --> 01:00:54.390
and circumscribed.

01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:57.790
As I think can be said
reasonably of VARA.

01:00:57.790 --> 01:01:00.440
And you know that's just an
important thing to keep in mind.

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:05.880
That that particular concern
will not just have gone away

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:07.690
by virtue of the
time that's past

01:01:07.690 --> 01:01:09.730
since the US joined
the Berne Convention.

01:01:09.730 --> 01:01:10.840
&gt;&gt; Okay. Can I --

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:11.500
&gt;&gt; Sure. Sure.

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:15.300
&gt;&gt; So actually, I agreed
with what June said.

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:20.650
But so American film directors
and others are, in fact,

01:01:20.650 --> 01:01:23.850
typically recognized as
authors in other countries.

01:01:23.850 --> 01:01:25.770
Even if there's work-for-hire
here.

01:01:25.770 --> 01:01:28.470
In other words, a French court
typically will not recognize

01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:31.780
work-for-hire as creating
authorship in the movie studio.

01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:33.310
It will recognize
first donorship,

01:01:33.310 --> 01:01:35.620
which mean the director
still has these rights.

01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:39.620
And some European collectives
actually that collect money

01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:43.350
for film that is supposed
to paid to authors have had

01:01:43.350 --> 01:01:46.300
to make some interesting
arrangements to be able

01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:48.970
to send that money to US --

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.560
I don't even know
what to call them.

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:54.330
Beneficiaries.

01:01:54.330 --> 01:01:59.130
So it's -- but the point
here is that you don't see --

01:01:59.130 --> 01:02:02.730
at least to my knowledge,
you don't see a lot

01:02:02.730 --> 01:02:05.620
of US film director going
around the world saying yeah,

01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:07.130
I can sue for moral
rights infringement.

01:02:07.130 --> 01:02:09.520
You don't see, you know,
a heck of a lot of that.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:12.050
So there might be
more here, but --

01:02:12.050 --> 01:02:13.250
and I don't disagree with that.

01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:15.110
Actually I think I said
something along the same

01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:15.340
lines --

01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:18.320
&gt;&gt; I will just say
that with some people

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:19.310
and directors are one of them.

01:02:19.310 --> 01:02:21.570
There's another thing operating,
which is you'll never work

01:02:21.570 --> 01:02:23.880
in this town again, so
you know, it's not just

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:25.700
about legally what you
have a right to do.

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:25.910
&gt;&gt; I agree.

01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:29.630
&gt;&gt; And attribution is so well
covered by guild agreements

01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:33.550
and all the other obligations
that for anybody who stays

01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:36.870
to the end of a movie
credits is not an issue.

01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:41.460
The motion picture industry,
everybody is credited

01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:44.430
and the caterers included but --

01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:45.050
&gt;&gt; That's true.

01:02:45.050 --> 01:02:45.710
&gt;&gt; But it's --

01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:49.170
&gt;&gt; So it should be easy then to
establish an explicit provision

01:02:49.170 --> 01:02:50.740
in the United States
law for attribution.

01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:52.510
Isn't that what the
panel has concluded?

01:02:52.510 --> 01:02:55.170
[ Laughter ]

01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:57.930
I probably won't
ask for an answer

01:02:57.930 --> 01:03:00.490
for that now unless we
have some additional time.

01:03:00.490 --> 01:03:03.270
I did want to leave open at
least five or six minutes

01:03:03.270 --> 01:03:04.840
for audience questions.

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:07.010
And then, if you have any
closing remarks we can do that,

01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:09.100
if we don't have a significant
amount of audience questions.

01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:12.480
But I think we have one there.

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:13.970
&gt;&gt; Thanks very much.

01:03:13.970 --> 01:03:15.400
Steve Tepp, Sentinel Worldwide,

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:18.060
on behalf of the
Artists Rights Society.

01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:19.210
June, thank you very much

01:03:19.210 --> 01:03:21.580
for mentioning the droit de
suite, the resale royalty.

01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:23.730
It seems to me that
it certainly deserves

01:03:23.730 --> 01:03:26.870
at least honorable
mention at this conference.

01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:30.590
And of course for those not
familiar with it, it's the right

01:03:30.590 --> 01:03:33.640
of authors to receive modest
commission from the sale

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:36.560
of their works and
resale of their works.

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:40.010
It's particularly critical,
I think, and I'm asking

01:03:40.010 --> 01:03:42.650
for the panel's reaction
to these observations.

01:03:42.650 --> 01:03:46.320
To artists whose works
are valued for, of course,

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:50.830
their artistic merit but
for their relative scarcity

01:03:50.830 --> 01:03:52.620
as opposed to their ubiquity.

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:55.270
Which is what the Copyright Act,

01:03:55.270 --> 01:03:58.920
the latter is what the Copyright
Act most often is directed

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:00.520
to facilitate.

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:03.910
And it seems to me that
there's a trend towards the

01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:04.860
resale royalty.

01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:06.350
The EU has adopted it.

01:04:06.350 --> 01:04:08.740
Australia has adopted it
in relatively recent years,

01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:11.630
and implementation has
gone fairly smoothly.

01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:15.480
It's now on topic recurring
on the Standing Committee

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:19.030
of Copyright and
Related Rights at WIPO.

01:04:19.030 --> 01:04:21.670
We have legislation pending in
both Houses of the US Congress.

01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:24.680
And of course, the copyright
office has issued a report,

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:28.670
which I think I'll end this
with, this poignant statement.

01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:29.850
Without a resale royalty,

01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:33.200
many if not most visual artists
will not realize a benefit

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:36.220
proportional to the
success of their work.

01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:38.900
So I just offer that up
for comment-observation

01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:40.960
on the importance
of resale royalty.

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:41.250
Thank you.

01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:42.460
&gt;&gt; Anyone want to
briefly discuss --

01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:42.590
&gt;&gt; Sure.

01:04:42.590 --> 01:04:44.510
&gt;&gt; Resale royalty?

01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:50.960
[ Inaudible Response ]

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:53.440
&gt;&gt; Works of art certainly
have a special status, right?

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:57.490
It's like, in music, you don't
ever want to get to the master.

01:04:57.490 --> 01:04:59.950
Or in movies, you know,
the original copy.

01:04:59.950 --> 01:05:01.260
So that works of art,

01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:03.380
you're absolutely
right on this feature.

01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:06.580
That the original --
you can make a copy,

01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:10.750
but it's never the
painting on the wall, right?

01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:13.530
But that being said,
again, that's a right

01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:15.270
that scares some people.

01:05:15.270 --> 01:05:18.870
And it's implemented so, you
know, many different ways.

01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:22.080
The typical case of course that
you hear about is the Van Gogh.

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:25.020
You know, the artist who sells
the painting for five bucks,

01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:28.530
and then somebody sells it
later for you know a lot more.

01:05:28.530 --> 01:05:31.960
But in reality, you have
typically in works of art,

01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:35.890
you have incremental
value changes.

01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:39.210
And so some countries
implement this droit de suite,

01:05:39.210 --> 01:05:41.330
like basically each
time the work sells,

01:05:41.330 --> 01:05:43.010
you pay a percentage
of the whole price.

01:05:43.010 --> 01:05:45.280
And some countries have
only the difference

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:47.950
between the sale price and
the previous sale price.

01:05:47.950 --> 01:05:52.730
There was a long discussion
in the UK about this.

01:05:52.730 --> 01:05:55.210
So if ever this was
to move here,

01:05:55.210 --> 01:05:56.540
I would certainly recommend

01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:59.110
that the Copyright Office
pay very close attention

01:05:59.110 --> 01:06:01.060
to the debates in the
UK about droit de suite.

01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:05.410
I think they covered it right,
left, up, down, every other way.

01:06:05.410 --> 01:06:06.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And I would just add

01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:07.790
that our report did
mention the UK --

01:06:07.790 --> 01:06:09.100
&gt;&gt; Of course.

01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:11.760
&gt;&gt; And the fact that, in
the UK, they were just going

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:13.640
through like you
know implementation.

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:15.950
They had initially just
implemented it, I think,

01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:17.120
for the life of the author.

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:18.600
And then they, at the time,

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:21.840
were about to extend
it to heirs as well.

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:23.580
And so one of our
recommendations was

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:26.640
to closely follow, kind of
once it was fully implemented,

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:30.880
if it actually affected the
art market in a negative way.

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:32.700
&gt;&gt; You know, it just
seems like it's something

01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:34.740
that could and should be done.

01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:37.230
I should caveat it
by saying everything

01:06:37.230 --> 01:06:39.550
and nothing I've said is very
controversial this morning.

01:06:39.550 --> 01:06:41.710
But speaking on my
own behalf and not

01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:44.400
for the several clients I'm
noticing in the room [laughter].

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:49.490
But no, I think that
personally, yeah,

01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:51.220
there should be a
resale royalty right

01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:52.670
when you think about
works of art.

01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:55.280
And the, you know,
the one-off sales.

01:06:55.280 --> 01:07:00.560
And the lack of, you know,
whether it's as a percentage

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:03.830
or as a percentage between the
differential and the amount

01:07:03.830 --> 01:07:04.880
that you're talking about.

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:07.530
As a way to compensate
those that created the work,

01:07:07.530 --> 01:07:11.990
not those that are good at
selling and reselling it.

01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:15.270
With all the respect to
galleries and other places

01:07:15.270 --> 01:07:17.660
that you know there should
be some compensation.

01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:19.100
&gt;&gt; I think we're
right at the end.

01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:21.510
I guess we have time
for one last question,

01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:23.870
and then we're going to turn
it over to the next panel.

01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:26.070
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm Carrie Devorah,
Center for Copyright

01:07:26.070 --> 01:07:28.700
and Integrity and probably the
odd voice in a room of lawyers

01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:30.520
to say I don't believe
in resale rights.

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:32.040
I think it comes
down to contracts.

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:33.440
You have the right
to say I'm going

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:35.470
to drop the contract
and if you sell it.

01:07:35.470 --> 01:07:37.910
I don't think the government
has the right to legislate.

01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:39.600
Other points were made
up there they really come

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:41.060
down to contracts.

01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:42.590
My background is licensing.

01:07:42.590 --> 01:07:46.040
I entered that world over 40
years ago, and I retired a bunch

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:48.360
of years back because
of licensing.

01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:52.580
You need to understand there's
a global access out there,

01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:56.440
so it comes down to artists
being taught about a contract

01:07:56.440 --> 01:08:01.460
and the value of time, territory
that dovetails into your talent.

01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:03.450
So I do not believe
in resale rights.

01:08:03.450 --> 01:08:05.960
I think if someone's
going to invest in you,

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:08.090
they're entitled
to make that money.

01:08:08.090 --> 01:08:11.530
Same way as a casino entitled
to make money on your win

01:08:11.530 --> 01:08:13.520
because they provided
the machine.

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:14.410
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:08:14.410 --> 01:08:16.860
&gt;&gt; You don't know what the
value of the work is at first.

01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:19.280
I mean that's the
reason for renewal.

01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:21.620
That's the reason for
copyright termination.

01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:23.820
I mean it's you know
that the author is just

01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:27.190
in the unknown position
at that time of first sale

01:08:27.190 --> 01:08:30.670
because she doesn't know
what her work is worth.

01:08:30.670 --> 01:08:32.550
She knows what it's
worth at that moment

01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:36.530
but she surely doesn't for
the life of the copyrights.

01:08:36.530 --> 01:08:38.160
&gt;&gt; And I would hate
to cut us off.

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:40.410
I know that we could actually
get into a long conversation

01:08:40.410 --> 01:08:43.140
about resale royalty, but
the focus of this panel

01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:46.130
and of the day is a more
specifically on moral rights.

01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:47.670
So I want to thank all

01:08:47.670 --> 01:08:50.930
of the panelists here who've
given us a very good overview

01:08:50.930 --> 01:08:53.140
of moral rights and the basis
for our later discussions.

01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:55.060
Thank you very much [applause].

01:08:56.410 --> 01:09:00.070
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
