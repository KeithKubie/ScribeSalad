00:00:00.422 --> 00:00:03.635
- [Voiceover] Bob is riding his
bicycle along the same path.

00:00:03.635 --> 00:00:05.348
For zero is less than or equal to t

00:00:05.348 --> 00:00:06.658
is less than or equal to 10.

00:00:06.658 --> 00:00:10.176
Bob's velocity is modeled
by B of t is equal to

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:12.834
t to the third minus
six t squared plus 300,

00:00:12.834 --> 00:00:16.143
where t is measured in minutes
and B of t is measured in

00:00:16.143 --> 00:00:17.733
meters per minute.

00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:22.191
Find Bob's acceleration
at time t equals five.

00:00:22.191 --> 00:00:23.515
Well acceleration,

00:00:23.515 --> 00:00:25.724
this is a velocity
function right over here,

00:00:25.724 --> 00:00:27.407
so the acceleration is
going to be derivative

00:00:27.407 --> 00:00:29.781
of the velocity function
with respect to time.

00:00:29.781 --> 00:00:32.199
What is the rate of change of
velocity with respect to time?

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:33.465
That's acceleration.

00:00:33.465 --> 00:00:38.465
So we really just want to evaluate this,

00:00:38.516 --> 00:00:41.594
Bob's acceleration at t equals five,

00:00:41.594 --> 00:00:45.112
that's going to be B prime of five.

00:00:45.112 --> 00:00:47.685
So let's first figure
out what B prime of t is.

00:00:47.685 --> 00:00:50.239
B prime of t is equal to,

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:51.203
we'll take the derivative here.

00:00:51.203 --> 00:00:52.201
It's pretty straightforward.

00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:53.559
Just use the Power Rule.

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.559
So it's going to be three
t squared minus 12t,

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.507
two times negative six
is 12 or negative 12,

00:01:02.507 --> 00:01:05.444
and then the derivative
of 300 doesn't change

00:01:05.444 --> 00:01:06.182
with respect to time,

00:01:06.182 --> 00:01:07.634
so it's just a zero.

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:12.124
And so B prime of five is
going to be equal to three

00:01:12.124 --> 00:01:17.124
times five squared minus 12 times five

00:01:17.258 --> 00:01:21.319
which is equal to 75 minus 60

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:23.340
which is equal to 15,

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.371
and the units here, this is acceleration.

00:01:25.371 --> 00:01:26.370
So this is going to be,

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.750
his velocity was in meters per minute,

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.358
and so this is going meters per minute,

00:01:30.358 --> 00:01:31.503
per minute because remember,

00:01:31.503 --> 00:01:33.058
time is in terms of minutes.

00:01:33.058 --> 00:01:35.845
So we could write as meters,

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:38.632
and we write it out meters per minute,

00:01:38.632 --> 00:01:43.053
per minute which is the same
thing as meters per minute,

00:01:43.053 --> 00:01:45.897
meters per minute squared.

00:01:45.897 --> 00:01:48.518
All right. Let's do the next part.

00:01:48.518 --> 00:01:50.603
Based on the model B from part c,

00:01:50.603 --> 00:01:54.260
find Bob's average velocity
during the interval

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.184
from zero is less than or equal to t

00:01:56.184 --> 00:01:57.669
is less than or equal to 10.

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:59.981
And if the notion of average velocity

00:01:59.981 --> 00:02:03.149
or average value of a function
is completely foreign to you,

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.533
I encourage you to watch the videos

00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:08.191
on Khan Academy on find
the average of a function.

00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:12.114
But just to kind of cut to the chase,

00:02:12.114 --> 00:02:14.368
the average velocity,

00:02:14.368 --> 00:02:15.955
the average velocity,

00:02:15.955 --> 00:02:19.217
is going to be the area
under the velocity curve

00:02:19.217 --> 00:02:22.433
divided by our change in time.

00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:26.474
So the area under the velocity
curve from t equals zero

00:02:26.474 --> 00:02:30.351
to t equals 10 of B of t

00:02:30.351 --> 00:02:33.579
of B of t, dt,

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.714
divided by our change in time.

00:02:36.714 --> 00:02:38.216
So it's going to be divided by,

00:02:38.216 --> 00:02:39.946
well you're going from zero to 10.

00:02:39.946 --> 00:02:43.800
So 10 minus zero is
going to be equal to 10.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.362
And if you wanted the
intuition here it's like well,

00:02:46.362 --> 00:02:48.589
if you know the area of
something and if you wanted

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:50.524
to find its average height,

00:02:50.524 --> 00:02:52.917
you could just divide by its width.

00:02:52.917 --> 00:02:54.195
And that's what we're doing here.

00:02:54.195 --> 00:02:56.203
If we know the area of something,

00:02:56.203 --> 00:02:58.450
we want to figure out its average height,

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.354
and so you divide by its width.

00:03:00.354 --> 00:03:03.071
That's I guess a very
high-level intuition for

00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:05.637
where this expression came from.

00:03:05.637 --> 00:03:08.795
And so this is going to be
equal to one tenth times

00:03:08.795 --> 00:03:11.314
the integral from zero to 10,

00:03:11.314 --> 00:03:16.314
and B of t is t to the
third power minus 6t squared

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.390
plus 300 dt,

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.792
and so this is going to
be equal to one over 10.

00:03:25.792 --> 00:03:27.208
Take the anti-derivative here,

00:03:27.208 --> 00:03:29.832
so this is going to be t
to the fourth over four,

00:03:29.832 --> 00:03:32.618
t to the fourth over four,

00:03:32.618 --> 00:03:34.453
and then this is going to be,

00:03:34.453 --> 00:03:36.295
if we increase the exponent here by

00:03:36.295 --> 00:03:37.503
what is t to the third,

00:03:37.503 --> 00:03:39.140
and then you divide by three.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.420
So it's negative six divided by three is

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.578
negative two, t to the third,

00:03:44.578 --> 00:03:47.886
and then plus 300t,

00:03:47.886 --> 00:03:49.581
300t,

00:03:49.581 --> 00:03:51.938
And I'm going to evaluate it.

00:03:51.938 --> 00:03:56.938
I am going to evaluate it
at 10 and subtract from that

00:03:57.186 --> 00:03:58.927
and evaluate it at zero.

00:03:58.927 --> 00:04:01.482
And so this is going to be equal to,

00:04:01.482 --> 00:04:03.950
this is going to be equal to one tenth,

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.552
that same one tenth there,

00:04:05.552 --> 00:04:07.828
and when you evaluate all this at 10

00:04:07.828 --> 00:04:08.971
what'd everybody get?

00:04:08.971 --> 00:04:12.708
Let's see 10 to the fourth power is,

00:04:12.708 --> 00:04:17.708
10 to the fourth power is
10,000 divided by four is 2,500,

00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:20.388
2,500,

00:04:20.388 --> 00:04:23.209
and then minus two times 10 to the third.

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:25.420
So it's two times a thousand.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.206
So minus 2,000.

00:04:28.206 --> 00:04:30.308
And then 300 times 10,

00:04:30.308 --> 00:04:33.059
well that's plus 3,000,

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:35.764
and then you subtract all
of this evaluated at zero

00:04:35.764 --> 00:04:37.877
which is just going to be zero.

00:04:37.877 --> 00:04:39.898
So this going to be equal to,

00:04:39.898 --> 00:04:43.741
2,500 minus 2,000 is 500 plus 3,000.

00:04:43.741 --> 00:04:44.786
This is all,

00:04:44.786 --> 00:04:47.398
simplifies to 3,500,

00:04:47.398 --> 00:04:49.220
or 3,500,

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.846
and then you divide it by 10.

00:04:50.846 --> 00:04:54.590
This is going to be 350,

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:55.771
350,

00:04:55.771 --> 00:05:00.771
and it's an average
velocity meters per 350,

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:03.631
meters per minute.

00:05:03.631 --> 00:05:05.041
And we are done.
