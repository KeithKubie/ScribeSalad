00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:06.290
You know what they say, more money more problems,
well what about more money more sex?

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.309
Hey guys, Julia here for Dnews

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.490
A recent study from Anglia Ruskin University
in Cambridge, England found a link between

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.810
income and sex.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:17.990
Oooh exciting right?

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.439
But before we talk about sex, let’s talk
about subscribing

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.020
We know you’re curious about getting it
on, so get your subscribe on so you don’t

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.570
miss an episode of DNews.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.970
We’ve also got a playlist filled with videos
all about the sexy times.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.369
Check out links for that down in the description
below.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.110
Now that you’ve subscribed, let’s get
to back to the subject of sex.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.730
In a study published in the International
Journal of Manpower, researchers reviewed

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.649
data from 75-hundred participants and found
those who had sex two or three times a week

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.079
made 4.5% more income than their less frisky
coworkers.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.940
Even those who weren’t in perfect health
still benefited from a higher salary, they

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.950
earned 1.5% than their similarly less fit
coworkers.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.140
The lead researcher from the study says the
data supports the idea that more money, means

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.760
more sex and vice versa, that having more
sex might give you a boost in the boardroom.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.760
Okay okay.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.760
I know.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.140
Correlation does not equal causation.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.740
So let’s break this down.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.880
Sex might be good for us for all sorts of
reasons.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.030
Some doctors say its relaxation effects help
soothe stress.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.560
Small studies like one published in the journal
Biological Psychology suggests it helps lower

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.060
blood pressure spikes.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.290
Other research shows that pleasureable actvities,
like sex, reduce stress.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.950
And another study from the Archives of Sexual
Behavior shows that sex lowers anxiety and

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.590
can boost your mood the next day.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.979
These mental health benefits might make us
more alert on the job and ready to tackle

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.829
any challenges with ease.

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.020
Maybe frequent sex is the sign of a strong
relationship and strong relationships also

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.030
have health benefits.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.220
According to the journal BMC Public Health,
people who are satisfied in their relationships

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.990
have a kind of buttress against emotional
distress.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.810
Or another way of looking at it, maybe getting
it on more often is a vote of confidence.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.380
If you’re getting lucky at home, maybe that
leaves a little more pep in your step when

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.479
you head to work.

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.520
Some research from the University of Melbourne
showed that self-confidence is a key determinant

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.590
of workplace success.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.299
When you feel better about yourself you’re
more likely to do a better job.

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.410
Or maybe you know, it’s the other way around.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.440
It could be that healthier people do better
in the workplace and healthier people also

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.660
happen to have more sex.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.520
The same study in the Journal of International
Manpower found that people without disabilities

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.190
are 13% more sexually active than those with
disabilities and people with heart disease

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.940
have 11.4% less sex than their healthier peers.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.410
Studying the link between health and sex and
status is surprisingly difficult.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.480
Most studies rely on self-reporting, so you
know, people don’t always tell the truth.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.010
Especially when it comes to a subject as touchy
as sex.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.850
I guess you could say….

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.030
More research is needed.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.750
On the topic of sex research, did you know
that funny people get laid more?

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:48.580
Trace and I explore that connection in this
video:

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.590
Oh come on, i know...we’re all curious about
sex and we all know that what you learn in

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.280
health class might not be all that.. er…
factual.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.280
And here at DNews we’ll stick to the science.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.130
