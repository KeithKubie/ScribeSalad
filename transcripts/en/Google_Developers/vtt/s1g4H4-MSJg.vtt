00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.400
In this short overview, I will
discuss App Engine, tell you

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.560
what it is, and how it
helps you build applications

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.580
at Cloud Scale.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.760
I'm Laurence Moroney, and I'm
a Developer Advocate in Google,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.390
working on the Google
Cloud Platform.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.050
App Engine is an integral part
of the Google Cloud Platform.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.080
This family of technologies
can provide you

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.470
with everything you need
to build for the Cloud,

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.630
including platform and
infrastructure as a service,

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.820
as well as big data, cloud
storage, and much more.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.930
Cloud applications should be
able to scale at a moment's

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.160
notice to handle huge or
tiny amounts of traffic.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.820
You should only pay for
the infrastructure capacity

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.760
your applications actually use.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.460
When using App Engine, you
can build your applications

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.529
to run on top of Google's
world class infrastructure.

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:46.820
You don't have to worry about
provisioning and managing

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.370
a data center that scales
to meet your demand.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.090
Google takes care
of all of that.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.550
And you can just
focus on building

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.030
the best possible
app for your users.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.980
When developing
for App Engine, you

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.770
can use popular languages such
as Python, Java, PHP, and GO,

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.489
as well as existing frameworks
like Django and flask.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.230
You can focus on
your code and let

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.660
Google worry about database
administration, server

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.900
configuration, sharding, load
balancing, and everything else

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.120
that you need to build at scale.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.470
You have multiple options
for storing your data,

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.850
including relational databases,
scalable file storage,

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.110
and a lightweight data store.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.810
App Engine makes
you more productive

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.730
by reducing the need to
write boilerplate code.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.850
Manage services such as task
queues, Memcache, and the users

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.080
API will help you build
world class applications.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.080
You can use the tools you know,
including Eclipse, Intelliji,

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.860
Maven, GIT, and much more.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.970
The App Engine STK allows you
to test applications locally

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.610
in a simulated environment.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.100
And they deploy your app
with simple to use tools.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.300
Some of the world's most
popular web services

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.970
are built on our platform.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.750
You can scale up to billions
of requests per day,

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.377
and scale down when
traffic subsides.

00:01:54.377 --> 00:01:56.210
There's lots of great
stuff available to you

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.090
as a developer.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.640
And you can learn more about
using them at this URL--

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.230
developers.google.com/appengine.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.370
The Cloud is one of the
most important advances

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.750
in computer
technology in decades.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.120
App Engine is built on the
same infrastructure that

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.420
allows Google to return
billions of search results

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.740
in milliseconds, serve over
6 billion hours of YouTube

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.020
video per month, and provide
storage for 425 million Gmail

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.920
users.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.670
And this scale to your demand.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.421
With free STK's, it's
easy to get started.

00:02:24.421 --> 00:02:26.295
And you could be up and
running with building

00:02:26.295 --> 00:02:28.080
Cloud applications very quickly.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.550
Companies such as
Snapchat, Rovio,

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.130
the makers of Angry
Birds, and Khan Academy

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.440
already run an App Engine,
giving their customers

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.900
scalable reliable service.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.400
With App Engine,
this infrastructure

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.740
is available to you.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.180
And you'll only have to
pay for what you use.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.800
You can learn more about
App Engine at these URLs--

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.815
cloud.google.com/product/appengine,
 developers.google.com/appengine.

00:02:51.815 --> 00:02:53.190
And there's some
terrific samples

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.030
to get you started at
googlecloudplatform.github.io.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.640
Thank you.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.523
And welcome to the Cloud.
