00:00:05.862 --> 00:00:08.445
(upbeat music)

00:00:22.625 --> 00:00:26.792
- I wanted to sort of pitch
or present the work today

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:30.451
in the context of the effects of stress

00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:33.673
because of the high
burden that mental illness

00:00:33.673 --> 00:00:38.671
has on young people, that is
as many as 40% of young people

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:41.504
today experience a mental illness.

00:00:42.349 --> 00:00:45.668
The majority of these are
related to anxiety and stress

00:00:45.668 --> 00:00:48.451
and if we don't treat these early they can

00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:51.442
go on to lead to chronic illness,

00:00:51.442 --> 00:00:54.985
both psychiatric as well
as physical illness.

00:00:54.985 --> 00:00:56.819
So the questions that we've been asking

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:00.902
in our laboratory over
the years is how are these

00:01:01.845 --> 00:01:06.274
early life experiences
impacting emotional well-being

00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:08.997
and the underlying
brain circuitry involved

00:01:08.997 --> 00:01:13.021
in that well-being, and
ultimately, what we need to do

00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:16.024
is to use this information
so that we can facilitate

00:01:16.024 --> 00:01:18.569
and enhance healthy brain development

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:21.856
and also of course
well-being of young people,

00:01:21.856 --> 00:01:25.622
which is then gonna be
well-being of our society.

00:01:25.622 --> 00:01:28.042
But if we first take just
a simplistic look at all

00:01:28.042 --> 00:01:31.438
the changes that are happening
in post-natal development,

00:01:31.438 --> 00:01:36.318
what you'll see is that
there is dramatic changes

00:01:36.318 --> 00:01:40.678
just in the number of
synapses throughout the brain

00:01:40.678 --> 00:01:43.246
that develop regionally,
so we see a proliferation

00:01:43.246 --> 00:01:46.310
and a subsequent pruning
of these connections.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.408
Simultaneously, there are
changes in neurochemicals

00:01:50.408 --> 00:01:53.081
and neurotrophins that
are absolutely essential

00:01:53.081 --> 00:01:56.226
to development and learning,
and with all these regional

00:01:56.226 --> 00:02:00.305
changes, it is co-occurring with increased

00:02:00.305 --> 00:02:02.716
myelination throughout the brain,

00:02:02.716 --> 00:02:05.636
which is making the connections stronger.

00:02:05.636 --> 00:02:08.821
So we've been focused on
all these dynamic changes

00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:12.634
and trying to understand
with just one picture,

00:02:12.634 --> 00:02:16.567
using human imaging and
focusing on one circuitry

00:02:16.567 --> 00:02:19.960
that's really important
for our ability to process

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.386
emotional information,
so emotional regulatory

00:02:23.386 --> 00:02:26.077
and emotional reactive processes.

00:02:26.077 --> 00:02:30.451
And during this time, during
childhood and adolescence,

00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:32.522
there are major changes in the circuitry

00:02:32.522 --> 00:02:35.689
and we think that they are one pathway

00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:39.915
for us to seeing how early
life experiences are reflected

00:02:39.915 --> 00:02:42.146
in them and how this continued development

00:02:42.146 --> 00:02:45.913
may also be a window
of plasticity of sorts

00:02:45.913 --> 00:02:49.490
where we may have the biggest change.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.834
Now, in human studies,
one of the way that we try

00:02:51.834 --> 00:02:56.575
to look at this in these
circuitries and the behaving

00:02:56.575 --> 00:03:00.821
human brain, non-invasively,
is to use simple stimulator

00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:04.578
cues that we present, so here's an example

00:03:04.578 --> 00:03:06.947
of a cue with emotional information.

00:03:06.947 --> 00:03:11.543
We examine how these cues
impact both brain and behavior.

00:03:11.543 --> 00:03:15.903
These cues can be positive,
smiling faces or negative,

00:03:15.903 --> 00:03:19.924
or they can be neutral, but
what we see is even if you

00:03:19.924 --> 00:03:22.788
were in the laboratory
performing this task,

00:03:22.788 --> 00:03:24.780
if we asked you just to press a button

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.937
whenever you saw one of these cues,

00:03:26.937 --> 00:03:31.696
you would be significantly
in detecting a threat cue,

00:03:31.696 --> 00:03:34.994
a fearful cue, than you would
be to a neutral or happy,

00:03:34.994 --> 00:03:38.708
as you see here, so we have
a longer latency there.

00:03:38.708 --> 00:03:42.612
It's adaptive when we see cues
that have some uncertainty

00:03:42.612 --> 00:03:45.723
or ambiguity, I don't think
for a minute when I present

00:03:45.723 --> 00:03:48.615
this cue to you that you
are threatened by that.

00:03:48.615 --> 00:03:51.667
However, we learn over a lifetime
when we see cues like this

00:03:51.667 --> 00:03:53.594
that there might be potential danger,

00:03:53.594 --> 00:03:56.088
and what's very important
for us to understand

00:03:56.088 --> 00:03:59.005
is in this context, is it a threat.

00:04:00.051 --> 00:04:03.077
So if a bear were to come into the room,

00:04:03.077 --> 00:04:05.524
I might have an emotional response,

00:04:05.524 --> 00:04:09.119
but the circuitry is important
if I saw a bear in a zoo

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:13.343
to know that that bear in that
situation, I would be safe

00:04:13.343 --> 00:04:16.676
because they were behind a cage or wire.

00:04:18.128 --> 00:04:22.060
So now if we look at these
responses and this change

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.712
in our responses depending
on the potential threat

00:04:25.712 --> 00:04:28.828
of information in our environment,
if we open up the brain

00:04:28.828 --> 00:04:31.794
and look inside, the areas
that tend to be related to

00:04:31.794 --> 00:04:36.145
that delay and our approach
behavior in such situations

00:04:36.145 --> 00:04:40.062
involve the amygdala and
the prefrontal cortex.

00:04:41.333 --> 00:04:43.329
And hopefully what you
note from this slide

00:04:43.329 --> 00:04:46.113
is that the amygdala,
the more active it is,

00:04:46.113 --> 00:04:48.365
the slower you are to respond.

00:04:48.365 --> 00:04:50.712
The amygdala's very important
in picking up the emotional

00:04:50.712 --> 00:04:53.286
significance of information
in the environment

00:04:53.286 --> 00:04:56.024
and has been associated
with emotional reactivity.

00:04:56.024 --> 00:04:59.446
In contrast, the prefrontal
cortex, which has direct

00:04:59.446 --> 00:05:03.496
projections to the amygdala
based on elegant animal work

00:05:03.496 --> 00:05:07.663
and more recent human work,
that area is less active

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.603
when you're really slow to respond

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:14.702
and the more active it
is the quicker you are.

00:05:14.702 --> 00:05:18.796
That is, you see a potential
threat, you are able

00:05:18.796 --> 00:05:20.919
to understand in this particular situation

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.792
with repeated presentations
of it, get over yourself,

00:05:23.792 --> 00:05:27.113
alright, already, nothing's
gonna happen to you.

00:05:27.113 --> 00:05:31.680
Now, I've just made a sort
of claim that over time,

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.680
nothing's gonna happen to you.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.689
Well let's look at that in
the brain and what systems

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:37.754
are absolutely essential for that.

00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:40.737
What's important when we
look at, with those repeated

00:05:40.737 --> 00:05:44.636
presentations, how well you
habituate to these cues,

00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:47.829
is this inverse coupling
between the prefrontal cortex

00:05:47.829 --> 00:05:51.744
and the amygdala in the circuitry
and this inverse coupling

00:05:51.744 --> 00:05:55.729
or negative connectivity
seems to be changing

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:59.520
radically from childhood to adolescence.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.189
And it is when you are not able
to habituate that response,

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:07.475
that is associated with
heightened anxiety,

00:06:07.475 --> 00:06:10.290
so I just want you to focus
on this quadrant for a moment

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.323
and basically, if you
look over at the y axis,

00:06:13.323 --> 00:06:16.373
that's amygdala habituation
and it's a negative score.

00:06:16.373 --> 00:06:21.368
That means, not only was there
not a change in how active

00:06:21.368 --> 00:06:24.350
the amygdala was to these
cues, but that was actually

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.778
sensitized and it was
increasing over the course

00:06:26.778 --> 00:06:30.397
of the experiment, and
that's related to the highest

00:06:30.397 --> 00:06:32.798
level of self-reported trait anxiety.

00:06:32.798 --> 00:06:35.175
Now, some of these
pictures had a lot of data

00:06:35.175 --> 00:06:39.757
and I think data slides and
pictures are worth 100 or a 1000

00:06:39.757 --> 00:06:43.666
words but movies might
tell a simpler story.

00:06:43.666 --> 00:06:46.897
So this is an example of
an individual who reports

00:06:46.897 --> 00:06:51.287
low anxiety and they're being
presented with these cues

00:06:51.287 --> 00:06:55.134
of potential, so you see
there's bilateral activity

00:06:55.134 --> 00:06:57.505
in the amygdala with
repeated presentations,

00:06:57.505 --> 00:07:01.311
but then it's like the system
begins to return to baseline

00:07:01.311 --> 00:07:04.078
and it turns blue, that represents

00:07:04.078 --> 00:07:08.018
from the increase going
back down to baseline.

00:07:08.018 --> 00:07:09.488
In contrast, when we look
at an individual with

00:07:09.488 --> 00:07:14.378
high anxiety, we basically see
a similar pattern at first,

00:07:14.378 --> 00:07:17.722
with this bilateral
activation of the amygdala,

00:07:17.722 --> 00:07:21.772
but then it stays up and
it stays up and it stays up

00:07:21.772 --> 00:07:23.603
and it doesn't return to baseline,

00:07:23.603 --> 00:07:26.763
so it's that vigilant state
of anticipation of threat

00:07:26.763 --> 00:07:30.348
and an uncertainty of what
these cues potentially mean.

00:07:30.348 --> 00:07:34.040
So two different paths that
we have taken in trying

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.863
to understand these two very
different neural signatures

00:07:37.863 --> 00:07:41.053
here is to look at
differences in genetic factors

00:07:41.053 --> 00:07:43.979
that may explain this, but in
the interest of the symposium

00:07:43.979 --> 00:07:48.198
today, also in the environment
or experiences that we have.

00:07:48.198 --> 00:07:50.731
So how does early life stress impact

00:07:50.731 --> 00:07:53.173
the development of the circuitry?

00:07:53.173 --> 00:07:58.159
And we have used really an
extreme example of early life

00:07:58.159 --> 00:08:02.731
stress, it is an unfortunate
but a naturally-occurring one

00:08:02.731 --> 00:08:06.187
and that is children who
grow up in the orphanage.

00:08:06.187 --> 00:08:10.781
Now, in the orphanage experience,
all the orphanages vary

00:08:10.781 --> 00:08:15.075
but there's always gonna be
some fragmented caregiving

00:08:15.075 --> 00:08:17.983
because of the high
ratio of so many children

00:08:17.983 --> 00:08:22.197
to a single caregiver, so what
we've been interested in is,

00:08:22.197 --> 00:08:24.847
as these children are adopted
to families in the United

00:08:24.847 --> 00:08:27.455
States, we've been
trying to understand how

00:08:27.455 --> 00:08:30.855
this disregulation of
their needs not being met,

00:08:30.855 --> 00:08:33.310
how there's not attunement
in the child's needs

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:36.121
with what the caregiver can
actually provide to them,

00:08:36.121 --> 00:08:38.888
how that impacts their
ability to regulate self,

00:08:38.888 --> 00:08:40.862
but particularly, today I'll talk about

00:08:40.862 --> 00:08:43.615
how to regulate emotion.

00:08:43.615 --> 00:08:47.782
So again, we use these simple
cues and we ask children

00:08:49.341 --> 00:08:51.589
who have been adopted from
the orphanages as well as

00:08:51.589 --> 00:08:54.390
comparison group who
have not been adopted,

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.780
who live in the United
States, they all have moved,

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:59.046
the adopted children have been
here for at least two years

00:08:59.046 --> 00:09:02.999
to make sure they get
acclimated to their new home

00:09:02.999 --> 00:09:06.216
and their new culture and environment.

00:09:06.216 --> 00:09:10.295
And what we do is we present
these cues of potential threat,

00:09:10.295 --> 00:09:13.135
but in the task, we
tell them, ignore these,

00:09:13.135 --> 00:09:15.924
try not to pay attention
to them, and you find

00:09:15.924 --> 00:09:18.885
in the situations in
which you have these cues,

00:09:18.885 --> 00:09:23.052
relative to situations where
you present a smiling face,

00:09:24.142 --> 00:09:27.302
that the adopted children
are much more lower

00:09:27.302 --> 00:09:29.732
in anticipation of one of them occurring.

00:09:29.732 --> 00:09:31.451
So even if it's a neutral
face on the screen,

00:09:31.451 --> 00:09:33.612
if they know they're about
to see a threatening face,

00:09:33.612 --> 00:09:35.974
they're really hesitant to respond.

00:09:35.974 --> 00:09:38.227
But if it's to a happy
face or smiling face,

00:09:38.227 --> 00:09:40.775
you don't see a difference
between the two groups.

00:09:40.775 --> 00:09:44.416
Now this is paralleled in the
brain by enhanced activity

00:09:44.416 --> 00:09:48.377
in the amygdala, and that's shown here

00:09:48.377 --> 00:09:50.347
on the left and the right side.

00:09:50.347 --> 00:09:53.174
But I think what's important
about these findings is first,

00:09:53.174 --> 00:09:55.908
this is greater activity in
the children who were adopted

00:09:55.908 --> 00:09:59.671
from orphanages abroad relative
to the comparison group,

00:09:59.671 --> 00:10:02.781
the area in blue is actually
more active in the comparison

00:10:02.781 --> 00:10:05.198
group, this is a part of
the brain that's important

00:10:05.198 --> 00:10:07.885
for attention regulation
and emotion regulation

00:10:07.885 --> 00:10:10.873
so one is being able to
regulate their emotions

00:10:10.873 --> 00:10:14.967
and ignore and the other is
quite reactive, that group.

00:10:14.967 --> 00:10:18.100
But more importantly, when
you see images like this

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.923
and you have these neural signatures,

00:10:19.923 --> 00:10:23.802
it is how does that relate
to their actual behavior,

00:10:23.802 --> 00:10:25.841
when you get them outside
of the scanner environment

00:10:25.841 --> 00:10:30.176
or the laboratory, and so
we measured how the behavior

00:10:30.176 --> 00:10:33.600
between caregivers and
their adopted children,

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.055
when they had been separated
briefly and then they were

00:10:36.055 --> 00:10:38.973
reunited, and we looked at
the amount of eye contact

00:10:38.973 --> 00:10:42.929
they had with their caregiver
when they were reunited.

00:10:42.929 --> 00:10:47.096
And basically we see that the
more active the amygdala was,

00:10:48.094 --> 00:10:52.582
the less eye contact they
had with the caregiver.

00:10:52.582 --> 00:10:56.665
Also, the less eye gaze they
actually held on the faces

00:10:56.665 --> 00:11:00.533
that they were presented in
the experiment, as well too.

00:11:00.533 --> 00:11:03.169
Now when we have
naturally-occurring experiments

00:11:03.169 --> 00:11:08.114
such as this, we don't really
have control on pre-existing

00:11:08.114 --> 00:11:11.500
conditions that may be there,
genetic or environmental.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.279
So we've actually turned
to use mouse models

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:18.849
to try to see if we can
control for the genetic

00:11:18.849 --> 00:11:21.785
and environmental confounds
that might otherwise

00:11:21.785 --> 00:11:25.689
explain what we're seeing,
and so we borrowed paradigms

00:11:25.689 --> 00:11:29.338
that had been developed by
individuals like Regina Sullivan

00:11:29.338 --> 00:11:32.715
at NYU and also Tallie Baram at UC Irvine

00:11:32.715 --> 00:11:36.882
to induce sort of a
fragmented caregiving of a dam

00:11:38.785 --> 00:11:43.296
to her pups, and so I wanna
just show you those movies.

00:11:43.296 --> 00:11:46.163
On the top is a dam where
we've taken away the nesting

00:11:46.163 --> 00:11:50.045
material, she has a little
bit but not sufficient,

00:11:50.045 --> 00:11:52.785
so she is running around,
oh this is not in real-time,

00:11:52.785 --> 00:11:56.615
she's a little bit slower than that.

00:11:56.615 --> 00:12:00.877
So basically, I don't even
know if you can see the control

00:12:00.877 --> 00:12:03.612
dam, so she has all the
nesting materials she needs

00:12:03.612 --> 00:12:05.836
and she's spending the
majority of her time grooming

00:12:05.836 --> 00:12:10.003
and feeding, nursing, her pups,
but you can see the mother

00:12:11.148 --> 00:12:13.978
above is trying to pull
together the nesting material

00:12:13.978 --> 00:12:17.837
and sometimes her pups over
to her corner for the nest.

00:12:17.837 --> 00:12:20.660
So basically you're seeing
this fragmented care

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:23.715
because she can't attend to
her pups when she's doing

00:12:23.715 --> 00:12:27.121
other things, which we thought
might, in the slightest way

00:12:27.121 --> 00:12:28.734
mimic some of the fragmented care

00:12:28.734 --> 00:12:31.045
that we see in the orphanages.

00:12:31.045 --> 00:12:34.554
And if you look within a two-hour period,

00:12:34.554 --> 00:12:38.986
you see a significant
difference in the amount of time

00:12:38.986 --> 00:12:42.373
that the dam is spending with her litter

00:12:42.373 --> 00:12:45.535
relative to controls, but
quite frankly, if you look

00:12:45.535 --> 00:12:49.275
across a 24-hour period,
they're spending almost as much

00:12:49.275 --> 00:12:53.107
time with physical contact,
but it's very fragmented

00:12:53.107 --> 00:12:55.691
in that contact, so
there's not that attunement

00:12:55.691 --> 00:12:58.524
between the caregiver and the pup.

00:13:00.224 --> 00:13:03.376
So then if we look at
their ability to regulate

00:13:03.376 --> 00:13:06.425
their emotions, not the
dam, but now her offspring

00:13:06.425 --> 00:13:08.764
who have been given this fragmented care,

00:13:08.764 --> 00:13:12.737
basically what we see,
a paradigm in which,

00:13:12.737 --> 00:13:15.677
we've trained them that a
nozzle will lead to them

00:13:15.677 --> 00:13:18.725
having access to condensed
milk and mice love condensed

00:13:18.725 --> 00:13:23.101
milk and so we put that
nozzle in a novel cage

00:13:23.101 --> 00:13:26.811
with a bright light, where
there's potential threat for mice

00:13:26.811 --> 00:13:29.596
and we see that when we put it there,

00:13:29.596 --> 00:13:33.428
there's a difference between
those mice that grew up

00:13:33.428 --> 00:13:36.977
with a stressed dam relative
to the mice whose dam,

00:13:36.977 --> 00:13:40.094
their mother was not
stressed, and you don't see

00:13:40.094 --> 00:13:42.532
any difference in terms
of how quickly they move

00:13:42.532 --> 00:13:44.861
to the nozzle and their home cage.

00:13:44.861 --> 00:13:47.838
And then if we look at the
brain using C-Fos activity

00:13:47.838 --> 00:13:50.814
as an index, we see
heightened amygdala activity

00:13:50.814 --> 00:13:54.140
in this group relative to the controls,

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.039
and so this gives us a bit more confidence

00:13:57.039 --> 00:14:00.507
that what we're seeing in the
human data that I presented

00:14:00.507 --> 00:14:03.118
is not as much as associated
with maybe pre-existing

00:14:03.118 --> 00:14:07.372
conditions as it is with
the early life stress

00:14:07.372 --> 00:14:10.957
because these parallel quite nicely.

00:14:10.957 --> 00:14:13.990
Now, with the mice,
unlike our human children,

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.716
who are usually adopted by super parents,

00:14:16.716 --> 00:14:19.836
if you do nothing after
that, you see that there is

00:14:19.836 --> 00:14:24.225
persistent effects of
that early life stress,

00:14:24.225 --> 00:14:27.383
so that they're still
showing heightened amygdala

00:14:27.383 --> 00:14:29.892
reactivity in adulthood, even though

00:14:29.892 --> 00:14:33.492
there's continued
development of the circuitry.

00:14:33.492 --> 00:14:36.711
Now this persistent effect
in these mice is somewhat

00:14:36.711 --> 00:14:40.878
reminiscent of work that Nim
Tottenham has done at Columbia

00:14:42.555 --> 00:14:45.225
in collaboration with Dylan
Gee, who's now a colleague

00:14:45.225 --> 00:14:49.206
of mine at Yale University,
and she's actually shown

00:14:49.206 --> 00:14:51.979
that if you look at this
frontal lymbic circuitry,

00:14:51.979 --> 00:14:55.569
that there appears to be something similar

00:14:55.569 --> 00:14:58.761
to a premature closing
of a sensitive period

00:14:58.761 --> 00:15:01.494
of neural development of this circuit,

00:15:01.494 --> 00:15:04.363
such that if you just
look at healthy children,

00:15:04.363 --> 00:15:07.163
what I described before,
there are drastic, significant

00:15:07.163 --> 00:15:10.963
changes from coupling
between the prefrontal cortex

00:15:10.963 --> 00:15:15.068
and it becomes inverse or
negatively-related in adolescence,

00:15:15.068 --> 00:15:18.413
what we see in children who
have grown up in the orphanage

00:15:18.413 --> 00:15:21.404
is you're already seeing
those changes early.

00:15:21.404 --> 00:15:25.048
And so now, Nim is trying to
follow and see just how rigid

00:15:25.048 --> 00:15:28.273
does that make the individual
when they go through

00:15:28.273 --> 00:15:31.551
adolescence, which is an even
more stressful time of life

00:15:31.551 --> 00:15:33.559
in meeting so many challenges,
and I just wanna end

00:15:33.559 --> 00:15:37.726
with one more study, an area
of work that Dr. Tottenham

00:15:38.675 --> 00:15:42.923
is following up on, and that
is showing how important

00:15:42.923 --> 00:15:46.163
the caregiver is, and
so in these experiments

00:15:46.163 --> 00:15:49.116
where we're showing
these very simple stimuli

00:15:49.116 --> 00:15:51.488
in the scanner while we're
taking pictures of the brain

00:15:51.488 --> 00:15:53.425
and watching how they perform games,

00:15:53.425 --> 00:15:57.592
if you simply put a picture
of the face of the caregiver

00:15:59.685 --> 00:16:02.981
along the screen where they're
performing the task and you

00:16:02.981 --> 00:16:06.206
can counter-balance that
with the face of a stranger,

00:16:06.206 --> 00:16:09.573
she sees that that's associated
with decreased activity

00:16:09.573 --> 00:16:12.217
in the amygdala, so it's a
decrease in that emotional

00:16:12.217 --> 00:16:16.384
reactivity, just by having that
parental cue present there.

00:16:17.295 --> 00:16:21.462
And also, there is an
increase, or inverse coupling,

00:16:22.545 --> 00:16:25.835
with the prefrontal cortex that is typical

00:16:25.835 --> 00:16:28.342
more of adulthood, but
we're seeing the parent

00:16:28.342 --> 00:16:31.194
has that ability to help regulate.

00:16:31.194 --> 00:16:35.748
So I hope what I've shown you
or illustrated is just one

00:16:35.748 --> 00:16:38.481
small set of experiments
that are being performed

00:16:38.481 --> 00:16:41.070
where we can show that early life stress

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:45.222
can lead to persistent
changes in brain and behavior,

00:16:45.222 --> 00:16:47.872
particularly in terms
of emotional capacities

00:16:47.872 --> 00:16:51.371
and it highlights, too,
this last bit of work,

00:16:51.371 --> 00:16:54.338
the importance of having
very early interventions

00:16:54.338 --> 00:16:56.705
and also the importance of the caregiver

00:16:56.705 --> 00:16:59.788
in helping to develop a healthy brain

00:17:00.664 --> 00:17:05.301
and also in terms of
enhancing emotional well-being

00:17:05.301 --> 00:17:08.784
now and hopefully forward
for that individual.

00:17:08.784 --> 00:17:12.020
So I just wanna end by
thanking so many individuals

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:14.069
who have come through my
laboratory over the years,

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:17.409
the majority of them fellows
who are stellar stars now

00:17:17.409 --> 00:17:21.017
and to also thank you for your attention.

00:17:21.017 --> 00:17:23.600
(gentle music)
