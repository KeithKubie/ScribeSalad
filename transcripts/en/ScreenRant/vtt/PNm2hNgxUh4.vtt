00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.270
Ryan Gosling – La La Land
Ryan Gosling seems to be on somewhat of a

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.760
hot streak after delivering back to back brilliant
performances in 2016’s The Nice Guys and

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.410
2016’s critical hit La La Land.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.760
Gosling is nominated for the latter film and
it makes sense, as his portrayal of the jazz

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.850
musician was truly moving.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.880
People already knew that the actor could sing
and dance from his childhood as a Mickey Mouse

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.700
club star but fans may not know about the
new skill Gosling picked up for the movie.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.180
Instead of using CGI or a hand double, Ryan
Gosling actually trained himself to become

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.000
a very accomplished jazz pianist for the role.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.650
Apparently, he became so good that co-star
John Legend was actually jealous of his natural

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:27.930
talent.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.650
Comedy, music, drama, it really seems like
there is nothing that Ryan Gosling cannot

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.780
do!

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.550
Casey Affleck – Manchester By The Sea
For most of his career, Casey Affleck has

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.670
primarily been known as the younger brother
of A-list star Ben Affleck.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.660
All of that changed in 2016 when Casey Affleck
delivered an absolutely incredible performance

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.700
in the heart wrenching drama Manchester By
The Sea.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.100
His emotional role, opposite Michelle Williams,
has earned him the Oscar nomination for Best

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.750
Actor, which has thrust Casey into the public
spotlight more than ever before.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.840
People know a lot about his Bostonian past
and his work with his wife’s family but

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.629
something people may not know about Casey
is that he is actually an enormous activist

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:14.629
for animal rights.

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:15.629
For years, the actor has been involved with
PETA and other organizations fighting the

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:16.629
good fight for animal rights.

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:22.280
Just like Leonardo Di Caprio, Casey Affleck’s
great work reaches far beyond the big screen.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.090
Denzel Washington – Fences
Having already taken home two acting Academy

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.349
Awards, it is no surprise to see Denzel Washington
nominated yet again for his outstanding performance

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.530
in the 2016 drama, Fences.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.620
The movie is great but if there is one knock
against it, it is that it seems almost too

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.680
theatrical.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.590
It makes sense, then, to find out that this
film was actually originally a Broadway play

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.209
from 1987.

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.530
The play was then revived in 2010 and can
you guess who played the leading roles on

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.530
stage?

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.609
That’s right, Denzel Washington and Viola
Davis played the leading roles in the theatrical

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.870
version of Fences so it makes sense that after
seven years, and they’ve gotten pretty great

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.030
in the role.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.290
Although Denzel failed to take home the Golden
Globe, we think that he could be a sneaky

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.400
pick to snag the Best Actor honors at the
Academy Awards.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.579
Andrew Garfield – Hacksaw Ridge
2016’s Hacksaw Ridge puts Mel Gibson back

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:18.541
behind the camera and stars Andrew Garfield
as American army Medic Desmond T. Doss, a

00:03:18.541 --> 00:03:23.580
real man who served during the Battle of Okinawa,
refuses to kill people, and became the first

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.530
American to receive the Medal Of Honor without
firing a single shot.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.069
Any time an actor has to portray a real person,
it’s tough, but Garfield delivered a shockingly

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:33.930
deep and complete performance.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.349
When the movie was premiering, the real life
son of Demond T. Doss was in the audience

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.079
and he has told reporters that he was moved
to tears by Garfield’s portrayal of his

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.079
heroic father.

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:47.310
If that’s not a measure of success, we don’t
know what is and we understand why Garfield

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.439
has received such high praise for his performance.

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:55.939
Natalie Portman – Jackie
Natalie Portman has been treating the world

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:59.029
to compelling performances for over two decades
now.

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:03.069
Her career took off when she starred in Leon:
The Professional as a twelve year old and

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.290
her latest role as the titular character in
the Jackie Kennedy Bio-pic proves just how

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.609
well rounded the Academy Award winning actress
really is.

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:14.620
As if all of this success isn’t enough,
fans should know that Natalie Portman is also

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.359
a graduate of Harvard University.

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.460
It’s pretty incredible to think that at
the same time she was starring the Star Wars

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.590
prequels, she was also working on a Psychology
degree from one of the most respect universities

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:25.660
in the world.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.890
Portman never ceases to impress us and we
are excited to see what the actor from Jerusalem

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.230
will do next!

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.030
Damien Chazelle – La La Land
Damien Chazelle has become one of the most

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.220
promising young directors in Hollywood and
it is no surprise that he is nominated for

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.910
his amazing work on 2016’s La La Land.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.440
Unsurprisingly, Chazelle has actually been
working on the film for over six years as

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.950
he first came up with the idea when he was
at Harvard in 2010.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.160
The film is loosely based on his own struggles
to make it as an artist and when he first

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.130
tried to get the movie made, he was met with
serious restrictions and requests.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.250
Chazelle decided to drop the project, as he
did not want to change it in the ways the

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.390
studios wanted.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.220
Then, once his 2014 film, Whiplash, proved
to be a major success, the studios decided

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.510
to give him the green light to make La La
Land the way he wanted.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.470
We have to give it to him for sticking to
his guts and making such a fantastic film!

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.870
Michelle Williams – Manchester By The Sea
At the age of 36, Michelle Williams has already

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.920
racked up a pretty impressive list of great
performances.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.390
From Shutter Island, to My Week With Marilyn
to her incredibly deep performance in 2016’s

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.810
Manchester By The Sea, it’s truly hard to
believe how young the actress is.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.720
What may be even harder to believe, though,
is that it took until this latest movie for

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.340
her to feel like she was actually a good actress.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.680
Williams has told the public that after filming
scenes opposite Casey Affleck she felt like

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.500
she had turned in the first truly great days
of acting in her career.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.050
We hope she is just being modest as Williams
has been nominated and awarded for a variety

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.750
of roles over the years.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.590
Regardless of her own self confidence, we
can vouch that her performance in Manchester

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.470
By The Sea is not to be missed.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.560
Viola Davis – Fences
Whether it is on her hit show How To Get Away

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.190
With Murder or her moving speech honoring
Meryl Streep, Viola Davis brings quality to

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:12.300
everything she does.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.680
It’s no surprise then to see her nominated
for her amazing performance opposite Denzel

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.500
Washington in Fences.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.710
What is surprising to some people, however,
is that her role is nominated for Best Supporting

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.870
Actress and not Best Actress.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:29.400
Apparently, director and co-star Denzel Washington
disagrees with this placement but it turns

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.960
out that it was actually Viola’s decision
as she felt that it would give her a better

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:39.270
chance of winning if she campaigned her performance
in the supporting category.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.530
Jeff Bridges – Hell Or High Water
Hell Or High Water is one of the most criminally

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.160
underappreciated films of 2016 as it is stuffed
full of great performances, storytelling and

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.160
cinematography.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.680
The films stars Ben Foster and Chris Pine,
but the real stand out performance came from

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:58.060
Academy Award winning actors Jeff Bridges.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.420
Bridges brings a certain mix of fun and gravitas
to every role he has ever done and that’s

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.780
definitely one of the reasons he has become
a bankable fan favorite.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:13.720
But fans may not know just how talented Bridges
really is as the actor also has a pretty prominent

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:23.960
singing career as well and his songs could
easily pop up on any country music channel!

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.520
Emma Stone – La La Land
Emma Stone has really come a long way from

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:33.060
playing the quirky hot chick in movies like
Superbad and Easy A, to garnering multiple

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.470
Oscar nominations for her roles in Birdman
and La La Land.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:41.930
Emma Stone is fantastic in 2016’s musical
hit La La Land and she does a great job of

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:44.680
keeping up with the extremely talented Ryan
Gosling.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.750
While many of the big numbers were recorded
in post, Emma Stone has let it be known that

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:52.740
her more intimate numbers, Like “Audition”
and “City Of Stars”, were actually recorded

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.150
live as to preserve a feeling of raw authenticity.

00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:00.560
It definitely worked out well as those songs
are some of the best moments in the film.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.740
We like Emma Stone’s chances to take home
the Oscar and we are wondering if Emma Watson

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:08.860
is regretting passing on the role, as she
was offered it first.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:13.080
So there you have it, there is our list of
10 shocking secrets from this years Oscar

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.080
Nominees.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.000
Who do you think will win each category?

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:23.740
What do you think were the biggest snubs of
