1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,090
G O K you there?

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,540
[inaudible]. Hello? Okay,
there you are. I'm Jad Abumrad.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,960
I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab.
Yes sir. And so, okay,

4
00:00:12,961 --> 00:00:15,450
we're going to continue with
one more episode from a,

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,360
from the series on erased what
you did for somebody else,

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,410
but here it was kind of for somebody
else but also for us at the same time.

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,950
Uh, it all was kind of
squishy to be honest.

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,610
So I've produced a four part series
along with, uh, focus features,

9
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,100
stitcher and limited house. Uh,

10
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:36,030
that was about the history of conversion
therapy in America. That's, uh,

11
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,200
people who are gay, who are being pushed
to or asked to or want to be straight.

12
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:42,960
Yes. And sometimes it's a
therapy type situation. Sciencey.

13
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:46,350
Sometimes it's a church type situation.
Here's the, here's a funny thing,

14
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,520
Robert. You would think it's kind of, uh,

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,760
you would think it doesn't happen
a lot, right? These days? Nothing,

16
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,490
certainly less, certainly
less than before. Well, uh,

17
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:02,250
there was a survey done recently
by, uh, by a group at UCLA,

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,340
uh, at the Williams institute in
conjunction with Gallup, Gallup polling.

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,260
They did a survey that looked at,

20
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,890
of the people in America
who identify as LGBTQ,

21
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:14,640
which is about 4.5%
roughly 13 million people.

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,480
How many of those people have gone
through something like conversion therapy?

23
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,980
And the number was completely
shocking to me. Ooh,

24
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,480
shockingly small. Shocking, well shocked.

25
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:31,730
Almost 700,000 people in the
1970s and eighties and so on.

26
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,860
Yeah, I mean, but also
recently, like recently,

27
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:38,340
this was a survey has done in 2012 and I
just want to give you a sense of scale.

28
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,950
Okay. 700,000 people,

29
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,430
that is the equivalent
of the city of Boston.

30
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,550
That's the number of
people we're talking about.

31
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,120
That's a lot of freaking
people. Now, to your question,

32
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,620
you would think it would
be mostly older folks? Yes.

33
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,320
From the days when it was an abomination
and dow no longer really from any

34
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:05,160
family? No. It was actually equally
prevalent in all age groups. I mean,

35
00:02:05,161 --> 00:02:08,940
the survey found that just as
many young people, you know,

36
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:13,941
teens were being put through these
kinds of programs as people of older

37
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:19,200
generations. That is surprising.
The prevalence wasn't going down.

38
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,180
Um, you know, if anything
like just as LGBTQ, uh,

39
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,330
people are being embraced
in the wider culture,

40
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:32,070
there has been a kind of silent reentry
judgement in certain communities in

41
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:32,904
America.

42
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,790
And so that was part of the whole reason
to do this project is that there's this

43
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:39,450
thing happening that we're not really
looking at and it's got a whole history to

44
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:44,400
it. It's troubling, but also
kind of fascinating. So, uh,

45
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:49,350
I want to play the final episode in the
four part series and it deals with, um,

46
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:55,440
well it deals with one of the
central guys in that history.

47
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,800
This main character that
you found, this is a really

48
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,050
complex fellow. Yes. You turn
this thing on and you think,

49
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:13,290
no. Well, well he, oh hmm. And then,

50
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,860
I don't know, I don't know what your
face will look like at the end of this.

51
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,430
Yes. So, um, let's just say a few
things before we start this. Uh,

52
00:03:20,431 --> 00:03:24,060
this whole project was done in conjunction
with the focus features film boy

53
00:03:24,061 --> 00:03:25,380
erased, which is out now.

54
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,240
And that film was based on a wonderful
memoir by a guy named Garrett Conley.

55
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,040
And this story was the
story everybody told us.

56
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:38,220
We had to tell if we were going to do
a series about conversion therapy in

57
00:03:38,221 --> 00:03:41,890
America, and it's about
a guy named Smith. Yes.

58
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,080
[inaudible]

59
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,830
news cameras started showing

60
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:54,550
bullhorns came out and all of
a sudden I heard John Smith,

61
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,210
we know you're in there.

62
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:58,550
[inaudible]

63
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:03,230
John Smith, we know you're
here. It was as though a torpedo

64
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,650
had just hit the side of our ship.

65
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,340
The ship that John Smith
captained before it was torpedoed.

66
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,070
What's the largest ex
gay ministry in America

67
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:19,210
called Love in action? 11 action

68
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,500
for almost 25 years from 1994 2008 if
you were an evangelical Christian who had

69
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:29,590
a gay son or daughter and you
wanted to convert them to straight,

70
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:35,220
you might've sent them to John for maybe
$7,000 he would run them through his

71
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:39,100
program and I want to, I want you
to tell him how affected he is.

72
00:04:39,101 --> 00:04:42,430
The guy in boy erased the
torments Garrett County.

73
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,130
Tell him how you hate him for the things
that he's the way he, you sit down,

74
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,650
sit down, but I'm not angry and and
and yeah, no things that upset you.

75
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,070
Are you just letting me down here
and you die? Do I have to be angry?

76
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:00,110
I don't like my life to be painted as
a villain and that's kind of the way I

77
00:05:00,111 --> 00:05:05,000
feel about this movie. It's like I
don't like it. It's uncomfortable.

78
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,820
I don't like the movie.
I don't like the book.

79
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:12,680
I don't like what people are saying. I
don't like hearing Garrett talk about it.

80
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,940
I don't like it. It's
uncomfortable. At the same time,

81
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:22,270
there is truth in that I was a foreigner
and a spokesperson and a national and

82
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:29,240
international leader that said, you must
eradicate homosexuality from your life.

83
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:34,460
That's just the price these days.

84
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,500
John Smit is living a very different life.

85
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:40,100
My life has been reinvented
several times. Majorly reinvented.

86
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,680
He now lives in Paris, Texas
with his husband Larry,

87
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,310
and he makes furniture
is this way. Yeah. Okay.

88
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,010
Producer shemale [inaudible]
and I paid him a visit. Well,

89
00:05:52,011 --> 00:05:56,360
we're going into my workshop, which
is a off the corner of our house.

90
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,640
John and Larry live in a tiny one story
house bordering an enormous horse farm.

91
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,340
So what you see as we walked to
the garage, out of his house,

92
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,320
into the garage is rolling
hills in one direction. Epic,

93
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:12,320
Texas, flatlands and another
and a sky that is so big,

94
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:15,700
it kind of hurts your head to shop itself
as is it in here with the cars? It's,

95
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,770
it's a divided shop. The
cars are in the next space.

96
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,720
John also collects and restores
old cars. Oh Wow. Look at this.

97
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,580
I'm, I'm a person that uses
every scrap that I can.

98
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,780
I have a lot of used wood,

99
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:33,590
old wood like over there as a whole
bunch of these days. Uh, what he does,

100
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,990
instead of trying to
eradicate homosexuality,

101
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,030
John will spend his days taking, uh,

102
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,600
old copies of Reader's digest books and

103
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,910
carving them into the
letters of the alphabet.

104
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,810
This large band saw a really
cuts a nice refined edge.

105
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,370
There's no frayed edges

106
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,830
or a heel. Also, and I'm
going to router these out.

107
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,013
[inaudible]

108
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,960
carpentry work for local designers. I
know he'll make a calling. Paint it white.

109
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,653
Yeah.

110
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,240
When you're making something, what are
you thinking about it? Most of the time

111
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:25,390
I'm, I'm thinking about relationships.
I'm thinking about life,

112
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,170
people, history, future.

113
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:36,040
A lot of times it's processing painful
things, you know, difficult things.

114
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:51,000
How to think about John Smith
is a difficult question.

115
00:07:51,001 --> 00:07:55,920
He is undeniably warm and funny and
honest and engaging at the same time.

116
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,550
Many people told us before
we came, don't forget,

117
00:07:59,551 --> 00:08:02,850
this is a guy who ran a program, uh,

118
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,270
where people in the program
tried to commit suicide

119
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,840
and in some cases succeeded

120
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,090
and now that he's out himself and married
to man and vehemently opposed to the

121
00:08:16,091 --> 00:08:20,440
whole idea of conversion therapy.
It does beg the question,

122
00:08:20,441 --> 00:08:21,970
what do we do with that past?

123
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:29,910
How should we think about it?
Is He allowed to just move on?

124
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:37,180
Where'd you grow up? I was
raised in Omaha, Nebraska.

125
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:44,010
It was 1959 life was the
fifties life was good.

126
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,810
All the moms walked up and down the
street in their shirtwaist dresses and had

127
00:08:48,811 --> 00:08:50,040
coffee with each other. I mean,

128
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:55,041
it was a stereotypical 1950s suburban
neighborhood experience and I remember

129
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,810
feeling, um, at five,

130
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:05,811
I remember sitting back in our backyard
on a summer morning school was out

131
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,890
sitting in to play sandbox
and feeling the warm sun.

132
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,280
And I remember just feeling, life's good.

133
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:17,360
[inaudible]

134
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,530
I was so at peace

135
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,063
[inaudible]

136
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,470
it was this one moment of calm. He says,

137
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,080
where he didn't have to
worry about who he was

138
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,460
[inaudible]

139
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:35,460
now the story as it goes from here of
John becoming and then unbecoming the

140
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,810
Elvis of the ex gay movement is
complicated to say the least.

141
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,750
You could start the story
in the fourth grade.

142
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:49,990
I remember in fourth grade having
an emotional affair with Steve.

143
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:54,920
I wanted to carry his books. He had a
broken arm. I wanted to hold his hand.

144
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,030
Of course I was a gay boy,

145
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,750
but I didn't know how to work that
through or what does a little boy in that

146
00:09:59,751 --> 00:10:01,850
situation say to himself.
I didn't have words.

147
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,210
Then there was fifth grade for the first
time in school gets a male teacher.

148
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,360
All my teachers were females and all
of a sudden we had this male teacher.

149
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:11,390
I remember just, I just fantasizing,

150
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,730
just looking at him being drawn to
him, being attracted to his maleness,

151
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,470
not knowing what to do with that.

152
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:24,180
Jumping forward a bit dated several girls
in high school ends up marrying a girl

153
00:10:24,181 --> 00:10:25,980
named Chris. How old
were you at this point?

154
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:30,720
I was 1716 like him. She
had a tough family life,

155
00:10:30,721 --> 00:10:32,820
alcoholic father. Parents are divorced,

156
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:37,080
felt like they just kind of got each
other and we created two children and then

157
00:10:37,081 --> 00:10:42,081
you get to the first in a series of
violent shifts in John's midlife.

158
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:46,130
Many years later when he was like firmly
embedded in the ex gay movement and a

159
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,800
preaching against homosexuality,

160
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,490
he would give a sermon that sort
of talked about this moment.

161
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,740
I just want to share a little bit about
my personal story so you know who I am

162
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:55,730
and where I'm coming from.

163
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,380
He describes as being 23
newly married with kids,

164
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,530
homosexual and then
falling into this funk,

165
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,070
like suddenly being very uncertain
about his marriage, about the future.

166
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,890
At the time he was working at
a department store and, uh,

167
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,110
he meets a guy named Leonard.

168
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,530
He called me one night and we
wonder, you know, it's funny how,

169
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,980
how the enemy works in our
lives and you works in those,

170
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,660
those intimate times
of darkness of secrecy.

171
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,180
It's not in the light.
It's not above board.

172
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:27,260
It's always somewhere sinister that
he sneaks in. And one Friday night,

173
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,800
nine 30 at night, my wife was bowling.
I was taking care of the kids.

174
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,560
Leonard called me, Hey
John, I'm at the bar. Um,

175
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,240
why don't you come over and we can talk.

176
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:39,380
Well now he had strategically placed
himself at a bar right across the street

177
00:11:39,381 --> 00:11:40,900
from where I lived. And, uh,

178
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:45,410
I found out later that he was already
surmising what I was looking for,

179
00:11:45,411 --> 00:11:48,110
what I was curious about,
where I was headed in his mind.

180
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,610
I want to cross the street.

181
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:54,250
That evening ended up in a very
mutually seductive homosexual encounter.

182
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,390
Uh, I came home from that
four o'clock in the morning,

183
00:11:58,391 --> 00:12:02,940
which is again something I never did. I
never, ever went out and stayed out. Um,

184
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,790
of course my wife wasn't stupid. She
knew that. Why was he out so late?

185
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,910
What was going on? So she began
to ask me questions, what went on,

186
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,930
and I immediately went to her and
I said, uh, Chris, I'm a, I'm gay.

187
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:20,170
Do you see how quick that identity
got stuck? I had one sexual encounter,

188
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,550
one outside of marital sex,

189
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:28,930
which was the only other experience I'd
ever had sexually. One sexual encounter.

190
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,010
And I'm signed, sealed, delivered.
I'm gay and I want a divorce.

191
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,710
Well, what do you think
when you hear that? Now?

192
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:41,060
My first thought was my verbiage and the
way I described that story and the way

193
00:12:41,671 --> 00:12:44,340
I would describe it diff today
would be so violently different.

194
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,730
Those terms were inflammatory. I mean, I,

195
00:12:47,731 --> 00:12:52,731
I filtered that story through
my theology at that time.

196
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,080
I walked away from that marriage,

197
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:01,880
abandoned my children in homosexual
adultery and dove into head long,

198
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:06,320
full force, the homosexual subculture.
I lived in a gay apartment building,

199
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,420
frequented gay businesses. Um,

200
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,010
anyone who wasn't familiar with
or didn't like my homosexuality,

201
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,840
I just crossed them off the list

202
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,250
in a later a TV interview.

203
00:13:17,251 --> 00:13:22,251
John would say that during this period
he even became the guy so that a young

204
00:13:22,441 --> 00:13:26,040
gay men who are new in town would
call to sort of get initiated.

205
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,490
I had taken people to the gay
bars for their first time.

206
00:13:29,491 --> 00:13:32,660
I was instrumental in helping people
involve themselves in that lifestyle.

207
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,380
So for years I lived in that lifestyle,

208
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:38,730
four years of active pursuit and
all along thinking in my head,

209
00:13:38,731 --> 00:13:43,320
I'm looking for monogamy, I'm
looking for a life partner.

210
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,250
I'm looking for that one person that can
satisfy all my needs and never let me

211
00:13:47,251 --> 00:13:48,050
down.

212
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:48,883
What makes, uh,

213
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:54,070
John's backstory so interesting and also
difficult to wrap your head around or

214
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:58,760
these wildly different poles that he
travels between in one life? I mean,

215
00:13:58,761 --> 00:14:02,060
he starts off living the sort of
50s American suburban Dream Wife.

216
00:14:02,061 --> 00:14:05,420
Two kids swings into the gay
subculture as he calls it.

217
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,580
And then as he puts it,

218
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:11,360
what happened was he started
to get his heartbroken a lot.

219
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:15,430
The first guy that I
lived with, I mean I just,

220
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:20,050
I just really loved him as a
20 something year old can. Um,

221
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,810
he came home one day and he
says, I can't be with you.

222
00:14:22,811 --> 00:14:25,880
I'm a size queen and you
don't measure up. Hmm,

223
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,020
okay. I basically told them, you're
not enough of a man down there for me.

224
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:33,760
That was a shocking, deeply,
deeply wounding moment.

225
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,750
He says he struggled with his confidence
and he got into a series of, of,

226
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,790
of very bad dysfunctional relationships
develop and began to feel like something

227
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:43,624
was wrong with him.

228
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:44,080
And,

229
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:49,080
and it was at that point with this four
year experience in the gay culture where

230
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:53,870
a girl I with at the time, he was
working for the railroad as a clerk.

231
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,640
She was an ever gelical Christian,

232
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,120
started talking with me about Jesus in
the Bible and she was very open about her

233
00:15:01,251 --> 00:15:03,830
own struggles, very vulnerable with me.

234
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:07,940
And she invited me to church
and kept inviting me to church.

235
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,340
And eventually I went

236
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,050
[inaudible]

237
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,210
it was a Christian revival,
this church service,

238
00:15:18,211 --> 00:15:20,760
this is the kind where people speak in
tongues. Talk about the devil a lot.

239
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:25,050
So I went and sure enough I was sitting
in the Pew and this guy was speaking and

240
00:15:25,051 --> 00:15:28,350
I don't know what the heck he's talking
about because God was too busy speaking

241
00:15:28,351 --> 00:15:31,890
to me personally and I was sitting
back in this pew and I'll never forget,

242
00:15:31,891 --> 00:15:33,390
God said, John,

243
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,360
you don't have to live
this way any longer.

244
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:40,973
No.

245
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,480
What was it t that, I mean

246
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,350
t w this is always the hardest John.
Like what? Both stories, how's he,

247
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,390
how does it explain that moment now?

248
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,720
Because everything that follows
really flows from that moment

249
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,960
as honest as I can be about it because
I don't really understand it myself

250
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,690
either. But as much as I can process it,

251
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:09,750
it was built on the hope
of not the experience of,

252
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,330
he told me later that, you
know the conversion moment,

253
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:16,490
that God's voice in his
head that he can't explain,

254
00:16:16,491 --> 00:16:21,491
but all the moments after suddenly having
this whole new belief system reframed

255
00:16:21,891 --> 00:16:24,620
everything. First of all, he was reborn.

256
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,860
So literally everything before
that point was no longer important.

257
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:31,580
It was only about what comes after.
And also he now had this book,

258
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,640
which seemed to say that the
way he just was was a sin,

259
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,010
which you would think you
wouldn't want to hear.

260
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:42,280
But he said it was actually a relief to
hear that because he could now take all

261
00:16:42,771 --> 00:16:47,510
of those really hard questions about
himself and who he was as a man,

262
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,590
and he can now put it into a box
called sin and say to Himself, oh,

263
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:56,870
that's why I was feeling so bad
because I was committing sin.

264
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,000
It was what I was doing. It's not
necessarily who I am. It was my behavior.

265
00:17:02,001 --> 00:17:03,980
And that can change.

266
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,790
I believed that all this pain,

267
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:13,060
Jesus could heal and he
could bring meaning and sense
and comfort and peace into

268
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:16,274
my life.

269
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,040
And so in, uh, another violent shift,

270
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:23,990
John Smith becomes really only one of
two people I've ever heard of to come out

271
00:17:23,991 --> 00:17:28,080
of the closet and then go back in. And
so this past starts to go into this

272
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,230
church regularly. I felt free.

273
00:17:30,231 --> 00:17:34,130
I felt liberated telling them about your
clown ministry. Yeah, I was a clown.

274
00:17:34,131 --> 00:17:37,130
I became a clown. You
were a clown. Yes. Um,

275
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:41,400
I was rainbow the clown and we, we love
how you say that. So matter of fact.

276
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:44,420
Yeah. Well we were, we were trained and
we went through clown school. Was it,

277
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,750
was it you was a, you were a
Christian clown? Yes, and my,

278
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,310
my clown stick was I would walk in
with an umbrella because I was high.

279
00:17:51,311 --> 00:17:54,510
I was underneath the clouds
of life and the rain and my,

280
00:17:54,511 --> 00:17:56,820
I had a trick umbrella
that when I would shake it,

281
00:17:56,821 --> 00:18:00,960
you would fall and it put it down in the
rainbow would come out the promises of

282
00:18:00,961 --> 00:18:02,670
God's future. It was my testimony,

283
00:18:02,671 --> 00:18:06,870
kind of a story of how I came out from
under the rain clouds and found the sun.

284
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:12,420
No, I made all the wigs for the clowns
and I made the props and it was really a

285
00:18:12,421 --> 00:18:17,421
significant two and a half years of my
life when I didn't have any outside.

286
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:20,290
Yeah. Pressures. He says it was a little
bit like that moment when he was four.

287
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:23,230
He was totally at peace,
super happy. But then

288
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,460
he starts getting lonely
and I needed a companion.

289
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,820
So I dated a couple of girls
and those things didn't succeed.

290
00:18:30,821 --> 00:18:34,990
And finally I met Valene and we started
kind of dating and I felt like you said

291
00:18:34,991 --> 00:18:38,020
initially things were going well and
he felt like, oh, maybe I can change,

292
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,730
maybe I have. But then as he
describes it, that funk returned,

293
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:45,860
uh,

294
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,040
like those old feelings. But
even more unspoken than that,

295
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,340
that's just a kind of panic would
come up. And I started feeling really,

296
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:53,270
really scared.

297
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:55,450
Um,

298
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,220
while I was in that place

299
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:04,640
today on family them I
heard a radio program.

300
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,390
Welcome everyone to this edition of
family talk, focus on the family,

301
00:19:08,391 --> 00:19:10,420
James Dobson. James Dobson, by the way,

302
00:19:10,421 --> 00:19:14,410
is maybe one of the most influential
evangelical voices of the last 50 years.

303
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:17,410
It's a hugely popular radio show today.

304
00:19:17,411 --> 00:19:20,590
We're addressing the tough
subject of same sex attraction,

305
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,730
which affects millions of people and
their families and the guest on the guest

306
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:26,800
on the radio program as Barbara Johnson.

307
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,630
So when I learned that he was homosexual,

308
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,910
I thought this couldn't happen
to Christian families. I mean,

309
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:34,660
Barbara Johnson was a mom of a gay
son. And at the end of that program,

310
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,930
homosexual feelings can and do dissipate.

311
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:41,890
And they offered information sheets
on ex gay ministry. John's has,

312
00:19:41,891 --> 00:19:45,070
they basically said for all of you who
are struggling with same sex feelings,

313
00:19:45,071 --> 00:19:47,440
there is a program out
there. They can help you.

314
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:50,710
First time I'd ever heard gay anything
in the context of Christian anything.

315
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,490
So I said, focus on the family a
letter. And to make a long story short,

316
00:19:54,491 --> 00:19:59,491
he ends up getting connected with the
guy who many people sort of believe to be

317
00:19:59,921 --> 00:20:03,940
the father, the spiritual godfather
of the ex gay movement, very hard.

318
00:20:03,941 --> 00:20:07,990
And I had just given up on the church.
We talked about him a bit in episode one.

319
00:20:07,991 --> 00:20:12,130
Like John Frank Worthen was a
guy who had been in the closet,

320
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:15,850
come out of the closet, but then, uh,
at a low point heard a voice from God.

321
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,080
Yeah,

322
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,960
I heard God say, I want your back.

323
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,260
And you went back in the closet.

324
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,320
This was 1973.

325
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,383
I know,

326
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,460
right in the middle of a Jesus movement.

327
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,830
Frank starts going to church
and after service, one day

328
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:31,803
after church,

329
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:36,670
three young men came to visit me and
they were all gay and they said, uh,

330
00:20:36,671 --> 00:20:39,450
I heard you made a
recommitment to Christ at,

331
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:42,880
you're leaving the gay lifestyle
and we would like to leave it too.

332
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:48,130
And so that kind of, you know, within
three days we a little group going

333
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,620
as frank Worthen tells it.

334
00:20:50,621 --> 00:20:54,370
That's how the x game movement began
casually when they, after church,

335
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,530
while the members named
it love and action,

336
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:01,620
we did feel that it was God's answer to
the APA saying homosexuality is normal

337
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,270
and god is saying not really.

338
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:11,680
What he's referring to there is sort
of the beginning of the scientific

339
00:21:11,681 --> 00:21:15,370
community washing their hands.
The whole idea of the gay cure,

340
00:21:15,371 --> 00:21:17,650
which we talked about in the last
episode, they're not Christian.

341
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:20,050
They don't know what they're saying.
John says at the time that's,

342
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,770
that really spooked a lot of evangelicals.

343
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:26,020
This scientific communities were accepting
homosexuality and they were saying

344
00:21:26,021 --> 00:21:27,700
that it's not a disorder anymore.

345
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,540
They were removing it from the DSM three
which is why we need to do what we're

346
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:34,540
doing. So it was very explicit
in your mindset? Oh yeah.

347
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:38,640
In any case, John and frank [inaudible]
and Frank's wife and Nita Worthen,

348
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,600
they started corresponding and I said
I was capable, I was trustworthy.

349
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:46,230
They could count on me. Can
you help me? What do you have?

350
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,760
And so Anita called me, she says,

351
00:21:47,761 --> 00:21:51,810
we are hiring a house leader
for one of our houses.

352
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,220
We want to know if you want to apply
for it. So John goes out to San Rafael,

353
00:21:56,221 --> 00:22:01,221
California and I volunteered for 11
action and so begins a very bizarre,

354
00:22:02,191 --> 00:22:07,191
very dramatic 25 year odyssey to try
and stamp out homosexuality in Christian

355
00:22:08,071 --> 00:22:10,500
men everywhere and especially in himself.

356
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:15,750
That's after the break on a race. We'll
continue on radio lab and just a model.

357
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,560

Hey, I'm Chad up and rod. I'm Robert
Krulwich. This is Radiolab. Yes,

373
00:23:27,871 --> 00:23:30,960
and we're listening to episode four of
an erased on radio lab and let's get back

374
00:23:30,961 --> 00:23:33,390
to the story of John Smith.
At this point in the story,

375
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:38,280
John is searching for a way to rid
himself of gay attractions and to make

376
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:40,050
himself attracted to his wife,

377
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,690
his second wife because he does
end up marrying a second time.

378
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,040
He goes to San Rafael,
California to volunteer for

379
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:50,570
a new ministry run by frank and Anita
Worthen that promises a solution.

380
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,680
They loved me. I was became an office
manager. I managed all kinds of stuff.

381
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:57,470
I became senior house manager.
Fast forward a couple of years,

382
00:23:57,471 --> 00:24:00,740
frank worth and decides to go to the
Philippines on sort of a missionary trip

383
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,650
and John takes over the ministry

384
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:06,973
[inaudible]

385
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,060
so when he left,

386
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,050
clearly redecorated, moved everything
around, changed everything.

387
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:12,973
I'm an elected.

388
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,103
Yeah, I mean

389
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,810
the moment frank flew out, which
was a symbol of this is now mine,

390
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:24,930
and here's where John's story morphs
into something quite different,

391
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:30,180
something much bigger and maybe darker
than just one man's journey towards

392
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:34,290
accepting who he is. As John
tells it, the moment he showed up,

393
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,090
11 action caught a win.

394
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,850
Los Angeles, welcome to Larry King Live.

395
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,420
I went on the Larry King Live
program six months after I got there,

396
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,960
which is insane. You started
appearing on various talk shows.

397
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:51,130
Homosexuality from my
experience get stemmed out of
a need to know I was okay as

398
00:24:51,131 --> 00:24:53,380
a man. And he very quickly
realized [inaudible]

399
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,290
his story was like rocket fuel.

400
00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:00,320
I had a phenomenal, miraculous testimony.

401
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:01,510
This is him and a phone in here.

402
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,290
I mean,

403
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:07,290
I was one of those people who had a
dramatic transformation from where I was.

404
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:13,710
One day I'm sleeping with my gay partner
and the next day I'm 100% sold out to

405
00:25:14,621 --> 00:25:16,180
God, committed, faithful.

406
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:20,410
So people saw my life as
the dark versus the light.

407
00:25:20,411 --> 00:25:23,080
It was almost like Saint
Paul on the road to Damascus.

408
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:23,691
He says,

409
00:25:23,691 --> 00:25:26,690
people would come up to them at Christian
conferences and say that they were

410
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:30,380
actually jealous of him. And once
he saw the power in his own story,

411
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:34,050
we became much more
extroverted as a ministry.

412
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,270
And perhaps as a result,

413
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:39,620
love and action started to gain converts
by the week to the point where they

414
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,950
could no longer fit in the small
church in San Rafael. And so

415
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:49,320
around 1994 they go off in search of
a bigger church. We'd go to Memphis

416
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:52,930
[inaudible]

417
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:57,280
in Memphis, Tennessee. So we go to
Memphis, big church, large community,

418
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,930
they hire staff. At this point,

419
00:25:58,931 --> 00:26:03,430
John is flying high and love and action
was advertising the staggering success

420
00:26:03,431 --> 00:26:06,070
rates. This is something that we
heard from Jared Conley. My mom says,

421
00:26:06,071 --> 00:26:11,071
they said there was an 87% success rate
of conversion from gay to straight.

422
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,150
I internally underneath that all
while I couldn't verbalize it,

423
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,790
I had to admit somewhere in me
that we were not seeing success.

424
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:26,420
We were not winning. They were
successful. Why? They were in the program.

425
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:31,190
As soon as they'd leave, boom, they
had fallen. I knew it wasn't working,

426
00:26:31,191 --> 00:26:32,690
but I couldn't admit that.

427
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:37,340
So the only way I could acknowledge that
would be to adopt something new that

428
00:26:37,341 --> 00:26:40,160
might work better. So
when he got to Memphis,

429
00:26:40,161 --> 00:26:44,460
he decided to go a totally different
route. He figured if people were quote,

430
00:26:44,461 --> 00:26:46,320
relapsing, which they were,

431
00:26:46,321 --> 00:26:50,320
let me draw inspiration
from other modalities, uh,

432
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,190
that also have to deal with the
problem of people relapsing.

433
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:57,300
And so he ended up visiting a
local drug and Rehab Center.

434
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:01,200
It's called second chance. It's a
drug and alcohol rehab for teenagers.

435
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,700
Wonderful success rates.

436
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:05,850
So we all talked about it as a
staff and we sat down and we said,

437
00:27:05,851 --> 00:27:08,040
we really think they
have something valuable.

438
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,070
We adopted their philosophy.

439
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,930
They decided they would
define homosexuality.
Homosexuality is an addiction,

440
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,690
and maybe they could just treat
it with something like 12 step.

441
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,720
The 12 steps seemingly were the the best
way to rid people of drug and alcohol

442
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:28,410
abuse and had a track record. And
I'm thinking, well, maybe that'll,

443
00:27:28,411 --> 00:27:30,420
if homosexuality is an addiction,

444
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:35,600
we need to remove the homosexual drug
long enough for these people to detox from

445
00:27:38,311 --> 00:27:39,144
it.

446
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:45,680
So starting in 1994 and going through
his whole 14 year stint at the Memphis

447
00:27:45,681 --> 00:27:49,610
clinic, John Basically implemented
a system where young men,

448
00:27:49,611 --> 00:27:50,570
women would come in,

449
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:55,490
anything that they had that could
be remotely construed as homosexual,

450
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,440
which we called [inaudible] false
images. They're homosexual. Look,

451
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:04,610
they're homosexual books. They're
homosexual concepts, friends, people,

452
00:28:04,611 --> 00:28:05,570
associations,

453
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:10,660
drug and alcohol recovery centers have
seen these things as contraband and it

454
00:28:11,061 --> 00:28:13,970
has to be removed. They
can't come here with that.

455
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,160
They have to be separated from it.

456
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:19,910
So they can think without it because
it's their coping mechanisms.

457
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,380
It's their addiction.

458
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:26,420
After they were then separated from their
homosexual paraphernalia or what have

459
00:28:26,421 --> 00:28:30,200
you, clients would then go through,
you know, endless rounds of

460
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,810
pseudoscientific talk therapy

461
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:38,040
and so it became this elaborate 12 step
program where we had to write down every

462
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:45,660
week three different sexual experiences
that we had in our lifetime and do a

463
00:28:46,661 --> 00:28:50,920
moral inventory about each
one. This is Peterson Tescano.

464
00:28:50,921 --> 00:28:54,190
We heard a bit from him in
episode one he did two stints,

465
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:59,170
11 actual sexual experience would be well
beyond just physically having sex with

466
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:02,890
someone, but a fantasy and
obsession over someone,

467
00:29:02,891 --> 00:29:07,891
a romantic crush that you had an encounter
you may have had with an inanimate

468
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:09,910
object. They use this very,

469
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,720
this very like strange language to talk
about this stuff and some of it was

470
00:29:16,181 --> 00:29:19,270
like, what are you talking about? And
they were like, you know, you know,

471
00:29:19,271 --> 00:29:23,500
did you ever use shaving cream when you
masturbated over? Like I was like, no,

472
00:29:23,501 --> 00:29:25,570
but now I'm thinking of
that. Thank you for that.

473
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:32,170
If you're writing about these really
intense sexual encounters and it becomes

474
00:29:32,171 --> 00:29:37,060
like a butterfly with pins in
it that you're splayed out in,

475
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,630
you're analyzing it and dissecting
it and tearing it apart.

476
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,070
Peterson also told us

477
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,170
that there were times when this,

478
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:48,100
these kinds of techniques tipped
into just abject cruelty. Uh,

479
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:52,360
sometimes they would be asked to confess
some of these stories directly to

480
00:29:52,361 --> 00:29:54,220
parents on friends and family at night.

481
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:58,290
He told us about a mock funeral that
was staged for a young man named Aaron

482
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:58,890
Opera. Lee Peterson

483
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:02,310
remembers candles. I'm not
sure if I remember that or
not, but maybe there were.

484
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:07,100
It's one of these pretty traumatic things
that I didn't really ever really want

485
00:30:07,101 --> 00:30:08,640
to bring back to the light.

486
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:12,210
This is Aaron. We called them up. He
says he is okay talking about it now,

487
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,150
especially since it's a
scene in the boy erased film.

488
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,980
But essentially what
happened is that Aaron had,

489
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,580
I guess, relapsed or fallen or whatever
with someone outside of the program,

490
00:30:20,581 --> 00:30:23,910
I guess is how they stated it. So
they asked him to lie on a table,

491
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,620
close his eyes. They brought in,

492
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,130
they had some pretty gaudy
flowers in their office. I mean,

493
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,830
John Smith is probably going
to laugh at me for saying that,

494
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:35,040
but I did not like the flower
arrangements. But anyway. Um,

495
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,960
but I do know that I was on a table, I,

496
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:41,910
that my eyes were shut and
then they wanted all the
people in the program to say

497
00:30:41,911 --> 00:30:45,330
their goodbyes to me. Um, wow. Yeah.

498
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,210
When we asked John Smith about
this, like, come on, really?

499
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:50,890
This is what he said.

500
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,430
It was a directive by the professional
counselor that was our consulting

501
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:58,360
psychologist. They made this up and
they said, you should do this. He said,

502
00:30:58,361 --> 00:31:03,361
the reason we're doing this is because
this man has had a pattern of destructive

503
00:31:04,211 --> 00:31:04,990
behavior.

504
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:07,900
He says it was just something that was
suggested to them by an actual counselor.

505
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:12,550
He said, this is called gestalt
therapy. He says the guy suggested it,

506
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,121
they did it.

507
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:16,360
And it also just seemed like another one
of those things they could borrow from

508
00:31:16,361 --> 00:31:20,680
drug and rehab clinics that apparently
do this sometimes if somebody's using

509
00:31:20,681 --> 00:31:24,640
drugs and maybe my dye and needs to
be scared straight. I don't know.

510
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:28,780
When we were chastised for our rules,

511
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:33,490
which we were and I was and I have been,

512
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,280
I know, I understand that now,

513
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:41,940
but we were chastised for it and we
would internally say we are not doing

514
00:31:43,181 --> 00:31:46,720
anything different than the
local successful drug rehab.

515
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:51,490
John says he knew that some of these
techniques were confrontational and maybe

516
00:31:51,491 --> 00:31:52,181
even traumatic.

517
00:31:52,181 --> 00:31:57,181
But at the time I believed at the time
that a temporary pain to rid your life of

518
00:31:59,771 --> 00:32:02,770
the horror of homosexuality is worth it.

519
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:06,990
It gets me upset thinking
about it too. Just

520
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:13,760
how crazy some of us scout there.
This is Peterson disco again.

521
00:32:13,761 --> 00:32:17,390
This is actually him in a film
made by a director, Morgan Fox,

522
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,220
who was nice enough to
let us use the footage.

523
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:23,260
One of my closest friends there
attempted suicide and, um,

524
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:29,330
I found his truck at the end of the
driveway with all these photographs of his

525
00:32:29,331 --> 00:32:34,220
children. And he had, um, this note, yeah,

526
00:32:34,221 --> 00:32:38,390
this, he had this note at just
about what a horrible person he was.

527
00:32:38,391 --> 00:32:40,040
And he gave up,

528
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,140
you know, that he's such a bad person.

529
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:46,030
And he took all these pills and
went off to the fields to die.

530
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:55,240
Peterson told me he knows that at
least five students from Levin Action,

531
00:32:55,241 --> 00:32:59,110
who at one point either in the program
or afterwards attempted suicide,

532
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:04,750
smit himself offered a story of going
with a colleague to a Christian conference

533
00:33:04,751 --> 00:33:06,370
in California looking on the wall,

534
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:09,700
seeing a plaque with a
name of a former student.

535
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:13,820
This room dedicated in the memory
of David Bilberry bilberry king.

536
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:19,310
I said, Alan, what happened? He says,

537
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:22,010
he committed suicide five years ago.

538
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:29,110
I asked John about a letter
that he wrote in 2010 where he,

539
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,090
I know this is jumping forward just a bit,

540
00:33:31,091 --> 00:33:34,780
but where he ultimately apologizes
for everything he's done.

541
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:40,240
And below that written
apology. A commenter said,
I don't accept your apology.

542
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:44,680
And then they listed a series
of names. Aiden Schaffer.

543
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:49,390
17 committed suicide dominant crouch
15 jumped to his death from a six story

544
00:33:49,391 --> 00:33:53,020
building. Billy Lucas 15 hung
himself in his family's farm.

545
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,020
Asher brown 13 shot himself
with his father's gun.

546
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,890
Seth Walsh hanged himself from a tree
in his backyard. Didn't die immediately.

547
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:03,310
He was taken to a hospital or he's placed
on life support. Died nine days later,

548
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,740
Jeanine blend shit. 21 pills.

549
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:09,970
Terrelle Williams 17 hung himself
in his bedroom closet and on and on.

550
00:34:09,971 --> 00:34:13,660
And on about 20 suicides. Now, not
all of them happened at Levin. Action.

551
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:14,583
What do you,

552
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:16,870
how do you hold that? How do you,

553
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:21,550
the only thing I could say to
that is in, in all honesty,

554
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,450
in some levels of this process,

555
00:34:25,451 --> 00:34:28,870
I have to use some denial.

556
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:33,640
I have to, and I don't mean
denial, it didn't happen.

557
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,570
Denial of my feelings. Um,

558
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:42,770
there have been many times through life
experience where I have perceived if I

559
00:34:43,751 --> 00:34:48,550
truly felt everything that
there is in there, I would die.

560
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,713
Okay.

561
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,100
And I also,

562
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:05,230
I also have to release people to
their own process and I cannot take

563
00:35:07,761 --> 00:35:09,950
responsibility for their process.

564
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:12,563
I can't,

565
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,560
all I can do is acknowledge
and release the rest.

566
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:31,270
John, Dan told me something
that could sound defensive,

567
00:35:31,271 --> 00:35:34,270
but actually I think is a truth
that needs to be acknowledged.

568
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,570
The idea that he, yeah.

569
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:38,250
With

570
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:41,430
selling it love and action or
perhaps that he bought into,

571
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,550
ultimately it goes way beyond him.

572
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,150
The sources of all that shame are
as much the families of those kids,

573
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:54,030
the peer groups, the schools where they
went to this. Certainly the churches,

574
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:58,200
the society at large that creates the
conditions for love and action to exist.

575
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:02,200
He says he cannot take
responsibility for all that.

576
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,673
And I think that's right.

577
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,650
This is an album that, um,

578
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:16,880
the guys in the program actually made for
me and it has pictures with statements

579
00:36:18,391 --> 00:36:20,910
from each one of those clients.

580
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,580
While we were there, John showed us, uh,

581
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:28,260
a kind of yearbook of the love in
action class of 1993. These are,

582
00:36:28,261 --> 00:36:30,950
these are students or,
yeah. Oh Wow. [inaudible]

583
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,080
okay.

584
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,870
First picture was a kid who's
maybe 18, Husky thick black hair.

585
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,300
This guy here, you know,

586
00:36:39,301 --> 00:36:42,090
you've been an inspiration to me
from the first year I met you.

587
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:46,200
I've learned from you that you have to
face life and death and then go through

588
00:36:46,201 --> 00:36:50,400
it. You're a good leader and a shepherd
and I'm so grateful to the Lord for you.

589
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,293
I love you.

590
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:56,780
And this is a guy that today is
married to his husband and uh,

591
00:36:57,001 --> 00:36:59,460
and we are in contact regularly and,

592
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:02,280
and it's a very affirming
and positive relationship.

593
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:03,643
Okay.

594
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,220
This man I was in contact
with tall, thin, blonde hair,

595
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:14,480
but this is one of the, one of the
circumstances where this man, uh, uh,

596
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,140
he died of a drug overdose,
um, about two years ago.

597
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:23,090
They didn't believe it was
a suicide. Um, but he, uh,

598
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,470
he's no longer with us.

599
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,283
Yeah.

600
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,090
This Si. Um, here's one,
this guy, he says, Smitty.

601
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:33,410
They called me Smitty back then.

602
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:37,100
So much of my heart has gone into
preparing this keepsake for you.

603
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:40,040
Each time you look upon it,
may, you know my love for you.

604
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,680
He looks like early twenties, tall, thin.

605
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:47,060
Adam's apple kind of bushy black
hair. [inaudible] big smile.

606
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,910
I've had conversations with him. He, um,

607
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:54,500
he doesn't completely accept
necessarily where I am today.

608
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:59,450
Um, but he's very, uh, warm and friendly.
He doesn't accept where you are.

609
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:03,440
He doesn't completely embrace
someone being gay and being married.

610
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:07,880
So he's not openly gay is open.
Again, he talks about being gay,

611
00:38:07,881 --> 00:38:11,360
but he's married to a
woman and he has a family.

612
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:19,740
I have not had communication with him. Uh,

613
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,860
I have had communication with him,
all American guy, freckles. Um,

614
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,000
but he actually continued working
for a very anti gay organization and,

615
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:36,250
uh, it got to the point where
I just was just in turmoil

616
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:39,820
when I would see things who would post
on Facebook or things he would say.

617
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:43,510
And so I really chose to kind
of not be affected by that.

618
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:45,243
Okay.

619
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:49,750
This is a guy, um, sandy
hair, radiant smile.

620
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:53,680
He was a guy who was HIV positive
when he came in the program. And, uh,

621
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,460
three years later he
died. Um, in California,

622
00:38:57,461 --> 00:39:02,050
there were people that were in our program
or in our support group ministry in

623
00:39:02,051 --> 00:39:05,920
California. The years I was there.
22 of those people died from HIV.

624
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,550
Are you in touch with all these people?

625
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:19,670
I have had communication with him, yes.

626
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,940
Him, yes. Yes. Actually,

627
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,760
in the last five years since he's
been high and dry of love and action,

628
00:39:25,761 --> 00:39:30,590
John says he has made it his mission to
reach out to everyone he can to try and

629
00:39:30,591 --> 00:39:33,560
engage with them, support them
if they want to be supported,

630
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:37,550
make amends if that's
what they want for him.

631
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:43,150
His sort of clean break
really began in 2005 June 6th,

632
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:48,230
2005 we moved in and
that was our first day.

633
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:51,830
They just upgraded their headquarters
a second time, hired more staff due.

634
00:39:51,831 --> 00:39:56,750
We had just started a new group
of teenagers. Everybody was there.

635
00:39:56,751 --> 00:39:59,630
We were excited. Eight 30 in the morning,

636
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,740
our office manager came running
in my office and said, John,

637
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,500
there are protesters outside.

638
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:15,920
I was hoping for

639
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:19,600
[inaudible].

640
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:24,010
Oh my gosh. What has happened?

641
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,660
How did they know?

642
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:27,570
This is when the torpedo struck.

643
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:32,630
A young kid in the program named Zach
had posted a message to my space saying

644
00:40:32,671 --> 00:40:36,120
his parents had put him in this
straight camp. It was like a boot camp.

645
00:40:36,121 --> 00:40:39,100
He wasn't sure he's going to make
it. News cameras started showing,

646
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,720
well her swat the demonstrates today,

647
00:40:40,721 --> 00:40:44,020
say they basically are here today to
show their support for those who are

648
00:40:44,021 --> 00:40:46,360
enrolled in the love and action
program. We're going to pan over.

649
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:51,400
Bullhorns came out and
all of a sudden I heard

650
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,760
John Smith, we know you're in John Smith.

651
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:59,270
We know you're here. Hey,

652
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:02,740
Ryan's after this door raising their
voices in front of loving actions,

653
00:41:02,741 --> 00:41:04,930
new recovery treatments
in our, in Raleigh.

654
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,050
I mean they were there in
the morning and the night

655
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:13,330
from the protest. I started
entering into an absolute days,

656
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,990
just just a cloud. I don't even know.

657
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,290
The protest lasted for eight solid weeks.

658
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,450
International media started coming in.

659
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:26,890
There's so much attention that the state
of Tennessee actually started cracking

660
00:41:26,891 --> 00:41:30,580
down performing inspections. John
Smith ends up counter suing the state.

661
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:34,100
I was so desperate to make this
work, and he says, now looking

662
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,590
back, what's amazing is how
long it took him to wake up.

663
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:40,340
How all throughout his mind would
contort itself to push away down.

664
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:42,300
I would drive through the protest

665
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:49,550
and I remember them saying, we love you.
We love you to me. He says, amazingly,

666
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,890
he interpreted that in
that moment as God's

667
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:52,580
speaking to him.

668
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:56,570
I know you're here and I knew you were
here and I didn't want you to hide.

669
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:00,890
I wanted to celebrate you being here
and I did it through these protestors.

670
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,400
That's the way I interpreted it.
Wow. This some mental gymnastics.

671
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,620
Yes it is.

672
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:13,190
So the honest truth is what brought John
into the light or what needed to happen

673
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:17,300
before he can be able to see the light
is that as organization collapsed,

674
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,030
the protestors created
division and his staff,

675
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:22,670
one of his managers tried to force
him out. He didn't know what to do.

676
00:42:22,671 --> 00:42:26,090
Eventually he resigns
and so when I resigned,

677
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:31,340
I sat in my newly designed
Home Office and I said,

678
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:35,990
God, I have no idea what you have
in store for me. For the future.

679
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,280
Surprised me from that
point forward. He says,

680
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:44,870
it was like slowly sobering up after
you've been drunk for 25 years.

681
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,580
This time it wasn't a violent shift.
It was a series of tiny micro steps.

682
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:54,640
Like one day he's sitting in his computer
and decides to click on gay porn for

683
00:42:54,801 --> 00:42:58,430
the first time in his life. Immediately
feel horrible, wracked with shame,

684
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:01,460
decides he's got to go tell his wife
who he was still married to at the time,

685
00:43:01,461 --> 00:43:06,020
by the way. But then he thinks, no,
I'm not going to tell her we're short.

686
00:43:06,021 --> 00:43:10,970
While after that he's at a
Christian conference and he
announces to the audience

687
00:43:10,971 --> 00:43:15,680
that he, John Smith, the Elvis of the
ex gay movement was in fact not cured.

688
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:17,600
I vocally said, I'm a gay man.

689
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:21,920
I'm a gay man and I'm in a
mixed orientation. Marriage.

690
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:25,460
Mixed orientation by the way means a
marriage between a homosexual and a

691
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:30,140
heterosexual. So a term you sometimes
hear in this world. Um, but that process,

692
00:43:30,141 --> 00:43:34,100
that slow, gradual awakening,
John says it is still happening.

693
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:37,180
Yes. And the whole creative
component in the car.

694
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:40,570
He told us even about the shoes he was
wearing it. Oh, that brought it up.

695
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:44,380
I have bright blue tennis shoes on
today. I bought those a month ago.

696
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:49,150
I, I love bright colors. I've
always loved bright colors.

697
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:54,390
I stood in the store for 20
minutes looking at gray or
turquoise blue shoes that

698
00:43:54,941 --> 00:43:59,200
were identical and I made the
decision, the conscious decision,

699
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:04,270
and I feel very emotional about this,
crazy about blue tennis shoes, but I'm,

700
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:08,350
I hadn't to make the decision to buy
the blue tennis shoes because I love

701
00:44:08,351 --> 00:44:12,880
turquoise blue and it's that, it's,
it's still, I'm still coming out.

702
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:17,910
I'm still having to open myself
up to the reality of who I am,

703
00:44:20,231 --> 00:44:24,430
of who I was wired to be from
the moment I was born. It just,

704
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:28,840
there's this constant battle
within me to deny, to push away,

705
00:44:28,841 --> 00:44:32,010
to surgically cut off a major of who I am.

706
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:37,980
And so even though I was a, I was
an ex gay leader and one of the,

707
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,620
one of the instruments of abuse,

708
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:46,550
I'm also per a person who was subjected
to ex gay ministry for 25 years.

709
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:51,240
And so I have the same kinds of
anger in the same kinds of wounds,

710
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,690
the same kind of pain and that

711
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:57,960
complicatedness about John Smith that
he is both the instrument of abuse and

712
00:44:57,961 --> 00:45:01,260
also a subject himself of that same abuse.

713
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:06,290
It might color how you see
the final chapter in his
journey from straight to gay

714
00:45:07,201 --> 00:45:10,290
to excavate to ex ex gay. But
it has to do with this guy

715
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:12,180
about, uh,

716
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:17,370
eight miles west of this place
community called Maxi, Texas.

717
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:18,413
Okay.

718
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,270
This is Larry McQueen, John's husband.

719
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:24,260
He works in the Engineering Department
of a company that manufacturers pipes for

720
00:45:24,261 --> 00:45:28,580
oil rigs. Third Generation Pentecostal
comes from a very religious family.

721
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,660
And so before he and John
connected about five years ago,

722
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:37,040
he had never been with a man. He tried
dating women. It didn't work new.

723
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,020
He was attracted to men.
Push those thoughts away.

724
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:42,160
Up to that point. I
had lived my life along

725
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,270
and [inaudible].

726
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:45,381
In fact,

727
00:45:45,381 --> 00:45:49,610
I had come to the point where I was
crying myself to sleep because I was so

728
00:45:49,611 --> 00:45:54,500
lonely. And that's what
actually led me to say, look,

729
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:59,180
Larry, you know, you're 40
something years old, you're lonely.

730
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:03,050
I don't think God really wants
me to be this way any longer.

731
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:06,220
The first night that they were together,
which initially wasn't romantic,

732
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:06,520
it was,

733
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,430
they had gotten together as friends
to do some home improvement projects.

734
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,160
I don't know if I want to
talk about this. Well, no.

735
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:17,710
It's like, well, okay. So, so I walked,

736
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,170
we went out to dinner and
came back and we just,

737
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:22,890
we just really had a,

738
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:27,400
a comfortable time and Larry came to a,

739
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:30,280
an amazing awareness
at that point. He said,

740
00:46:30,281 --> 00:46:32,980
you know what I'm feeling with you,

741
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:38,200
really confirms to me that I'm
gay. And he said, and by the way,

742
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:42,070
we're sleeping in separate beds. Next
morning, Larry walks into John's room,

743
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:45,010
lays down beside him on the
bed, puts his arm around him.

744
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,340
He just put his arms around
me and I was reading an email.

745
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:53,150
He had his arms around me and I just
started to sob uncontrollably. You know,

746
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:56,530
I had never in my life ever
cried with another human being

747
00:46:56,770 --> 00:47:01,770
and for me it was like almost a physical
sensation inside me that as if there

748
00:47:04,151 --> 00:47:08,620
were cogs that never were
quite aligned properly.

749
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:13,600
But that weekend I felt within my body,

750
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:18,900
these cogs coming into place and clicking
and I felt whole for the first time

751
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:20,990
I was Larry's first kiss?

752
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:24,590
Yes. Wow. At 52 years old

753
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:34,410
[inaudible]

754
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:37,630
a few months after that weekend, John
got a divorce from his second wife,

755
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:38,923
baleen.

756
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:43,370
John and Larry got married in 2014 and
these days they sing in their church

757
00:47:43,371 --> 00:47:44,204
choir.

758
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:47,750
They're the only openly gay couple in
their church and they continue to nudge

759
00:47:47,751 --> 00:47:51,650
the church very gently to take a
stand in support of gay marriage.

760
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:52,641
At the end of the day,

761
00:47:52,641 --> 00:47:55,820
it's still difficult to know how to
reconcile John Smith's past with his

762
00:47:55,821 --> 00:47:59,630
present, whether he's taking enough
responsibility for his actions or not.

763
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:04,130
We spoke to people who are all over the
map on that question. John would say,

764
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:09,280
however you feel the lesson from his life
is that very simply people can change.

765
00:48:10,131 --> 00:48:13,850
Humans are teachable. The
human mind is infinite.

766
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:27,723
[inaudible]

767
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:30,610
Robert, I want to just offer
one side note to the story. Um,

768
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:34,670
in the time that we were
working on this series,

769
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:38,570
like something like four states,
uh, I may have that number wrong,

770
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:40,880
outlawed conversion therapy from minors.

771
00:48:40,881 --> 00:48:44,300
And if you look to start more
broadly in the last few years,

772
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:49,010
there's been this wave of legislation
that's trying to stamp this out. Really?

773
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:52,610
Yeah. On what theory is
it's cruel. I mean that a,

774
00:48:52,611 --> 00:48:54,380
especially when you're talking
about offering it to minors.

775
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:59,920
So I think something like 37
municipalities in the last few years have,

776
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:02,540
have outlawed conversion
therapy for minors.

777
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:07,690
And at the same time you have a lot of
debate about the sort of expanding idea

778
00:49:07,821 --> 00:49:08,980
of religious freedom. Yeah.

779
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:11,540
That protection that's written
into the first amendment.

780
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:16,430
And a lot of these groups are arguing
successfully at times that they have the

781
00:49:16,431 --> 00:49:19,460
constitutional right to
offer these programs.

782
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:22,430
So it's a really interesting
and confusing moment right now.

783
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,133
[inaudible]

784
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:38,140
this episode of Radiolab.
It's drawn from unraced,

785
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:41,470
the a untold history of
conversion therapy in America,

786
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:43,720
a series that I worked
on with focus features,

787
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:47,260
stitcher and liminality in conjunction
with a feature film boy erased.

788
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:51,940
Huge thanks to the production team.
She, Molly Ikat, Aaron, Alice Quinlan,

789
00:49:51,941 --> 00:49:53,500
Michael Assessor, David Craig, Garrett,

790
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,440
calmly to anonymous content
for their support of unraced.

791
00:49:56,441 --> 00:49:58,660
If you want to hear the entire
series, I hope you will.

792
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,080
You can find unraced in all
the usual podcast places.

793
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:06,850
Okay, well, I guess we should go.
Yes, let's go. We can whiz it. Gone.

794
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:07,870
We can leave it now. Bye.
