00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.850
- Let's talk a little bit about

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:03.580
exocytosis,

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.490
which is how the cell is able to

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.690
release larger molecules

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.650
that might be used by the rest of the body.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.420
Other cells, or maybe it's going to be part

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.720
of the extracellular matrix.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.090
And to understand how this works,

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.090
it's really the reverse of endocytosis,

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.490
we're going to go

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.090
and produce some proteins

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.690
in the endoplasmic reticulum,

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.120
this is our classic example.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.220
Those proteins are then going to bud off,

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.220
in their own little vesicles,

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.390
which then merge with the golgi apparatus

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.390
where they are further processed.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.990
So they're processed in the golgi apparatus,

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.020
right over here,

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.490
and then eventually they're going to bud off

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.150
of the golgi apparatus in new vesicles,

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.950
and those vesicles are going to make their way

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.950
over to the cell's outer membrane,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.250
the plasma membrane

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.790
and the membranes of the vesicles

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.120
are going to merge with the membrane

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.990
of the cell

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.650
and in doing so, they're going to release

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.580
their contents.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.720
And this is classic exocytosis,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.750
there are other cases

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.120
where maybe it

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.790
merges partially, releases the contents

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.050
and then buds back

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.820
is called the "kiss and run" method

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:01.890
of exocytosis,

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.020
but the classic one is

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.790
it merges with the membrane.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.090
We can look at this,

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.050
this membrane

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.120
after the vesicle's membrane has merged

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.420
with the plasma membrane,

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.520
the membrane might look like this.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.750
So if the vesicle,

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.390
let me do the vesicle's membrane in orange,

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.590
if the vesicle's membrane is at an orange,

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.390
well now it has merged like this

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.420
and it has released its contents.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.290
It has released the protein

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.220
to be used someplace else,

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.090
someplace else in the body.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.920
And I want to be clear,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.590
this membrane,

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.350
and I talk about it many times

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.190
in many other videos,

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.790
even though I've drawn it as one line

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.790
right over here,

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.190
this is going to be a phospholipid bilayer,

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.430
so if we were to zoom in,

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.990
it would look like this.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.420
It's a phospholipid bilayer.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.120
So these are some of the phospholipids

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.620
that were part of the original

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.090
part of the original membrane

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.750
and then we also, in my little box,

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.020
I get some of the ones that are part of,

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.890
or that were part of the vesicle

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.250
that was holding that protein.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.120
That were part of the vesicle

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.320
that was holding the protein.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.020
So I really want to stress

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.290
I want to really stress these lines

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.110
that I'm drawing

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.820
these are bilayers of phospholilpids.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.090
And all of these lines,

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.920
these membranes that you see,

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.320
these are all bilayers of phospholipids.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.220
Just to make sure

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.750
that we are visualizing this correct.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.450
And that's what exocytosis is

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.490
and one thing that I find interesting

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.690
is when you first learn about it

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.120
you see it diagrammed like this

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.750
and you just assume,

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.320
okay, well, these bubbles of these

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.090
with these membranes

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.750
they just randomly must float

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.590
eventually to the membrane

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.820
where they get merged

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.950
and then they release their contents.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.790
But actually it isn't that chaotic.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.850
They actually can sit on tracks

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.090
so they actually can sit on tracks.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.650
Remember we talked about the cytoskeleton

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.650
which isn't drawn enough

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:51.690
probably because it makes drawings

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.590
really messy

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.590
but whenever we think about a cell

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.390
there's all this structure to it.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.220
There's all this structure to it,

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.190
microtubules, microfilaments,

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.520
intermediate filaments,

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.250
all of these things over here

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.220
that not only provide structure to the cell,

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.020
but they can be used to transport.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.450
And these vesicles

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.550
these vesicles can actually ride

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.750
on these structures

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.960
and you could actually have

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.550
motor proteins that are using ATP

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.740
to actively push the vesicle

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:20.890
containing its contents

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.520
so this is a kind of transportation.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.020
It's really like a factory

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.450
to push them towards the membrane

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.150
so that they can be released.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.720
So whenever I think about it, it's fascinating

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.890
'cause I always talk about these cells

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.150
being a universe unto themselves.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.890
And they aren't just these blobs,

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:36.890
they have all of these structures,

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.090
there's all of these proteins

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.250
that are really on an unbelievably small scale

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.620
able to do these fairly intricate processes.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.420
So what I just showed you, once again,

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.350
this is classic exocytosis,

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.680
you'll see it when you have proteins, lipids,

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.020
being produced by the cell

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.690
that need to be released somehow.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.980
They're also famously used in

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.710
neurons,

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:58.790
the chemical signal,

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.720
when you go from one neuron to another,

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.890
you have exocytosis of neurotransmitters

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.290
that will trigger the next neuron.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.920
So these are very, very important processes.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.410
Our bodies would not function properly

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.890
or, wouldn't function at all,

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.240
if we did not have exocytosis.
