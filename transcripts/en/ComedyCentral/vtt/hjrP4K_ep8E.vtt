00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.569
<i>Time</i> magazine's
person of the year

00:00:02.603 --> 00:00:04.505
is our president-elect
and person who definitely

00:00:04.538 --> 00:00:06.940
at some point in his life
has yelled, "Seize him!"

00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:08.976
-Donald Trump.
-(laughter)

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.980
Now, he's an '80s movie villain,
you guys.

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:14.381
He's an '80s movie villain.

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:17.217
He's the one, who whatever that
story is, he keeps the nerds

00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:19.720
from accomplishing
whatever thing it is, and then,

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:22.089
they got to, in the end, like,
teach him a lesson.

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:24.725
He's like, "Nerds!"
Like, that's him.

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:26.960
Now, if you're not a Trump fan,
I would like to remind you

00:00:26.994 --> 00:00:28.695
the title goes to someone
who is influential,

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:31.798
not someone who is necessarily,
like, the greatest person ever.

00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:33.033
If that was the case,
every year,

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.301
it would just go to The Rock.

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:35.936
I mean,
he's the greatest person ever.

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.905
-I mean, every...
-(applause and cheering)

00:00:37.938 --> 00:00:42.242
Why don't they just... do that?

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:45.746
To help.... to help keep things
in perspective,

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:48.115
here's what a wise man
once said on Twitter.

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:49.850
Quote, "The <i>Time</i> magazine list

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.985
"of the 100 most influential
people is a joke

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:53.554
"and a stunt of a magazine
that will,

00:00:53.587 --> 00:00:56.223
like <i>Newsweek,</i> soon be dead.
Bad list!"

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:57.891
Who said that again? Oh, right.

00:00:57.925 --> 00:00:59.927
<i>Time</i> magazine's 2016
man of the year,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.428
-Donald Trump. -Oh!
-(people groaning)

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:04.031
Uh, so, comedians,
what other list

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:06.033
does Donald Trump
consider to be bad?

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.768
Joe Randazzo.

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:11.271
Uh, list of the 2.8 million
more people who actually voted

00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:13.240
for Hillary Clinton
in the election than him.

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:15.542
All right, I will give you
points for that.

00:01:15.576 --> 00:01:17.144
(applause and cheering)

00:01:17.177 --> 00:01:19.346
Mamrie Hart.

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:21.381
The waiting list
for a new Slovenian wife.

00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:22.783
-HARDWICK: Points.
-(laughter)

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:24.484
-Points.
-(applause)

00:01:24.518 --> 00:01:26.753
Who wants
to be the <i>second</i> First Lady?

00:01:26.787 --> 00:01:28.155
HART (laughing):
Yeah.

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:30.090
-Jon Gabrus.
-Schindler's list.

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:32.192
Not the movie,
but the actual list.

00:01:32.226 --> 00:01:34.194
-Okay, all right, points.
-(laughter, groaning, applause)

00:01:34.228 --> 00:01:34.294
I'll give you points for that.
