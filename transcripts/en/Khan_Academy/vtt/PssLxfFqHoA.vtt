00:00:01.019 --> 00:00:02.302
- [Instructor] What we
wanna do in this video

00:00:02.302 --> 00:00:04.160
is get some practice estimating

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.743
multi-digit division problems.

00:00:06.743 --> 00:00:10.743
Here, we're asked to
estimate 794 divided by 18.

00:00:12.098 --> 00:00:13.938
Now, if you wanted to get the exact answer

00:00:13.938 --> 00:00:15.796
you'd probably have to do,
in fact you would have to do,

00:00:15.796 --> 00:00:18.252
some long division or
maybe use a calculator.

00:00:18.252 --> 00:00:19.372
But, the whole point here

00:00:19.372 --> 00:00:21.055
is to get some practice estimating.

00:00:21.055 --> 00:00:23.621
Pause this video and try to
see if you can figure this out

00:00:23.621 --> 00:00:26.953
without even using any pencil or paper.

00:00:26.953 --> 00:00:29.252
All right, so now let's do this together.

00:00:29.252 --> 00:00:31.202
I'll tell you what my brain does.

00:00:31.202 --> 00:00:35.369
My brain says that look,
794 is awfully close to 800

00:00:37.186 --> 00:00:39.436
and then 18 is close to 20.

00:00:40.296 --> 00:00:43.213
I would say this is going
to be roughly the same thing

00:00:43.213 --> 00:00:48.078
as 800, is gonna be roughly
equal to 800 divided by 20.

00:00:48.078 --> 00:00:49.270
Is it going to be exactly equal?

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.248
No, but these are the numbers
closest to the numbers there

00:00:52.248 --> 00:00:54.972
that it's easy for me
to divide in my head.

00:00:54.972 --> 00:00:57.623
For example, I would then say,

00:00:57.623 --> 00:00:59.330
if I was just doing
this purely in my head,

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.857
I would say, well, 100
divided by 20 is five,

00:01:02.857 --> 00:01:05.857
so 800 divided by 20 is equal to 40.

00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:11.715
Another way to think
about it, 800 over 20.

00:01:11.715 --> 00:01:14.298
If we divide the numerator
and the denominator by 10,

00:01:14.298 --> 00:01:19.266
it's the same thing as 80
over 2, which is equal to 40.

00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:23.180
So 794 divided by 18
definitely isn't exactly 40,

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.212
but it's going to be close to 40,

00:01:25.212 --> 00:01:27.594
and especially of these
choices right over here.

00:01:27.594 --> 00:01:29.353
It's definitely gonna be much closer to 40

00:01:29.353 --> 00:01:31.853
than 80, 4, or definitely 400.

00:01:32.753 --> 00:01:34.281
So, we're gonna go with that.

00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:35.948
Let's get another example here,

00:01:35.948 --> 00:01:38.182
make sure we get enough practice.

00:01:38.182 --> 00:01:42.349
Once again, we are asked to
estimate 722 divided by 68.

00:01:44.474 --> 00:01:45.804
Why don't you have a go at it.

00:01:45.804 --> 00:01:47.551
Pause the video and try to
see if you can figure out

00:01:47.551 --> 00:01:51.429
what it is and try to do it in your head.

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:52.782
Well, what I would do in my head,

00:01:52.782 --> 00:01:57.286
I would say, well look, 722,
this is awfully close to 700,

00:01:57.286 --> 00:01:59.786
and 68 is awfully close to 70.

00:02:01.547 --> 00:02:03.791
And then, this is quite
straightforward to do in your head,

00:02:03.791 --> 00:02:07.541
700 divided by 70 is
going to be equal to 10.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.598
And, good for us, there's a choice here

00:02:10.598 --> 00:02:13.534
that is awfully close
to what we approximated.

00:02:13.534 --> 00:02:15.485
Now, if you don't find
your exact answer here,

00:02:15.485 --> 00:02:17.711
that's okay 'cause remember,
it's an approximation.

00:02:17.711 --> 00:02:19.406
You should find the answer that is closest

00:02:19.406 --> 00:02:21.023
to what you estimated.

00:02:21.023 --> 00:02:22.140
But, whoever wrote this question

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.886
had a very similar thought process.

00:02:23.886 --> 00:02:28.096
They said, okay, 722, pretty close to 700.

00:02:28.096 --> 00:02:30.415
And 68, pretty close to 70.

00:02:30.415 --> 00:02:32.009
And so it's gonna be approximately equal

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:33.759
to 700 divided by 70.
