00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.305
The average percentage of obese people in all states is 27%.

00:00:04.305 --> 00:00:07.590
With the help of some interactivity on this graphic,

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.620
I can hover over this black middle line and see that.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.190
Here's the figure.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.030
For the second question, we were looking for DC, or the District of Columbia.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.500
This question was a bit easier to answer.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.570
We can determine these rankings by looking at the state that's on

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.040
the left side here.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.280
So if I just hover over,

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.220
this would be the least educated state by population, West Virginia.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.020
The most educated would be up here, the District of Columbia.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.390
And finally, most states have higher percentages of obese people.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.610
This one is harder to notice from the graph, but

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.910
it's recognizable from the color of the lines.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.120
Looking at our plot,

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.630
we can tell that slightly more lines are red rather than blue.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.310
So, slightly more states have larger pair of percentages of obese people,

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.920
compared to percentages of people with higher educations.
