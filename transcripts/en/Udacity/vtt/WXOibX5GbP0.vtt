00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.410
Let's get back to the throwDown method.

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.910
We managed to initialize the player's
turn with this line of code.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.625
Now we need to initialize a turn for
the computer.

00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:11.220
We'll just use the default
init method for now.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.245
And now that we have turns for
both players, we can initialize a game.

00:00:15.245 --> 00:00:18.105
Notice that when you have long
method names like this that might

00:00:18.105 --> 00:00:22.825
not fit on one line, the convention
is to line up the colons like this.

00:00:22.825 --> 00:00:26.105
Xcode will do it for
you automatically if you press return.

00:00:26.105 --> 00:00:29.375
So now we have an instance
of RPSGame to work with and

00:00:29.375 --> 00:00:31.435
our throwDown method is finished.
