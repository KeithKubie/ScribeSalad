parables we think in ways that are
 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:12.100
parables we think in ways that are
unrecognizable to other species and

that's maybe fifty thousand years old
 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:17.020
that's maybe fifty thousand years old
right around the time that our ancestors

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:17.030
right around the time that our ancestors
 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.300
right around the time that our ancestors
started doing things like throwing

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310
started doing things like throwing
 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.759

pigment on the walls of the cave and

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769
pigment on the walls of the cave and
 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.929

this pattern of colors stands for an

paintings the first sign that this is

paintings the first sign that this is

not a horse this is a picture of a horse

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890
not a horse this is a picture of a horse
 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.000
not a horse this is a picture of a horse
and that was an incredible leap forward

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010
and that was an incredible leap forward
 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.369
and that was an incredible leap forward
so we're this symbolic species and our

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379
so we're this symbolic species and our

so we're this symbolic species and our
brain does this unbelievably fancy

brain does this unbelievably fancy
 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.200
brain does this unbelievably fancy
symbolism but the interesting thing is

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210
symbolism but the interesting thing is
 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.540
symbolism but the interesting thing is
it actually doesn't do it all that well

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550
it actually doesn't do it all that well
 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.439
it actually doesn't do it all that well
and it has to do with the fact that

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449
and it has to do with the fact that
 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.760
and it has to do with the fact that
50,000 years is a blink of an eye on

evolutionary terms 50,000 years you
 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.500
evolutionary terms 50,000 years you
invent all these abstract sort of

invent all these abstract sort of
 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.380
invent all these abstract sort of

something like that in the eye blink of
 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.620
something like that in the eye blink of
50,000 years and you see all sorts of

give me some duct tape I'm going to
strap moral disgust onto gustatory

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820
strap moral disgust onto gustatory

strap moral disgust onto gustatory
disgust the insular cortex does that now

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750
disgust the insular cortex does that now
 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.210
disgust the insular cortex does that now
what's most interesting thing about that

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220
what's most interesting thing about that
 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.940
what's most interesting thing about that
though is at the end of the day if this

because this food is fetid and
 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.410
because this food is fetid and
disgusting and activates because you're

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420
disgusting and activates because you're
 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.330
disgusting and activates because you're
hearing about an act that was morally

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340
hearing about an act that was morally
 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.430
hearing about an act that was morally
reprehensible if it can't tell the

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440
reprehensible if it can't tell the
 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.590
reprehensible if it can't tell the
difference we have trouble telling the

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600
difference we have trouble telling the
 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.780
difference we have trouble telling the
difference between visceral disgust and

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790
difference between visceral disgust and
 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.840
difference between visceral disgust and
moral disgust and thus you see things

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850
moral disgust and thus you see things
 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.500
moral disgust and thus you see things
like we mistake things that are

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510
like we mistake things that are
 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.660
