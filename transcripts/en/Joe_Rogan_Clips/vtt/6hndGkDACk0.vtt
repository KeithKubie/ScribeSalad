00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.490
There's a benefit to being in a city where you're a kid or an adult,

2
00:00:03.491 --> 00:00:04.510
there's definitely a benefit.

3
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.770
The negative part is this depreciation of,

4
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.040
of value of life people,
there's so many people,

5
00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:14.430
you don't think of them as being as important.
They're,

6
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.360
they're a hindrance as much as they are like a nice thing to see why there's so

7
00:00:19.361 --> 00:00:20.450
many homeless people too.

8
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.010
And there's a homeless woman who basically stands on my corner and just begs for

9
00:00:27.221 --> 00:00:31.750
change every day.
Um,
and my son was with me the other day and this woman,

10
00:00:31.751 --> 00:00:35.370
she's like,
Hey,
do you have any money for a sandwich?
And a,
I was like,
no,

11
00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:38.010
sorry I don't today.
And I keep on walking and I might not looked down at my son.

12
00:00:38.011 --> 00:00:42.240
He's like,
that's really sad.
She doesn't have money for a sandwich.
And I'm like,

13
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.810
she has every fucking day,
James.
Everyday she has.
Okay,
I can't.

14
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.100
And I'd explain to him,
I was like,
I was like,
well,
you know,
look,

15
00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:52.530
I can't give her money every single day.
And I was like,

16
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.120
you know when I do have a dollar though,
I was like,

17
00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:57.000
why don't we go back and give her a dollar?
And then it was like,
no,
I get it now.

18
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.760
I swear to God,
he stopped me from giving her the dollar.
Well,

19
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.870
if the world was just one,
there was only one person like that.

20
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.510
That was the only issue.
Just one lady.
Just need some help.
You'd be,
oh,

21
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.360
we'll just help her.
Yeah,
but when there's a million of them,
you're like,

22
00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:17.970
why can't help it?
I just can't do this.
I gotta keep going.

23
00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:20.010
I've got to concentrate on my own shit.
That's like,

24
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.420
that's a microcosm of what happens in the city.
If that lady was in a small town,

25
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.420
she would be the crazy beggar lady.
People would probably be like,

26
00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:31.230
figure out a way to help her get her cans to something.
Some people.

27
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.960
The problem is,
is just like humans,

28
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.290
some humans when you give them that as an option,

29
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.270
just begging like these guys who do it.

30
00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:41.280
And there was a whole San Fran when I lived in San Francisco,

31
00:01:41.281 --> 00:01:44.310
there was a news report thing about this guy who was doing it for a living and

32
00:01:44.311 --> 00:01:46.110
he was making a lot of money,
a lot of money.

33
00:01:46.111 --> 00:01:48.240
Now he's just begging and he was essentially saying,

34
00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:50.970
there's nothing wrong with it.
It's totally legal.
And uh,

35
00:01:50.971 --> 00:01:54.690
I just make up stories and have people donate money to me.

36
00:01:54.691 --> 00:01:57.900
And I think of it as like an occupation.
So he,

37
00:01:57.901 --> 00:02:02.730
it was weird listening to them talk about it because he was telling this lady

38
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.450
who was the reporter lady who was telling her how she could do it too and you

39
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:10.230
know how he was doing it and how he shows people how to do it.

40
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.580
But he was making like a decent living,
like 100 bucks a day.
Yeah,
I'm sure.

41
00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:16.800
I don't remember cause I was a kid,
but I remember listening like,

42
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.810
Oh this mother fucker,
he's just faking it.
I don't,
in a weird way,
I,

43
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.850
I appreciate the hustle.
I don't look,
I watched my mom on welfare.

44
00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:28.640
I remember as a kid watching my mom collect a welfare check and,

45
00:02:28.641 --> 00:02:30.500
and sit in the room,
smoke cigarettes and not work.

46
00:02:30.501 --> 00:02:33.230
And I remember as a little kid being like,
that's not right.
I was like,

47
00:02:33.231 --> 00:02:35.030
what are you doing?
Just work.
Do something else.

48
00:02:35.031 --> 00:02:38.600
We could be in a better situation just from way too young having that thought.

49
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.570
Right.
Um,
but in a weird way,
I,

50
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.300
I appreciate the guys hustle.
He's figured out a way to thrive sorta.

51
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.140
It's not nothing to be proud of,
you know,
he shouldn't be bragging about it,

52
00:02:51.141 --> 00:02:53.450
but at the same time,
like it's just a different system.

53
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.830
It's a different game if you disconnect from sort of like,
you know,
whatever,

54
00:02:57.831 --> 00:02:59.800
we're,
you know,
he's con artist.

55
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.190
There's not never a good thing having someone who's lying to everybody all the

56
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:07.950
time.
I appreciate a good con artists.
I really do.
Yeah.
Yeah.

57
00:03:07.951 --> 00:03:12.330
It's boring.
It's boring.
Just figure it out.
Stupid.
Stop lying apart.

58
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.130
They figuring out something different.
They're just finding the lemmings.

59
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.200
That's all they're doing.
They're finding lemmings.

60
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.930
They're finding people that don't know any better people that what's three chord

61
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:21.870
money?
Come on,
I'll show you.
Well,
that's sort of what they deal with.

62
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.740
Homeless Ladies doing theirs.
Now,
look,
I've been in New York City since 2001.
Um,

63
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.880
I've,
I'm so desensitized to homeless people that I,

64
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.760
there's no part of me that feels bad.
I just walk on Sar.
Can't keep on going.

65
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.130
But what happens is you get there,

66
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.870
they're looking for the person who moved there a week ago.

67
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:38.800
They're looking for the tourists.

68
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:40.970
They're looking for the person who looking for Nice people and they're,

69
00:03:40.971 --> 00:03:44.020
they're there.
So it's sort of like that's,
but that's not the same thing.

70
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.770
Like that lady might just be crazy.
She's not a con artist.

71
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.660
Con Artists are people lying and pretending to listen to my car broke down.
Um,

72
00:03:52.661 --> 00:03:55.900
my wife and kid haven't had anything to eat in 24 hours.
Really?

73
00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:57.700
In a bad situation,
I would never do this.

74
00:03:57.701 --> 00:04:01.420
But I just ask you if you could just give me $5 and the guy says,
yeah,
man,
sure.

75
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:05.000
I'm sorry.
Here's $5 next person.
Hey man,
um,

76
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.950
I need to go take this flight to see my mom.
She's dying of cancer.

77
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.431
That'll change it.

78
00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:12.430
Usually they have the same stores sold and they'll change it all the time.
Well,

79
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:15.640
I had a guy do that to me in New York when I first moved there and I,
the guy,

80
00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:18.880
he was wearing a suit,
young white guy wearing a suit.
He was like,
dude,

81
00:04:18.881 --> 00:04:21.910
I missed my bus back home,
was here for a job interview.
Um,
you know,

82
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.850
I'm just trying to get money for a bus ticket back home.
And I was like,

83
00:04:24.851 --> 00:04:27.610
God to hear a couple of bucks,
whatever.
And the next day and Union Square,

84
00:04:27.611 --> 00:04:32.530
same fucking kids,
same suit,
same story because they learn it like a sales pitch.

85
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.230
So they know the beats of it,
they know exactly what to say.

86
00:04:35.231 --> 00:04:37.180
You see it went on the subway.
When they get on the subway,

87
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.940
they have an actual script,
you know,
so it's like,
you know,

88
00:04:39.941 --> 00:04:42.850
I don't mean the bad guy,
you know,
but my wife is blah,
blah,
blah blah.

89
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.150
And you see them every day going down the cart and it,

90
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.900
if you ever done a sales job,
a good sales script is pretty good.

91
00:04:49.901 --> 00:04:52.030
You're just sort of fishing,
you're playing the numbers,
you're,
you're,

92
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.940
instead of sort of adding emotion to it and changing the story and doing all

93
00:04:54.941 --> 00:04:57.160
these different things and putting too much thought into it,
you go,

94
00:04:57.161 --> 00:05:00.520
I'm just going to run the script and close one out of 20 people that walk by.

95
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.680
Stupid.
Yeah.

96
00:05:02.681 --> 00:05:06.730
No it's the only benefit is that you grow up around people that are full of Shit

97
00:05:06.731 --> 00:05:09.970
and you learn how to spot people that are full of shit.
So it benefit.

98
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.410
Other than that,
it's just annoying.

99
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.980
I agree with you but I also can appreciate it.
I can,

100
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:16.420
I can appreciate a good hustler.

101
00:05:16.421 --> 00:05:18.970
I appreciate there it goes out and gets a fucking job.

102
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.230
You don't just lie to people everywhere with some stupid story about how you

103
00:05:23.231 --> 00:05:27.730
missed your bus down shit together.
Pussy stop mooching money from people.

104
00:05:27.731 --> 00:05:29.770
That's gross.
What about as gross?

105
00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:33.880
What about a guy who sells his CD on the street that's maybe a bit different

106
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.300
cause he's offering something.
He has his art.
Nobody had a CD player.

107
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.160
You do now have a CD player do we don't want up top.

108
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.540
I've got a refurbished laptop.
This guy in Columbus,
you're sorta reminded me,

109
00:05:43.541 --> 00:05:46.840
I've completely forgot about him.
He was known as the wrapping bum,

110
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.610
but or help us on the way.

111
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.230
It's like 1520 years at Ohio state and this guy be on high street,

112
00:05:53.231 --> 00:05:56.620
which is like the main strip.
And he had this,
all these rhymes.

113
00:05:56.621 --> 00:05:59.390
He would constantly go to it and it always ended with help is on the way.

114
00:05:59.391 --> 00:06:02.570
But I don't remember a lot of them,
but he always said help is on the way.

115
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:03.920
And it like,
it was like this punchline,

116
00:06:03.921 --> 00:06:07.400
they help us on the way he had tee shirts made about them.
I think people,

117
00:06:07.401 --> 00:06:11.420
someone actually recorded them at one point and like 2005 or six but you

118
00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:14.330
remember when they found that homeless dude that had that crazy radio voice?

119
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.670
Yeah,
that was in Columbus to,
was it?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
It's not a job.
Right.

120
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.210
Went right back to the pipe.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He fucked it up.
Yeah.

121
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.910
Well you can't fix people,
man.
You can't fix him.
Like that voice was fire though.

122
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.600
It's a very good voice.
Great Voice Radio Voice.

123
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.250
You got a lot of gigs to move and he just wound up going right back to being a

124
00:06:34.251 --> 00:06:37.880
homeless person.
Right.
This is going to sound very insensitive,

125
00:06:37.881 --> 00:06:42.700
but most of the time it's not bad luck.
Right.
You know,
it's sort of the,

126
00:06:42.701 --> 00:06:43.910
the decisions you make,

127
00:06:43.911 --> 00:06:47.240
and I'm not saying that you can have a bad situation and you cannot,
you know,

128
00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.420
there is bad luck in the sense that some people are born into,
you know,

129
00:06:50.421 --> 00:06:55.180
affluent households and some people are born into poverty.
But this is him.
Yeah,

130
00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:56.510
the same,
let's hear it.

131
00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.480
<v 1>Nothing but the best of all of these.
You're listening.</v>

132
00:06:58.481 --> 00:07:03.240
Just magic 98.9 thank you so much.
God bless you.

133
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:09.210
He was a radio guy.
Fell on,
right?
Yeah.
And then he fell on well,

134
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.400
and don't forget tomorrow morning is your chance to win a pair of tickets to see

135
00:07:12.401 --> 00:07:14.770
this man live in concert.
I have a theory.

136
00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.570
<v 0>I think doing that for a living makes you fucking crazy.
That's what I think.</v>

137
00:07:18.571 --> 00:07:22.090
I think if you have that fake voice,
eventually you just snap.
You know,
I,

138
00:07:22.091 --> 00:07:24.030
I can't do this anymore.
I can't talk like this.

139
00:07:24.031 --> 00:07:26.400
I can't have this fake voice blow a fuse.
