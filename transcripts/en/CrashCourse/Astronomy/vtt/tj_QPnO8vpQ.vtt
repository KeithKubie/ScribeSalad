00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.820
Over the past few weeks I’ve talked about
our Sun, the planets, and other objects in our

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:13.460
solar system, stars (both big and small), brown dwarfs,
exoplanets, supernovae, and clouds of gas and dust.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.000
What do all these things have in common?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.140
Well, they — WE — all live in the same
town. It’s a big town, and it’s called

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.220
the Milky Way galaxy.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.290
Let’s cut to the chase: The Milky Way galaxy
is a vast, flat, disk-shaped collection of

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:32.369
gas, dust, and stars; a sprawling megalopolis
that’s a mind-crushing 100,000 light years

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.489
across and several thousand light years thick.
The Sun is but one of HUNDREDS of BILLIONS

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.170
of stars in it, and we’re located halfway
out from the center, in the suburbs.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.640
The disk has two major spiral arms in it,
and two minor ones. These come together more

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.460
or less in the middle of the galaxy. Located
in the center of the disk is a bar; an elongated

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.510
roughly cylindrical collection of old red
stars.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.920
I know, this is a lot to take in. I’ll go
over it piece by piece. And how we know all

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.840
this, like with so many other such deep 
astronomical discoveries, begins simply enough:

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.980
going outside and looking up.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.480
If you happen to be in a dark spot on a moonless
night, you’ll see a faint fuzzy glow stretching

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.570
across the sky. It’s brighter in some spots
than others, and if the constellations of

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.040
Sagittarius and Scorpius are visible, you’ll
notice the stream broadens there, forming

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.660
a bulge apparently bigger than your outstretched
hand.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.440
This glow’s resemblance to a pathway or
river is strong, and many ancient cultures

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.300
saw it that way as well. Because it glows
a dull white, the ancient Greeks called it

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.840
Galaxius, or “milky”. Over the millennia
that name stuck, and we now call it the Milky

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.000
Way, or (redundantly) the Milky Way galaxy.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.390
But what is that glow? It was thought to be
nebulous, cloudy, until one day a guy by the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.180
name of Galileo pointed his newly crafted
telescope at it. He was astonished to see

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.920
that it was actually made up of stars, thousands
of them. They were so close together and so

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.349
faint that our naked eyes couldn’t see them
individually; instead they blended together

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:09.810
to create that glow.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.160
Clearly, there were far more stars in the
sky than the 6000 or so visible to our unaided

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.420
eyes. But how many more? And what overall
shape did they form?

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.480
Astronomers reasoned that counting stars in
different directions might reveal the shape;

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.530
if the galaxy is longer in one direction than
others, you should see more stars in that

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.530
direction. Over the centuries maps were made
this way, and they generally showed the galaxy

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.290
to be oval shaped, or a flattened disk, with
the Sun near the center.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.760
This star counting method is a good idea,
but it’s fatally flawed: It doesn’t account

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.670
for interstellar dust! As we saw in our episode
about nebulae, dust absorbs visible light

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.900
from stars, hiding them from our view. It’s
like being in a smoky room where you can’t

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.040
see the walls. It looks like the room is smaller
than it really is, and you look like you’re

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.819
in the center, even if you’re near one of
the walls.

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.030
Globular clusters were a good clue that there
was more going on. These spherical balls of

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.490
stars orbit the galaxy well outside the main
body of the galaxy itself. There are more

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.670
of them on one side of the sky than the other,
which you wouldn’t expect if they were evenly

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.380
distributed in space. The simplest explanation
was that they actually WERE evenly distributed

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.750
in space, but it was WE who were off-center.
Measurements put the Sun about 25,000 light

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.040
years from the galactic center, which was
in the direction of Sagittarius.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.349
Hey, that’s where the glow of the Milky
Way in the sky gets brighter and broadens

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.120
out, too! Coincidence?

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.220
So at this point things were coming together.
The Milky Way must be a flattened disk, with

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.020
a bulge in the middle. The Sun is in that
disk, far from the center. From inside it,

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.590
we see it as a broad line in the sky, and
when we look toward the center, toward Sagittarius

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.780
in the sky, we see that bulge as a big blob.
The disk is thinner than it is broad, so we

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.239
see more stars looking INTO the disk then
we do looking up or down OUT of it.

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.539
But what about the disk itself? Does it have
structure in it, or is it more like a smooth flat, plate?

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.330
That’s hard to determine using visible light.
Dust severely restricts our view; looking

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.580
into the disk we can only see about a thousand
light years before dust blocks everything behind it.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.560
But with the advent of radio astronomy we
figured that out too. Star forming gas clouds

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:14.020
emit a very narrow wavelength range of radio
waves, and this could be used to measure their

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.190
Doppler shift, how quickly they were moving
toward or away from us. Making a few other

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.360
basic assumptions, their rough distance could
be found as well. An amazing result was found:

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.730
The locations of these nebulae indicated that
the disk of the Milky Way was divided into

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.600
SPIRAL ARMS; huge, sweeping, curving arms
that were tens of thousands of light years

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.850
along their lengths.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.100
Interestingly, all the young, massive, bright
stars appeared to be in these spiral arms

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.690
too, with none in the apparent gaps between
the arms. But that makes sense: Like all stars,

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.940
these massive ones form in giant nebulae,
but unlike most stars they don’t live very

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.910
long before exploding as supernovae. If most
nebulae are in the arms, then these massive

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.680
stars will be too; they don’t live long
enough to get very far from their nurseries

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.970
before they explode.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.240
Here’s where things get a bit weird. You
might want to think of the arms as structures;

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.620
huge collections of stars and nebulae moving
together around the galaxy’s center. But

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.300
that can’t be right: If that were the case,
they’d wind up like string on a spool, since

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.190
the stars and nebulae closer to the galactic
center orbit faster. But we know the spiral

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.610
arms have been around a while, and AREN’T
wound up.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.840
That’s because they aren’t actual structures.
They’re traffic jams.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.530
Think about a highway with heavy traffic on
it. For some reason one car slows down a little.

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.979
The car behind it slows, and the car behind
that one hits the brakes, too. It’s like

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.070
a wave that moves backwards through traffic,
slowing everyone down. Where they slow down

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.850
they tend to clump up, too, so you see more
cars and trucks in the jam.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.370
The funny thing about traffic jams is, they
tend to persist for a long time even as cars

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.870
move out of them. The car at the front might
slow for a moment, then accelerate away. But

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.419
the cars behind it are still moving slowly,
and more cars are piling up in the rear. For

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:57.760
every car that leaves the jam at the front,
another enters from the back. Even though

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.350
the actual INDIVIDUAL cars come and go, the
jam persists!

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.790
Spiral arms are the same sort of phenomenon.
The initial wave, the jam, may be started

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:11.100
by some sort of disturbance in the disk, perhaps
an overdense region created when a couple

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.509
of giant molecular clouds smash together.
Once created, this effect propagates outward

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:19.729
like a ripple in a pond, and gets sheared
into a spiral wave pattern by the rotation

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:24.530
of objects in the disk. Stars and nebulae
enter the wave, pile up a bit, move through

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:29.310
it, and then resume their merry way once they
leave it. Our Sun takes about 250 million

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.960
years to orbit the galaxy, which means it’s
made about 20 orbits since it was born; it’s

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.310
moved in and out of spiral arms many times
over its long life.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:42.479
That’s why spiral arms don’t wind up:
The arms are waves made up of objects in them,

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:44.570
but the objects themselves are transient.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:49.630
However, there’s more to it. A nebula entering
a spiral arm might hit another one already

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:54.889
in there — a cosmic fender bender. But when
that happens the nebulae can collapse, forming

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:59.320
stars. Some of them are massive: luminous,
blue, and hot. These stars are very easy to

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:04.030
spot at great distances, making the galaxy’s
spiral arms look blue. They also light up

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.090
the gas around them, accentuating the spiral
arms.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.780
Spiral arms are where the majority of star
birth occurs in the galaxy, which helps maintain

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.449
the spiral pattern. They’re the ultimate
crowd-sourced projects.

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:19.150
After all that, it’s actually hard to say
how many spiral arms the Milky Way has! It’s

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:23.590
been thought to have two for a long time,
but a recent study of the locations of star

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.030
clusters seems to indicate there are actually
four!

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:32.729
Milky Wayologists are still arguing it, but
either way, there are also short spurs that

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:37.669
stream off of the major arms as well. Our Sun
is located just outside one of those smaller

00:07:37.669 --> 00:07:39.300
arms, called the Orion Arm.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:44.020
Mapping the galaxy’s spiral arms is ongoing
work and it’s kind of a mess. It’s like

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:48.840
being inside a hurricane and trying to figure out
its structure. But we’re doing pretty well so far.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:53.319
In the center of the galaxy is the bulge.
Recent observations indicate this is ACTUALLY

00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:58.400
a cylindrical bar of redder stars that’s
pointed nearly directly at us, so it looks

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:03.400
more circular to us. This region is very old;
all the star birth in there happened long

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:08.389
ago, and ceased when the gas ran out. Unlike
the spiral arms, where stars are still actively

00:08:08.389 --> 00:08:14.020
being born, all the blue stars in the bar
are long dead, exploded, leaving behind billions

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.000
of lower mass, redder stars.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.720
The bar is probably about 20,000 light years
long. This odd structure is due to the weird

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:26.250
gravity of the galactic disk. Unlike our solar
system where the central Sun dominates the

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:32.000
gravity, the gravity of the galaxy is spread
out over a huge area. This distribution of

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.279
stars and gravity means weird structures can
pop up and self-maintain, like spiral arms,

00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:42.580
and central bars. Unlike the arms, though,
the bar rotates as a single unit; stars near

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:46.200
the edge make one orbit in the same time as
the stars closer in.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:51.959
In the very center of the galaxy sits a VERY
massive black hole, one with four million

00:08:51.959 --> 00:08:56.830
times the mass of the Sun. This might seem
huge, but remember the galaxy has hundreds

00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:01.330
of BILLIONS of stars in it. The central black
hole is actually just a teeny tiny part of

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:05.750
the galaxy by mass, but we’ll learn more
about it in a future episode, and see that

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:09.720
it may have played a very big role in our
galaxy’s formation and evolution.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:15.020
The last component of the Milky Way is its
halo, a vast, spherical cloud of stars surrounding

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:19.310
it out to great distance, more than 100,000
light years. We don’t know much about the

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:24.040
halo, but we know the stars in it are old.
No star formation occurs there, so any stars

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:28.899
we do see WOULD be old. It’s possible some
stars in the halo formed there, while others

00:09:28.899 --> 00:09:33.399
were flung out into the halo after collisions
with other stars in clusters. Speaking of

00:09:33.399 --> 00:09:37.870
which, most of the globular clusters orbiting
the Milky Way are in the halo. There are more

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.410
than 150 in total.

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:44.279
So, there you have it, our local galactic
town. But like any denizen of a small town,

00:09:44.279 --> 00:09:49.170
it’s natural to wonder if this is all there
is. What else is out there? And at the beginning

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:52.480
of the 20th century, astronomers started to
ask the same thing.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.600
Is the Milky Way THE galaxy, or A galaxy?

00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:01.320
Oooh, we’re about to take a big step here with
Crash Course Astronomy. A REALLY big step.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:07.180
Better strap in. Starting with the next episode,
the Universe is about to get a LOT bigger.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:11.980
Today you learned the Milky Way is a disk
galaxy, a collection of dust, gas, and hundreds

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:16.870
of billions of stars, with the Sun located
about halfway out from the center. The disk

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:21.670
has grand spiral patterns in it, formed by
the traffic jams of stars and nebulae, where

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:26.779
stars are born. The central region is shaped
like a bar, and is mostly old, red stars.

00:10:26.779 --> 00:10:29.519
There’s also a halo surrounding us of old
stars.
