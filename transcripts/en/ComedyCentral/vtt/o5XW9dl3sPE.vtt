&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Any savvy Internet

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:03.437
user is familiar with Godwin's

00:00:03.437 --> 00:00:04.505
law, which states that as an

00:00:04.505 --> 00:00:05.706
online discussion progresses, it

00:00:05.706 --> 00:00:06.807
becomes inevitable that someone

00:00:06.807 --> 00:00:09.109
will be compared to Hitler.

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:10.277
And if you don't believe me,

00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:11.445
you're worse than Hitler.

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:13.347
Well, now Twitter's Stephan

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:14.681
Heck-- watch your language-- has

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:15.816
coined a brand-new law even more

00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:17.718
relevant for our horny modern

00:00:17.718 --> 00:00:20.053
world: Brazzers' Law.

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:21.321
Now, if you're unfamiliar with

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:22.556
Brazzers, it's the wildly

00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:24.057
popular porn site that you've

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:24.791
just pretended to be unfamiliar

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:25.792
with.

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:26.793
(laughter)

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:27.794
So, comedians, what is Brazzers'

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:28.495
Law?

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:30.163
What is it? Paul F. Tompkins.

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:31.298
&gt;&gt; Uh, Brazzers' Law comes on

00:00:31.298 --> 00:00:32.799
after Rizzoli &amp; Isles, right?

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:35.102
(laughter)

00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:38.038
(whooping, applause)

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:43.076
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK (laughing): That's

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:44.077
amazing.

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:46.113
&gt;&gt; Brazzers! In my office! Now!

00:00:46.113 --> 00:00:47.114
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: All right,

00:00:47.114 --> 00:00:48.248
all right.

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:49.850
What do you want, Chief?

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.185
What do you want?

00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:54.321
(laughter, applause)

00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:55.322
I got a hot lead.

00:00:55.322 --> 00:00:55.822
&gt;&gt; A hot lead?

00:00:55.822 --> 00:00:56.823
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Yeah, I got a hot

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:58.125
lead on this story.

00:00:58.125 --> 00:00:59.126
There's no time for questions!

00:00:59.126 --> 00:00:59.626
&gt;&gt; Listen.

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:00.627
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: What?

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:01.695
&gt;&gt; There's a guy running around

00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:02.863
the city using a lady voice.

00:01:02.863 --> 00:01:03.864
(laughter)

00:01:03.864 --> 00:01:04.865
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: I'll find him!

00:01:04.865 --> 00:01:07.134
I'll find him. Thank you.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.273
(laughing): There's a guy...

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:15.409
Ah... ah, okay. All right.

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:16.410
Oh, other people have answers,

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.411
too.

00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:19.146
Uh, Jessica.

00:01:19.146 --> 00:01:20.547
&gt;&gt; Uh, yeah, it's: When God

00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:22.149
closes a pussy, he opens a

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.150
backdoor.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.784
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: That's great.

00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:24.785
Yes, points.

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:26.720
(applause, whooping)

00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:32.159
(laughter)

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.594
Uh, closed.

00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:35.462
(laughter)

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:37.130
Uh, Kurt Braunohler.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.198
&gt;&gt; I'll always be surprised to

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:39.533
find out I have a smaller dick

00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:40.567
than I thought I did.

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:41.802
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Yes, points.

00:01:41.802 --> 00:01:43.504
Very good.

00:01:43.504 --> 00:01:44.805
But you're all wrong!

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:46.740
Brazzers' Law states that...

00:01:51.612 --> 00:01:53.647
Por example, this Trump

00:01:53.647 --> 00:01:55.582
supporter tweets...

00:02:00.888 --> 00:02:01.922
And then literally one minute

00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:03.223
later he tweets at porn star

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:05.192
Sara Jay: Tits!

00:02:05.192 --> 00:02:07.561
(laughter)

00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:09.930
&gt;&gt; What? What?

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:10.931
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: How are you

00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:12.432
supposed to respond to that?

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:14.735
&gt;&gt; I mean, was that in response

00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:15.302
to something?
