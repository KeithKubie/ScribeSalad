00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.200
I want to make a quick note in
this video because I realized

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.270
that some of these ratio and
rate algebraic problems can

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:09.470
get a little bit confusing.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.000
So I just want to make
sure you get the

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.080
intuition behind it.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.090
So if I were to tell you that
Sal takes-- I don't know--

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.530
let's say he takes 1
hour to eat a pie.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.420
Let me pick a number
better than 1.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.190
Let's say he takes 2 hours.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.340
2 hours to eat a pie.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.280
So he takes 2 hours per pie.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:37.320
And let's say Dean takes
3 hours to eat a pie.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.500
So he takes 3 hours per pie.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.210
And if I were to ask you, how
long does it take for both of

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.670
them, if they're both working
together, how long will it

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.630
take them to eat a pie?

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.880
You might be wondering, well,
why can't I just add the 2

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.060
hours per pie and the
3 hours per pie?

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:05.170
Why can't I just do 2 hours per
pie plus 3 hours per pie?

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.980
Why would this be incorrect?

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.420
Why wouldn't this be their
combined rate?

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.610
I guess the best way to think
about it is think about what's

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.200
happening here.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.620
You're saying that Sal takes
2 hours a pie, Dean takes 3

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.470
hours a pie.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.020
If they're both working on the
same pie, it's going to take

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.900
them less time.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.670
They're going to do it faster.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.610
But when you add the hours,
what are you doing?

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.410
You're going to get
5 hours per pie.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.880
This is not answering the
question, how many hours will

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.230
it take for them to
finish one pie?

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.680
This is answering the question,
how much total time

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.040
would be spent if they each
independently ate a pie?

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.330
Sal would spend 2 and then
Dean would spend 3.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.210
Their total time would be 5.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.110
So we're just adding
times here.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.490
If you really want to combine
their effort, you want to

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.600
combine their rates, you have
to express both of these in

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.000
terms of rates.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.690
And if you want to express 2
hours per pie in terms of

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.220
rate, you would say that this
is the same thing as-- you

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.410
would just write the ratio
the other way around.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:13.200
Instead of 2 hours per pie you
would say, 1 pie per 2 hours,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.660
for 2 hours.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.810
Or you could view it as
1/2 pie per hours.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.510
Now it is expressed as a rate.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.700
Do the same thing for Dean.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.530
Instead of 3 hours per pie, you
could say that he would do

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.000
1 pie every 3 hours.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.200
Or another way to think about
it is he does 1/3

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.030
of a pie per hour.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.080
Now we're speaking in
a language of rates.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.620
How many pies per hour I can
do, how many Dean can do.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.670
If we combine it, then we
have our combined rate.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:56.640
So if we add 1/2 plus 1/3, that
is our combined rate in

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.560
pies per hour.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.350
And what is this equal to?

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.540
1/2 is 3/6.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.460
Plus 1/3 is 2/6, which
is equal to 5/6.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.720
All the units here are
in pies per hour.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.580
And then if we wanted to
say, how many hours?

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.590
So we would do literally 5/6 of
a pie per hour when we're

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.980
eating together.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.210
Now if you want to say how many
hours per pie, you would

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.260
just write this ratio.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.320
You would just flip it.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:29.040
So this is the same thing
as 6/5 hours per pie.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.290
So hopefully that makes sense.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.700
I don't want this to seem like
some type of voodoo where I

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.680
just decide arbitrarily to flip
both of these numbers.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.300
I'm flipping them so I can
express them as rates.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.020
Which hopefully makes intuitive
sense because you

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.300
can only add rates.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.850
If you add the times, you're
not saying that they're

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.190
working on the same pie.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.000
You're saying how much total
time is it taking them.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.240
Only when you're flipping them
and combining you're saying,

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.990
hey, their rates are being
combined on the same effort.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.280
I can combine them.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.450
And that'll tell you their
combined rate.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.900
And then you can take the flip
of that and say, on a combined

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.530
basis, how many hours?

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.990
And it should make
intuitive sense.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.150
If we're both eating the same
pie, it's going to take fewer

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.530
hours than either of us.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.640
And 6/5 is 1 and 1/5
hours or 1.2 hours.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.580
Or 1 hour and 12 minutes,
which makes sense.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.740
It's a little bit more than
if you had two Sals.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.930
Two Sals would take 1 hour.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.000
And two Deans would take
an hour and a half.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.700
So it's someplace in between
those two numbers.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.180
Which hopefully, make sense.
