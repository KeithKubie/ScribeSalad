00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.250
The Joe Rogan experience. I was broken. I was coming up, man. Let me just start.

2
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.680
Huh? Where'd you start doing standup? Back in Detroit. In Detroit? Yeah. I was,

3
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.780
um, my brother used to go to acting class on Thursday and his wife, I said,

4
00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:16.670
well that's pretty cool. I should try to be an actor.

5
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.050
So I got in the yellow pages, they had them yellow page.

6
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.910
They don't have now though.

7
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.920
Everybody got to go through the phone and get the number,

8
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.460
but they had the yellow pages. I go, I went the yellow pages.

9
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.910
I went to an acting class, private acting lessons, and I had called the guy,

10
00:00:28.911 --> 00:00:33.170
he said, $25 an hour. Come on over. I'm done. We can get started.

11
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.710
So this teacher had John [inaudible] acting classes could in a comedy show once

12
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.910
once a year and you say, I want you to be on the show. I said,

13
00:00:42.911 --> 00:00:44.900
I don't want him about no comedy. He said, well you,

14
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.260
this was very lucrative business. You can make a lot of money. I said,

15
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.123
we really,

16
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.170
I one that stole the show. Why is it, wait a minute.

17
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.870
That's funny. The oldest I used to do impressions of Nike and Cole,

18
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.790
Johnny Mathis and uh, wasn't boy Joe Cocker and all that stuff.

19
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.000
Oh, Mick Jagger. I used to Mick Jagger. Jeez, don't go eat,

20
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.960
go, go.

21
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.240
And they had about 500 people out there for the show.

22
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.390
I'm bouncing across the stage like Joe Cocker. Boy. It was so funny.

23
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.390
And I got a standing ovation and I said, wait,

24
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.050
am I could probably make some money doing this.

25
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.600
I really was money money was your number one motivation when you broke money is,

26
00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:33.680
you know, tell them I love it. Yeah. Fiction. That's some bull.

27
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.930
I didn't have it at my wish. I didn't have that luxury. No luxury.

28
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.480
Get out of my wish. I can count this.

29
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.590
Where did you start out in LA. What clubs did you start out here? Oh,

30
00:01:46.591 --> 00:01:51.350
I drove from here, joy to LA. I moved to New York. I moved to New York. Um,

31
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.650
six 71. 1971. That was about 30 years old. 29 30.

32
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.910
And then I went to material can be a fashion model. I was fashion mom,

33
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.740
Detroit fashion commercials.

34
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.660
I worked at Cadillac motorcar and,

35
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.100
and my job was plating bumpers, deep Dick fucking bumpers.

36
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.520
And so the bumpers, I would need the monies,

37
00:02:15.521 --> 00:02:18.280
I'm picking this up cause you know you use now, you used it in journalism. I,

38
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.610
you losing endorphins and everything else you got in your body to kick in and

39
00:02:21.611 --> 00:02:23.290
put this big bump on this fucking line.

40
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.470
Do it to keep going and get into the plating pit.

41
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.100
So I have now the bumper going down and I had about three minutes,

42
00:02:30.101 --> 00:02:33.720
I looked at his magazine, I saw that gas man next to a car.

43
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.460
So I look better than that dude. Damn. I went into the,

44
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.810
I went to the yellow pages again and got me a call.

45
00:02:42.811 --> 00:02:47.310
The acting lady called the M Marlene schools. They said, Oh sure, come on in.

46
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.790
They gave me a job that weekend. I thought I was hot there.

47
00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:52.380
I went to New York and I'm do look 10 times better than me

49
00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.330
I'm the midget model. So I couldn't do that. So I,

50
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.890
I uh, I got the hell out of there. I went back to the, you had went to New York.

I went to the [inaudible] and I'll stand up. Stand, cut that Molly.

55
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.530
Now cause I have never said that shit at work. Where did you uh,

56

57
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.140

58
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.670

59
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.440
Sam had to please Sam and Mitzi breaking up. Mitzi.

60
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.470

61
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.100

64
00:03:55.241 --> 00:03:57.610
Dave Letterman was EMC. The first shot I MC the second show.

65
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.520
He didn't have no money then either. He had a wife,

66
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.140
he had a red truck and a dog named Bob. That's the only thing.

67
00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:09.640
He came to LA with me. I just had this blue. I had this blue Whoa Mustang.

68
00:04:09.641 --> 00:04:11.670
I bought about 150 to drive to LA,

69
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.880
a hunting $50 car drill tail all the way to LA. Wow. You know,

70
00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:17.830
I was determined to get out there and get me some of that money.

71
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.720
Leaked all the transmission fluid.

72
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.500
I had to get out every 200 miles to fill the car back up with all and

73
00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:30.900
transmission fluid every 200 miles on a mouse. I bet that night man,

74
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.740
Oh, Oh. You hear this shit and it's donating only light.

75
00:04:35.741 --> 00:04:40.360
You see headlights on the car. I've got at that point got, I'm going to stick.

76
00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:43.090
I had to stick with me and put your head little funnel.

77
00:04:43.091 --> 00:04:46.720
Put that all in that car looking around. You know I'll be doing, yeah.

78
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.070
Uh huh. And got to California. No, I actually went to the Las Vegas person.

79
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.290
I'm fucked. You got stuck. I got stuck in LA. He told me about that.

80
00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.830
What happened? That blew his money.

81
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.000
I had a guy tell me to keep this thing in front of you. Can you grab that? Oh,

82
00:05:04.001 --> 00:05:08.980
here. Yeah. Tell me my friend, he rich boy.

83
00:05:08.981 --> 00:05:12.220
He said, look, just go to go to Las Vegas per se with the comics are doing.

84
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.120
Then you go to LA di, you know what they're doing and they get,

85
00:05:16.121 --> 00:05:19.920
that's the comics. They work in Las Vegas all the time. I went there,

86
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.120
the old ass joke, Jewish joke. They planned to tell it and, but gay Kaplan,

87
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.190
this old, funny big head look. Ain't funny. He's a good actor,

88
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.930
but he, he was, I waste all my time.

89
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.120
He told me stay there half an hour. I mean halfway half of 30 days, stay there.

90
00:05:40.121 --> 00:05:45.121
So I paid up my rent for 30 days and I went that night I met my new man Navy

91
00:05:45.551 --> 00:05:49.680
suit on him and shot up his, I can beat boy Marlene close. You know what I mean?

92
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.870
Standing around, you know, had a big old Afro man.

93
00:05:52.871 --> 00:05:57.470
I lost every dime I had at that fucking horseshoe casino. I was,

94
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.590
I went back home crying. So

95
00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.750
now I don't know what the hell I'm gonna do here. I didn't,

96
00:06:03.751 --> 00:06:08.340
I drove two and a half days across the country and so I,

97
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.510
I called people in Detroit, try get some money, but you know when you call them,

98
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:14.450
you don't always wait. Hey, nobody got no money. People don't answer the phone.

99
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:16.490
They say, Oh no, I ain't got no money.

100
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.810
So I got some more borrow money from some of my friends in the state.

101
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.540
Had to stay there for six months till I got no money to go to LA.

102
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.820
Well you said that then you tell me that you hit,

103
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.340
you did one of the slot machines in it. It hit with Adoree grant.

104
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:36.380
I had $150 left. I saw Donna Rose. See what I would do,

105
00:06:36.381 --> 00:06:39.350
I would go at night and during the weekend,

106
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.120
during the weekend mean you can go to the front of the uh,

107
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.620
casinos and the guy in the front day say, I'm a comic.

108
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.820
I just want to sit in the back here and watch some the comic and I'm gone. They,

109
00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.350
they let you do that. Just sit there and wait to anybody.

110
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.390
Nobody's sitting there. They've got 2000 seats in little places,

111
00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:00.230
something like that. So I had a dollar and a half left. I saw down. And Ross,

112
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.450
he had a great show. So on the outlay, I said,

113
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:05.150
I'm gonna play this fucking money. I just just be broke.

114
00:07:05.151 --> 00:07:09.980
My check is coming from the unemployment. Uh, it'd be here another day or two.

115
00:07:09.981 --> 00:07:11.540
I can go without food for a day.

116
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.510
Most of them. I said, burglar, you better put some down here, n****r. Yes.

117
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.630
So I put that money in the machine. It rung up,

118
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:31.520
I think it was 7,000 rarely. Yeah. I thought I fucked up something.

119
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.790
Oh shit. Now what have I done? The guy came, well, he said, I just got on jobs.

120
00:07:36.791 --> 00:07:38.900
Just hold on, sir. I just got here.

121
00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:43.370
You had struck the jackpot today. Hustle jackpot.

122
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:48.980
I, he gay. He came and just put them $100 in my hand. It was like a miracle.

123
00:07:48.981 --> 00:07:53.540
Even like, like Moses came down to hand me some money or something.

124
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:58.190
They was so damn, that money felt so good. I went home

125
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.710
and pack my stuff. I had about two more days on my rent.

126
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.830
I got in that car, I got me some gas, Joe,

127
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.050
you know how they have in Vegas?

128
00:08:12.051 --> 00:08:14.420
They got the little Island in the middle of the street,

129
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:18.560
drove over that damn thing, going back, going the opposite direction. I said,

130

134
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:37.760
I drove all the way from three o'clock in the morning,

135
00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:39.890
four o'clock in the morning, wherever the timing was.

136
00:08:39.891 --> 00:08:41.480
I drove all the way back to LA. Um,

137
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:45.830
and my friend let me stay at her house for about a month. Candy.

138

147
00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:22.080
I come out here with big plans and I went straight.

148
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:26.160
I went straight to her house and I got a job at Gucci and I went to the comedy

149
00:09:26.161 --> 00:09:28.620
store and everything. I just stayed there. If you didn't go to Vegas,

150
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.660
would you have even gotten stuck? I wouldn't have gotten stuff.

151
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:33.150
So that's a six month.

152
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:36.660
That's a six month waiting game that you had to play because you lost some money

153
00:09:36.661 --> 00:09:37.250
on it.

154
00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:41.910
It's worse counting airplanes coming in and taken off cause you can see them

155
00:09:41.911 --> 00:09:45.740
from my, my door. You see the plane and come into the Karen,

156
00:09:45.741 --> 00:09:49.950
I think the name of the hotel at the video, the plane terminal.

157
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:53.640
They come in, you see them take off. That's all I did all day long. He playing,

158
00:09:53.641 --> 00:09:58.140
coming in as wild plane, taking off, playing, coming in, playing,

159
00:09:58.141 --> 00:10:02.280
dig it off and you're just stuck. They're stuck in Las Vegas.

160
00:10:02.281 --> 00:10:05.030
I learned I deserved my moneys.

161
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:08.880
So people are telling you your love money? Yes,

162
00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:13.320
I deserve every dime I went through today.

163
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:16.920
That shits. Oh my God.

164
00:10:16.921 --> 00:10:19.380
That car lasted for another four or five years.

165
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:23.340
Really fit 65 Mustang. That's a great car.

166
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:27.990
It is a great car. Regular gas. I gotta get some new tires.

167
00:10:27.991 --> 00:10:32.670
I told you I gotta be some new tires, a case of oil and a case,

168
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:35.521
and I got a,

169
00:10:35.521 --> 00:10:39.960
I never forgot I got my old color TV and a bucket of Kentucky fried chicken

170
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.590
back then. When you trying to get up in the store, how did,

171
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:46.850
how did the auditions go? What did they do? No, you don't have to.

172
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:51.180
You have to go through the a potluck. You had to go through that. Yeah. Oh yeah.

173
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.170
Oh yeah. Hoping Mike the same today. But it wasn't that many comments.

174
00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.090
Hit the close at about 11 o'clock. I didn't know comics that go on anymore.

175
00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:01.740
How many comics were there? Oh, he must've been about 10 15 really? Huh?

176
00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:06.480
What years is 74 so it was at the beginning. As soon as we,

177
00:11:06.481 --> 00:11:10.650
soon as Mitzi, Mitzi just started, I was there in the beginning. She, she,

178
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:15.510
she liked me. She get me, she, Johnny come out here and work the door.

179
00:11:15.511 --> 00:11:17.700
You can do anything you want. I said, I need a job. Mitzi.

180
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:22.920
So I hustled a door. Mitzi. She said, y'all better watch it Johnny.

181
00:11:22.921 --> 00:11:27.480
He can make some money at that damn door. What I would do, I was,

182
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:30.150
what'd he call him? Maitre D or somebody call him maitre D.

183
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.740
so I will put a reserved signs in the front seats up there.

184
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:39.450
Reserved for the owners, grandmother, Missouri, further mothers grant,

185
00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:44.190

186
00:11:44.191 --> 00:11:47.610
I mean the main room and the other room be crowded, packed people. I said,

187
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.180

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:04.660
So I would make, I would make,

192
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:14.830

193
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:20.740
$500,500. It wasn't that kind of money. That's a, that pictures her.

194
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:24.290
That's Mitzi. I know. I recognized that pigeon. Eh,

that's when she was younger though. Yeah.

196
00:12:25.781 --> 00:12:28.960
There's a photo that was from the comedy store that was sitting around the back

197
00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:33.460

But she's one of the most important people ever in comedy and comedy.

204
00:12:54.611 --> 00:12:56.860
And people don't realize that. A lot of people don't realize it.

205
00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:59.530
Mitzi was the shits.

206
00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:03.040
She and that little Pauline is crazy and running around. They little baby.

We don't have nobody to work the door. I can get up and go over there.

232
00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.500
Too much accent. You like saying centric two weeks injury.

233
00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:45.370
I didn't want to hang around too long. August. Still there out of his mind. See,

234
00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:49.060
he's still there. Aren't you still in there? He was there last night. Yeah,

235
00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:51.470

236
00:14:51.471 --> 00:14:55.040
when I go back down, I want to go once a year or so. But I see our guard.

237
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:59.900
I like August season. He was townies. Talented. Yes. Genius. But he didn't,

238
00:14:59.901 --> 00:15:03.890
he didn't want to lead a comic store. Mm. He got a radio station downstairs.

239
00:15:03.891 --> 00:15:06.770
He told me they have a podcast. What's a podcast though?

240
00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:10.010
They have a podcast studio. [inaudible] studio. Yeah.

241
00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:12.650
But Mitsi Ivanhoe and Mitzi. Mitzi.

242
00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:17.730
I knew her in 1974 when I went over there and I noticed when I got on,

243
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.870
when I got on, um,

244
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:26.110
open Mike night for people who wanted to try to become on the regular show.

245
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:31.880
Mitzi used to love impressionists. She loved people who could do voices.

246
00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.310
And I just realized that after about three weeks of being there,

247
00:15:34.311 --> 00:15:38.990
trying to be funny as shit, I'm doing old red Fox jokes. I'm doing a,

248
00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:43.400

252
00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:57.140
so at the end the person come out and sing.

253
00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:00.980
She loved people that saying Tina Turner women, this 18 attorney,

254
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:03.170
she put two or three of them right behind each other.

255
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:06.730
They still want the same song. Jesus, that's a MySequel and crazy boy.

256
00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:13.850
[inaudible] impressionist. But since y'all love the women,

257
00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:15.171
go do you know the women?

258
00:16:15.171 --> 00:16:18.230
All of them got the same impressions but she put the two or three of 'em on the

259
00:16:18.231 --> 00:16:22.900

263
00:16:34.311 --> 00:16:36.400
He put me on some nice times and shit. But,

264
00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:42.130
but she wanted me to stay with her on that door and emceeing help her out.

265
00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.360
She had me click closed the door closed the place. One day I just miss,
