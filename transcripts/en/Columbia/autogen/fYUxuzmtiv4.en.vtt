and government has to continue to
 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.609
and government has to continue to
mobilize for response as we work to

which is really what's going to solve
 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.670
which is really what's going to solve
this problem and begin reversing the the

causes of climate change we will still
need to adapt to the impact of the

need to adapt to the impact of the
 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.999
need to adapt to the impact of the

really what we're going to be talking

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939
really what we're going to be talking
 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.289
really what we're going to be talking
about tonight for the most part that

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299
about tonight for the most part that
 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:56.670
about tonight for the most part that
does not mean we're going to abandon

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680
does not mean we're going to abandon
 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.069
does not mean we're going to abandon
living near coasts i should say with a

00:01:59.069 --> 00:01:59.079
living near coasts i should say with a
 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:01.709
living near coasts i should say with a
city with 500 miles of coastline i don't

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:01.719
city with 500 miles of coastline i don't
 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:02.789
city with 500 miles of coastline i don't
think we're going to be heading for the

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799
think we're going to be heading for the
 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.950
think we're going to be heading for the
hills there's only so much room here on

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960
hills there's only so much room here on
 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.889
hills there's only so much room here on
Morningside Heights anyway and as near

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899
Morningside Heights anyway and as near
 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.450
Morningside Heights anyway and as near
as I can tell most of the apartments are

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460
as I can tell most of the apartments are
 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.610
as I can tell most of the apartments are
already full so we're going to need to

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620
already full so we're going to need to
 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.380
already full so we're going to need to
continue to live on our coast and I

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390
continue to live on our coast and I
 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.040
continue to live on our coast and I
think people want to do that the risk of

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050
think people want to do that the risk of
 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.660
think people want to do that the risk of
disaster doesn't mean that we're going

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670
disaster doesn't mean that we're going
 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:19.540
disaster doesn't mean that we're going
to abandon our

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550
to abandon our
 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.600
to abandon our
communities it's not clear if we look at

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610
communities it's not clear if we look at
 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.700
communities it's not clear if we look at
this nationally that any area is out of

this nationally that any area is out of
 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.020
this nationally that any area is out of
is away from risk whether you talk about

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030
is away from risk whether you talk about
 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.880
is away from risk whether you talk about
drought in the Midwest or fires and the

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890
drought in the Midwest or fires and the
 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.400
drought in the Midwest or fires and the
West potential for other kinds of

West potential for other kinds of
 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.960
West potential for other kinds of
natural disasters there is really no

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970
natural disasters there is really no
 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.670
natural disasters there is really no
place to hide we have to figure out a

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680
place to hide we have to figure out a
 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.830
place to hide we have to figure out a
way to reduce and mitigate climate

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840
way to reduce and mitigate climate
 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.840
way to reduce and mitigate climate
change and to adapt to the change that's

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850
change and to adapt to the change that's
 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.850
change and to adapt to the change that's
underway it means we have to develop

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860
underway it means we have to develop
 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.310
underway it means we have to develop
more resilient homes and infrastructure

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320
more resilient homes and infrastructure
 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.250
more resilient homes and infrastructure
and a more robust national program of

emergency response and insurance and of
 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.540
emergency response and insurance and of
course we really have to address the

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550
course we really have to address the
 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.240
course we really have to address the
basic issue of climate change however

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250
basic issue of climate change however
 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.620

it's not only climate change that's

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630
it's not only climate change that's

that means that storms that at one point

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750
that means that storms that at one point
 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.410
that means that storms that at one point
might have passed by a population now

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420
might have passed by a population now
 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.480
might have passed by a population now
we'll hit that population that

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490
we'll hit that population that
 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.790

to these kinds of emergencies science
 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.550
to these kinds of emergencies science
and technology has given us the gift of

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560
and technology has given us the gift of
 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.610
and technology has given us the gift of
our modern way of life but but it's also

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620
our modern way of life but but it's also
 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.740
our modern way of life but but it's also
given us the curse of pollution and

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750
given us the curse of pollution and
 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.530
given us the curse of pollution and
climate change my view is that we're

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540
climate change my view is that we're
 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.180
climate change my view is that we're
going to need science and technology to

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190
going to need science and technology to
 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.670

planning for the future what do we

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550
planning for the future what do we
 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.850
planning for the future what do we
currently know that isn't effectively

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860
currently know that isn't effectively
 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.590

being used in that loose plans so I'll

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600
being used in that loose plans so I'll
 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.880
being used in that loose plans so I'll
start with Adam and we'll work our way

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:11.890
start with Adam and we'll work our way
 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.500

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.510
 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:20.360
so I don't I haven't read all the

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370
so I don't I haven't read all the
 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.250
so I don't I haven't read all the
adaptation plans that are out there but

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260
adaptation plans that are out there but
 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.890
adaptation plans that are out there but
my sense is that we're still at the

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900
my sense is that we're still at the
 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.590
my sense is that we're still at the
beginning of actually using climate

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600
beginning of actually using climate
 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.800

information in in planning for the
 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.360
information in in planning for the
future in the sense that when it comes

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370
future in the sense that when it comes
 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.970
future in the sense that when it comes
to disasters I mean we have a sense you

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:37.980
to disasters I mean we have a sense you
 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.070
to disasters I mean we have a sense you
know floods like sandy we have a sense

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080
know floods like sandy we have a sense
 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.980
know floods like sandy we have a sense
of what the historical references are we

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:42.990
of what the historical references are we
 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.270
of what the historical references are we
have flood maps for example that are

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280
have flood maps for example that are
 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.980
have flood maps for example that are
based on the one in a hundred year flood

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:45.990
based on the one in a hundred year flood
 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.070
based on the one in a hundred year flood
or or some other metric like that that's

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080
or or some other metric like that that's
 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.100
or or some other metric like that that's
based on historical events but when it

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.110
based on historical events but when it
 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.150
based on historical events but when it
comes to when it comes to larger scale

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160
comes to when it comes to larger scale
 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.380
comes to when it comes to larger scale
climate variability and especially

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:57.390
climate variability and especially
 

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.990
climate variability and especially
anthropogenic climate change my sense is

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000
anthropogenic climate change my sense is
 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.960
anthropogenic climate change my sense is
that in some places like New York City

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:02.970
that in some places like New York City
 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:04.580
that in some places like New York City
there's been a fair amount of effort

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:04.590
there's been a fair amount of effort
 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.620
there's been a fair amount of effort
paid to understanding what that's going

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:06.630
paid to understanding what that's going
 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.120
paid to understanding what that's going
to mean locally they've been reports

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.130
to mean locally they've been reports
 

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:09.170
to mean locally they've been reports
written about how climate change is

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.180
written about how climate change is
 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.730
written about how climate change is
going to affect the city but i'm not

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:10.740
going to affect the city but i'm not
 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.850
going to affect the city but i'm not
sure if and maybe a surgery kind of

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860
sure if and maybe a surgery kind of
 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.350
sure if and maybe a surgery kind of
address this more effectively than i can

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360
address this more effectively than i can
 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.240
address this more effectively than i can
but i'm not sure if it's really been

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:17.250
but i'm not sure if it's really been
 

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.340
but i'm not sure if it's really been
used that much in the sense of actually

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:19.350
used that much in the sense of actually
 

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:20.600
used that much in the sense of actually
affecting a decision about anything

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:20.610
affecting a decision about anything
 

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:21.830
affecting a decision about anything
that's actually you know has anything

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840
that's actually you know has anything
 

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.300
that's actually you know has anything
actually changed yet because of a

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:23.310
actually changed yet because of a
 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.210
actually changed yet because of a
climate change projection i'm not sure i

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:26.220
climate change projection i'm not sure i
 

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.040
climate change projection i'm not sure i
think there's a heightened awareness now

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.050
think there's a heightened awareness now
 

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.570
think there's a heightened awareness now
and there was before sandy and it's even

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:29.580
and there was before sandy and it's even
 

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:30.800
and there was before sandy and it's even
higher now in this city's and the

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:30.810
higher now in this city's and the
 

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:34.280
higher now in this city's and the
leaders in that but whether whether this

real decisions have been made accounting

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:36.210
real decisions have been made accounting

for what we know is going to happen in

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:37.230
for what we know is going to happen in
 

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:38.510
for what we know is going to happen in
the future i don't know an example of

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:38.520
the future i don't know an example of
 

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.950
the future i don't know an example of
that is the new fema flood risk maps

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:39.960
that is the new fema flood risk maps
 

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.830
that is the new fema flood risk maps
which what's said about them is that

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:42.840
which what's said about them is that
 

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.240
which what's said about them is that
they don't account for sea level rides

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:44.250
they don't account for sea level rides
 

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.970
they don't account for sea level rides
yet although i might take on it is that

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:46.980
yet although i might take on it is that
 

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.320

maybe they sort of do even though

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:48.330
maybe they sort of do even though
 

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:49.760
maybe they sort of do even though
they're not saying it but that's an

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:49.770
they're not saying it but that's an
 

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:50.930
they're not saying it but that's an
example of where i think the information

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:50.940
example of where i think the information
 

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:56.090
example of where i think the information
isn't yet there Lisa the IRI is one of

its main purpose is actually to take

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:57.450
its main purpose is actually to take
 

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.540
its main purpose is actually to take
climate information and bring it to

00:07:59.540 --> 00:07:59.550
climate information and bring it to
 

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.550
climate information and bring it to
decision-makers so what's your take on

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:01.560
decision-makers so what's your take on
 

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.980
decision-makers so what's your take on
this question I like Adam I'm also

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:03.990
this question I like Adam I'm also
 

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.230
this question I like Adam I'm also
interested to hear what Sergei has to

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240
interested to hear what Sergei has to
 

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.000
interested to hear what Sergei has to
say about what New York is actually

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:08.010
say about what New York is actually
 

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:11.480
say about what New York is actually
doing but more broadly in communities

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:11.490
doing but more broadly in communities
 

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.090
doing but more broadly in communities
there's really two types of information

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:14.100
there's really two types of information
 

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.460
there's really two types of information
that are regularly being used about the

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:16.470
that are regularly being used about the
 

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.950
that are regularly being used about the
future one is just weather forecasts so

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960
future one is just weather forecasts so
 

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.470
future one is just weather forecasts so
that's not quite in that climate realm

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:20.480
that's not quite in that climate realm
 

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.550
that's not quite in that climate realm
and then there's climate change

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560
and then there's climate change
 

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.140
and then there's climate change
projections and so right now I would say

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:26.150
projections and so right now I would say
 

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.750
projections and so right now I would say
for most people most decision-makers the

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:28.760
for most people most decision-makers the
 

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.990
for most people most decision-makers the
future is synonymous with whatever the

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.000
future is synonymous with whatever the
 

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.060
future is synonymous with whatever the
climate change projections say and I

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:34.070
climate change projections say and I
 

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:35.500
climate change projections say and I
agree with that what adam says that

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:35.510
agree with that what adam says that
 

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.030
agree with that what adam says that
there has been a lot of awareness that's

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:37.040
there has been a lot of awareness that's
 

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:41.260
there has been a lot of awareness that's
been raised from these such as the

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:41.270
been raised from these such as the
 

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:44.560
been raised from these such as the
robustness of sea level rise at least

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:44.570
robustness of sea level rise at least
 

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.140
robustness of sea level rise at least
that it globally will rise the

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:47.150
that it globally will rise the
 

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.630
that it globally will rise the
temperatures will get warmer and in many

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:49.640
temperatures will get warmer and in many
 

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.040
temperatures will get warmer and in many
parts of the world were more likely to

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:51.050
parts of the world were more likely to
 

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:54.190
parts of the world were more likely to
experience extreme events but I think

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:54.200
experience extreme events but I think
 

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.560
experience extreme events but I think
what's missing from our plans of the

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:56.570
what's missing from our plans of the
 

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:59.470
what's missing from our plans of the
future is a more holistic view of

00:08:59.470 --> 00:08:59.480
future is a more holistic view of
 

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.330
future is a more holistic view of
climate the fact that climate

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:01.340
climate the fact that climate
 

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.980
climate the fact that climate
variability is a really important part

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:02.990
variability is a really important part
 

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:05.320
variability is a really important part
of the planning and climate varies on a

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:05.330
of the planning and climate varies on a
 

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.600
of the planning and climate varies on a
lot of different time scales and we are

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:07.610
lot of different time scales and we are
 

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:09.070
lot of different time scales and we are
going to get to climate change one year

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:09.080
going to get to climate change one year
 

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.690
going to get to climate change one year
at a time and so we need to bring

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:10.700
at a time and so we need to bring
 

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.160
at a time and so we need to bring
climate variability and climate change

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:12.170
climate variability and climate change
 

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:15.040
climate variability and climate change
together so i think that the things that

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:15.050
together so i think that the things that
 

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:16.390
together so i think that the things that
we already know that could be better

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:16.400
we already know that could be better
 

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.440
we already know that could be better
used in planning has to do with

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:19.450
used in planning has to do with
 

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:22.330
used in planning has to do with
historical risks and for example

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:22.340
historical risks and for example
 

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.640
historical risks and for example
seasonal climate forecasts which will

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:24.650
seasonal climate forecasts which will
 

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:27.010
seasonal climate forecasts which will
help us in at least our short term

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:27.020
help us in at least our short term
 

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.980
help us in at least our short term

Planning and infrastructure planning I

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:42.350
Planning and infrastructure planning I
 

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:43.900
Planning and infrastructure planning I
like to take a step back and just think

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:43.910
like to take a step back and just think
 

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:45.700
like to take a step back and just think
for a second about New York City really

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:45.710
for a second about New York City really
 

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:47.620
for a second about New York City really

is a marvel of engineering when you
 

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.570
is a marvel of engineering when you
think about for a second the fact that

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:49.580
think about for a second the fact that
 

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:50.860
think about for a second the fact that
we have you know the oldest and densest

of this endowment and also to think hard

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:19.580
of this endowment and also to think hard
 

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.190
of this endowment and also to think hard
about new ways of doing things as well

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.200
about new ways of doing things as well
 

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.080
about new ways of doing things as well

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:23.090
and I think you know New Yorkers are
 

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.480

you turn back the clock back to two

00:10:41.439 --> 00:10:41.449

thousand six on the mayor really

00:10:42.849 --> 00:10:42.859
thousand six on the mayor really
 

00:10:42.859 --> 00:10:44.739
thousand six on the mayor really
convened all the city agencies for to

00:10:44.739 --> 00:10:44.749
convened all the city agencies for to
 

00:10:44.749 --> 00:10:48.429
convened all the city agencies for to
create play NYC in 2007 and really the

00:10:48.429 --> 00:10:48.439
create play NYC in 2007 and really the
 

00:10:48.439 --> 00:10:50.319
create play NYC in 2007 and really the
goal was to accommodate a million more

00:10:50.319 --> 00:10:50.329
goal was to accommodate a million more
 

00:10:50.329 --> 00:10:52.059
goal was to accommodate a million more
people and make the city greener more

00:10:52.059 --> 00:10:52.069
people and make the city greener more
 

00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:54.669
people and make the city greener more
sustainable and more resilient also and

00:10:54.669 --> 00:10:54.679
sustainable and more resilient also and
 

00:10:54.679 --> 00:10:57.429
sustainable and more resilient also and
I think really the mayor bloomberg

00:10:57.429 --> 00:10:57.439
I think really the mayor bloomberg
 

00:10:57.439 --> 00:10:59.139
I think really the mayor bloomberg
really set the course sir I think was

00:10:59.139 --> 00:10:59.149
really set the course sir I think was
 

00:10:59.149 --> 00:11:00.939
really set the course sir I think was
one of the few cities really to take

droughts storms are probably to change

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:43.660
droughts storms are probably to change
 

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.420
droughts storms are probably to change
sea level rise is going to go up but

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:45.430
sea level rise is going to go up but
 

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:46.530
sea level rise is going to go up but
there's a very different levels of

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:46.540
there's a very different levels of
 

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:47.730
there's a very different levels of
uncertainty on those different

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:47.740
uncertainty on those different
 

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.320
uncertainty on those different
projections some things we're very

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:49.330
projections some things we're very
 

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:50.850
projections some things we're very
confident about the temperature going up

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:50.860
confident about the temperature going up
 

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:52.950
confident about the temperature going up
is one and it'll go up pretty much

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:52.960
is one and it'll go up pretty much
 

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.890
is one and it'll go up pretty much
everywhere with almost no exceptions and

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:55.900
everywhere with almost no exceptions and
 

00:14:55.900 --> 00:15:00.120
everywhere with almost no exceptions and
we know with some uncertainty how much

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:00.130
we know with some uncertainty how much
 

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:01.800
we know with some uncertainty how much
but the uncertainty is bigger than we

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:01.810
but the uncertainty is bigger than we
 

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:03.750
but the uncertainty is bigger than we
like it to be but it's it's it's what it

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:03.760
like it to be but it's it's it's what it
 

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:04.920
like it to be but it's it's it's what it
is and it definitely rules out some

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:04.930
is and it definitely rules out some
 

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:06.240
is and it definitely rules out some
possibilities on the low end of the high

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:06.250
possibilities on the low end of the high
 

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:10.080
possibilities on the low end of the high
end so I think on the one hand we have

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:10.090
end so I think on the one hand we have
 

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:14.070
end so I think on the one hand we have
to be aware of the the high risk events

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:14.080
to be aware of the the high risk events
 

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.990
to be aware of the the high risk events
like sandy that we can't quantify the

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.000
like sandy that we can't quantify the
 

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.610
like sandy that we can't quantify the
risk all that precisely we don't know

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:17.620
risk all that precisely we don't know
 

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:20.130
risk all that precisely we don't know
how the changes with that much precision

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:20.140
how the changes with that much precision
 

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:21.540
how the changes with that much precision
how much more frequent they're going to

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:21.550
how much more frequent they're going to
 

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:22.830
how much more frequent they're going to
be in the future or how much in more

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:22.840
be in the future or how much in more
 

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.390
be in the future or how much in more
intense but then there's some things we

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:24.400
intense but then there's some things we
 

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.340
intense but then there's some things we
are very confident about and I don't

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:26.350
are very confident about and I don't
 

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:27.840
are very confident about and I don't
think we're using that information as as

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:27.850
think we're using that information as as
 

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:30.060
think we're using that information as as
well as we could one example that's

that would be distributed through the UN
and other mechanism so the question they

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:06.850
and other mechanism so the question they
 

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:08.850
and other mechanism so the question they
asked was how is climate science being

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:08.860
asked was how is climate science being
 

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.710
asked was how is climate science being
used in what these countries are saying

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720
used in what these countries are saying
 

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:11.500
used in what these countries are saying
they need to do

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:11.510
they need to do
 

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:13.300
they need to do
to prepare for climate change and what

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:13.310
to prepare for climate change and what
 

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:16.480
to prepare for climate change and what
they found was that the the plans by and

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:16.490
they found was that the the plans by and
 

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:19.150
they found was that the the plans by and
large were based on adapting to what's

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:19.160
large were based on adapting to what's
 

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.610
large were based on adapting to what's
currently the most the biggest hazard in

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:21.620
currently the most the biggest hazard in
 

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:22.930
currently the most the biggest hazard in
the current climate which is natural

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:22.940
the current climate which is natural

variability in rainfall creating

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:24.290
variability in rainfall creating
 

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:26.650
variability in rainfall creating
droughts in some years so currently the

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:26.660
droughts in some years so currently the
 

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:28.990
droughts in some years so currently the
big risk for agriculture in this region

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:29.000
big risk for agriculture in this region
 

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.660
big risk for agriculture in this region
of Africa is drought and so there's

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:31.670
of Africa is drought and so there's
 

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:33.040
of Africa is drought and so there's
droughts every so often sometimes they

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:33.050
droughts every so often sometimes they
 

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:35.140
droughts every so often sometimes they
can last for several years or even ten

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:35.150
can last for several years or even ten
 

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:36.280
can last for several years or even ten
years and that could be very

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:36.290
years and that could be very
 

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:38.380
years and that could be very
catastrophic and so precipitation is the

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:38.390
catastrophic and so precipitation is the
 

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:39.940
catastrophic and so precipitation is the
problem for agriculture and the plans

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:39.950
problem for agriculture and the plans
 

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:43.090

that will happen is that the
 

00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:20.079

events with higher rainfall leading to
 

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:34.450
events with higher rainfall leading to
more flooding and we pretty confident

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:34.460
more flooding and we pretty confident
 

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.070
more flooding and we pretty confident
about that those are the two things we

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080
about that those are the two things we
 

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.870
about that those are the two things we
know with the most certainty will be

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:37.880
know with the most certainty will be
 

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.100
know with the most certainty will be
different in the future and because

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:39.110
different in the future and because
 

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:41.190
different in the future and because
they're out a sample I mean because they

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:41.200
they're out a sample I mean because they
 

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.210
they're out a sample I mean because they
isn't within the range of natural

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:43.220
isn't within the range of natural
 

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:44.890
isn't within the range of natural
variability the the plans really didn't

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:44.900
variability the the plans really didn't
 

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:45.940
variability the the plans really didn't
account for that and so that's an

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:45.950
account for that and so that's an
 

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:48.640
account for that and so that's an
example where the current climate

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:48.650
example where the current climate
 

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:50.740

it is that that it could be getting

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:54.440
it is that that it could be getting
 

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.990
it is that that it could be getting
ahead of the curve based on the science

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.000
ahead of the curve based on the science
 

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.010

but instead they're adapting to the
 

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.240
but instead they're adapting to the
problems of past and I think that if we

problems of past and I think that if we
 

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:02.440

look at I suspect that that conclusion

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:02.450
look at I suspect that that conclusion
 

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:04.690
look at I suspect that that conclusion

in regions of the Sahel the variability
 

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:27.180
in regions of the Sahel the variability
is critical and so it's it's maybe not

a really important point to make and so

okay which is to say what kind of

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:16.650
okay which is to say what kind of
 

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:18.770
okay which is to say what kind of
science information do you know this out

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:18.780
science information do you know this out
 

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.660
science information do you know this out
there that you wish you could figure out

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:20.670
there that you wish you could figure out
 

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:21.860

some way to bring into the

decision-making process and you know I
 

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.910
decision-making process and you know I
know a lot about this is making

rational marched decisions until there's
an answer and in fact what happens in

an answer and in fact what happens in
 

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:36.800
an answer and in fact what happens in
the policy process is we're just trying

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:36.810
the policy process is we're just trying
 

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:40.040
the policy process is we're just trying
to make things less bad and and that the

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:40.050
to make things less bad and and that the
 

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:41.810
to make things less bad and and that the
process making things less bad we

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:41.820
process making things less bad we

sometimes when information but sometimes
 

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.530
sometimes when information but sometimes
we just do not have any because sort of

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:45.540
we just do not have any because sort of
 

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:46.970
we just do not have any because sort of
what you don't know can't hurt you but

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:46.980
what you don't know can't hurt you but
 

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:49.190
what you don't know can't hurt you but
let me just put the question to you what

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200
let me just put the question to you what
 

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.480
let me just put the question to you what
kind of science information would you

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:50.490
kind of science information would you
 

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:52.310
kind of science information would you
like to have yeah let's do you think you

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320
like to have yeah let's do you think you
 

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.620
like to have yeah let's do you think you
for that I think our administration is

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:54.630
for that I think our administration is
 

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:55.970
for that I think our administration is
very data-driven and science driven we

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:55.980
very data-driven and science driven we
 

00:20:55.980 --> 00:21:00.500
very data-driven and science driven we
want the science to lead I think the way

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:00.510
want the science to lead I think the way
 

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:01.520
want the science to lead I think the way
the way I look at it if you look at

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:01.530
the way I look at it if you look at
 

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:03.050
the way I look at it if you look at
across infrastructure classes in New

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:03.060
across infrastructure classes in New
 

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:06.130
across infrastructure classes in New
York City to me it seems that the

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:06.140
York City to me it seems that the
 

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:09.110
York City to me it seems that the
climate risks right now are not really

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120
climate risks right now are not really
 

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.850
climate risks right now are not really
included in the regulatory frameworks

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:10.860
included in the regulatory frameworks
 

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:14.300
included in the regulatory frameworks
that that govern energy telecom and

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:14.310
that that govern energy telecom and
 

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:16.250
that that govern energy telecom and
other critical infrastructures so right

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:16.260
other critical infrastructures so right
 

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:19.010
other critical infrastructures so right
now there there is not a clear road map

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:19.020
now there there is not a clear road map
 

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:23.300
now there there is not a clear road map
at the regulatory level and so we can

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:23.310
at the regulatory level and so we can
 

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:24.830
at the regulatory level and so we can
talk about specific types of data that

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:24.840
talk about specific types of data that
 

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.210
talk about specific types of data that
would be needed and which ones are there

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:26.220
would be needed and which ones are there
 

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:28.370
would be needed and which ones are there
or not but I think one of the one of the

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:28.380
or not but I think one of the one of the
 

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:30.320
or not but I think one of the one of the
insights I think is that you know

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:30.330
insights I think is that you know
 

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:32.000
insights I think is that you know
regulators tend to look at costs rather

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:32.010
regulators tend to look at costs rather
 

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:34.790
regulators tend to look at costs rather
than performance so how do you one of

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:34.800
than performance so how do you one of
 

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.410
than performance so how do you one of
the challenges is how do you say well in

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:36.420
the challenges is how do you say well in
 

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.240
the challenges is how do you say well in
order to mitigate this risk should I

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:38.250
order to mitigate this risk should I
 

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:39.440
order to mitigate this risk should I
spend a hundred million dollars to spend

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:39.450
spend a hundred million dollars to spend
 

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:41.720
spend a hundred million dollars to spend
a billion dollars on it so I think you

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:41.730
a billion dollars on it so I think you
 

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:42.830
a billion dollars on it so I think you
need to put in the cost-benefit

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:42.840
need to put in the cost-benefit
 

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.500
need to put in the cost-benefit
framework and I think the climate

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:45.510
framework and I think the climate
 

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:47.870
framework and I think the climate
science community and the what is a very

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:47.880
science community and the what is a very
 

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.690
science community and the what is a very
mature risk management industry and the

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:50.700
mature risk management industry and the
 

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.400
mature risk management industry and the
utilities and infrastructure operators

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:52.410
utilities and infrastructure operators
 

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:53.960
utilities and infrastructure operators
they need to speak each other's

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:53.970
they need to speak each other's
 

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:56.330
they need to speak each other's
languages and I think that we're seeing

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:56.340
languages and I think that we're seeing
 

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.640
languages and I think that we're seeing
that start to happen but it's not quite

00:21:58.640 --> 00:21:58.650
that start to happen but it's not quite
 

00:21:58.650 --> 00:21:59.930
that start to happen but it's not quite
there yet and I think that's one of the

00:21:59.930 --> 00:21:59.940
there yet and I think that's one of the
 

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.030
there yet and I think that's one of the
reasons that regulators struggle to

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:02.040
reasons that regulators struggle to
 

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.280
reasons that regulators struggle to
figure out exactly what price tag to put

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:04.290
figure out exactly what price tag to put
 

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:06.770
figure out exactly what price tag to put
on an investment that would mitigate

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:06.780
on an investment that would mitigate
 

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:10.430
on an investment that would mitigate
against some type of risk so they want

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:10.440
against some type of risk so they want
 

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.240
against some type of risk so they want
to see better confidence intervals and

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:13.250
to see better confidence intervals and
 

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:15.830
to see better confidence intervals and
more more the kind of work up that they

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840
more more the kind of work up that they
 

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.680
more more the kind of work up that they
normally include in their types of

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:18.690
normally include in their types of
 

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:20.950
normally include in their types of
analysis so that's that's an area that

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960
analysis so that's that's an area that
 

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.880
analysis so that's that's an area that
we need to see more

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:22.890
we need to see more
 

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:25.910
we need to see more
progress on do you writing notes you

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:25.920
progress on do you writing notes you
 

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.190
progress on do you writing notes you
have something you want to add to that

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:27.200
have something you want to add to that
 

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:32.450
have something you want to add to that
yeah I mean I was really thinking about

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:32.460
yeah I mean I was really thinking about
 

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:34.610
yeah I mean I was really thinking about
the different question which about what

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:34.620
the different question which about what
 

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:37.160
the different question which about what
you know that I just thinks there's a

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:37.170
you know that I just thinks there's a
 

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:40.000
you know that I just thinks there's a
couple good points I mean about the

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:40.010
couple good points I mean about the
 

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:42.140
couple good points I mean about the
better confidence intervals I mean I

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:42.150
better confidence intervals I mean I
 

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:46.070
better confidence intervals I mean I
think we the sort of we're here in some

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.080
think we the sort of we're here in some
 

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.750
think we the sort of we're here in some
sense a lot of people are here anyway

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760
sense a lot of people are here anyway
 

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:49.190
sense a lot of people are here anyway
although you planned this before sandy

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200
although you planned this before sandy
 

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.050
although you planned this before sandy
that some people are probably here

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:51.060
that some people are probably here
 

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:53.900
that some people are probably here
because of Sandy and and that's so these

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:53.910
because of Sandy and and that's so these
 

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:55.280
because of Sandy and and that's so these
kind of extreme events are poster

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:55.290
kind of extreme events are poster
 

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:57.950
kind of extreme events are poster
children for for climate change whether

00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:57.960
children for for climate change whether
 

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.680
children for for climate change whether
or not a particular event has any

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:00.690
or not a particular event has any
 

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:02.630
or not a particular event has any
climate change signal in it doesn't

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640
climate change signal in it doesn't
 

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.550
climate change signal in it doesn't
almost doesn't matter it brings all our

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:04.560
almost doesn't matter it brings all our
 

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:08.990
almost doesn't matter it brings all our
attention to to the risks that we are

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:09.000
attention to to the risks that we are
 

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.750
attention to to the risks that we are
facing and so the rare events are really

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760
facing and so the rare events are really
 

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:15.200
facing and so the rare events are really
important I mean although there are a

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:15.210
important I mean although there are a
 

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:17.000
important I mean although there are a
lot of different ways will feel climate

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:17.010
lot of different ways will feel climate
 

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:18.410
lot of different ways will feel climate
change and climate variability this is

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:18.420
change and climate variability this is
 

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.870
change and climate variability this is
actually right about that but but even

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880
actually right about that but but even
 

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.550
actually right about that but but even
in the present climate we're under risk

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:22.560
in the present climate we're under risk
 

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.230
in the present climate we're under risk
for extreme events and whether in the

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240
for extreme events and whether in the
 

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.300
for extreme events and whether in the
president of future climate the extreme

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:26.310
president of future climate the extreme
 

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:27.650
president of future climate the extreme
events are what we are going to be the

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:27.660
events are what we are going to be the
 

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.980
events are what we are going to be the
most harmful and I think the the risks

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:30.990
most harmful and I think the the risks
 

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:32.300
most harmful and I think the the risks
of extreme events are where the climate

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:32.310
of extreme events are where the climate
 

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:36.170
of extreme events are where the climate
science can improve constantan proves

science can improve constantan proves
 

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:39.500
science can improve constantan proves
still because the there are some kinds

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:39.510
still because the there are some kinds
 

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:41.930
still because the there are some kinds
of extreme events that our climate

tempered heat waves and droughts we have

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:47.160
tempered heat waves and droughts we have
 

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.890
tempered heat waves and droughts we have
the climate models are somewhat capable

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:48.900
the climate models are somewhat capable
 

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:53.030
the climate models are somewhat capable
of doing those normal rainfall driven

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:53.040
of doing those normal rainfall driven
 

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:55.340
of doing those normal rainfall driven
floods maybe the hurricanes and

floods maybe the hurricanes and
tornadoes were still not great at

tornadoes were still not great at
 

00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:01.610
tornadoes were still not great at
hurricanes and getting better tornadoes

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:01.620
hurricanes and getting better tornadoes
 

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:04.700
hurricanes and getting better tornadoes
the long way off before we can say what

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:04.710
the long way off before we can say what
 

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:05.990
the long way off before we can say what
the risks are with climate change and

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000
the risks are with climate change and
 

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.240
the risks are with climate change and
even in the present climate because the

even in the present climate because the
 

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:09.620
even in the present climate because the
rare events are sufficiently rare that

rare events are sufficiently rare that
we haven't been around long enough to

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:10.950
we haven't been around long enough to
 

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:13.370
we haven't been around long enough to
observe the worst ones in many places we

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:13.380
observe the worst ones in many places we
 

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.440
observe the worst ones in many places we
don't even really know you know what is

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:15.450
don't even really know you know what is
 

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:18.290
don't even really know you know what is
the one in five hundred year storm we

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:18.300
the one in five hundred year storm we
 

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:19.250
the one in five hundred year storm we
don't know because we haven't had

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:19.260
don't know because we haven't had
 

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:20.690
don't know because we haven't had

records for 500 years that are good
 

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:24.920
records for 500 years that are good
enough so I think you know that better

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:24.930
enough so I think you know that better
 

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:26.390
enough so I think you know that better
confidence intervals and it's not just

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:26.400
confidence intervals and it's not just
 

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.560
confidence intervals and it's not just
the scientific knowledge but the ability

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:27.570
the scientific knowledge but the ability
 

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:28.820
the scientific knowledge but the ability
to express it in the right language I

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:28.830
to express it in the right language I
 

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:30.380
to express it in the right language I
think that's true there's a climate

think that's true there's a climate
 

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:31.550
think that's true there's a climate
change science and there's a sort of

change science and there's a sort of
 

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.410

exactly what the uncertainties are doing

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:14.070

industry the insurance business is a
huge business and you know in order to

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:21.090
huge business and you know in order to
 

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:24.140

and so you if you just look across did
 

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:43.910
and so you if you just look across did
you know in buildings and we have

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:43.920
you know in buildings and we have
 

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.680
you know in buildings and we have
discretion of our building codes and

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:45.690
discretion of our building codes and
 

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:50.210
discretion of our building codes and
then so so you know across measures you

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:50.220
then so so you know across measures you
 

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:52.010
then so so you know across measures you
have different entities from federal

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:52.020
have different entities from federal
 

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:55.400
have different entities from federal
state to local that have jurisdiction if

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:55.410
state to local that have jurisdiction if
 

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:57.230
state to local that have jurisdiction if
you look at for example the we had a

00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:57.240
you look at for example the we had a
 

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.510
you look at for example the we had a
liquid fuels problem during during the

00:28:59.510 --> 00:28:59.520
liquid fuels problem during during the
 

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.510
liquid fuels problem during during the
hurricane well that supply chain 75% of

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:02.520
hurricane well that supply chain 75% of
 

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.150
hurricane well that supply chain 75% of
supply chains outside of New York City

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:04.160
supply chains outside of New York City
 

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.320
supply chains outside of New York City
refineries from Philadelphia New Jersey

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:06.330
refineries from Philadelphia New Jersey
 

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:08.600
refineries from Philadelphia New Jersey
up through terminals and barges and

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:08.610
up through terminals and barges and
 

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:11.990
up through terminals and barges and
pipelines that come ultimately here so

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000
pipelines that come ultimately here so
 

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.910
pipelines that come ultimately here so
that's why we have I think a very close

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:13.920
that's why we have I think a very close
 

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.530
that's why we have I think a very close
federal interface on this because it's

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:15.540
federal interface on this because it's
 

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:17.299
federal interface on this because it's
going to require some cases of regional

00:29:17.299 --> 00:29:17.309
going to require some cases of regional
 

00:29:17.309 --> 00:29:20.210
going to require some cases of regional
solutions but we're still working on a

00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:20.220
solutions but we're still working on a
 

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:21.410
solutions but we're still working on a
lot of the recommendations particular on

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:21.420
lot of the recommendations particular on
 

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.990
lot of the recommendations particular on
coastal coastal protection measures

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000
coastal coastal protection measures
 

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.510
coastal coastal protection measures
those are you know we're looking

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:26.520
those are you know we're looking
 

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:28.280
those are you know we're looking
literally everything is on the table and

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:28.290
literally everything is on the table and
 

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:32.419
literally everything is on the table and
I think in May it's too early for me to

00:29:32.419 --> 00:29:32.429
I think in May it's too early for me to
 

00:29:32.429 --> 00:29:34.430
I think in May it's too early for me to
to say exactly what you know conclusions

00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:34.440
to say exactly what you know conclusions
 

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.660
to say exactly what you know conclusions
that reports going to have but I think

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:35.670
that reports going to have but I think
 

00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:38.799
that reports going to have but I think
you're going to see a very comprehensive

00:29:38.799 --> 00:29:38.809
you're going to see a very comprehensive
 

00:29:38.809 --> 00:29:41.299
you're going to see a very comprehensive
report looking across all classes

00:29:41.299 --> 00:29:41.309
report looking across all classes
 

00:29:41.309 --> 00:29:44.120
report looking across all classes
infrastructure Adam what's your take on

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:44.130
infrastructure Adam what's your take on
 

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:46.490
infrastructure Adam what's your take on
this risk issue for for our coastal

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:46.500
this risk issue for for our coastal
 

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:49.560
this risk issue for for our coastal
communities in the places like New York

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:49.570
communities in the places like New York
 

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:52.840
communities in the places like New York
um I don't know I really don't know what

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:52.850
um I don't know I really don't know what
 

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:55.360
um I don't know I really don't know what
to do about it it's a above my pay grade

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:55.370
to do about it it's a above my pay grade
 

00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:59.920
to do about it it's a above my pay grade
I there you know his I think it's good

00:29:59.920 --> 00:29:59.930
I there you know his I think it's good
 

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:02.320
I there you know his I think it's good
to put in perspective that the place if

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:02.330
to put in perspective that the place if
 

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:07.450
to put in perspective that the place if
you look at the places that flooded in

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:07.460
you look at the places that flooded in
 

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:09.610
you look at the places that flooded in
sandy and where historically there were

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:09.620
sandy and where historically there were
 

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:11.470
sandy and where historically there were
wetlands they're pretty much the same

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:11.480
wetlands they're pretty much the same
 

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:16.720
wetlands they're pretty much the same
and so that tells you that's a good

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:16.730
and so that tells you that's a good
 

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:19.840
and so that tells you that's a good
place to start now of course we're not

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:19.850
place to start now of course we're not
 

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:20.980
place to start now of course we're not
they're not gonna all go back to being

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:20.990
they're not gonna all go back to being
 

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:22.750
they're not gonna all go back to being
wetlands it's not going to happen I mean

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:22.760
wetlands it's not going to happen I mean
 

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:26.440
wetlands it's not going to happen I mean
the cities is too too far along its path

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:26.450
the cities is too too far along its path
 

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:32.380
the cities is too too far along its path
for that to happen but but somehow we

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:32.390
for that to happen but but somehow we
 

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:33.790
for that to happen but but somehow we
have to rent we have to recognize the

00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:33.800
have to rent we have to recognize the
 

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.560
have to rent we have to recognize the
fact that water's going to get there

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:35.570
fact that water's going to get there
 

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:37.830
fact that water's going to get there
sometime and do something about that so

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:37.840
sometime and do something about that so
 

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:43.120
sometime and do something about that so
the insurance could probably be more you

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:43.130
the insurance could probably be more you
 

00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:44.860
the insurance could probably be more you
know better reflect the risks that are

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:44.870
know better reflect the risks that are
 

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:49.120
know better reflect the risks that are
there and could probably be more widely

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:49.130
there and could probably be more widely
 

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:51.940
there and could probably be more widely
used a lot of people that you know could

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:51.950
used a lot of people that you know could
 

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:53.410
used a lot of people that you know could
have flood insurance and business is

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:53.420
have flood insurance and business is
 

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:54.340
have flood insurance and business is
probably too that could have flood

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:54.350
probably too that could have flood
 

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:58.810
probably too that could have flood
insurance it that don't but a lot of

00:30:58.810 --> 00:30:58.820
insurance it that don't but a lot of
 

00:30:58.820 --> 00:30:59.590
insurance it that don't but a lot of
it's probably gonna have to be

00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600
it's probably gonna have to be
 

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.470
it's probably gonna have to be
engineering of some kind whether you

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480
engineering of some kind whether you
 

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.430
engineering of some kind whether you
know so you have building codes

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440
know so you have building codes
 

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:08.140
know so you have building codes
insurance zoning sea walls all these

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:08.150
insurance zoning sea walls all these
 

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:13.000
insurance zoning sea walls all these
things that some have higher cost than

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:13.010
things that some have higher cost than
 

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:15.280
things that some have higher cost than
others but I think yeah we have to do

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:15.290
others but I think yeah we have to do
 

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:16.990
others but I think yeah we have to do
the cost-benefit analysis and that has

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:17.000
the cost-benefit analysis and that has
 

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.330
the cost-benefit analysis and that has
to take into account what the risks are

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:19.340
to take into account what the risks are
 

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:22.660
to take into account what the risks are
as accurately as we know them now and in

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:22.670
as accurately as we know them now and in
 

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:24.400
as accurately as we know them now and in
the future so one of the criticisms of

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:24.410
the future so one of the criticisms of
 

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:25.480
the future so one of the criticisms of
sea walls which i think is absolutely

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:25.490
sea walls which i think is absolutely
 

00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:27.490
sea walls which i think is absolutely
true is that sooner or later with enough

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:27.500
true is that sooner or later with enough
 

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:28.960
true is that sooner or later with enough
sea level rise it will be effective

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:28.970
sea level rise it will be effective
 

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:30.670
sea level rise it will be effective
anymore you'll have to keep them closed

00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:30.680
anymore you'll have to keep them closed
 

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.170
anymore you'll have to keep them closed
all the time and then the river roll

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:32.180
all the time and then the river roll
 

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:33.580
all the time and then the river roll
back up and it won't become unmanageable

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:33.590
back up and it won't become unmanageable
 

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:35.740
back up and it won't become unmanageable
so there's a period of time where they'd

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:35.750
so there's a period of time where they'd
 

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:38.230
so there's a period of time where they'd
probably work and then beyond that they

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.240
probably work and then beyond that they
 

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.760
probably work and then beyond that they
won't and so we have to decide what time

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:39.770
won't and so we have to decide what time
 

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:41.260
won't and so we have to decide what time
frame we're thinking on and not get

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:41.270
frame we're thinking on and not get
 

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:43.240
frame we're thinking on and not get
complacent if we go for big engineering

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:43.250
complacent if we go for big engineering
 

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:45.070
complacent if we go for big engineering
solutions like that the race is the

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.080
solutions like that the race is the
 

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.610
solutions like that the race is the
overall issue that

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:46.620
overall issue that
 

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:47.780
overall issue that
I remember the first time I heard about

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:47.790
I remember the first time I heard about
 

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:51.410
I remember the first time I heard about
climate adaptation people who wanted to

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:51.420
climate adaptation people who wanted to
 

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:53.660
climate adaptation people who wanted to
mitigate climate change said no we

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:53.670
mitigate climate change said no we
 

00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:55.460
mitigate climate change said no we
should not even talk about climate

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:55.470
should not even talk about climate
 

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:58.340
should not even talk about climate
adaptation because that is really almost

00:31:58.340 --> 00:31:58.350
adaptation because that is really almost
 

00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:01.160
adaptation because that is really almost
blast it means that we've given up we've

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:01.170
blast it means that we've given up we've
 

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:04.070
blast it means that we've given up we've
accepted defeat and we're going to

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.080
accepted defeat and we're going to
 

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:06.650
accepted defeat and we're going to
tolerate all this stuff so we'll start

00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:06.660
tolerate all this stuff so we'll start
 

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:08.270
tolerate all this stuff so we'll start
with lisa is that something we should

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:08.280
with lisa is that something we should
 

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.680
with lisa is that something we should
really be paying attention to is that

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:09.690
really be paying attention to is that
 

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:12.290
really be paying attention to is that
are these two irreconcilable issues we

00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:12.300
are these two irreconcilable issues we
 

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.600
are these two irreconcilable issues we
can only deal with one at a time um I

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:14.610
can only deal with one at a time um I
 

00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:16.430
can only deal with one at a time um I
think we absolutely need to deal with

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:16.440
think we absolutely need to deal with
 

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:18.680
think we absolutely need to deal with
with both and I think you're sort of

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:18.690
with both and I think you're sort of
 

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:25.730
with both and I think you're sort of
setting it up for that yeah we're

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:25.740
setting it up for that yeah we're
 

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:27.890
setting it up for that yeah we're
changing the the planet in irreversible

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:27.900
changing the the planet in irreversible
 

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.740
changing the the planet in irreversible
ways and it's it's not just increasing

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:30.750
ways and it's it's not just increasing
 

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:32.660
ways and it's it's not just increasing
greenhouse gases but that's a big part

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:32.670
greenhouse gases but that's a big part
 

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:33.830
greenhouse gases but that's a big part
of it and that's something that we need

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840
of it and that's something that we need
 

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:36.590
of it and that's something that we need
to to do something about that something

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:36.600
to to do something about that something
 

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:39.820
to to do something about that something
with that I think with better science

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:39.830
with that I think with better science
 

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:42.320
with that I think with better science
throughout the sciences so we could do

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:42.330
throughout the sciences so we could do
 

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:45.370
throughout the sciences so we could do
something about but at the same time

00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:45.380
something about but at the same time
 

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.990
something about but at the same time
climate is changing and it's we're

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000
climate is changing and it's we're
 

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.580
climate is changing and it's we're
already experiencing some of the effects

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:49.590
already experiencing some of the effects
 

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:51.410
already experiencing some of the effects
of that and I'll come back to the issue

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:51.420
of that and I'll come back to the issue
 

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:54.290
of that and I'll come back to the issue
of climate holistically that we need to

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:54.300
of climate holistically that we need to
 

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:58.850
of climate holistically that we need to
be adapting to climate period the fact

00:32:58.850 --> 00:32:58.860
be adapting to climate period the fact
 

00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:01.610
be adapting to climate period the fact
that New York City has experienced

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:01.620
that New York City has experienced
 

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:04.150
that New York City has experienced
storms of the magnitude that sandy

00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:04.160
storms of the magnitude that sandy
 

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:08.240
storms of the magnitude that sandy
brought in the past and maybe it didn't

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:08.250
brought in the past and maybe it didn't
 

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:12.130
brought in the past and maybe it didn't
lead to the same sort of economic and

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:12.140
lead to the same sort of economic and
 

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:15.919
lead to the same sort of economic and
financial losses back in the 30s I guess

00:33:15.919 --> 00:33:15.929
financial losses back in the 30s I guess
 

00:33:15.929 --> 00:33:18.919
financial losses back in the 30s I guess
it was that it did today because there

00:33:18.919 --> 00:33:18.929
it was that it did today because there
 

00:33:18.929 --> 00:33:20.440
it was that it did today because there
were less people and there wasn't

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:20.450
were less people and there wasn't
 

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:23.000
were less people and there wasn't
internet and as much communication and

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:23.010
internet and as much communication and
 

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:26.510
internet and as much communication and
is as much wealth but just because we

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:26.520
is as much wealth but just because we
 

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:29.419
is as much wealth but just because we
have growing populations and growing

00:33:29.419 --> 00:33:29.429
have growing populations and growing
 

00:33:29.429 --> 00:33:31.850
have growing populations and growing
infrastructure and a whole lot of a

00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:31.860
infrastructure and a whole lot of a
 

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.310
infrastructure and a whole lot of a
whole lot more demand on our planet as a

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320
whole lot more demand on our planet as a
 

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:37.280
whole lot more demand on our planet as a
whole we need to adapt to climate so

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:37.290
whole we need to adapt to climate so
 

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:39.379
whole we need to adapt to climate so
adaptation is

00:33:39.379 --> 00:33:39.389
adaptation is
 

00:33:39.389 --> 00:33:44.029
adaptation is
is not a debatable topic and it's not an

00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:44.039
is not a debatable topic and it's not an
 

00:33:44.039 --> 00:33:46.099
is not a debatable topic and it's not an
either/or so just because you're

00:33:46.099 --> 00:33:46.109
either/or so just because you're
 

00:33:46.109 --> 00:33:48.499
either/or so just because you're
adapting doesn't mean that that's a pass

00:33:48.499 --> 00:33:48.509
adapting doesn't mean that that's a pass
 

00:33:48.509 --> 00:33:51.430
adapting doesn't mean that that's a pass
on doing something serious about

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.440
on doing something serious about
 

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:54.529
on doing something serious about
mitigation and energy policy sir how did

00:33:54.529 --> 00:33:54.539
mitigation and energy policy sir how did
 

00:33:54.539 --> 00:33:56.899
mitigation and energy policy sir how did
look in City Hall I mean this was one of

00:33:56.899 --> 00:33:56.909
look in City Hall I mean this was one of
 

00:33:56.909 --> 00:33:59.060
look in City Hall I mean this was one of
the biggest emergencies that this

00:33:59.060 --> 00:33:59.070
the biggest emergencies that this
 

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:01.729
the biggest emergencies that this
administration had to deal with and it

00:34:01.729 --> 00:34:01.739
administration had to deal with and it
 

00:34:01.739 --> 00:34:06.829
administration had to deal with and it
was 24 7 for how long is this issue of

00:34:06.829 --> 00:34:06.839
was 24 7 for how long is this issue of
 

00:34:06.839 --> 00:34:08.690
was 24 7 for how long is this issue of
climate adaptation now part of the

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:08.700
climate adaptation now part of the
 

00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:11.059
climate adaptation now part of the
routine of city government is this sort

00:34:11.059 --> 00:34:11.069
routine of city government is this sort
 

00:34:11.069 --> 00:34:13.339
routine of city government is this sort
of like you know getting the salt ready

00:34:13.339 --> 00:34:13.349
of like you know getting the salt ready
 

00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:16.430
of like you know getting the salt ready
for a snowstorm that's a very good

00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:16.440
for a snowstorm that's a very good
 

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:19.430
for a snowstorm that's a very good
question i think that i think the answer

00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440
question i think that i think the answer
 

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.409
question i think that i think the answer
is yes i think it's getting there I

00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:21.419
is yes i think it's getting there I
 

00:34:21.419 --> 00:34:25.460
is yes i think it's getting there I
think you know obviously we've had a lot

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:25.470
think you know obviously we've had a lot
 

00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:27.019
think you know obviously we've had a lot
to say about mitigation the city had an

00:34:27.019 --> 00:34:27.029
to say about mitigation the city had an
 

00:34:27.029 --> 00:34:29.029
to say about mitigation the city had an
obviously very ambitious plan of city

00:34:29.029 --> 00:34:29.039
obviously very ambitious plan of city
 

00:34:29.039 --> 00:34:30.319
obviously very ambitious plan of city
government having a thirty percent

00:34:30.319 --> 00:34:30.329
government having a thirty percent
 

00:34:30.329 --> 00:34:33.440
government having a thirty percent
reduction target by 2017 and citywide by

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:33.450
reduction target by 2017 and citywide by
 

00:34:33.450 --> 00:34:36.619
reduction target by 2017 and citywide by
2030 we're already we've already reduced

00:34:36.619 --> 00:34:36.629
2030 we're already we've already reduced
 

00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:38.389
2030 we're already we've already reduced
our carbon footprint by sixteen percent

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399
our carbon footprint by sixteen percent
 

00:34:38.399 --> 00:34:40.759
our carbon footprint by sixteen percent
within city wide so i think that's

00:34:40.759 --> 00:34:40.769
within city wide so i think that's
 

00:34:40.769 --> 00:34:42.859
within city wide so i think that's
already a tremendous you know

00:34:42.859 --> 00:34:42.869
already a tremendous you know
 

00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:46.639
already a tremendous you know
achievement we're also doing getting

00:34:46.639 --> 00:34:46.649
achievement we're also doing getting
 

00:34:46.649 --> 00:34:47.690
achievement we're also doing getting
back to your question about you know is

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:47.700
back to your question about you know is
 

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:49.009
back to your question about you know is
it adaptation or mitigation i think it's

00:34:49.009 --> 00:34:49.019
it adaptation or mitigation i think it's
 

00:34:49.019 --> 00:34:52.159
it adaptation or mitigation i think it's
both we launched a study last year and

00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:52.169
both we launched a study last year and
 

00:34:52.169 --> 00:34:53.359
both we launched a study last year and
we're going to write we're wrapping that

00:34:53.359 --> 00:34:53.369
we're going to write we're wrapping that
 

00:34:53.369 --> 00:34:55.039
we're going to write we're wrapping that
up right now looking at is it possible

00:34:55.039 --> 00:34:55.049
up right now looking at is it possible
 

00:34:55.049 --> 00:34:56.269
up right now looking at is it possible
to actually reduce carbon emissions by

00:34:56.269 --> 00:34:56.279
to actually reduce carbon emissions by
 

00:34:56.279 --> 00:34:58.700
to actually reduce carbon emissions by
eighty percent by 2050 and you know

00:34:58.700 --> 00:34:58.710
eighty percent by 2050 and you know
 

00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:00.769
eighty percent by 2050 and you know
before the storm most of our

00:35:00.769 --> 00:35:00.779
before the storm most of our
 

00:35:00.779 --> 00:35:02.960
before the storm most of our
stakeholders we're interested in one

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:02.970
stakeholders we're interested in one
 

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:04.579
stakeholders we're interested in one
thing and after the storm we got a lot

00:35:04.579 --> 00:35:04.589
thing and after the storm we got a lot
 

00:35:04.589 --> 00:35:06.079
thing and after the storm we got a lot
of questions on well shouldn't it be all

00:35:06.079 --> 00:35:06.089
of questions on well shouldn't it be all
 

00:35:06.089 --> 00:35:07.609
of questions on well shouldn't it be all
about adaptation should we be even

00:35:07.609 --> 00:35:07.619
about adaptation should we be even
 

00:35:07.619 --> 00:35:09.440
about adaptation should we be even
spending a dollar and mitigation and i

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:09.450
spending a dollar and mitigation and i
 

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:10.430
spending a dollar and mitigation and i
think i think you have to look at both

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440
think i think you have to look at both
 

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:13.460
think i think you have to look at both
and in many cases are actually some

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:13.470
and in many cases are actually some
 

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:15.140
and in many cases are actually some
projects can bring you multiple benefits

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:15.150
projects can bring you multiple benefits
 

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:17.359
projects can bring you multiple benefits
when you're looking at it really when

00:35:17.359 --> 00:35:17.369
when you're looking at it really when
 

00:35:17.369 --> 00:35:18.529
when you're looking at it really when
you ask the fundamental question about

00:35:18.529 --> 00:35:18.539
you ask the fundamental question about
 

00:35:18.539 --> 00:35:20.480
you ask the fundamental question about
how do you modernize a system these are

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:20.490
how do you modernize a system these are
 

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:23.180
how do you modernize a system these are
really relevant questions to ask and it

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:23.190
really relevant questions to ask and it
 

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:24.920
really relevant questions to ask and it
has to go through that process so i

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:24.930
has to go through that process so i
 

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:26.749
has to go through that process so i
think i think the answer is you got to

00:35:26.749 --> 00:35:26.759
think i think the answer is you got to
 

00:35:26.759 --> 00:35:28.529
think i think the answer is you got to
do both

00:35:28.529 --> 00:35:28.539
do both
 

00:35:28.539 --> 00:35:30.849
do both
yeah i mean about adaptation risk

00:35:30.849 --> 00:35:30.859
yeah i mean about adaptation risk
 

00:35:30.859 --> 00:35:33.729
yeah i mean about adaptation risk
mitigation i mean that the the notion

00:35:33.729 --> 00:35:33.739
mitigation i mean that the the notion
 

00:35:33.739 --> 00:35:36.700
mitigation i mean that the the notion
that talking about adaptation means

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:36.710
that talking about adaptation means
 

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:41.859
that talking about adaptation means
we're giving up is just either it's

00:35:41.859 --> 00:35:41.869
we're giving up is just either it's
 

00:35:41.869 --> 00:35:43.749
we're giving up is just either it's
partly true in a sense but it's also

00:35:43.749 --> 00:35:43.759
partly true in a sense but it's also
 

00:35:43.759 --> 00:35:46.950
partly true in a sense but it's also
just reflecting reality i mean the the

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:46.960
just reflecting reality i mean the the
 

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:50.859
just reflecting reality i mean the the
even if we were to radically cut carbon

00:35:50.859 --> 00:35:50.869
even if we were to radically cut carbon
 

00:35:50.869 --> 00:35:53.920
even if we were to radically cut carbon
emissions now beyond anything that

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:53.930
emissions now beyond anything that
 

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:55.680
emissions now beyond anything that
anybody thinks is politically feasible

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:55.690
anybody thinks is politically feasible
 

00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:58.150
anybody thinks is politically feasible
we've already seen some anthropogenic

00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160
we've already seen some anthropogenic
 

00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.620
we've already seen some anthropogenic
warming probably a little more than half

00:35:59.620 --> 00:35:59.630
warming probably a little more than half
 

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:01.539
warming probably a little more than half
a degree and we'll see a little bit more

00:36:01.539 --> 00:36:01.549
a degree and we'll see a little bit more
 

00:36:01.549 --> 00:36:02.890
a degree and we'll see a little bit more
just because the carbons in the system

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:02.900
just because the carbons in the system
 

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:04.420
just because the carbons in the system
is going to stay there for a while so

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:04.430
is going to stay there for a while so
 

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:06.700
is going to stay there for a while so
the even under the most optimistic

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:06.710
the even under the most optimistic
 

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:09.819
the even under the most optimistic
scenarios there's some warming more

00:36:09.819 --> 00:36:09.829
scenarios there's some warming more
 

00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:12.489
scenarios there's some warming more
realistically where you know at the high

00:36:12.489 --> 00:36:12.499
realistically where you know at the high
 

00:36:12.499 --> 00:36:16.150
realistically where you know at the high
end now of what the projections were in

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:16.160
end now of what the projections were in
 

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:19.269
end now of what the projections were in
the last IPCC report in 2007 so we're

00:36:19.269 --> 00:36:19.279
the last IPCC report in 2007 so we're
 

00:36:19.279 --> 00:36:21.670
the last IPCC report in 2007 so we're
gonna see some warming and and it's just

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.680
gonna see some warming and and it's just
 

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.160
gonna see some warming and and it's just
unrealistic not to recognize that but

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:24.170
unrealistic not to recognize that but
 

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:27.460
unrealistic not to recognize that but
also i mean the problem of i think we

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:27.470
also i mean the problem of i think we
 

00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:28.539
also i mean the problem of i think we
have to be more realistic about the

00:36:28.539 --> 00:36:28.549
have to be more realistic about the
 

00:36:28.549 --> 00:36:31.269
have to be more realistic about the
politics of it i mean what we know shun

00:36:31.269 --> 00:36:31.279
politics of it i mean what we know shun
 

00:36:31.279 --> 00:36:33.279
politics of it i mean what we know shun
that adapting then we were giving up on

00:36:33.279 --> 00:36:33.289
that adapting then we were giving up on
 

00:36:33.289 --> 00:36:34.720
that adapting then we were giving up on
mitigation dated from a time when people

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:34.730
mitigation dated from a time when people
 

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:37.390
mitigation dated from a time when people
still had a great a deal of optimism

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:37.400
still had a great a deal of optimism
 

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.130
still had a great a deal of optimism
about the international negotiation

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:39.140
about the international negotiation
 

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:40.630
about the international negotiation
process around climate change i mean we

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:40.640
process around climate change i mean we
 

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.130
process around climate change i mean we
all have our hopes for it but it hasn't

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:42.140
all have our hopes for it but it hasn't
 

00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:46.450
all have our hopes for it but it hasn't
done too well so far and and the problem

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:46.460
done too well so far and and the problem
 

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:47.859
done too well so far and and the problem
is ultimately it's a problem of the

00:36:47.859 --> 00:36:47.869
is ultimately it's a problem of the
 

00:36:47.869 --> 00:36:50.349
is ultimately it's a problem of the
commons right we all have to reduce

00:36:50.349 --> 00:36:50.359
commons right we all have to reduce
 

00:36:50.359 --> 00:36:52.089
commons right we all have to reduce
carbon in order for anybody to benefit

00:36:52.089 --> 00:36:52.099
carbon in order for anybody to benefit
 

00:36:52.099 --> 00:36:55.269
carbon in order for anybody to benefit
and so what we're finding is that the

00:36:55.269 --> 00:36:55.279
and so what we're finding is that the
 

00:36:55.279 --> 00:36:57.670
and so what we're finding is that the
most effective action the most of the

00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:57.680
most effective action the most of the
 

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.229
most effective action the most of the
players were able to do the most on this

00:36:59.229 --> 00:36:59.239
players were able to do the most on this
 

00:36:59.239 --> 00:37:01.900
players were able to do the most on this
problem are low at the local level like

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:01.910
problem are low at the local level like
 

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:03.910
problem are low at the local level like
here in New York where where we've seen

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:03.920
here in New York where where we've seen
 

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.019
here in New York where where we've seen
such leadership from this administration

00:37:05.019 --> 00:37:05.029
such leadership from this administration
 

00:37:05.029 --> 00:37:08.499
such leadership from this administration
and and the city and this and the system

00:37:08.499 --> 00:37:08.509
and and the city and this and the system
 

00:37:08.509 --> 00:37:10.029
and and the city and this and the system
and a few other places in the United

00:37:10.029 --> 00:37:10.039
and a few other places in the United
 

00:37:10.039 --> 00:37:11.589
and a few other places in the United
States and around the world as well but

00:37:11.589 --> 00:37:11.599
States and around the world as well but
 

00:37:11.599 --> 00:37:13.690
States and around the world as well but
that's at a smaller level and there's

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:13.700
that's at a smaller level and there's
 

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:15.190
that's at a smaller level and there's
just nothing that regions of that size

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:15.200
just nothing that regions of that size
 

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.380
just nothing that regions of that size
can do that by itself will make a huge

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:17.390
can do that by itself will make a huge
 

00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:20.109
can do that by itself will make a huge
dent in the carbon dioxide in the

00:37:20.109 --> 00:37:20.119
dent in the carbon dioxide in the
 

00:37:20.119 --> 00:37:22.569
dent in the carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere we can we can and should do

00:37:22.569 --> 00:37:22.579
atmosphere we can we can and should do
 

00:37:22.579 --> 00:37:23.799
atmosphere we can we can and should do
it but it's because we're being good

00:37:23.799 --> 00:37:23.809
it but it's because we're being good
 

00:37:23.809 --> 00:37:25.749
it but it's because we're being good
citizens I mean wait it's not because if

00:37:25.749 --> 00:37:25.759
citizens I mean wait it's not because if
 

00:37:25.759 --> 00:37:27.190
citizens I mean wait it's not because if
New York City reduces its carbon

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200
New York City reduces its carbon
 

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.359
New York City reduces its carbon
footprint by thirty percent it's going

00:37:28.359 --> 00:37:28.369
footprint by thirty percent it's going
 

00:37:28.369 --> 00:37:29.529
footprint by thirty percent it's going
to change our climate it's going to make

00:37:29.529 --> 00:37:29.539
to change our climate it's going to make
 

00:37:29.539 --> 00:37:31.120
to change our climate it's going to make
no difference but we have to do it

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:31.130
no difference but we have to do it
 

00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:32.440
no difference but we have to do it
because if it because everybody has to

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:32.450
because if it because everybody has to
 

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:35.739
because if it because everybody has to
do it but so but adaptation we can do

00:37:35.739 --> 00:37:35.749
do it but so but adaptation we can do
 

00:37:35.749 --> 00:37:36.999
do it but so but adaptation we can do
for ourselves and that will make a

00:37:36.999 --> 00:37:37.009
for ourselves and that will make a
 

00:37:37.009 --> 00:37:38.589
for ourselves and that will make a
difference in life here and so I think

00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:38.599
difference in life here and so I think
 

00:37:38.599 --> 00:37:39.079
difference in life here and so I think
we know

00:37:39.079 --> 00:37:39.089
we know
 

00:37:39.089 --> 00:37:40.729
we know
I think it's interesting I mean the

00:37:40.729 --> 00:37:40.739
I think it's interesting I mean the
 

00:37:40.739 --> 00:37:42.499
I think it's interesting I mean the
politics of climate is always something

00:37:42.499 --> 00:37:42.509
politics of climate is always something
 

00:37:42.509 --> 00:37:44.839
politics of climate is always something
I'm interested in its that as a public

00:37:44.839 --> 00:37:44.849
I'm interested in its that as a public
 

00:37:44.849 --> 00:37:46.640
I'm interested in its that as a public
policy problem it's really a tough one

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:46.650
policy problem it's really a tough one
 

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:49.729
policy problem it's really a tough one
because it's created everywhere and its

00:37:49.729 --> 00:37:49.739
because it's created everywhere and its
 

00:37:49.739 --> 00:37:51.979
because it's created everywhere and its
impact is in the future and our

00:37:51.979 --> 00:37:51.989
impact is in the future and our
 

00:37:51.989 --> 00:37:53.479
impact is in the future and our
political system doesn't do well with

00:37:53.479 --> 00:37:53.489
political system doesn't do well with
 

00:37:53.489 --> 00:37:56.450
political system doesn't do well with
those kinds of problems now fortunately

00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:56.460
those kinds of problems now fortunately
 

00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:58.370
those kinds of problems now fortunately
there is the low-hanging fruit that New

00:37:58.370 --> 00:37:58.380
there is the low-hanging fruit that New
 

00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:01.690
there is the low-hanging fruit that New
York City's already grabbed for which is

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:01.700
York City's already grabbed for which is
 

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:06.499
York City's already grabbed for which is
most of the reduction in greenhouse

00:38:06.499 --> 00:38:06.509
most of the reduction in greenhouse
 

00:38:06.509 --> 00:38:07.849
most of the reduction in greenhouse
gases has been done through energy

00:38:07.849 --> 00:38:07.859
gases has been done through energy
 

00:38:07.859 --> 00:38:11.749
gases has been done through energy
efficiency there it's very hard to argue

00:38:11.749 --> 00:38:11.759
efficiency there it's very hard to argue
 

00:38:11.759 --> 00:38:13.609
efficiency there it's very hard to argue
that we should waste energy and spend

00:38:13.609 --> 00:38:13.619
that we should waste energy and spend
 

00:38:13.619 --> 00:38:16.190
that we should waste energy and spend
more money on it so the first twenty or

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:16.200
more money on it so the first twenty or
 

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.140
more money on it so the first twenty or
thirty percent that we're getting is

00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:18.150
thirty percent that we're getting is
 

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:20.959
thirty percent that we're getting is
coming from those gains in fact as you

00:38:20.959 --> 00:38:20.969
coming from those gains in fact as you
 

00:38:20.969 --> 00:38:22.940
coming from those gains in fact as you
were saying the bigger gains are going

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:22.950
were saying the bigger gains are going
 

00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:24.229
were saying the bigger gains are going
to have to come from something more

00:38:24.229 --> 00:38:24.239
to have to come from something more
 

00:38:24.239 --> 00:38:26.900
to have to come from something more
systemic technological or global my own

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:26.910
systemic technological or global my own
 

00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:29.059
systemic technological or global my own
bet would be on technological I I don't

00:38:29.059 --> 00:38:29.069
bet would be on technological I I don't
 

00:38:29.069 --> 00:38:29.870
bet would be on technological I I don't
think there's going to be a global

00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:29.880
think there's going to be a global
 

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:31.700
think there's going to be a global
treaty but I don't know sir j what do

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:31.710
treaty but I don't know sir j what do
 

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:33.979
treaty but I don't know sir j what do
you think will be a global trees I'm not

00:38:33.979 --> 00:38:33.989
you think will be a global trees I'm not
 

00:38:33.989 --> 00:38:36.499
you think will be a global trees I'm not
going to comment on that no idea but it

00:38:36.499 --> 00:38:36.509
going to comment on that no idea but it
 

00:38:36.509 --> 00:38:37.910
going to comment on that no idea but it
mean to go to your point I think there

00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920
mean to go to your point I think there
 

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.079
mean to go to your point I think there
are some investment like energy

00:38:39.079 --> 00:38:39.089
are some investment like energy
 

00:38:39.089 --> 00:38:40.880
are some investment like energy
efficiency which helps you not only

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:40.890
efficiency which helps you not only
 

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:43.729
efficiency which helps you not only
adaptive heat waves but also can there's

00:38:43.729 --> 00:38:43.739
adaptive heat waves but also can there's
 

00:38:43.739 --> 00:38:45.709
adaptive heat waves but also can there's
a value proposition for building owners

00:38:45.709 --> 00:38:45.719
a value proposition for building owners
 

00:38:45.719 --> 00:38:48.039
a value proposition for building owners
to do that so it helps you on both sides

00:38:48.039 --> 00:38:48.049
to do that so it helps you on both sides
 

00:38:48.049 --> 00:38:51.499
to do that so it helps you on both sides
so I agree with you let me ask one more

00:38:51.499 --> 00:38:51.509
so I agree with you let me ask one more
 

00:38:51.509 --> 00:38:53.630
so I agree with you let me ask one more
question the panel before I ask for the

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:53.640
question the panel before I ask for the
 

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:55.249
question the panel before I ask for the
audience to give us some questions and

00:38:55.249 --> 00:38:55.259
audience to give us some questions and
 

00:38:55.259 --> 00:38:56.989
audience to give us some questions and
see what you really would like to hear

00:38:56.989 --> 00:38:56.999
see what you really would like to hear
 

00:38:56.999 --> 00:39:00.469
see what you really would like to hear
about my question is if we had a blank

00:39:00.469 --> 00:39:00.479
about my question is if we had a blank
 

00:39:00.479 --> 00:39:03.769
about my question is if we had a blank
slate and endless funding what science

00:39:03.769 --> 00:39:03.779
slate and endless funding what science
 

00:39:03.779 --> 00:39:05.809
slate and endless funding what science
should we be working on that would help

00:39:05.809 --> 00:39:05.819
should we be working on that would help
 

00:39:05.819 --> 00:39:08.749
should we be working on that would help
on this issue there's now we're and

00:39:08.749 --> 00:39:08.759
on this issue there's now we're and
 

00:39:08.759 --> 00:39:10.969
on this issue there's now we're and
first I want to hear what what your own

00:39:10.969 --> 00:39:10.979
first I want to hear what what your own
 

00:39:10.979 --> 00:39:12.979
first I want to hear what what your own
or grown groups which should do and what

00:39:12.979 --> 00:39:12.989
or grown groups which should do and what
 

00:39:12.989 --> 00:39:15.799
or grown groups which should do and what
our scientists should do and then Sergey

00:39:15.799 --> 00:39:15.809
our scientists should do and then Sergey
 

00:39:15.809 --> 00:39:17.539
our scientists should do and then Sergey
can tell us what would be helpful to the

00:39:17.539 --> 00:39:17.549
can tell us what would be helpful to the
 

00:39:17.549 --> 00:39:19.819
can tell us what would be helpful to the
decision makers so Adam we'll start with

00:39:19.819 --> 00:39:19.829
decision makers so Adam we'll start with
 

00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:24.069
decision makers so Adam we'll start with
you and then I'll ask Lisa um right so I

00:39:24.069 --> 00:39:24.079
you and then I'll ask Lisa um right so I
 

00:39:24.079 --> 00:39:26.959
you and then I'll ask Lisa um right so I
certainly think there's a lot of science

00:39:26.959 --> 00:39:26.969
certainly think there's a lot of science
 

00:39:26.969 --> 00:39:28.039
certainly think there's a lot of science
to be done in extreme events

00:39:28.039 --> 00:39:28.049
to be done in extreme events
 

00:39:28.049 --> 00:39:29.690
to be done in extreme events
understanding what the risks are from

00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:29.700
understanding what the risks are from
 

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:31.339
understanding what the risks are from

00:39:31.339 --> 00:39:31.349
extreme events i think we've only begun
 

00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:33.670
extreme events i think we've only begun
to do that if you read the IPCC report

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:33.680
to do that if you read the IPCC report
 

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.749
to do that if you read the IPCC report
there's a very lot of very quantitative

00:39:35.749 --> 00:39:35.759
there's a very lot of very quantitative
 

00:39:35.759 --> 00:39:37.729
there's a very lot of very quantitative
information about how the temperature

00:39:37.729 --> 00:39:37.739
information about how the temperature
 

00:39:37.739 --> 00:39:38.959
information about how the temperature
might change depending what carbon

00:39:38.959 --> 00:39:38.969
might change depending what carbon
 

00:39:38.969 --> 00:39:39.790
might change depending what carbon
dioxide does

00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:39.800
dioxide does
 

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.710
dioxide does
and even though we don't know the answer

00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:41.720
and even though we don't know the answer
 

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.060
and even though we don't know the answer
precisely there's big arrow bar but we

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:43.070
precisely there's big arrow bar but we
 

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:44.860
precisely there's big arrow bar but we
know what the error bar is and with

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:44.870
know what the error bar is and with
 

00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:46.000
know what the error bar is and with
extreme events it's much more

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:46.010
extreme events it's much more
 

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:49.810
extreme events it's much more
qualitative statements done by very very

00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:49.820
qualitative statements done by very very
 

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:53.260
qualitative statements done by very very
isolated groups of scientists many of

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:53.270
isolated groups of scientists many of
 

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:55.390
isolated groups of scientists many of
whom are in the case of hurricanes and

00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:55.400
whom are in the case of hurricanes and
 

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:58.030
whom are in the case of hurricanes and
tornadoes are coming out of the

00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:58.040
tornadoes are coming out of the
 

00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.650
tornadoes are coming out of the
operational weather prediction community

00:39:59.650 --> 00:39:59.660
operational weather prediction community
 

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:00.820
operational weather prediction community
and are very well integrated into

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:00.830
and are very well integrated into
 

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:01.960
and are very well integrated into
climate and so we're just I think

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:01.970
climate and so we're just I think
 

00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:03.430
climate and so we're just I think
beginning to really think seriously in

00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:03.440
beginning to really think seriously in
 

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.290
beginning to really think seriously in
the last few years about the risks of

00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:05.300
the last few years about the risks of
 

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:06.910
the last few years about the risks of
extreme events and we're never going to

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:06.920
extreme events and we're never going to
 

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:09.220
extreme events and we're never going to
know you know what we're gonna have a

00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:09.230
know you know what we're gonna have a
 

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:11.200
know you know what we're gonna have a
hurricane of some magnitude ten or a

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:11.210
hurricane of some magnitude ten or a
 

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:12.400
hurricane of some magnitude ten or a
hundred years from now but we can I

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:12.410
hundred years from now but we can I
 

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:13.690
hundred years from now but we can I
think we can estimate the risks better

00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:13.700
think we can estimate the risks better
 

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:15.100
think we can estimate the risks better
than we have and I think we need to do

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:15.110
than we have and I think we need to do
 

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:16.360
than we have and I think we need to do
that in order to make proper

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:16.370
that in order to make proper
 

00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:20.320
that in order to make proper
cost-benefit assumptions I think I don't

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:20.330
cost-benefit assumptions I think I don't
 

00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:21.730
cost-benefit assumptions I think I don't
think we're going to be able to pin down

00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:21.740
think we're going to be able to pin down
 

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:23.830
think we're going to be able to pin down
the climate sensitivity that much better

00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:23.840
the climate sensitivity that much better
 

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:25.030
the climate sensitivity that much better
than we are now I mean we've been

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.040
than we are now I mean we've been
 

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:27.160
than we are now I mean we've been
working hard at saying how much warmer

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:27.170
working hard at saying how much warmer
 

00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:28.900
working hard at saying how much warmer
it's going to get in other words how

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:28.910
it's going to get in other words how
 

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:30.280
it's going to get in other words how
much warmer will be a hundred years from

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:30.290
much warmer will be a hundred years from
 

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:32.110
much warmer will be a hundred years from
now given some reasonable assumptions

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:32.120
now given some reasonable assumptions
 

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:33.880
now given some reasonable assumptions
about carbon we know that with some

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:33.890
about carbon we know that with some
 

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:35.200
about carbon we know that with some
uncertainty that hasn't changed in many

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:35.210
uncertainty that hasn't changed in many
 

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:36.280
uncertainty that hasn't changed in many
years I don't think we're going to get

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:36.290
years I don't think we're going to get
 

00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:37.390
years I don't think we're going to get
that much better on that in the near

00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:37.400
that much better on that in the near
 

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.430
that much better on that in the near
term but sea level rise which is very

00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440
term but sea level rise which is very
 

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:43.090
term but sea level rise which is very
big one for coastal cities I think the

00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:43.100
big one for coastal cities I think the
 

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:45.040
big one for coastal cities I think the
thinking on sea level rise has evolved

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:45.050
thinking on sea level rise has evolved
 

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:46.510
thinking on sea level rise has evolved
tremendously in just the last few years

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:46.520
tremendously in just the last few years
 

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:49.330
tremendously in just the last few years
and so I think there's still some hope

00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:49.340
and so I think there's still some hope
 

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:50.590
and so I think there's still some hope
that we could get a better handle on

00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:50.600
that we could get a better handle on
 

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.030
that we could get a better handle on
that I mean there's a very very wide

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:52.040
that I mean there's a very very wide
 

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:54.550
that I mean there's a very very wide
range of estimates and at this point we

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:54.560
range of estimates and at this point we
 

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:55.840
range of estimates and at this point we
have to just sort of say well we should

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:55.850
have to just sort of say well we should
 

00:40:55.850 --> 00:40:57.070
have to just sort of say well we should
prepare for the worst but that's not

00:40:57.070 --> 00:40:57.080
prepare for the worst but that's not
 

00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:59.800
prepare for the worst but that's not
very satisfying I'm you know could it be

00:40:59.800 --> 00:40:59.810
very satisfying I'm you know could it be
 

00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:01.660
very satisfying I'm you know could it be
a footer could be six feet I mean this

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:01.670
a footer could be six feet I mean this
 

00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:03.070
a footer could be six feet I mean this
somewhere in there and in a hundred

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:03.080
somewhere in there and in a hundred
 

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:04.300
somewhere in there and in a hundred
years I think we could probably do

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:04.310
years I think we could probably do
 

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:08.200
years I think we could probably do
better on that decato variability I

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:08.210
better on that decato variability I
 

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:11.680
better on that decato variability I
don't know at least I'll talk about the

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:11.690
don't know at least I'll talk about the
 

00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:12.500
don't know at least I'll talk about the
game

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:12.510
game
 

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:15.260
game
should be working on that sure I'll talk

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:15.270
should be working on that sure I'll talk
 

00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:16.900
should be working on that sure I'll talk
about the kid to be out of here look

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:16.910
about the kid to be out of here look
 

00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:20.090
about the kid to be out of here look
look before I do though would you say

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:20.100
look before I do though would you say
 

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:23.150
look before I do though would you say
that I think that preface my answer with

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:23.160
that I think that preface my answer with
 

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:25.850
that I think that preface my answer with
any the development of any climate

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:25.860
any the development of any climate
 

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:27.500
any the development of any climate
information that's it's going to be

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:27.510
information that's it's going to be
 

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:28.850
information that's it's going to be
useful and is actually going to make a

00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:28.860
useful and is actually going to make a
 

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:31.100
useful and is actually going to make a
difference in people's decisions really

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:31.110
difference in people's decisions really
 

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:34.600
difference in people's decisions really
needs to be thought about in context

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:34.610
needs to be thought about in context
 

00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:37.580
needs to be thought about in context
what's the problem who are you talking

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:37.590
what's the problem who are you talking
 

00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:39.440
what's the problem who are you talking
to what can they actually realistically

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:39.450
to what can they actually realistically
 

00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:42.500
to what can they actually realistically
do about it that being said I think that

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:42.510
do about it that being said I think that
 

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:43.970
do about it that being said I think that
there's still a number of outstanding

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:43.980
there's still a number of outstanding
 

00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:45.830
there's still a number of outstanding
challenges in the climate community as a

00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:45.840
challenges in the climate community as a
 

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:47.780
challenges in the climate community as a
whole and having better understanding of

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:47.790
whole and having better understanding of
 

00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:50.170
whole and having better understanding of
better tools to work with makes those

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:50.180
better tools to work with makes those
 

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:52.640
better tools to work with makes those
context related conversations and

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:52.650
context related conversations and
 

00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:54.110
context related conversations and
information development just that much

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:54.120
information development just that much
 

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:58.970
information development just that much
easier so just across the board in

00:41:58.970 --> 00:41:58.980
easier so just across the board in
 

00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:02.120
easier so just across the board in
climate sciences i would say inseparable

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:02.130
climate sciences i would say inseparable
 

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:06.400
climate sciences i would say inseparable
is the need for observations climate

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:06.410
is the need for observations climate
 

00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:09.170
is the need for observations climate
climate scale observations right now

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:09.180
climate scale observations right now
 

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:10.850
climate scale observations right now
what we take our weather observations

00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:10.860
what we take our weather observations
 

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:13.790
what we take our weather observations
any climate observations we need better

00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:13.800
any climate observations we need better
 

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:16.160
any climate observations we need better
modeling and we need to test those

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:16.170
modeling and we need to test those
 

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:18.170
modeling and we need to test those
things out in a predictive setting and I

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:18.180
things out in a predictive setting and I
 

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:19.460
things out in a predictive setting and I
think that those three things go

00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:19.470
think that those three things go
 

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:22.070
think that those three things go
together you take one of those legs away

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:22.080
together you take one of those legs away
 

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:23.510
together you take one of those legs away
from the stool and it's going to fall

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520
from the stool and it's going to fall
 

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:26.750
from the stool and it's going to fall
over right now the u.s. is investing in

00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760
over right now the u.s. is investing in
 

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:28.370
over right now the u.s. is investing in
all three of these things but I don't

00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:28.380
all three of these things but I don't
 

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:32.060
all three of these things but I don't
think it is sufficient level that we're

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:32.070
think it is sufficient level that we're
 

00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:34.700
think it is sufficient level that we're
really moving forward and definitely not

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:34.710
really moving forward and definitely not
 

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:36.740
really moving forward and definitely not
moving forward to the degree that we

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:36.750
moving forward to the degree that we
 

00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:38.270
moving forward to the degree that we
need to and I think last year is a

00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:38.280
need to and I think last year is a
 

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.850
need to and I think last year is a
really perfect example of that so I

00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:40.860
really perfect example of that so I
 

00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:42.940
really perfect example of that so I
would hope that with sufficient

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:42.950
would hope that with sufficient
 

00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:46.790
would hope that with sufficient
investment we would be building better

00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800
investment we would be building better
 

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:49.100

climate models a higher resolution that

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:49.110
climate models a higher resolution that
 

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:51.920
climate models a higher resolution that
are informed by good observations so

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:51.930
are informed by good observations so
 

00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:53.570
are informed by good observations so
that we're better capturing the the

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:53.580
that we're better capturing the the
 

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:55.700
that we're better capturing the the
dynamic and thermodynamic processes in

00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:55.710
dynamic and thermodynamic processes in
 

00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:57.710
dynamic and thermodynamic processes in
the models we need to get those physical

00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720
the models we need to get those physical
 

00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:00.170
the models we need to get those physical
processes right so that we actually have

00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:00.180
processes right so that we actually have
 

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:01.700
processes right so that we actually have
some confidence and what those models

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:01.710
some confidence and what those models
 

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:04.910
some confidence and what those models
are telling us and at when we need to

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:04.920
are telling us and at when we need to
 

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:06.350
are telling us and at when we need to
come down to a much smaller resolution

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:06.360
come down to a much smaller resolution
 

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:09.560
come down to a much smaller resolution
in order to really faithfully represent

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:09.570
in order to really faithfully represent
 

00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:11.600
in order to really faithfully represent
those and even so some processes won't

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:11.610
those and even so some processes won't
 

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:14.150
those and even so some processes won't
be resolved but even if we're getting

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160
be resolved but even if we're getting
 

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:18.350
be resolved but even if we're getting
the processes spot on there will still

00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:18.360
the processes spot on there will still
 

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:21.320
the processes spot on there will still
be uncertainty and models and so having

00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:21.330
be uncertainty and models and so having
 

00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:23.360
be uncertainty and models and so having
better models is not necessarily going

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:23.370
better models is not necessarily going
 

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:24.420
better models is not necessarily going
to ensure

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:24.430
to ensure
 

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:26.220
to ensure
that we have perfectly accurate

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:26.230
that we have perfectly accurate
 

00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:29.100
that we have perfectly accurate
information but what we'll do is give us

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:29.110
information but what we'll do is give us
 

00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:32.100
information but what we'll do is give us
a much better sense of what the true

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:32.110
a much better sense of what the true
 

00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:34.830
a much better sense of what the true
uncertainty is in that information and

00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:34.840
uncertainty is in that information and
 

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:36.840
uncertainty is in that information and
from that we can get a better idea of

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:36.850
from that we can get a better idea of
 

00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:39.990
from that we can get a better idea of
the risks so I would advocate for really

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:40.000
the risks so I would advocate for really
 

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.310

fundamental question about how science

question gotta ask tonight and I didn't
answer it somebody else answered it and

00:48:41.099 --> 00:48:41.109
answer it somebody else answered it and
 

00:48:41.109 --> 00:48:42.419
answer it somebody else answered it and
I agreed with their answer and then more

00:48:42.419 --> 00:48:42.429
I agreed with their answer and then more
 

00:48:42.429 --> 00:48:43.949
I agreed with their answer and then more
I thought about the more I came to a

00:48:43.949 --> 00:48:43.959
I thought about the more I came to a
 

00:48:43.959 --> 00:48:45.329
I thought about the more I came to a
different conclusion my first thought

00:48:45.329 --> 00:48:45.339
different conclusion my first thought
 

00:48:45.339 --> 00:48:48.569
different conclusion my first thought
was that when I first heard this raised

00:48:48.569 --> 00:48:48.579
was that when I first heard this raised
 

00:48:48.579 --> 00:48:51.839
was that when I first heard this raised
was that it it didn't make a lot of

00:48:51.839 --> 00:48:51.849
was that it it didn't make a lot of
 

00:48:51.849 --> 00:48:54.359
was that it it didn't make a lot of
sense to me because you know we can I

00:48:54.359 --> 00:48:54.369
sense to me because you know we can I
 

00:48:54.369 --> 00:48:59.640
sense to me because you know we can I
think those of us on the left side of

00:48:59.640 --> 00:48:59.650
think those of us on the left side of
 

00:48:59.650 --> 00:49:00.809
think those of us on the left side of
the political spectrum which includes

00:49:00.809 --> 00:49:00.819
the political spectrum which includes
 

00:49:00.819 --> 00:49:02.429
the political spectrum which includes
pretty much every scientist that works

00:49:02.429 --> 00:49:02.439
pretty much every scientist that works
 

00:49:02.439 --> 00:49:05.370
pretty much every scientist that works
on this for better or worse I mean let's

00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:05.380
on this for better or worse I mean let's
 

00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:11.370
on this for better or worse I mean let's
be honest be honest the yeah I mean we

00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:11.380
be honest be honest the yeah I mean we
 

00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:16.499
be honest be honest the yeah I mean we
you know we we have you know we have may

00:49:16.499 --> 00:49:16.509
you know we we have you know we have may
 

00:49:16.509 --> 00:49:17.580
you know we we have you know we have may
think

00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:17.590
think
 

00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:19.020
think
we have may have our thoughts about

00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:19.030
we have may have our thoughts about
 

00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:21.030
we have may have our thoughts about
who's more or less responsible for the

00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040
who's more or less responsible for the
 

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.590
who's more or less responsible for the
situation that we're in but you know we

00:49:22.590 --> 00:49:22.600
situation that we're in but you know we
 

00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:24.150
situation that we're in but you know we
all are burning fossil fuels we wouldn't

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:24.160
all are burning fossil fuels we wouldn't
 

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:25.560
all are burning fossil fuels we wouldn't
be here if we weren't you know so I

00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:25.570
be here if we weren't you know so I
 

00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:28.860
be here if we weren't you know so I
think we were all complicit in the

00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:28.870
think we were all complicit in the
 

00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:30.420
think we were all complicit in the
situation and so my first thought when I

00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:30.430
situation and so my first thought when I
 

00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:31.830
situation and so my first thought when I
heard about this divestiture thing well

00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:31.840
heard about this divestiture thing well
 

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:33.210
heard about this divestiture thing well
that doesn't make sense because we can't

00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:33.220
that doesn't make sense because we can't
 

00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:34.200
that doesn't make sense because we can't
really blame the oil companies for

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:34.210
really blame the oil companies for
 

00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:36.330
really blame the oil companies for
giving us what we are paying them for

00:49:36.330 --> 00:49:36.340
giving us what we are paying them for
 

00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:39.330
giving us what we are paying them for
right but actually I've come to think

00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:39.340
right but actually I've come to think
 

00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:40.950
right but actually I've come to think
about it differently I think the issue

00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:40.960
about it differently I think the issue
 

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:44.700
about it differently I think the issue
is that you know the debate about

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:44.710
is that you know the debate about
 

00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:46.560
is that you know the debate about
climate change which is a kind of

00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:46.570
climate change which is a kind of
 

00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:48.120
climate change which is a kind of
manufacturer debate at this point that's

00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:48.130
manufacturer debate at this point that's
 

00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:50.910
manufacturer debate at this point that's
really reminiscent of the one that was

money and fake studies to discredit the
notion that smoking would kill you is

00:49:59.670 --> 00:49:59.680

it's that that justifies thinking about
 

00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:14.180
it's that that justifies thinking about
tactics like that the fact that there's

00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:14.190

responsible for that not just the oil

00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:21.670
responsible for that not just the oil
 

00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:23.760
responsible for that not just the oil
companies but the fact that they're

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:23.770
companies but the fact that they're
 

00:50:23.770 --> 00:50:25.590

creating a false debate about the
 

00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:27.750
creating a false debate about the

science some some people and I think
some of the energy companies are

00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:28.750
some of the energy companies are
 

00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:30.120
some of the energy companies are
responsible for helping to create a

the real debate we should be having

00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:32.890
the real debate we should be having
 

00:50:32.890 --> 00:50:34.110
the real debate we should be having
which is what to do about it I mean we

00:50:34.110 --> 00:50:34.120
which is what to do about it I mean we
 

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:35.220
which is what to do about it I mean we
know what's happening with the climate

00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:35.230
know what's happening with the climate
 

00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:36.990
know what's happening with the climate
to first approximation we just know what

00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:37.000
to first approximation we just know what
 

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.700
to first approximation we just know what
to do and there's a legitimate political

00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:38.710
to do and there's a legitimate political
 

00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:40.290
to do and there's a legitimate political
debate to be had there where different

people can have different views about it
 

00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:42.930
people can have different views about it
and that's the debate that we should

00:50:42.930 --> 00:50:42.940
and that's the debate that we should
 

00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:44.970
and that's the debate that we should
have and there's room for views on all

two days after sandy what a pleasure to

00:57:03.739 --> 00:57:03.749
two days after sandy what a pleasure to
 

00:57:03.749 --> 00:57:05.329
two days after sandy what a pleasure to
hear the governor I know it's a blue

00:57:05.329 --> 00:57:05.339
hear the governor I know it's a blue
 

00:57:05.339 --> 00:57:08.180
hear the governor I know it's a blue
state but he he i think he said after

00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:08.190
state but he he i think he said after
 

00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:10.670
state but he he i think he said after
Irene and Sandy I hope that the deniers

00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:10.680
Irene and Sandy I hope that the deniers
 

00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:13.480
Irene and Sandy I hope that the deniers
get pushed into the corner they belong

00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:13.490
get pushed into the corner they belong
 

00:57:13.490 --> 00:57:16.789
get pushed into the corner they belong
having said that looking at Washington

00:57:16.789 --> 00:57:16.799

Zippo nada do you have any theories or

00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:26.220
Zippo nada do you have any theories or
 

00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:29.539
Zippo nada do you have any theories or
ideas on how we as a public or science

00:57:29.539 --> 00:57:29.549
ideas on how we as a public or science
 

00:57:29.549 --> 00:57:34.069
ideas on how we as a public or science
or universities can bring at the federal

00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:34.079
or universities can bring at the federal
 

00:57:34.079 --> 00:57:38.109
or universities can bring at the federal
level this topic more into the center

Adam on you start and that is yeah I

00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400
Adam on you start and that is yeah I
 

00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:46.009
Adam on you start and that is yeah I
think those of us in this field are all

00:57:46.009 --> 00:57:46.019
think those of us in this field are all
 

00:57:46.019 --> 00:57:47.870
think those of us in this field are all
pretty frustrated at this point I mean

00:57:47.870 --> 00:57:47.880
pretty frustrated at this point I mean
 

00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:49.910
pretty frustrated at this point I mean
the way the one line of argument a few

00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920
the way the one line of argument a few
 

00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:51.109
the way the one line of argument a few
years ago is we have to be better at

00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:51.119
years ago is we have to be better at
 

00:57:51.119 --> 00:57:55.910
years ago is we have to be better at
communicating I'm not convinced that's

00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920
communicating I'm not convinced that's
 

00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:59.329
communicating I'm not convinced that's
the case I think we've communicated what

00:57:59.329 --> 00:57:59.339
the case I think we've communicated what
 

00:57:59.339 --> 00:58:01.460
the case I think we've communicated what
the problem is pretty clearly I think

00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:01.470
the problem is pretty clearly I think
 

00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:04.009
the problem is pretty clearly I think
there's two at least two problems on a

00:58:04.009 --> 00:58:04.019
there's two at least two problems on a
 

00:58:04.019 --> 00:58:06.589
there's two at least two problems on a
large scale one is that in the US and

00:58:06.589 --> 00:58:06.599
large scale one is that in the US and
 

00:58:06.599 --> 00:58:07.849
large scale one is that in the US and
we've had a denialist movement that's

00:58:07.849 --> 00:58:07.859
we've had a denialist movement that's
 

00:58:07.859 --> 00:58:09.229
we've had a denialist movement that's
been very well-funded and I think that's

00:58:09.229 --> 00:58:09.239
been very well-funded and I think that's
 

00:58:09.239 --> 00:58:10.729
been very well-funded and I think that's
created a lot of problems that are

00:58:10.729 --> 00:58:10.739
created a lot of problems that are
 

00:58:10.739 --> 00:58:12.319
created a lot of problems that are
unique to this country to some extent

00:58:12.319 --> 00:58:12.329
unique to this country to some extent
 

00:58:12.329 --> 00:58:14.420
unique to this country to some extent
the rest of the world is mostly free of

00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:14.430
the rest of the world is mostly free of
 

00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:16.009
the rest of the world is mostly free of
that to the extent that we have it but

00:58:16.009 --> 00:58:16.019
that to the extent that we have it but
 

00:58:16.019 --> 00:58:17.989
that to the extent that we have it but
the other problem is just that even if

00:58:17.989 --> 00:58:17.999
the other problem is just that even if
 

00:58:17.999 --> 00:58:20.059
the other problem is just that even if
we all agreed about the science that we

00:58:20.059 --> 00:58:20.069
we all agreed about the science that we
 

00:58:20.069 --> 00:58:21.349
we all agreed about the science that we
come back to the problem at the

00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359
come back to the problem at the
 

00:58:21.359 --> 00:58:24.049
come back to the problem at the
international level which is what where

00:58:24.049 --> 00:58:24.059
international level which is what where
 

00:58:24.059 --> 00:58:25.940
international level which is what where
you would need to if you wanted to do

00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:25.950
you would need to if you wanted to do
 

00:58:25.950 --> 00:58:27.019
you would need to if you wanted to do
anything in a large-scale about

00:58:27.019 --> 00:58:27.029
anything in a large-scale about
 

00:58:27.029 --> 00:58:28.309
anything in a large-scale about
emissions ultimately you have to get

00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:28.319
emissions ultimately you have to get
 

00:58:28.319 --> 00:58:29.599
emissions ultimately you have to get
everybody to do something or at least

00:58:29.599 --> 00:58:29.609
everybody to do something or at least
 

00:58:29.609 --> 00:58:31.009
everybody to do something or at least
all the big players to do something I

00:58:31.009 --> 00:58:31.019
all the big players to do something I
 

00:58:31.019 --> 00:58:33.109
all the big players to do something I
mean which is US China and India and few

00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119
mean which is US China and India and few
 

00:58:33.119 --> 00:58:34.469
mean which is US China and India and few
others and

00:58:34.469 --> 00:58:34.479
others and
 

00:58:34.479 --> 00:58:36.339
others and
everybody hopes that somebody else will

00:58:36.339 --> 00:58:36.349
everybody hopes that somebody else will
 

00:58:36.349 --> 00:58:37.390
everybody hopes that somebody else will
bear the cost of it there's going to be

00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:37.400
bear the cost of it there's going to be
 

00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:39.579
bear the cost of it there's going to be
costs no matter what I mean we we have

00:58:39.579 --> 00:58:39.589
costs no matter what I mean we we have
 

00:58:39.589 --> 00:58:40.749
costs no matter what I mean we we have
this question about fracking and that

00:58:40.749 --> 00:58:40.759
this question about fracking and that
 

00:58:40.759 --> 00:58:42.660
this question about fracking and that
you know that is an example I mean with

00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:42.670
you know that is an example I mean with
 

00:58:42.670 --> 00:58:44.859
you know that is an example I mean with
going to natural gas although in the

00:58:44.859 --> 00:58:44.869
going to natural gas although in the
 

00:58:44.869 --> 00:58:46.449
going to natural gas although in the
long term it's still burning carbon but

00:58:46.449 --> 00:58:46.459
long term it's still burning carbon but
 

00:58:46.459 --> 00:58:48.640
long term it's still burning carbon but
it'd be cleaner than coal and and other

00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:48.650
it'd be cleaner than coal and and other
 

00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:50.979
it'd be cleaner than coal and and other
some other sources and so in the short

00:58:50.979 --> 00:58:50.989
some other sources and so in the short
 

00:58:50.989 --> 00:58:52.449
some other sources and so in the short
term at least you know we should be

00:58:52.449 --> 00:58:52.459
term at least you know we should be
 

00:58:52.459 --> 00:58:53.890
term at least you know we should be
doing it but it brings a potential cost

00:58:53.890 --> 00:58:53.900
doing it but it brings a potential cost
 

00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:56.140
doing it but it brings a potential cost
to our region if they're mining the gas

00:58:56.140 --> 00:58:56.150
to our region if they're mining the gas
 

00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:57.729
to our region if they're mining the gas
here we don't know exactly how bad it is

00:58:57.729 --> 00:58:57.739
here we don't know exactly how bad it is
 

00:58:57.739 --> 00:58:58.929
here we don't know exactly how bad it is
but some of us I think are rightfully

00:58:58.929 --> 00:58:58.939
but some of us I think are rightfully
 

00:58:58.939 --> 00:59:00.699
but some of us I think are rightfully
scared of it and don't trust studies

00:59:00.699 --> 00:59:00.709
scared of it and don't trust studies
 

00:59:00.709 --> 00:59:01.989
scared of it and don't trust studies
have been done thus far they're really

00:59:01.989 --> 00:59:01.999
have been done thus far they're really
 

00:59:01.999 --> 00:59:03.939
have been done thus far they're really
conclusive but that's that's not in my

00:59:03.939 --> 00:59:03.949
conclusive but that's that's not in my
 

00:59:03.949 --> 00:59:06.279
conclusive but that's that's not in my
backyard kind of thing but everything

00:59:06.279 --> 00:59:06.289
backyard kind of thing but everything
 

00:59:06.289 --> 00:59:07.719
backyard kind of thing but everything
has cost like that I mean Indian Point

00:59:07.719 --> 00:59:07.729
has cost like that I mean Indian Point
 

00:59:07.729 --> 00:59:08.890
has cost like that I mean Indian Point
you know we get a lot of a power from

00:59:08.890 --> 00:59:08.900
you know we get a lot of a power from
 

00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:10.509
you know we get a lot of a power from
nuclear which is carbon free it's great

00:59:10.509 --> 00:59:10.519
nuclear which is carbon free it's great
 

00:59:10.519 --> 00:59:11.829
nuclear which is carbon free it's great
right but scares the daylights out of me

00:59:11.829 --> 00:59:11.839
right but scares the daylights out of me
 

00:59:11.839 --> 00:59:14.799
right but scares the daylights out of me
I don't I don't um you know you want to

00:59:14.799 --> 00:59:14.809
I don't I don't um you know you want to
 

00:59:14.809 --> 00:59:16.299
I don't I don't um you know you want to
think about disaster scenarios that are

00:59:16.299 --> 00:59:16.309
think about disaster scenarios that are
 

00:59:16.309 --> 00:59:18.039
think about disaster scenarios that are
scary for New York City that's that's

00:59:18.039 --> 00:59:18.049
scary for New York City that's that's
 

00:59:18.049 --> 00:59:21.039
scary for New York City that's that's
one so I think there will be cost of

00:59:21.039 --> 00:59:21.049
one so I think there will be cost of
 

00:59:21.049 --> 00:59:22.569
one so I think there will be cost of
whatever we do and they're going to have

00:59:22.569 --> 00:59:22.579
whatever we do and they're going to have
 

00:59:22.579 --> 00:59:24.279
whatever we do and they're going to have
to be distributed broadly and so it's a

00:59:24.279 --> 00:59:24.289
to be distributed broadly and so it's a
 

00:59:24.289 --> 00:59:27.519
to be distributed broadly and so it's a
classic game where everybody hopes

00:59:27.519 --> 00:59:27.529
classic game where everybody hopes
 

00:59:27.529 --> 00:59:29.019
classic game where everybody hopes
somebody else will do it and I think

00:59:29.019 --> 00:59:29.029
somebody else will do it and I think
 

00:59:29.029 --> 00:59:30.819
somebody else will do it and I think
that's the problem at the international

00:59:30.819 --> 00:59:30.829
that's the problem at the international
 

00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:32.829
that's the problem at the international
level at the national level we have a

00:59:32.829 --> 00:59:32.839
level at the national level we have a
 

00:59:32.839 --> 00:59:35.529
level at the national level we have a
political debate that's dysfunctional as

00:59:35.529 --> 00:59:35.539
political debate that's dysfunctional as
 

00:59:35.539 --> 00:59:37.179
political debate that's dysfunctional as
we all know you should you want to add

00:59:37.179 --> 00:59:37.189
we all know you should you want to add
 

00:59:37.189 --> 00:59:39.459
we all know you should you want to add
to that I don't think I really can't add

00:59:39.459 --> 00:59:39.469
to that I don't think I really can't add
 

00:59:39.469 --> 00:59:40.719
to that I don't think I really can't add
to that I think that was really

00:59:40.719 --> 00:59:40.729
to that I think that was really
 

00:59:40.729 --> 00:59:46.269
to that I think that was really
exponents ok dirty well let's how much I

00:59:46.269 --> 00:59:46.279
exponents ok dirty well let's how much I
 

00:59:46.279 --> 00:59:47.919
exponents ok dirty well let's how much I
can opine on the federal side but I

00:59:47.919 --> 00:59:47.929
can opine on the federal side but I
 

00:59:47.929 --> 00:59:49.630
can opine on the federal side but I
think what we've tried to do is a city

00:59:49.630 --> 00:59:49.640
think what we've tried to do is a city
 

00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:52.089
think what we've tried to do is a city
is to show that it can be done at the

00:59:52.089 --> 00:59:52.099
is to show that it can be done at the
 

00:59:52.099 --> 00:59:54.160
is to show that it can be done at the
city level yeah it's obviously much more

00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:54.170
city level yeah it's obviously much more
 

00:59:54.170 --> 00:59:56.289
city level yeah it's obviously much more
efficient the larger your geographic

00:59:56.289 --> 00:59:56.299
efficient the larger your geographic
 

00:59:56.299 --> 00:59:59.289
efficient the larger your geographic
area is so if you have a regional carbon

00:59:59.289 --> 00:59:59.299
area is so if you have a regional carbon
 

00:59:59.299 --> 01:00:00.789
area is so if you have a regional carbon
pool well it's always better to make it

01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799
pool well it's always better to make it
 

01:00:00.799 --> 01:00:03.009
pool well it's always better to make it
even bigger because you don't want to

01:00:03.009 --> 01:00:03.019
even bigger because you don't want to
 

01:00:03.019 --> 01:00:05.549
even bigger because you don't want to
have policy leakage and in other

01:00:05.549 --> 01:00:05.559
have policy leakage and in other
 

01:00:05.559 --> 01:00:09.579
have policy leakage and in other
essentially deadweight losses so I think

01:00:09.579 --> 01:00:09.589
essentially deadweight losses so I think
 

01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:13.019
essentially deadweight losses so I think
you know our position is that you know

01:00:13.019 --> 01:00:13.029
you know our position is that you know
 

01:00:13.029 --> 01:00:15.249
you know our position is that you know
we've done it we can we can do it here

01:00:15.249 --> 01:00:15.259
we've done it we can we can do it here
 

01:00:15.259 --> 01:00:16.479
we've done it we can we can do it here
and I think and we already have a little

01:00:16.479 --> 01:00:16.489
and I think and we already have a little
 

01:00:16.489 --> 01:00:18.729
and I think and we already have a little

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:42.650
those energy efficiency investment so I
 

01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:45.039
those energy efficiency investment so I
think in many cases I think what we've
