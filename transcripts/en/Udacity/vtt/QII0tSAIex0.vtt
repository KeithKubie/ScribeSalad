00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.960
This code should be really familiar to you because it's what

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.440
we saw in lesson three. One of the first plots you

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.020
created was a histogram, so let's see what this one looks

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.100
like. We can immediately notice

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.820
some important discreetness to this distribution.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.920
There appear to be prices at which there are many observations,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.650
but then no observations in adjacent prices. This makes sense if

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.900
prices are set in a way that applies to many of

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.240
the consumers. There are some purchases that involve much lower prices, and

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.070
if we are interested in price sensitivity, we definitely want

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.140
to consider what sort of variations is in these prices. Now,

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.090
I also want you to note that if we chose

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.720
a different bin width we might obscure this discreetness. Say if

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.720
I chose a bandwidth equal to ten. In this histogram,

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.740
we would miss the observation for some of the empty spaces

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.400
for the adjacent prices. So, it's no surprise that for

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.550
this very discreet data this histogram is a very biased model.
