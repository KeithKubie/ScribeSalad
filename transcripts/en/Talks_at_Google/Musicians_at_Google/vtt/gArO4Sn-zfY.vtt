RYAN LOREN: Davi, I'd like you
to tell me more about, if you

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:39.300
had to, in a nutshell,
tell me about your music

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.640
and what you want to get
across, what would it be?

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.930
DAVI: My music is
just an illustration

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:50.610
of some of the things
that are important to me

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:55.190
within the society, within
my heart, within my vision.

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:59.820
And the best vessel that I
found is to do it through music.

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:05.500
So music I see through my
body and through my voice.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:09.160
And then directing folks on
instruments that I don't play.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:15.890
So if someone asked
me, what genre--

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:18.470
I get that a lot--
my music is, it's

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:23.071
somewhere between new wave,
electronica, and soul.

00:21:23.071 --> 00:21:24.570
I used to call it
Afro-electro funk,

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:26.028
but I'm actually
moving beyond that

00:21:26.028 --> 00:21:29.150
at this point in
my musical journey.

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:38.731
And I think at the
very core of it,

00:21:38.731 --> 00:21:40.980
I'm always pushing something
I call human [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:43.180
It's something I created
when I was at NYU.

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:46.360
And essentially,
it's using things

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.770
that identify one's
uniqueness-- whatever

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:52.170
makes them special,
whatever makes them tick,

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:55.920
whatever makes their skin
crawl, those things that

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.775
really make them who they are.

00:21:58.775 --> 00:22:02.535
And once people are able to
understand that for themselves,

00:22:02.535 --> 00:22:03.910
then they'll be
able to recognize

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:06.300
that in another
person, and appreciate

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.340
that for another person,
and love another person

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:14.170
because that person has that
beyond any color, prejudice,

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:16.570
and bias that they may
have against another.

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:20.690
If we can begin to understand
ourselves as universal beings,

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:23.950
then I think we'll
be on a good track.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:26.320
RYAN LOREN: You do a
lot of other things too.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.330
You choreograph.

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:28.090
You're a DJ.

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:33.380
So tell me what experience
you have in those worlds

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:38.250
and how it convergenced
into music now.

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:40.910
DAVI: So choreography
was something

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:44.220
that was really easy for
me when I was growing up.

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:50.980
At NYU, I was a step
master of the step team.

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.345
We were number one.

00:22:52.345 --> 00:22:54.220
My best friend's in the
audience, [? Taja. ?]

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:56.580
And we were chumping it up.

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.910
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:03.770
DAVI: And we were number one
in the Northeast at one time.

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:06.109
And then I started doing
that for other schools.

00:23:06.109 --> 00:23:07.900
In the meantime, I
started getting mentored

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:13.520
by a modern choreographer,
Kathryn Posin, who took me

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:18.459
under her wing in the middle
of my junior year at NYU.

00:23:18.459 --> 00:23:20.000
And she said, you're
a choreographer.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.980
Not just for step, but
you're a choreographer

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:24.550
in all these other ways too.

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:25.440
So explore that.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:30.820
And she pushed me to
so many other things

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:32.950
I wasn't actually prepared for.

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:36.330
I ended up choreographing for
Kerry Washington, and David

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:39.040
Alan Grier, and
Tyler James Williams,

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.980
and a whole bunch of
folks for this movie

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:45.200
called, "We The Peeples."

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.020
And it came out last year.

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:53.350
And in the meantime, I
also worked with a group

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:56.510
called Cubic Zirconia, doing
all their tour choreography

00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:57.510
and video choreography.

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:01.390
I'm in two of their videos,
if you want to check them out,

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:04.610
and also doing choreography
for this other group

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:05.590
called Telephone.

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:09.570
So I've done a lot of different
choreography for other people.

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:13.410
And it's been really, really
exciting doing and illustrating

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:16.690
what movement looks like
for me in my own songs.

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:18.190
Because I don't
know if you noticed,

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:22.880
but my movement is not
hip hop and modern.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:26.040
It's somewhere in between,
somewhere in the grays.

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.870
And I think that
that's really exciting.

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:29.746
I'm excited about it.

00:24:29.746 --> 00:24:31.745
RYAN LOREN: Where are you
going to take it next?

00:24:31.745 --> 00:24:32.920
What can we expect from you?

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:36.340
DAVI: Well, I think the
path that I've been on

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.500
has always been around music.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.580
It just so happened that it
came out through movement

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:44.690
initially on a public eye.

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:47.355
But it's always been something.

00:24:47.355 --> 00:24:48.980
My mother's here,
and I always told her

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:50.370
I wanted to be an artist.

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:53.940
I created my life
plan when I was 16,

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:55.429
and that was the
forefront of what

00:24:55.429 --> 00:24:56.970
I was going to be
doing with my life.

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:02.310
So it was always about music.

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:05.790
I think what worked
at the time is

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:09.710
why I did choreography
first on a public level.

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:14.010
But I was also recording my
music during that time too.

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:17.240
Actually, the first EP
was done at the same time

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:22.260
that I was filming,
"We the Peeples."

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:25.680
I was staying at a
friend's spot in New York,

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.240
and I was going back and forth
from Stanford, Connecticut.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.823
And when I came back,
I was recording.

00:25:29.823 --> 00:25:32.030
When I was in Stanford,
I was filming.

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:36.400
So it was a really
exciting time period.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.510
So it's always
been around music.

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:47.750
And the next steps for me
is just really expanding

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:50.040
what this Davi universe is.

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.860
I think when people
come to my shows,

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:53.693
they're always explaining,
as an experience.

00:25:53.693 --> 00:25:56.520
And that's really what I want
people to get involved in,

00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:03.400
a new world, a new culture that
not only excites you musically,

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:07.109
but also excites you to shift
things in your own life.

00:26:07.109 --> 00:26:09.025
That's actually what
"That Thump" talks about.

00:26:09.025 --> 00:26:10.358
A lot of people don't know that.

00:26:10.358 --> 00:26:14.970
That was me introducing
myself and challenging

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:18.840
you to expand the
ways in understanding

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.250
how artists can impact you.

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:22.740
Because I remember,
for example, when

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:24.450
I started listening
to Erykah Badu.

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:27.320
My whole [INAUDIBLE] changed.

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.329
I walked differently.

00:26:28.329 --> 00:26:29.620
I looked at people differently.

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:32.880
I was like, I'm a
whole person who's

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.100
been impacted by Erykah Badu.

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:41.312
And that happened in small ways
with Prince, Santigold, MIA,

00:26:41.312 --> 00:26:43.020
Michael Jackson-- a
whole bunch of people

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:45.110
who have impacted me,
and just beginning

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:47.790
to take notice of how artists
impact the way we think,

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:49.420
and how we feel about ourselves.

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:51.160
RYAN LOREN: You
have a unique sound,

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:54.672
and I hope you keep bringing it.

00:26:54.672 --> 00:26:55.880
DAVI: You don't have to hope.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.920
RYAN LOREN: Oh, I know
you will, and I really

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.020
appreciate you being here.

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:00.220
