00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
What's up guys? We are back again in the beautiful

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.260
Arizona desert once again with the Sonic Dad Team to test one more experimental idea.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.420
[and] we've got a glass jar. Some aluminum foil and [the] drain cleaners sodium hydroxide

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.899
We're going to mix these [two] together with some water and producing hydrogen gas with that chemical reaction started going to take this 36 inch

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.590
Balloons put all the top capture that hydrogen Gap tie it off

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.430
And then we're going to shoot it with this modified round [out] the sparkler in the end

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.639
We're going to see what happened when we like this and stick it in the cannon

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.149
We should be able to hit those hydrogen balloon and cause a big ball of fire least

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.379
That's the idea [and] [I] got a request from tuna bug to make some kind of a flaming arrow

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.729
So I thought with the sonic Dad team there's no more perfect opportunity [that] what we're about to do today

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.070
You guys remember how this works, we're gonna

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.369
Take some drain cleaner fill up a glass guard and put in some aluminum

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.259
And add a little water is going to create a reaction that generate hydrogen gas

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.879
We're going to cap it with the balloon and collect all that gas in the balloon

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.959
And I brought some stick welding gloves because this jar is going to get extremely hot

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.480
Jake why don't you take this you can just go ahead and Sprinkle in a bunch of sodium hydroxide and so [this]

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:13.029
[yeah], aluminum seems to be the limiting factor. So we're just going to put in more other than less

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.210
That's going to be enough to fill up our balloon

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.470
Alright, let's get some water

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:38.839
Not going to be an immediate reaction that should take off here in about 30 seconds now just watch

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.610
Look at that reaction that is amazing

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.120
[it's] bubbling at least three-quarters of the way up the jar, and [I'm] sure that's getting extremely hot right now

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.940
Lets take it off. That's hot. It's very hot

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.700
Yeah

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.530
Check this out it floats got a boomerang balloon

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.820
So there's about two minutes after it captain. Go ahead and feel that

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.869
Yeah, that would be hot to the touch gloves [if] you [don't] want to hold that very hot right now particularly. Yeah, that's

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.390
what I heard in 10, maybe

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.229
It's very warm right now when the hydrogen is flowing into the balloon

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.060
It's actually very very hot and as we cap off the balloon and it cools down the gas shrinks

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.989
And so our ballon's quite a bit smaller than we started It used to float as well

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.480
And now it's not floating as much, and that's because the density of the rubber is pulling it down, but this will still work

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.869
There's still quite a bit of hydrogen here at least enough to get a good reaction. I think

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.630
You hear that it's all water splashing around inside there. That's the theme condensing and turning back [into] water inside the balloon listen this

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.600
That's why it's not floating. It's got all that water in it. It's spilling down my gloves. It's probably not good

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.080
And it smells like hydrogen

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.800
It smells like success

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.509
It smells like we're about to have victory here in the Arizona desert

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.509
If I open the neck of the bottle a little bit, you can see already the condensed water is starting to drip out cool

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.030
Alright update our hydrogen balloon

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.899
Is that all we have to do now is light up one of our sparklers are shove it in the barrel and send it flying

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.910
[let's] see if this [actually] [works]

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.600
My slow-mo's rolling Rich is gonna let me take the first shot

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.730
Yeah, fire in the hole

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.560
321 00

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.800
that was

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:55.689
nice yes, that was amazing. So I couldn't have asked for anything better to hear that won't call that hydrogen just coming out

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.839
It wasn't exploded it was almost there was a big ball of fire

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.499
but I still felt the question [would] you feel that your chest so

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.439
I was like a spacey, sud

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.030
Cool

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.670
Now this is h 0 gas that would have been explosion would've been here piercing

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:22.780
But because hydrogen it had to [fuse] with the oxygen as it burned and so it probably took about 10 times longer for that burn

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.660
[and] if we use [h/o] so apparently hydrogen exploding targets on our thing. We're going to make it again and again and again

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.209
We're also adding a little bit string here because as the balloon

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.629
Inflates the hydrogen is lighter than air and so it may want to float away

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:49.220
[ok] let's get these things lit up. [I] don't think we have a lot of time to work with there. We go. We got him

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:01.040
Fired [didn't] ignite. [I] don't know if that blew up or not

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:14.089
Now here's the thing guys are theory on why that last one didn't make a big fireball is because the hydrogen was Mick 16

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.639
When the Sparkler [when] there's a lot more heat energy that had to dissipate through the steam and so did make a big fireball

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.610
Wow, that was actually a lot

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.160
like blast back for my face

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.649
And I think [about] [5%] [we're] all good. That was hot I thought that on my knuckle. It was awesome

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:35.569
Good no doubt here guys let's roll

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.370
[yeah]

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:46.848
rise look at that reaction

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.150
Bueno Bueno indeed

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.709
This way we can watch it from a [distant] and my hands are burning

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:00.438
[now] just explodes [as] a whole lot of steam in my face a lot of hot gas starting to get a little tighter

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.219
I think I'm going to go ahead and release it release the kraken

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.860
ready the cannons

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:11.209
Ok here. We go on three two one fire

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.800
[321]

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:23.269
Little bit of a delayed reaction there, but I heard [that] I thought up that camera might have [thought] a real close

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:31.098
That was good. That was a good amount of hydrogen. I feel very happy about selling the grand Council approved as a graph

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:43.249
So it looks like igniting Giant hydrogen targets as a team effort

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:51.440
Cool there you have it guys epic day of experimenting with Sparkler bombs and hydrogen Target. We had a lot of fun doing huge

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.869
Thanks to the sonic Dad team if you have not checked it out yet

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.239
I've got a link down in the description you can click to go to their [channel]

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.740
[I've] also got a link to the plans for their original Marshmallow cannon you can download it and try to [hold] yourself

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.930
And a big [thank] [you] to bug for suggesting flaming arrows and help make this experiment happen today

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:11.779
I got [twenty-five] bucks [come] your way. Thanks for joining us for this experiment today. We'll be looking for the next video documentary

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:14.580
blown up balloon

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.580
with science
