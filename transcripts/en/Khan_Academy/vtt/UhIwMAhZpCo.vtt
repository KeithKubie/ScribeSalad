00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.140
We've already talked about
the life cycle of stars

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.070
roughly the same mass as our
sun, give or take a little bit.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.710
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.260
talk about more massive stars.

00:00:12.372 --> 00:00:14.080
And when I'm talking
about massive stars,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.180
I'm talking about stars that
have masses greater than 9

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.960
times the sun.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.330
So the general idea
is exactly the same.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.170
You're going to start off
with this huge cloud of mainly

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.910
hydrogen.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.410
And now, this cloud
is going to have

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.070
to be bigger than the clouds
that condensed to form stars

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:34.741
like our sun.

00:00:34.741 --> 00:00:36.240
But you're going
to start with that,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.440
and eventually gravity's
going to pull it together.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.330
And the core of it is going
to get hot and dense enough

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.090
for hydrogen to ignite, for
hydrogen to start fusing.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.534
So this is hydrogen,
and it is now fusing.

00:00:49.534 --> 00:00:50.200
Let me write it.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.630
It is now fusing.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.550
Hydrogen fusion.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.360
Let me write it like this.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.000
You now have hydrogen
fusion in the middle.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.280
So it's ignited,
and around it, you

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.820
have just the other
material of the cloud.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.990
So the rest of the hydrogen.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.640
And now, since it's so
heated, it's really a plasma.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.280
It's really kind of a soup
of electrons and nucleuses

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.957
as opposed to well-formed atoms,
especially close to the core.

00:01:15.957 --> 00:01:17.290
So now you have hydrogen fusion.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.820
We saw this happens at
around 10 million Kelvin.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.276
And I want to make
it very clear.

00:01:21.276 --> 00:01:23.150
Since we're talking
about more massive stars,

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.650
even at this stage,
there's going

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.710
to be more gravitational
pressure, even at this stage,

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.020
during the main
sequence of the star,

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.560
because it is more massive.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.460
And so this is going to
burn faster and hotter.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.650
So this is going to be faster
and hotter than something

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.670
the mass of our sun.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.850
And so even this stage
is going to happen over

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.470
a much shorter period of
time than for a star the mass

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.100
of our sun.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.747
Our sun's life is going to be
10 or 11 billion total years.

00:01:58.747 --> 00:02:00.580
Here, we're going to
be talking about things

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.840
in maybe the tens of
millions of years.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.579
So a factor of 1,000
shorter life span.

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.370
But anyway, let's think
about what happens.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.500
And so far, just the
pattern of what happens,

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.083
it's going to happen
faster because we

00:02:11.083 --> 00:02:13.850
have more pressure, more
gravity, more temperature.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.460
But it's going to happen
in pretty much the same way

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.000
as what we saw with a
star the mass of the sun.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.060
Eventually that helium--
sorry, that hydrogen

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.930
is going to fuse into
a helium core that's

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.164
going to have a hydrogen
shell around it.

00:02:28.164 --> 00:02:30.080
It's going to have a
hydrogen shell around it,

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.520
hydrogen fusion shell around it.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.170
And then you have the rest
of the star around that.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.870
So let me label it.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.740
This right here is
our helium core.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.420
And more and more
helium is going

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.970
to be built up as this
hydrogen in this shell fuses.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.930
And in a star the size of our
sun or the mass of our sun,

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.020
this is when it starts
to become a red giant.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.020
Because this core is getting
denser and denser and denser

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.670
as more and more
helium is produced.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.110
And as it gets denser
and denser and denser,

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.370
there's more and more
gravitational pressure

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.490
being put on the hydrogen,
on this hydrogen shell

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.600
out here, where we have
fusion still happening.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.440
And so that's going to release
more outward energy to push out

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.836
the radius of the actual star.

00:03:17.836 --> 00:03:19.210
So the general
process, and we're

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.430
going to see this as the star
gets more and more massive,

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.888
is we're going to have heavier
and heavier elements forming

00:03:23.888 --> 00:03:25.142
in the core.

00:03:25.142 --> 00:03:26.600
Those heavier and
heavier elements,

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.370
as the star gets
denser and denser,

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.170
will eventually ignite,
kind of supporting the core.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.900
But because the core itself
is getting denser and denser

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.920
and denser, material is getting
pushed further and further out

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.010
with more and more energy.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.710
Although if the star
is massive enough,

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.460
it's not going to be
able to be pushed out

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.330
as far as you will have
in kind of a red giant,

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:45.824
with kind of a sun-like star.

00:03:45.824 --> 00:03:47.740
But let's just think
about how this pattern is

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:48.490
going to continue.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.280
So eventually, that helium,
once it gets dense enough,

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.340
it's going to ignite and it's
going to fuse into carbon.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.760
And you're going to have
a carbon core forming.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.350
So that is carbon core.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.840
That's a carbon core.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.810
Around that, you
have a helium core.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.980
And near the center
of the helium core,

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.180
you have a shell
of helium fusion--

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.150
that's helium, not hydrogen--
turning into carbon, making

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.310
that carbon core
denser and hotter.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.680
And then around that,
you have hydrogen fusion.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.139
Have to be very careful.

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:21.180
You have hydrogen fusion.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.925
And then around that, you
have the rest of the star.

00:04:27.172 --> 00:04:29.380
And so this process is just
going to keep continuing.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.700
Eventually that carbon
is going to start fusing.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.090
And you're going to
have heavier and heavier

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.048
elements form the core.

00:04:34.048 --> 00:04:36.130
And so this is a
depiction off of Wikipedia

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.440
of a fairly mature massive star.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.760
And you keep
forming these shells

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.760
of heavier and heavier
elements, and cores

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.380
of heavier and heavier
elements until eventually, you

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.310
get to iron.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.650
And in particular, we're
talking about iron 56.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.920
Iron with an atomic mass of 56.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.980
Here on this periodic table
that 26 is its atomic number.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.680
It's how many protons it has.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.010
56, you kind of view it
as a count of the protons

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.940
and neutrons, although
it's not exact.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.720
But at this point, the reason
why you stop here is that you

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.290
cannot get energy
by fusing iron.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.210
Fusing iron into heavier
elements beyond iron

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.720
actually requires energy.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.070
So it would actually be
an endothermic process.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.200
So to fuse iron actually
won't help support the core.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.980
So what I want to do in this--
So just to be very clear,

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.630
this is how the heavy
elements actually formed.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.500
We started with
hydrogen, hydrogen fusing

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.090
into helium, helium
fusing into carbon,

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.979
and then all of these things
in various combinations--

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:38.520
and I won't go into
all the details--

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.380
are fusing heavier
and heavier elements.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.650
Neon, oxygen, and you
see it right over here.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:43.700
Silicon.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.300
And these aren't the only
elements that are forming,

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.820
but these are kind of the main
core elements that are forming.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.236
But along the way, you have
all this other stuff, lithium,

00:05:50.236 --> 00:05:51.070
beryllium, boron.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.520
All of this other
stuff is also forming.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.330
So this is how you form
elements up to iron 56.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.980
And also, this is actually how
you can form up to nickel 56,

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.600
just to be exact.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.470
There will also
be some nickel 56,

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.770
which has the same
mass as iron 56,

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.400
just has two fewer neutrons
and two more protons.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.590
So nickel 56 will
also form, can also

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.420
be, it'll be like
a nickel-iron core.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.250
But that's about
how far a star can

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.940
get, regardless of how massive
it is, at least by going

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.150
through traditional
fusion, through

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.280
the traditional
ignition mechanism.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.310
What I want to do
is leave you there

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.180
just so you can think about
what might happen next,

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.400
now that we can't fuse
this star anymore.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.890
And what we're actually going to
see is that it will supernova.
