00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.982
In general, we want to follow these four steps in order to solve radical

00:00:02.982 --> 00:00:08.540
equations. First, we want to isolate the radical on one side of the equation.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.868
Once that happens, we can raise both sides of the equation to the power that is

00:00:11.868 --> 00:00:16.819
equal to the index of the radical. Just like in the last problem. We wanted to

00:00:16.819 --> 00:00:21.034
undo a square root, so we used a square power. Then we can just solve the

00:00:21.034 --> 00:00:24.828
equation for the variable, and check our answer in the original equation. Keep

00:00:24.828 --> 00:00:28.840
in mind not to ignore this step. You really want to check your answers here,

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.270
since sometimes they won't always work.
