00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now we're going to take a really quick quiz,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
and the question is would you consider it likely

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that the timing of inputs is important for testing:

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
a, software under test that interacts directly with hardware devices,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
b, software under test that interfaces with other machines on the internet,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
c, software under test that is multi-threaded,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
or d, software under test that prints time values into a log file.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Go ahead and write all of the answers that you think are good ones

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
into the text box here.
