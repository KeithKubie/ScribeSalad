00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.610
In the last video, I gave the
example of this bank that I

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:04.670
keep using.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.340
In this example, as opposed to
giving the gold out to make

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.205
loans and be used for projects
that gold gets redeposited and

00:00:13.205 --> 00:00:14.260
then re-lent out.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.540
What we did in this examples is
that the bank-- every time

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.020
it made a loan, it just made a
loan and that created an asset

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.835
and then it had a corresponding
liability where

00:00:21.835 --> 00:00:24.080
the liability was either a
checking account that the

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.340
entrepreneur could use or bank
notes, which are essentially

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.600
cash that the entrepreneur
could use to pay their

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.439
laborers or to buy their land or
whatever they needed to do.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.650
So an obvious question was, how
much could a bank do it?

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.950
When does this stop?

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.430
Can a bank just keep increasing
the left and right

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.980
hand sides of the
balance sheet?

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.550
And to answer this question,
we'll introduce the idea of a

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.530
reserve ratio.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.190
So just, I guess, a bit of a
review, just to make sure

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.090
we're clearly reading
this balance sheet.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.030
Let me label things a little bit
more because sometimes I

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.240
assume too much.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.980
Remember, these are
the assets.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.065
The assets are all of these.

00:00:59.065 --> 00:01:03.710
Let me make a bold line here.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.620
All of this is the assets of
this bank, including its

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.860
building, so its vault
down there.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.040
And then the liabilities.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.700
I'll do that in this red.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.125
I don't like this red color, but
these are the liabilities.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.880
And the equity-- whoever owns
the bank, whether it's

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.090
stockholders or maybe it's
owned by an individual.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.620
Maybe it's owned by me--
is what's left over.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.690
I'll do it in a nice
neutral color.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.940
This is the equity.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.710
So the question is, how much can
the bank continue to issue

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.230
out more loans and increase
its assets and its

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.490
liabilities?

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.050
Remember, every time it'd issue
a loan, like for right

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.320
here, it issued a 100 gold piece
equivalent loan to D--

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.720
and instead of giving D 100 gold
pieces from, say, right

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.770
here, it just created a checking
account for D, which

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.700
later D paid to A and that's why
it's labeled A right here.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.000
Let me relabel another thing
because the gold is different

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.570
colors so you see the gold.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.090
This is the gold part
of the assets.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.080
Let me make that very clear,
that all of this

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.775
right here is gold.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.420
That's all gold and there's
500 gold pieces.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.150
So let's introduce the concept
of a reserve ratio.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.760
Let's think a little bit about
what even a reserve is.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.390
A reserve is something that
you keep aside because you

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.750
might need it one day.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.860
And in this situation, all of
these liabilities-- whether

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.380
they're these bank notes
outstanding in this example or

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.920
whether they're these checking
accounts, these demand

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.770
accounts-- these are all
liabilities that someone can

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.940
come back to the bank on any
given day and say, hey, I want

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.830
my gold now-- for
whatever reason.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.490
Maybe I'm leaving town.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.480
Maybe I don't trust
the bank anymore.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.435
For whatever reason--
maybe they just want

00:03:24.435 --> 00:03:26.290
to make some jewelry.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.800
For whatever reason, that person
wants their gold back.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.070
These are demand accounts.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.110
These checking accounts are
demand accounts and these

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.530
notes are things that can be
exchanged for gold at any

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.940
point in time.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.880
And we talked a little bit about
this earlier when we

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.580
started the whole banking
discussion, but you have to

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:49.000
leave aside a little bit of
gold just in case someone

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.650
wants their gold back.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.780
So this amount of the gold that
you have to leave aside

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.870
as a reserve, relative to the
total amount of demands you

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.540
have on that gold, that's
the reserve ratio.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:10.290
And in this situation, this
world that we've created, the

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.710
reserve store value is gold.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.250
Later on we're going to get
ourselves off of this gold

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.149
system and then that reserve
store of value is actually

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:23.030
going to turn into cash, but
for right now-- and I think

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.760
it's easier actually to
conceptualize gold.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.685
Let's stick with gold.

00:04:25.685 --> 00:04:29.910
The reserve ratio for this bank
is the amount of gold

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.090
assets-- you won't see this
formal definition anywhere

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.000
because most people are off the
gold standard right now--

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.520
but it's the amount of gold
assets divided by total-- I

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.470
don't want to say total
liabilities because the bank

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.840
could take out loans that
aren't demand loans.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.100
Everything on the liabilities
right now are on demand loans,

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.680
which means whoever has that
liability can come back and

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.580
exchange it for gold at any
moment in time, but the bank

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.550
could've taken just a regular
loan-- and a regular loan

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.730
might not be on demand.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.780
A regular loan might be a loan
that the bank doesn't have to

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.060
pay back for 10 years, in which
case there's no reason

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.660
why the bank would have
to set aside some

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.040
gold to pay that back.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.380
So let's make our definition
not total liabilities, but

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.250
total demand liabilities.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.900
So what would be total
demand liabilities?

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:38.800
That would be total bank notes
in this case-- and bank notes

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.650
are also something-- we'll
later leave a world where

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.720
every bank is issuing bank
notes, but I just wanted to

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.300
give you that kind of historical
context, how bank

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.840
notes even started off.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.300
Total bank notes and
demand accounts,

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.120
demand or checking accounts.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.900
So let's see what it is for this
bank that we have here.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.770
So our total gold assets are
500-- and what's our total

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.310
demand accounts?

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:14.630
100 plus 100 plus 100-- 100,
200, 300, 400-- 600-- and I

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:20.180
think this is another
100 here-- 700.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.000
The total demand liabilities,
I just figured out, was 700

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:32.370
and the gold assets in
this bank are 500.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.920
So right now the reserve
ratio of this bank is

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.500
pretty high-- 5/7.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.170
So I don't know what 5/7 is.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.590
If I'm doing my mental math
right, it's about 62%-- 7 goes

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:56.550
into 50-- no, no, 7 goes into
57 times-- it's like 71%.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.740
Right.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.000
7 times 7 is 49-- 71%.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.940
So that's its reserve ratio.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.230
And what keeps banks from just
keep issuing more assets and

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.590
debts to expand its balance
sheet is a reserve ratio

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:09.700
requirement.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.570
So right now in the United
States-- although we're not on

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.630
the gold standard, but you
could imagine it in this

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.960
world-- our bank regulators
might say that your reserve

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.680
ratio on demand accounts-- so
the amount of gold you have to

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.090
set aside for checking
accounts-- so reserve

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:26.190
requirement, we'll call it.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.516
Let me change colors just
to ease the monotony.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.070
They might say the reserve
requirement is equal to--

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:36.080
let's say they want
to be safe.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.180
Let's say they want
to make it 20%.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.250
In the U.S. right now, it's
10% although the reserve

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:44.710
commodity isn't gold anymore.

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.190
Let's say your reserve
requirement is 20%.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:52.750
That means as long as-- at any
given moment in time, more

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:57.260
than 20% of these people don't
demand their money back, the

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.230
bank's going to have
liquidity.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:03.190
The bank is going to be able
to fulfill its promise.

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:05.340
Because all of these people
think at any given moment they

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.020
can go to the bank and
get their gold.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.960
In order for this system to
work, there has to be

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.650
confidence-- and in order for
there to be confidence, the

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.520
bank has to be good for it every
time someone asks for

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:15.940
their money.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:19.350
So the bank has to
stay liquid.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:22.020
So essentially this reserve
ratio is what the regulators

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.760
think that a bank needs
to maintain

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.230
in order to be liquid.

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:30.690
Our bank as it is right now, it
has a reserve ratio of 71%.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:34.630
So as long as no more than 71%
of these people-- some of

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.710
these loans, they might be
out for a year or two.

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.740
So as long as, in that year or
two that these loans are out,

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:45.470
as long as no more than 71% of
these people don't come asking

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.550
for their gold, we
should be OK.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:51.030
If all of a sudden for whatever
weird reason, I don't

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:55.570
know, 80% of these people who
have demand deposits or bank

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:59.340
notes come and want to switch
their money for gold, this

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.750
bank is going to run out of gold
and that's a bank run.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:06.050
And there's a couple of reasons
why that's really bad.

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:09.780
One is, all of a sudden these
demand deposit accounts all of

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.780
a sudden don't seem to be that
great because you're not

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.410
really getting your gold on
demand because more people are

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.550
asking for gold than
there is gold.

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.940
And the other problem is, all of
a sudden everyone will lose

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.270
confidence in the system and
everyone's going to think,

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.960
boy, these banks that have
these nice vault-looking

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.730
buildings-- maybe they're not
as safe as I thought.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:30.700
So everyone is going to start
pulling their money out.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.070
And that's called a bank run.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.430
So in this example, if I assume
that this loan is

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.990
really worth 300 gold pieces
and it's really going to be

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:40.160
paid back and this loan right
here is really worth 100 gold

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.640
pieces and it really
will be paid back,

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.540
this bank is solvent.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.780
It has more assets than
it does liabilities.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:52.100
So if it has enough time, it
will be able to pay back all

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.310
of its liabilities.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:56.540
But if all of these people, all
of a sudden, come in and

00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:01.540
want not just 500 gold pieces,
if they want 600 gold pieces,

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.200
right, they're owed actually
700-- so if they want 600 gold

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.510
pieces, all of a sudden
everyone's going to lose

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:07.950
confidence in the system.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:10.050
These people probably-- if
they're not able to get that,

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:11.990
they're probably going to want
all their money back so then

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.630
all of these liabilities
are going to come due.

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:17.400
And then maybe the bank is going
to have to try to sell

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.660
these loans to someone else or
maybe try to collect from

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:24.940
someone, but as you can imagine,
it's a big mess and

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.570
the whole system which is
dependent on confidence will

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.060
just start to crumble.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:32.160
But anyway, the initial question
is, what is the limit

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.280
to how much you can expand the
asset and the liability side

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.550
of the balance sheet just by
creating these loans and these

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:38.640
deposit accounts?

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.740
And that limit is driven by the
reserve ratio, whatever

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.060
the regulators set.

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:48.270
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
