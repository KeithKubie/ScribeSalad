00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:09.589
Mysteries of vernacular:

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:11.239
Yankee,

00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:12.860
a New England resident

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.381
or, more generally, a person who lives in

00:00:15.381 --> 00:00:18.247
or is from the United States.

00:00:18.247 --> 00:00:21.235
Though the origin of Yankee is uncertain,

00:00:21.235 --> 00:00:23.917
this all-American word most likely descended

00:00:23.917 --> 00:00:26.632
from the Dutch moniker Janke,

00:00:26.632 --> 00:00:29.749
a diminutive meaning little Jan,

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:31.685
or little John.

00:00:31.685 --> 00:00:33.521
In the 17th century,

00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:36.774
Janke was the common nickname of Dutch sailors,

00:00:36.774 --> 00:00:39.214
pirates in particular.

00:00:39.214 --> 00:00:41.768
A Dutch pirate ship operating in the West Indies

00:00:41.768 --> 00:00:44.666
was even called the Yankee.

00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:47.242
Over the years, Yankee transformed

00:00:47.242 --> 00:00:49.155
from a pirate's nickname

00:00:49.155 --> 00:00:51.752
into a general term of contempt.

00:00:51.752 --> 00:00:55.617
In 1758, British general James Wolfe

00:00:55.617 --> 00:00:58.581
used Yankee as a pejorative term

00:00:58.581 --> 00:01:01.381
for the colonists under his supervision.

00:01:01.381 --> 00:01:04.577
But the insult wasn't limited to soldiers.

00:01:04.577 --> 00:01:08.358
Yankee quickly came to mean New Englander,

00:01:08.358 --> 00:01:10.117
and by the 1780s,

00:01:10.117 --> 00:01:11.603
it was used to look down

00:01:11.603 --> 00:01:14.149
upon any American.

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:15.771
During the Revolution,

00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:18.022
colonists co-opted Yankee

00:01:18.022 --> 00:01:22.109
and transformed it into a mark of national honor.

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:23.907
The Civil War, however,

00:01:23.907 --> 00:01:26.520
intensified the derisive definition

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.358
when it was used by Southerners

00:01:28.358 --> 00:01:30.769
to mock members of the Union.

00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:33.859
Today, it carries much less emotion,

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:35.239
unless, of course,

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:38.033
we're talking about baseball.
