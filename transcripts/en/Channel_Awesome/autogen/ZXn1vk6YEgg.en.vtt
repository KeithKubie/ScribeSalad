you can have a friend you can have a
girlfriend and they may not you may not

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190
girlfriend and they may not you may not

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750
be able to hang out with them all the
 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.500
be able to hang out with them all the
time but sometimes when everyone hangs

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510
time but sometimes when everyone hangs
 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.760
time but sometimes when everyone hangs
out together it just creates more

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770
out together it just creates more
 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.529

problems so it's okay to have that
 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.190
problems so it's okay to have that
separate time in that
