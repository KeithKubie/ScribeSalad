Alright, so we've identified what information this graphic is

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.480
communicating. But, you could probably imagine a really bad

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.320
graphic that had all the same information. You might

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.640
look at it and have no idea what's going on.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.390
Or, it might not tell the story as effectively.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.300
What makes this graphic so effective? Can we quantify

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.680
effective information visualization down to a few important ingredients?

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.640
I'd like to hear your thoughts again. In your perspective,

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.470
what are the ingredients to good information visualization? This

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.200
is a free-form question, so there's no right or

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.070
wrong answer. Type your answer in this text box.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.730
I'll share my thoughts with you in the next video.
