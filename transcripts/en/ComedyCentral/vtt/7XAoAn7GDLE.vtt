00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:09.543
SO OSWALD IS GREAT
FOR UNIVERSAL.

00:00:09.643 --> 00:00:11.812
WALT GOES TO CHARLES MINTZ
AND HE SAYS,

00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:16.316
LISTEN, WE ARE [BLEEP]
KILLING IT,

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:18.185
TIME FOR YOU TO PAY US
SOME MORE MONEY.

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:21.455
AND MINTZ, MINTZ LOOKS AT HIM
AND HE LAUGHS.

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:24.791
[laughs]
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU LESS MONEY.

00:00:24.892 --> 00:00:30.063
AND MINTZ GOES, I HAVE SIGNED
ALL OF YOUR ANIMATORS,

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:34.601
AND I OWN OSWALD, HE'S MINE.

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:38.005
WALT DISNEY VOWED FROM THAT DAY,

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:44.011
NOT ONLY WILL I EVER NOT OWN
ANY CHARACTER I CREATE,

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:48.382
I WILL NEVER NOT OWN THEM.

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:52.920
THEY-THE [laughs]
I THINK.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.089
HE SAID TO UB,
UB, YOU WITH ME?

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.394
AND UB, YET AGAIN,
LEFT WITH WALT DISNEY,

00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:02.629
AND UB SAID TO HIM,
WHAT ARE WE DOING WALT?

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:07.134
AND WALT'S LIKE, WE NEED A
CHARACTER, UB, WHAT DO YOU GOT?

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:09.636
WHAT ABOUT A HORSE?
NOPE.

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:11.638
WHAT ABOUT A DOG?
NOPE.

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:12.706
[sighs]
WHAT ABOUT A CAT?

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:15.175
NO, MAN,
WE GOT ENOUGH CATS.

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:17.845
WE GOT FELIX THE CAT,
THERE'S A LOT OF CATS OUT THERE.

00:01:17.945 --> 00:01:18.912
WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?

00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:21.281
WHAT ABOUT A MOUSE?

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:24.284
WALT'S LIKE, YEAH,
LET'S DO THAT.

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:29.656
BUT WHAT HAPPENED NEXT
WAS ALL UB IWERKS, OKAY?

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:32.192
SO UB LOCKED HIMSELF
IN THE STUDIO,

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:37.030
AND HE CHURNS OUT 600 TO 700
FRAMES A DAY, UNHEARD OF.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.501
HE DID TWO MONTHS OF ANIMATION
IN TWO WEEKS,

00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:44.738
AND HE CREATED A CHARACTER,
MICKEY MOUSE.

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:47.841
HE SAT DOWN AND DREW
THAT CARTOON PLAIN CRAZY,

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.676
WALT LOVES IT,
BUT HE GOES YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:52.946
WE NEED SOMETHING BIGGER,
AND UB WAS LIKE,

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:54.948
BUT WHAT IF WE COULD
SYNC SOUND TO IT?

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:58.485
WHAT IF WE DID OUR NEXT CARTOON
WHERE WE COULD SEE

00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:02.389
THE ACTION HAPPENING IN THE TIME
WITH THE MUSIC,

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:06.426
AND WALT WAS LIKE YEAH,
LET'S DO SYNC SOUND.

00:02:06.527 --> 00:02:10.497
SO STEAMBAY--SO STEAM MILL--

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:12.866
SO STEAMBOAT WILLIE COMES OUT

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:15.035
AND IT BLOWS AUDIENCES AWAY.

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:17.137
THEY WENT,
I CAN SEE THAT MOUSE WHISTLING.

00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:19.940
I CAN HEAR THE MOUSE WHISTLING,
OH MY GOD,

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.211
THIS MOUSE IS WHISTLING ALONG
WITH WHAT HIS MOUTH IS DOING.

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:26.146
THERE'S [bleep] SYNC SOUND.

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:28.048
THERE WERE STANDING OVATIONS.

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:31.151
MICKEY MOUSE BECAME
AN ICON OVERNIGHT.

00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:33.954
HE WAS REFERENCED
IN MOVIES AND SONGS,

00:02:34.054 --> 00:02:38.292
AND IT CREATES DISNEY.

00:02:38.392 --> 00:02:41.461
LIKE THIS EM--EMBELLISHES
THEIR MICE TO EVERYBODY.

00:02:41.562 --> 00:02:46.667
THEY KNOW THAT THIS IS LIKE
THE GAME HAS CHANGED.

00:02:46.767 --> 00:02:47.868
WITH THE ADDED PRESSURES
OF MICKEY DOING REALLY WELL,
