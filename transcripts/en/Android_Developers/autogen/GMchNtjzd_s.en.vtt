from a text-only product to an audio
product and as it is with these big

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959
product and as it is with these big
 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.720
product and as it is with these big
decisions we can't kept pushing off this

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730
decisions we can't kept pushing off this
 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.360
decisions we can't kept pushing off this
decision for a while at some point we

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370
decision for a while at some point we
 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.800

were sitting in a room six seven people

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810
were sitting in a room six seven people
 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.900
were sitting in a room six seven people
and we talked about a topic of audio

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910
and we talked about a topic of audio
 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.759
and we talked about a topic of audio
again and at this time growth had slowed

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769
again and at this time growth had slowed
 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.050
again and at this time growth had slowed
down a little bit in terms of like new

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060
down a little bit in terms of like new
 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.360

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690
it
 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.559
it
so we went often said okay let's try

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569
so we went often said okay let's try
 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.530
so we went often said okay let's try
audio let's make a plan but what's very

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540
audio let's make a plan but what's very
 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.930
audio let's make a plan but what's very
important is that we try to do this a

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940
important is that we try to do this a
 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.199
important is that we try to do this a
very structured way so we Betty said two

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209
very structured way so we Betty said two
 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.850
very structured way so we Betty said two
principles or we created framework for

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860
principles or we created framework for
 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.520
principles or we created framework for
us that said first let's be very clear

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530
us that said first let's be very clear
 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.380
us that said first let's be very clear
about our goals and expectations of

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390
about our goals and expectations of
 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.870
about our goals and expectations of
audio and second let's make it very easy

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880
audio and second let's make it very easy
 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.309
audio and second let's make it very easy
for us to get out of it if our

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319
for us to get out of it if our
 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.589
for us to get out of it if our
expectations are not met so what the

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599
expectations are not met so what the
 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.420
expectations are not met so what the
first one means is let's be very clear

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430
first one means is let's be very clear
 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.789
first one means is let's be very clear
what we expect from audio is we said

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799
what we expect from audio is we said
 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.650
what we expect from audio is we said
okay first it's gonna increased

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660
okay first it's gonna increased
 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.660
okay first it's gonna increased
usability of the product which means

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670
usability of the product which means
 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.580
usability of the product which means
more people are likely to convert to

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590
more people are likely to convert to
 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.379
more people are likely to convert to
blinkers because there's no like a room

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389
blinkers because there's no like a room
 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:28.550
blinkers because there's no like a room
like there's a time when they can use

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560
like there's a time when they can use
 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.509
like there's a time when they can use
blinkers and therefore they would

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519
blinkers and therefore they would
 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.150
blinkers and therefore they would
convert to the product second we thought

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160
convert to the product second we thought
 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.460
convert to the product second we thought
with audio the perceived value of the

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470
with audio the perceived value of the
 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.289
with audio the perceived value of the
product might be higher so we could

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299
product might be higher so we could
 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.360
product might be higher so we could
actually charge more for blinkers then

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370
actually charge more for blinkers then
 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.330
actually charge more for blinkers then
we could charge before in terms of make

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340
we could charge before in terms of make
 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.180
we could charge before in terms of make
it easy to get out we said to ourselves

won't work but if you really try to

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:49.600
won't work but if you really try to
 

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.060

facing or promise they need what they
 

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:54.990
facing or promise they need what they
have and what you can solve then this is

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:55.000
have and what you can solve then this is
 

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.360
have and what you can solve then this is
a good opportunity to introduce this and

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:57.370
a good opportunity to introduce this and
 

00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:59.550

see for audio we can push it off then we

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:13.090
see for audio we can push it off then we
 

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:14.940
see for audio we can push it off then we
said ok we do it we didn't know if we

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:14.950
said ok we do it we didn't know if we
 

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:16.710
said ok we do it we didn't know if we
kind of what's gonna work out or not so

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:16.720
kind of what's gonna work out or not so
 

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.030
kind of what's gonna work out or not so
what we knew is there is a need for

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:18.040
what we knew is there is a need for
 

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.950
what we knew is there is a need for
audio but we didn't know if link is the

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:19.960
audio but we didn't know if link is the
 

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.480
audio but we didn't know if link is the
right product in the right solution to

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:21.490
right product in the right solution to
 

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:24.540
right product in the right solution to
serve this need so you could like we

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:24.550
serve this need so you could like we
 

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:26.700
serve this need so you could like we
could discuss this for 4 years we did or

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:26.710
could discuss this for 4 years we did or
 

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.700
could discuss this for 4 years we did or
just try it and I think it's important

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:29.710
just try it and I think it's important
 

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:31.260
just try it and I think it's important
that you do research but I believe

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:31.270
that you do research but I believe
 

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:32.700
that you do research but I believe
strongly in that use at some point you

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:32.710
strongly in that use at some point you
 

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:34.110
strongly in that use at some point you
have to trust your intuition or like

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:34.120
have to trust your intuition or like
 

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.090
have to trust your intuition or like
listen to your gut saying ok if like I

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:36.100
listen to your gut saying ok if like I
 

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.980
listen to your gut saying ok if like I
collect a little of data I look at that

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:37.990
collect a little of data I look at that
 

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:39.540
collect a little of data I look at that
but then you have to make a decision

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:39.550
but then you have to make a decision
 

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.280
but then you have to make a decision
based on that so what we do at blinkers

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:41.290
based on that so what we do at blinkers
 

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:43.350
based on that so what we do at blinkers
we call this data-driven intuition which

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.360
we call this data-driven intuition which
 

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.960
we call this data-driven intuition which
basically means we we collect data but

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:45.970
basically means we we collect data but
 

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:47.280
basically means we we collect data but
the data won't give you the answer you

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:47.290
the data won't give you the answer you
 

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:48.990
the data won't give you the answer you
have to still like to make a leap of

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:49.000
have to still like to make a leap of
 

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.400
have to still like to make a leap of
faith at some point because you will

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:50.410
faith at some point because you will
 

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:52.020
faith at some point because you will
never have perfect data to make a

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:52.030
never have perfect data to make a
 

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:55.410
never have perfect data to make a
decision and sometimes timing or like

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:55.420
decision and sometimes timing or like
 

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.870
decision and sometimes timing or like
often timing is super important so one

00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:57.880
often timing is super important so one
 

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.400
often timing is super important so one
thing when it comes to audio blink is

00:10:59.400 --> 00:10:59.410
thing when it comes to audio blink is
 

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:01.350
thing when it comes to audio blink is
what is important is when you look at

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:01.360
what is important is when you look at
 

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.930
what is important is when you look at
when we launched audio it's like end of

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:03.940
when we launched audio it's like end of
 

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:06.720
when we launched audio it's like end of
November 2014 so we were working for 3

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:06.730
November 2014 so we were working for 3

November 2014 so we were working for 3
months so we started in September

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:08.590
months so we started in September
 

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:12.690

working on audio in October 2014 the

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:12.700
working on audio in October 2014 the
 

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:14.640
working on audio in October 2014 the
serial podcast was launched and serial

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:14.650
serial podcast was launched and serial
 

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.470

podcast like in hindsight is probably

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.480
podcast like in hindsight is probably
 

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.440
podcast like in hindsight is probably
the podcast that opened up audio again

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:19.450
the podcast that opened up audio again
 

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:21.180

for like basically everyone and that's
 

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:25.079
for like basically everyone and that's
very interesting because like we didn't

00:11:25.079 --> 00:11:25.089
very interesting because like we didn't
 

00:11:25.089 --> 00:11:26.400
very interesting because like we didn't
create his trend but we were like

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:26.410
create his trend but we were like
 

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:28.710
create his trend but we were like
basically at the same time maybe

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:28.720
basically at the same time maybe
 

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.269
basically at the same time maybe
arriving the same insight or like just

00:11:30.269 --> 00:11:30.279
arriving the same insight or like just
 

00:11:30.279 --> 00:11:31.920
arriving the same insight or like just
there at the right time because suddenly

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:31.930
there at the right time because suddenly
 

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:33.510
there at the right time because suddenly
all you was the thing and everyone was

serial I'm not sure if blinkers or you

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:36.820
serial I'm not sure if blinkers or you
 

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.010

would have been dead successful to be

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:38.020
would have been dead successful to be
 

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:41.040
would have been dead successful to be
honest but you can't you do you don't

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:41.050
honest but you can't you do you don't
 

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:42.600
honest but you can't you do you don't
know before and you just have to try

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:42.610
know before and you just have to try
 

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:44.310
know before and you just have to try
that so timing obviously is important

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:44.320
that so timing obviously is important
 

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.930
that so timing obviously is important
but without trying you will never be

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:45.940
but without trying you will never be
 

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.350
but without trying you will never be
able to capitalize on trends

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:48.360
able to capitalize on trends

test it so that we have two downside

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:09.400

to validate that and then rest we run

to validate that and then rest we run
with that and then we see if we want to

with that and then we see if we want to
 

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:20.460
