00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.600
So let's get started by looking
at the example Roman discussed.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.140
The awesome thing about this is that
most of the logic lies in the layout

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.810
file and
the Java code stays pretty tame.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.240
The only time you refer to
the collapsing toolbar layout is here,

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.930
where we assigned the title.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.360
Collapsing tool bar layout allows us to
set the title style when the tool bar

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.670
is expanded or collapsed.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.460
We'll explore in a moment
why this is useful.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.049
So, let's take a look at
another food inspired app.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:36.300
As we can see, we don't have to be
limited to a solid background when

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.310
dealing with a collapsing toolbar.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.200
When you scroll,
the image disappears and

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.680
the word eclairs appears in the app bar.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.400
The interesting bits about this
image view are right here.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.070
We want the image to have
a parallax effect as it collapses.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.280
That's to say that the foreground
moves faster than the background,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.600
providing a sense of depth to the scene.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.860
In this layout we have a text view
whose content takes up a lot of space.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.790
We would expect to need
to use a scroll view.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.760
Without this line, the app doesn't
know when to scroll the toolbar, so

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.210
your toolbar remains stationary.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.760
This is because AppBarLayout
expects to have a sibling

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.320
in CoordinatorLayout that is
capable of nested scrolling.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.100
You can do that with a nested scroll
view from the support library, or

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.090
by setting
nestedScrollingEnabled to true.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.950
The nestedScrollingEnabled property
is only present on scroll view for

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.655
Lollipop and above.

00:01:31.655 --> 00:01:34.630
Nested scrolling works with
CoordinatorLayout to notify and

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.840
manage when the app bar
should be scrolling,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.050
the nested view should be scrolling,
both should be scrolling, or none.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.915
Check the instructor's notes for
some resources on AppBarLayout.
