1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,340
The Joe Rogan experience. When will it
snap back? I mean it's coming. Trump.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,280
That's what Trump's press. What
that is. He's Gunna win again.

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,890
He's going to win again or the WHO can
beat him. They're not going to beat it.

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,650
There's no one who can write.
He's going to win again.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,450
He's going to win again
because of shit like this.

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,440
The more shit like this happens.
There's a then what's after chunk down.

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,790
Then there's another four
years son Donald Jr Donald J.

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,000
Donald Jr was a with a
friend of a friend of mine.

9
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:32,250
His name is crispy and he,
he's a disabled veteran or a shit.

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,850
He's very able, I should say, but he's
a wounded veteran. He's, he was missing,

11
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,450
he had his leg amputated,
Burns over most of his body.

12
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,250
Super positive attitude. Great Guy.
Anyways, he doesn't get political online.

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,790
He took a picture with
Donald Trump jr right,

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,490
and Instagram took it down for
violating their terms of service.

15
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,930
It's just a photo picture of just
photo with hesitant son. Yeah.

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,020
Photo with him at Trump jr standing
there and they took the picture down.

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,720
What that, what are you doing? Yeah,
maybe that's say hitch. Did they ever,

18
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,960
when they do that that it gives you a
reason or they just do what they want?

19
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:11,610
Well, he posted it on his, he sent
me a direct message about it too.

20
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,430
I asked,
I actually reached out to him,

21
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,090
cause a on follow him and he follows me
and I was like, this is this shit real.

22
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,120
And he's like, Yup. And he's
super positive about it.

23
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:24,570
I mean this is the guy who served our
country too and he's, he's a great guy.

24
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,440
Like his, his, his, his, his uh,

25
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,820
Instagram handle is
crispy 11 B. Okay. Yeah.

26
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:37,821
And he just put it up there and they said
that they got him for terms of service

27
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:41,250
and they took it down and he put it
back up again. Good. Good for him.

28
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,480
So this is the photo right here.

29
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,910
I'm going to say when asked to Instagram
says that they didn't do it so they

30
00:01:45,911 --> 00:01:48,490
didn't do it, but who took
it down that said, however,

31
00:01:48,491 --> 00:01:50,170
an Instagram spoke
first and told Fox News.

32
00:01:50,171 --> 00:01:53,340
The post was reviewed but was not deleted
by the company after I found the post

33
00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:56,650
did not violate their standards.
But that's not true because it's missing.

34
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,800
Spokesperson said that there are a number
of reasons at post may no longer be

35
00:01:59,801 --> 00:02:03,370
available, including the account holder
deletes either the account or the post.

36
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,780
He's saying he didn't do that, so it
could have been something else. Mm.

37
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,780
I mean you can't prove
it. Yeah. I don't know.

38
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:14,100
Well this dude is not an attention whore.
You wouldn't do that.

39
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,280
He wouldn't do that in lie about it.
That's ridiculous. I mean, Twitter,

40
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,230
Instagram could be lying and I just
never really could be a glitch too. Yeah.

41
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,550
You know,
sometimes it's a for two at as glitch.

42
00:02:23,551 --> 00:02:28,110
That looks like a massive conspiracy.
Yeah, but he said they'd send them notice.

43
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,940
It said it violated the terms of
services. So if he said that, okay. Yeah,

44
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,120
that's what was said back to me.

45
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,510
Pretty sure that's the screenshot you'll
want to make sure that's what he says.

46
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,700
You violated something. Yeah.
That's what you want. I mean,

47
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,460
it's just so weird what's going on now.
This is,

48
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,110
everything just seemed so
fucking preposterous. Yeah.

49
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:52,310
Just like on Facebook, Twitter,
all that stuff. If I get,

50
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,120
if it's something negative, I just, you
know, that's gone. I don't, I don't let,

51
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,770
I don't let people just start bashing me
on that stuff. I just, okay, here it is.

52
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,000
Once I landed,

53
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:04,870
I opened up Instagram and got a message
that your post was taken down for

54
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:07,030
violating Instagram guidelines,

55
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,900
so yeah.

56
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,240
Did he post that? Yes, he did.
Oh, there you go. Wait a minute.

57
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:13,643
Let me see what it did.

58
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,090
Yeah,

59
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,640
yeah. He posted a thing saying it.
Okay. Here's what he posted. Yeah.

60
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,500
It said wounded veteran violated
community standards by posting with Donald

61
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,810
Trump jr he didn't post
the actual notification,

62
00:03:24,811 --> 00:03:29,490
but he probably didn't even
save it. Right. Why would you,
yeah. He's, I believe him.

63
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,820
I believe him. I just somebody,
you're right. It is a sad,

64
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:37,140
I think you also have overzealous
employees. I think there's that too. Yeah.

65
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,390
I think there's probably a huge company.
Yeah. I mean, you, anybody can go row,

66
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,170
get a minute and just do what the
what the what the where they want.

67
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,910
You think the reading Dick Pics and kind
of just been fucking with them on the

68
00:03:47,911 --> 00:03:48,990
other way.
The other way around.

69
00:03:48,991 --> 00:03:51,120
Someone could've just flagged
it via a bunch of bots.

70
00:03:51,121 --> 00:03:54,440
It's just made up disappear. Oh right.
To get a reaction like this. Yeah.

71
00:03:54,441 --> 00:03:56,820
That's all. It could be simple
as that. Can you do that? Sure.

72
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,270
So if you just had a bot to do it right,
I could do it right now.

73
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,080
Instagram review it manually
before they delete it. No,

74
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,210
cause I can just be taken down.

75
00:04:06,211 --> 00:04:08,850
It happens on other accounts for that
doesn't get reviewed that way and it just

76
00:04:08,851 --> 00:04:11,490
got taken down because it got
flagged so many times. I don't know.
