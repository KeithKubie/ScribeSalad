00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is the second choice.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The extended Euclidean algorithm does exactly this.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It will give us that multiplicative inverse.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We won't go through that in detail now.

00:00:09.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Maybe it'll be a good question for a homework problem.
