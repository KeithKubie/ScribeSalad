I do advise my students to be broad and

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:07.240
I do advise my students to be broad and
 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.910
I do advise my students to be broad and
open-minded and they're thinking when it

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:08.920
open-minded and they're thinking when it
 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.650
open-minded and they're thinking when it
comes to careers I mean basically what

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:10.660
comes to careers I mean basically what
 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.810
comes to careers I mean basically what
you want is somebody to have a great

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:12.820
you want is somebody to have a great
 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.760
you want is somebody to have a great
career and be happy and you know and so

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770
career and be happy and you know and so
 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.029
career and be happy and you know and so
my advice to students is to not don't do

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:21.039
my advice to students is to not don't do
 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:22.830
my advice to students is to not don't do
what's gonna make you the most money or

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840
what's gonna make you the most money or
 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.230
what's gonna make you the most money or
the most security but do something that

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240
the most security but do something that
 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.990
the most security but do something that
will make you happy whatever that is

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000
will make you happy whatever that is
 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.370
will make you happy whatever that is
well when I got done with graduate

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380
well when I got done with graduate
 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.900
well when I got done with graduate
school or when I was finishing graduate

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910
school or when I was finishing graduate
 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.469
school or when I was finishing graduate
school this was the 1970s and there was

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:34.479
school this was the 1970s and there was
 

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:35.969
school this was the 1970s and there was
this gas shortage just like a few years

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:35.979
this gas shortage just like a few years
 

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:38.489
this gas shortage just like a few years
ago and the prices of gas kept going up

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:38.499
ago and the prices of gas kept going up
 

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:40.289
ago and the prices of gas kept going up
so what that meant if you were a

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:40.299
so what that meant if you were a
 

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:42.479
so what that meant if you were a
chemical engineer like I was is you'd

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489
chemical engineer like I was is you'd
 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.099
chemical engineer like I was is you'd
get a lot of job offers from oil

00:00:44.099 --> 00:00:44.109
get a lot of job offers from oil
 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:45.629
get a lot of job offers from oil
companies and pretty much all my

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:45.639
companies and pretty much all my
 

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:48.029
companies and pretty much all my
classmates went to oil companies and

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:48.039
classmates went to oil companies and
 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:49.680
classmates went to oil companies and
worked there and they got very high

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690
worked there and they got very high
 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.309
worked there and they got very high
paying jobs I did get 20 job interviews

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:53.319
paying jobs I did get 20 job interviews
 

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:58.529
paying jobs I did get 20 job interviews
from these companies and I got 20 offers

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539
from these companies and I got 20 offers
 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.379
from these companies and I got 20 offers
to but I wasn't very excited about doing

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:01.389
to but I wasn't very excited about doing
 

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:03.779
to but I wasn't very excited about doing
that I remember one interview where they

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789
that I remember one interview where they
 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:05.280
that I remember one interview where they
told me if I could just increase the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290
told me if I could just increase the
 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.770
told me if I could just increase the
yield of this one petrochemical by 0.1

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780
yield of this one petrochemical by 0.1
 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.840
yield of this one petrochemical by 0.1
percent that would be worth billions of

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850
percent that would be worth billions of
 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.359
percent that would be worth billions of
dollars and I just wasn't excited about

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369
dollars and I just wasn't excited about
 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:13.800
dollars and I just wasn't excited about
the impact that that would have and I

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810
the impact that that would have and I
 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.719
the impact that that would have and I
kept looking for ways where I guess I

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729
kept looking for ways where I guess I
 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.429
kept looking for ways where I guess I
felt I could have more of a of an impact

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439
felt I could have more of a of an impact
 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:18.060
felt I could have more of a of an impact
on the world

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070
on the world
 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.450
on the world
well let me give an example of what we

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460
well let me give an example of what we
 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.120
well let me give an example of what we
have one thing we did actually when I

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130
have one thing we did actually when I
 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.740
have one thing we did actually when I
was a postdoctoral fellow with Judah

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750
was a postdoctoral fellow with Judah
 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.080
was a postdoctoral fellow with Judah
Folkman one of the questions that we

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090
Folkman one of the questions that we
 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.419
Folkman one of the questions that we
asked was could mount could molecules

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429
asked was could mount could molecules
 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:32.760
asked was could mount could molecules
exist that could stop blood vessels from

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770
exist that could stop blood vessels from
 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.800
exist that could stop blood vessels from
growing in the body a lot of people

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810
growing in the body a lot of people
 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.599
growing in the body a lot of people
didn't believe that that could happen

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:36.609
didn't believe that that could happen
 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:39.389
didn't believe that that could happen
but my boss dr. time dr. Folkman did and

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399
but my boss dr. time dr. Folkman did and
 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.760
but my boss dr. time dr. Folkman did and
he hired me and we found that cartilage

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770
he hired me and we found that cartilage
 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.980
he hired me and we found that cartilage
was able to block blood vessels this was

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990
was able to block blood vessels this was
 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.080
was able to block blood vessels this was
done with Henry Brown as well and then

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090
done with Henry Brown as well and then
 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.690
done with Henry Brown as well and then
we found but we want to see could we

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700
we found but we want to see could we
 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.550
we found but we want to see could we
find an extract in other words were the

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560
find an extract in other words were the
 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.940
find an extract in other words were the
real substances that could could stop

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950
real substances that could could stop
 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.849
real substances that could could stop
blood vessels from growing that might

00:01:59.849 --> 00:01:59.859
blood vessels from growing that might
 

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:01.889
blood vessels from growing that might
exist and well there's a lot of things

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899
exist and well there's a lot of things
 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.660
exist and well there's a lot of things
you have to break up the things into

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670
you have to break up the things into
 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.429
you have to break up the things into
different parts so first where might a

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439
different parts so first where might a
 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.050
different parts so first where might a
molecule exists that could stop blood

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060
molecule exists that could stop blood
 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.760
molecule exists that could stop blood
vessels the answer to that was possibly

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770
vessels the answer to that was possibly
 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.080
vessels the answer to that was possibly
cartilage which doesn't have blood

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090
cartilage which doesn't have blood
 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.670
cartilage which doesn't have blood
vessels then you have to have a way to

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680
vessels then you have to have a way to
 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.380
vessels then you have to have a way to
study it and that was very very hard

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390
study it and that was very very hard
 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.210
study it and that was very very hard
because blood vessels

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220
because blood vessels
 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.340
because blood vessels
but actually grow slowly over time and

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350
but actually grow slowly over time and
 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.710
but actually grow slowly over time and
we needed what we call as a bio assay

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720
we needed what we call as a bio assay
 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.170
we needed what we call as a bio assay
and to develop a bio essay we needed

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180
and to develop a bio essay we needed
 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.040
and to develop a bio essay we needed
something that could release these

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050
something that could release these
 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.860
something that could release these
substances for a very very long time a

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870
substances for a very very long time a
 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.220
substances for a very very long time a
little polymer or microsphere or micro

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230
little polymer or microsphere or micro
 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.750
little polymer or microsphere or micro
particle so we developed those but none

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760
particle so we developed those but none
 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.150
particle so we developed those but none
of those had ever been able to slowly

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160
of those had ever been able to slowly
 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.520
of those had ever been able to slowly
release molecules that were really big

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530
release molecules that were really big
 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.710
release molecules that were really big
and the molecules that we thought would

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720
and the molecules that we thought would
 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.870
and the molecules that we thought would
stop blood vessels were really big so we

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880
stop blood vessels were really big so we
 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.050
stop blood vessels were really big so we
had to actually then create ways to

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060
had to actually then create ways to
 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.760
had to actually then create ways to
release these molecules slowly even

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770
release these molecules slowly even
 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.260
release these molecules slowly even
though they were big and release them

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270
though they were big and release them
 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.920
though they were big and release them
for months and that was something people

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930
for months and that was something people
 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.120
for months and that was something people
never thought was possible

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130
never thought was possible
 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.190
never thought was possible
but I spent several years working on it

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200
but I spent several years working on it
 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.630
but I spent several years working on it
experimenting with different techniques

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640
experimenting with different techniques
 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.970
experimenting with different techniques
and eventually I figured out a way to do

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980
and eventually I figured out a way to do
 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.850
and eventually I figured out a way to do
it and when we did that we published a

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860
it and when we did that we published a
 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.710
it and when we did that we published a
paper in nature showing that for the

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720
paper in nature showing that for the
 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.660
paper in nature showing that for the
first time you could release molecules

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670
first time you could release molecules
 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.190
first time you could release molecules
of any size from these little micro

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200
of any size from these little micro
 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.290
of any size from these little micro
particles and then we use that to create

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300
particles and then we use that to create
 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.210
particles and then we use that to create
the bioassay and we isolated the first

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220
the bioassay and we isolated the first
 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.340
the bioassay and we isolated the first
substances that could stop blood vessels

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350
substances that could stop blood vessels
 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.170
substances that could stop blood vessels
from growing in the body both of those

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180
from growing in the body both of those
 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.660
from growing in the body both of those
discoveries the polymer slow release

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670
discoveries the polymer slow release
 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.090
discoveries the polymer slow release
systems and the substances that could

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100
systems and the substances that could
 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.400
systems and the substances that could
stop blood vessels from growing led to

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410
stop blood vessels from growing led to
 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.340
stop blood vessels from growing led to
major industries yeah well when I first

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350
major industries yeah well when I first
 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.960
major industries yeah well when I first
gave lectures and on the work we did on

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970
gave lectures and on the work we did on
 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.130
gave lectures and on the work we did on
slowly releasing these large molecules

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140
slowly releasing these large molecules
 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.080
slowly releasing these large molecules
from polymers when we first published

from polymers when we first published
 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.509
from polymers when we first published
this work pretty much everybody in the

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519
this work pretty much everybody in the
 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.360
this work pretty much everybody in the
scientific community didn't believe it

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370
scientific community didn't believe it
 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.690
scientific community didn't believe it
and the consequence of that is that I

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700
and the consequence of that is that I
 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.690
and the consequence of that is that I
didn't get any grants my first nine

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700
didn't get any grants my first nine
 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.750
didn't get any grants my first nine
grants were rejected also when I started

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760
grants were rejected also when I started

to apply for faculty positions I'm a

to apply for faculty positions I'm a
chemical engineer and no chemical

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890
chemical engineer and no chemical
 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:57.930
chemical engineer and no chemical
engineering department in the world

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940
engineering department in the world
 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.180
engineering department in the world
would hire me I ended up going into a

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190
would hire me I ended up going into a
 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.000
would hire me I ended up going into a
nutrition department but the problem

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010
nutrition department but the problem
 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.880
nutrition department but the problem
there was that the people in that

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890
there was that the people in that
 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.470

department didn't think very much of
 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.390
department didn't think very much of
what I was doing and they basically told

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400
what I was doing and they basically told
 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.190
what I was doing and they basically told
me I should start looking for another

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200
me I should start looking for another
 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.610
me I should start looking for another
job so it was not very pleasant in the

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620
job so it was not very pleasant in the
 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.949
job so it was not very pleasant in the
beginning I think if I had moved away

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959
beginning I think if I had moved away
 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.550
beginning I think if I had moved away
from it I you know I don't I don't know

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560
from it I you know I don't I don't know
 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.719
from it I you know I don't I don't know
what would have happened I mean it's

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729
what would have happened I mean it's
 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.120
what would have happened I mean it's
very hard to to figure out alternative

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130
very hard to to figure out alternative
 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.659
very hard to to figure out alternative
paths I I think if you give up too

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669
paths I I think if you give up too
 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:28.980
paths I I think if you give up too
easily

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990
easily
 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.260
easily
that's not good obviously you don't want

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270
that's not good obviously you don't want
 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.640
that's not good obviously you don't want
to keep banging your head against the

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650
to keep banging your head against the
 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.370
to keep banging your head against the
wall forever so I think there's some

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380
wall forever so I think there's some
 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.820
wall forever so I think there's some
compromises you have to make but I think

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830
compromises you have to make but I think
 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.060
compromises you have to make but I think
if I gave up on something like that

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070
if I gave up on something like that
 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.620
if I gave up on something like that
you know maybe I'd give up on other

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630
you know maybe I'd give up on other
 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.140
you know maybe I'd give up on other
things that were important to I just

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150
things that were important to I just
 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.650
things that were important to I just
don't know I'm glad I didn't

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660
don't know I'm glad I didn't
 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.859
don't know I'm glad I didn't
