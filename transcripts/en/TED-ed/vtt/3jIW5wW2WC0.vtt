00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.411
In the 18th century,

00:00:08.411 --> 00:00:13.208
Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus
designed the flower clock,

00:00:13.208 --> 00:00:16.466
a timepiece made of flowering plants

00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:20.657
that bloom and close 
at specific times of day.

00:00:20.657 --> 00:00:25.029
Linnaeus's plan wasn't perfect,
but the idea behind it was correct.

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.363
Flowers can indeed sense time,
after a fashion.

00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:33.762
Mornings glories unfurl their petals
like clockwork in the early morning.

00:00:33.762 --> 00:00:38.032
A closing white water lily 
signals that it's late afternoon,

00:00:38.032 --> 00:00:43.339
and moon flowers, as the name suggests,
only bloom under the night sky.

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:46.776
But what gives plants 
this innate sense of time?

00:00:46.776 --> 00:00:48.673
It's not just plants, in fact.

00:00:48.673 --> 00:00:51.889
Many organisms on Earth
have a seemingly inherent awareness

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:54.993
of where they are in the day's cycle.

00:00:54.993 --> 00:00:57.215
That's because of circadian rhythms,

00:00:57.215 --> 00:01:02.288
the internal timekeepers
that tick away inside many living things.

00:01:02.288 --> 00:01:06.750
These biological clocks allow organisms
to keep track of time

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.024
and pick up on environmental cues
that help them adapt.

00:01:11.024 --> 00:01:14.230
That's important, because the planet's
rotations and revolutions

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.257
put us in a state of constant flux,

00:01:17.257 --> 00:01:21.011
although it plays out in a repetitive,
predictable way.

00:01:21.011 --> 00:01:23.708
Circadian rhythms incorporate various cues

00:01:23.708 --> 00:01:27.505
to regulate when an organism 
should wake and sleep,

00:01:27.505 --> 00:01:30.031
and perform certain activities.

00:01:30.031 --> 00:01:34.561
For plants, light and temperature
are the cues which trigger reactions

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:37.259
that play out at a molecular scale.

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.051
The cells in stems, leaves, and flowers
contain phytochromes,

00:01:42.051 --> 00:01:45.039
tiny molecules that detect light.

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.853
When that happens, phytochromes
initiate a chain of chemical reactions,

00:01:49.853 --> 00:01:53.490
passing the message down 
into the cellular nuclei.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.496
There, transcription factors trigger
the manufacture of proteins

00:01:57.496 --> 00:02:01.256
required to carry out 
light-dependent processes,

00:02:01.256 --> 00:02:03.246
like photosynthesis.

00:02:03.246 --> 00:02:07.006
These phytochromes not only sense
the amount of light the plant receives,

00:02:07.006 --> 00:02:09.382
but can also detect tiny differences

00:02:09.382 --> 00:02:13.779
in the distribution of wavelengths 
the plant takes in.

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:15.638
With this fine-tuned sensing,

00:02:15.638 --> 00:02:18.570
phytochromes allow the plant
to discern both time,

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.813
the difference between 
the middle of the day and the evening,

00:02:21.813 --> 00:02:26.051
and place, whether 
it is in direct sunlight or shade,

00:02:26.051 --> 00:02:30.933
enabling the plant to match
its chemical reactions to its environment.

00:02:30.933 --> 00:02:33.086
This makes for early risers.

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:37.203
A few hours before sunrise,
a typical plant is already active,

00:02:37.203 --> 00:02:42.142
creating mRNA templates 
for its photosynthesizing machinery.

00:02:42.142 --> 00:02:44.684
As the phytochromes 
detect increasing sunlight,

00:02:44.684 --> 00:02:47.248
the plant readies 
its light-capturing molecules

00:02:47.248 --> 00:02:51.708
so it can photosynthesize
and grow throughout the morning.

00:02:51.708 --> 00:02:53.579
After harvesting their morning light,

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:57.370
plants use the rest of the day
to build long chains of energy

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.154
in the form of glucose polymers, 
like starch.

00:03:01.154 --> 00:03:04.045
The sun sets, and the day's work is done,

00:03:04.045 --> 00:03:07.580
though a plant is anything 
but inactive at night.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.121
In the absence of sunlight,

00:03:09.121 --> 00:03:11.176
they metabolize and grow,

00:03:11.176 --> 00:03:15.413
breaking down the starch from 
the previous day's energy harvest.

00:03:15.413 --> 00:03:18.240
Many plants have seasonal rhythms as well.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.336
As spring melts the winter frost,

00:03:20.336 --> 00:03:24.414
phytochromes sense the longer days
and increasing light,

00:03:24.414 --> 00:03:28.684
and a currently unknown mechanism
detects the temperature change.

00:03:28.684 --> 00:03:31.315
These systems pass the news
throughout the plant

00:03:31.315 --> 00:03:33.668
and make it produce blooming flowers

00:03:33.668 --> 00:03:37.576
in preparation for the pollinators
brought out by warmer weather.

00:03:37.576 --> 00:03:41.977
Circadian rhythms act as a link
between a plant and its environment.

00:03:41.977 --> 00:03:45.088
These oscillations come 
from the plants themselves.

00:03:45.088 --> 00:03:47.564
Each one has a default rhythm.

00:03:47.564 --> 00:03:50.809
Even so, these clocks 
can adapt their oscillations

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:53.919
to environmental changes and cues.

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:55.853
On a planet that's in constant flux,

00:03:55.853 --> 00:04:00.764
it's the circadian rhythms that enable
a plant to stay true to its schedule

00:04:00.764 --> 00:04:03.144
and to keep its own time.
