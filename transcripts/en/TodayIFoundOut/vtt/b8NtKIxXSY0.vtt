00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:13.920
The word “penny” may have come from the
English ruler Penda, King of Mencia (an Anglo-Saxton

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.130
kingdom in today’s English midlands).

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:22.590
During his reign from 626 AD to 655 AD, he
issued coins that were called “pending.”

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.560
To further this theory along, the old English
word word for penny is “penige.”

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.980
In fact, the Danish still uses the word “Penge”
for their money.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.320
Now, if you think that “penny” came from
the Danish word (not the Danish coming from

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.141
the English), then the word could have something
to do with the pans that they used to use

00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:38.960
to coin the money.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.660
As with most idioms or sayings, no one is
exactly sure who first said “a penny for

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.100
your thoughts” or when.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.010
But we do know in this case who was the first
to publish it and then who popularized it.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.500
In 1522, Sir Thomas More’s book Four Last
Things was published posthumously.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.570
It was a book of meditations on death, God’s
judgement, pain, and how to combat “spiritual

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.570
diseases.”

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.800
Real uplifting stuff.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.800
In it, it reads,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.891
“As it often happeth that the very face
sheweth the mind walking a pilgrimage, in

00:01:09.891 --> 00:01:14.880
such wise that, not without some note and
reproach of such vagrant mind, other folk

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.990
suddenly say to them, ‘A penny for your
thought.’”

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.250
In other words, a wise man has fallen silent
and in order to garner his wisdom, money is

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.250
offered.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.450
The proverb is used in much the same way today.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.060
Despite More’s use, the saying didn’t
seem to gain widespread popularity until after

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.800
1547, with a book written by John Heywood.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.350
Heywood is best known as a playwright and
a collector of proverbs.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.720
Born around 1497 (records before the 17th
century are almost always spotty on these

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.350
types of dates), he began his career as a
singer in the “Chapel Royal” for Henry

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.350
VIII.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.110
His career was going along pretty well, singing,
teaching others to sing, and, occasionally,

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.110
acting.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.141
In the 1530s, he started writing “interludes,”
which were essentially what we would call

00:01:56.141 --> 00:02:00.840
sketches today – small, one-act plays which
were usually performed within bigger plays.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.840
This is how we began to gain some notoriety.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.560
It didn’t hurt that his interludes were
usually comedic in nature and poked fun at

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.330
the very powerful Church (despite his own
devout Catholic ways).

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.510
A rather interesting part of this was that
Henry VIII was also a devout Catholic, but

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.469
had been excommunicated from the Roman Catholic
Church.

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:21.709
So, Heywood gained favor with the King, but
angered clergymen with his barbs in this rather

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.430
divisive political climate.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.800
Either way, in 1546, at the height of his
popularity, he wrote a two hundred page book

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.260
entitled A dialogue conteinying the nomber
in effect of all the proverbes in the Englishe

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.419
tongue, which would later become known more
simply as The Proverbs and Epigrams of John

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:39.419
Heywood.

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:43.220
Even though the book is named after him, he
never claimed to have made any of these up.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.309
He simply collected them so that they would
be remembered.

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:51.519
As said in the preface of the book, “Rembrying
and confydering what the pyth is, that by

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.620
rememberence of these prouerbes male grow.”

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.370
Several well-known proverbs show up in this
book include “Rome was not built one day”

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.489
and “all that is well ends well.”

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.650
It also includes, “penny for your thoughts”
or as written in the book “Freend (quoth

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.629
the good man) a peny for your thought.”

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:13.489
Heywood’s political statements within his
interludes came back to bite him a bit when,

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.629
in 1547 (only a year after his book), the
ten year old son of Henry VIII, Edward, took

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:19.629
the throne.

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:23.401
With Edward being Protestant, Heywood being
Catholic and taking shots at the Church, he

00:03:23.401 --> 00:03:28.519
thought it was safer to flee to Belgium to
live out the rest of his days (which was actually

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.839
pretty long – 33 years).

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:35.400
Yes, he was essentially kicked out of England
by a ten year old.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.829
Now, how much was Thomas More or John Heywood
(or any person from 16th century English)

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:45.730
offering when he said he would give a penny
for converting the various neurological electrical

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.870
impulses happening in one’s brain into other
electrical impulses that ultimately produce

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.299
carefully crafted communicative vibrations
in the air?

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.529
Well, according to England’s National Archives
currency convertor, a penny in 1540 would

00:03:57.529 --> 00:04:01.909
be worth (accounting for inflation) about
1.6 pounds today.

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:06.869
Converting that into American dollars, that
would be about $2.50, or the price of a McDonald’s

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:07.869
Happy Meal.

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:11.099
So, if someone offers you a penny for your
thoughts, using your newfound knowledge you

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:15.459
can now attempt to extort a McDonald’s Happy
Meal out of them before you talk.

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:29.370
Although for your health’s sake, perhaps
in this case 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:44.520
it would be best just to keep your mouth shut.
