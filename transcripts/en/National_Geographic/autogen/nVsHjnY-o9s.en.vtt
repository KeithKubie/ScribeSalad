something happened

colossal blast created everything all

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860
colossal blast created everything all
 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.680

and it did all this without even making

but what's often overlooked is that the

Big Bang is not just an explosion that

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290
Big Bang is not just an explosion that
 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.930
Big Bang is not just an explosion that
happened at some moment in time at some

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150
 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.949
it was not just an explosion of material

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959
it was not just an explosion of material
 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.929
it was not just an explosion of material
into an empty universe that was sitting

into an empty universe that was sitting
 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.179
into an empty universe that was sitting
there waiting to be filled it was the

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:51.189
there waiting to be filled it was the
 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:53.940
there waiting to be filled it was the
explosion of space and time into

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950
explosion of space and time into
 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.420
explosion of space and time into
existence to begin with and that's what

existence to begin with and that's what
 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.849
existence to begin with and that's what
trips most of us up before the Big Bang

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859
trips most of us up before the Big Bang

there was nothing literally nothing and

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640
there was nothing literally nothing and
 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.949
there was nothing literally nothing and
the black void of space is something so

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959
the black void of space is something so
 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.449
the black void of space is something so
is time they asked what's before the Big

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459
is time they asked what's before the Big
 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.789
is time they asked what's before the Big
Bang what's before there is time is

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799
Bang what's before there is time is
 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.619
Bang what's before there is time is
really a meaningless question and

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:22.629
really a meaningless question and
 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:24.869
really a meaningless question and
likewise to ask where the Big Bang

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879
likewise to ask where the Big Bang
 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.699
likewise to ask where the Big Bang
occurred is meaningless because there

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709
occurred is meaningless because there
 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.310
occurred is meaningless because there
was no space
