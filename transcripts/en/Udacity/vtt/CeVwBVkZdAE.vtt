00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.240
In each lesson, you'll build a specific piece of the festival

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.290
lab. So that you can understand the use case, Samantha and

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.050
Andy are going to take you to an actual music festival, so

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.470
that you can really understand the problem you're solving in that lesson.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.368
&gt;&gt; As Andy and I guide you through building the app, I'll

00:00:15.368 --> 00:00:18.632
be teaching you and him how to actually build the app itself.

00:00:18.632 --> 00:00:20.963
&gt;&gt; And since I truly don't know anything about

00:00:20.963 --> 00:00:24.323
Salesforce I'll be playing the role of the student. Sam?

00:00:24.323 --> 00:00:25.323
&gt;&gt;

00:00:24.323 --> 00:00:24.723
[LAUGH]

00:00:24.723 --> 00:00:25.123
Yes.

00:00:25.123 --> 00:00:26.509
&gt;&gt; You are teaching me how to build the app.

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:27.510
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.250
&gt;&gt; And I'm building the app.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.676
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:28.676 --> 00:00:29.474
&gt;&gt; And, Mario?

00:00:29.474 --> 00:00:30.643
&gt;&gt; Interrupting you.

00:00:30.643 --> 00:00:32.390
&gt;&gt; You're, thanks, Mario.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.080
&gt;&gt; And I'll be interrupting the class every so often to give context about

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.590
what we're learning as well as to

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.930
explain some of the more difficult concepts. While

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.700
also asking you a lot of the questions like what was the first concert

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.320
you went to? Answering these questions is

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.840
really going to help to facilitate your learning.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.728
&gt;&gt; So what was the first concert

00:00:49.728 --> 00:00:50.568
that you went to, Mario?

00:00:50.568 --> 00:00:52.333
&gt;&gt; Boston.

00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:52.840
&gt;&gt; Boston.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.745
&gt;&gt; Green Day.

00:00:53.745 --> 00:00:55.520
&gt;&gt; Blink 182. What about you?
