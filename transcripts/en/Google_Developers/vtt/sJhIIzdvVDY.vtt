00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:03.690
MALE SPEAKER: Shanghai
GDG is a very

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.760
interesting developer community.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.600
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.760
has asked this question.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.103
MALE SPEAKER: And this is
where the magic happens.

00:00:09.103 --> 00:00:10.275
FEMALE SPEAKER: This
is primarily a

00:00:10.275 --> 00:00:10.830
question-and-answer show.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.335
So if any of you out there would
like to ask questions--

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:19.940
STEVE BAZYL: Hi, everyone.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.340
This is Stephen Bazyl here for
another "Google Developers

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.090
Live." Today we--

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.970
or me, rather, since this
is a solo endeavor--

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.299
I'm going to be taking a look
at an OS 10 app for Google

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.380
Drive called Archy.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.510
Basically what Archy is is a
full implementation of the

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.760
Drive web interface, but
done as a native

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.000
application for Macs.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.090
And I thought this would be a
good comparison since a few

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.990
weeks ago, we did an app review
of an Android client

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.700
called ASTRO, which is a file
manager for Android devices,

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.480
which did a lot of the same
functionality in terms of

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.220
implementing access to Drive as
a file system from within

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.500
their application.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.970
And it'd be a good comparison
to see how that translates

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.610
over to a full desktop
application.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.500
So the Archy application-- is
going to to take a look at

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.990
their website really quick--

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.710
it is still beta.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.730
It's very early access
right now.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.070
But as an OS 10 user myself,
I have to say it's actually

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.490
really nicely done
application.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.700
I take a little bit of issue
with their "bringing Google

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.330
Drive to the humans" claim.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.470
Google Drive is a pretty
usable product as is.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.080
But for those who do enjoy
having a desktop client, it is

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.050
something to take a look at.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.920
There are also a couple
other applications

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.580
that are very similar.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.070
One in particular that maybe
we'll do an app review of

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.790
sometime in the next few weeks,
is collections.me, and

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.430
very similar functionality in
terms of bringing Drive

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.580
contents and uni file management
to the desktop

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.850
experience.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.270
But I already did install
Archy here.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.270
And you can take a look
at the application.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.370
I have one little nit in just
the dimensions of the UI.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:10.870
It's a little narrow for me.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.730
I prefer to go a little
widescreen.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.060
But you can see here
we actually

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.480
have our Drive content.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.800
Authentication was very easy.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.700
It's using OAuth.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.490
And the first thing that happens
when you launch the

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.190
app for the first time is, it
will present a pop-up webpage

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.370
for entering your Google
credentials.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.760
I already went through that.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.200
But we can see here, it
connected to my account.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.120
And of course, we can
click on files.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.060
It will launch them in
whatever the native

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.270
application is for that type.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.450
And you can also do things
like create new files.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.770
In fact, you can even
create new Google

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.630
documents, for example.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.750
And I'll just do this.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.090
We'll just create this.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.330
And the nice thing is for the
native Google Doc formats,

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.250
when we try to open that, it's
actually going to launch this

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.750
in a web browser where I can
then go edit this file.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.690
So, a pretty nice experience for
working with native Google

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.670
Doc formats and also pretty nice
for working with a file

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.052
on your desktop.

00:03:15.052 --> 00:03:16.280
Of course, we have
the Sync client.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.060
If for whatever reason you're
not using that, and you just

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.050
want to quickly add something to
Google Drive from anywhere

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.900
in your file system,
you can just drag

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.840
something right into Archy.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.970
And it will just do an upload
into Google Drive.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:37.400
In fact, let's go over to
drive.google.com, and we

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.220
should see that content
there when that loads.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.800
There are some things that Archy
did in the UI that I

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.210
think are actually pretty cool
and a little bit different

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.430
than how we do navigation
on Google Drive itself.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.920
So one is we have some really
nice quick views here for

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.860
accessing our content.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.990
If I want to quickly find
my starred items, I can

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.690
click on the star.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.880
If I want to look at folders
I have in here, and

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:11.750
Trash and so on.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.610
And the one that's really
cool, actually, is this

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.480
Contacts view.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.880
So one of the permissions
Archy asks

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.209
for is Google Contacts.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.990
And it pulls in a lot
of information here.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.260
So you can actually see we
get a nice profile view.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.190
We can see pictures of the
people from our Contacts.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.700
And the even cooler part is, it
will actually show you how

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.615
many items you have shared
with each of these users.

00:04:35.615 --> 00:04:38.510
So we can see here I have this
Demo account on one of our

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.160
domains that have, it says,
98 shared items.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.860
I can just drill into this, and
it will show me all of the

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.700
items I have shared
with that account.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.130
So that's actually really a nice
navigation feature that

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.780
they added, which is not
something that is easily seen

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.190
in the Drive web UI,
so kind of a pretty

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.090
cool innovation there.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.490
And likewise, I can go click
on my wife, see what I have

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.840
shared with her, and so on.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.420
It's a pretty well-done
application.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.590
If you take a look at their menu
options, if you have a

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.880
lot of different things, they've
built in the Google

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.860
Drive sharing.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.560
So you can see here, I could
actually just click on the

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.070
little Share icon,
and I can just

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.270
share it my other account.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.030
And they'll manage that.

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.910
And of course, that will do the
same sharing that happens

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.860
if you were to share this
through the web UI.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.000
You can do it from here.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.495
We can get the link for that
file, change visibility--

00:05:40.495 --> 00:05:44.790
if you want to make it public,
available on a domain--

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.570
all of those are here,
changing ownership.

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.770
And pretty much anything that
you can do in the Drive UI or

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.440
through the Sync client you
can do through Archy.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.032
And they actually integrated
some contact management.

00:05:58.032 --> 00:06:02.130
A little bit of a UI issue in
that this is grayed out unless

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.860
you happen to be on
the Contact view.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:11.170
But if I want to create a new
contact for, I don't know--

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.610
Hopefully there's nobody named
Joe at exemple.com.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.710
But we can add that, and that's
going to be added into

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.890
my Contacts, synced in there.

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.370
So that same contact information
is now, of course,

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.100
in Gmail, on my phone,
wherever.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.760
So overall, it's a really nicely
integrated experience.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.400
I haven't really run into too
many issues in using it so

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.720
far, other than just a
few minor issues with

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.970
how the UI is done.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.210
You can see here, here's that
file I uploaded earlier.

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.150
And overall, it's really cool.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.300
I did mention earlier there's
one other application that, if

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.220
you are interested in a desktop
experience for Google

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.400
Drive, that might be another
interesting one to check out.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.230
And possibly we'll do an
app review of this.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:04.900
Maybe we can even do a little
bit of a head to head and see

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.070
which comes out on top.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:10.550
But Collections is also worth
investigating and trying out

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.330
if you have a chance.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.760
This one goes a little bit
beyond just Google Drive.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.770
It does Facebook and Instagram
and everything.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:22.450
But a really cool idea for
giving it that desktop view of

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.160
all your files, in the cloud,
no matter where

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.740
you're coming from.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.800
But for Archy, it's a really
solid application.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.560
I would like a little bit more
flexibility in the UI and just

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.840
to be able to change
the view--

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.650
maybe do a tile view, like we
have in the Drive web UI-- for

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.510
a little bit more
visual browsing.

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:47.690
But other than just a few minor
issues, it's a really

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:52.910
cool application for Mac
users, which I am.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:57.570
And I probably will be giving
this a try at home a little

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.310
bit more and seeing
if it sticks.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.960
So "good job" to the guys
that work on Archy.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.950
And that is it for today.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:07.780
Thank you, everyone.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.680
And we will see you next week.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:17.867
