00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.410
Jobberman.com is currently
the largest job website

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.220
in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.070
When we started Jobberman,
of course structurally when

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.300
you look at the labor
markets in Nigeria

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.680
and also the rest of
Africa, you discover

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.750
that it's a candidate
longer market.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.520
So you have a lot of
candidates with respect

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.860
to the number of jobs.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.820
So initially when
we started, there

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.490
was definitely more traction
from the job seeker side.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.960
And over time, companies
started approaching us,

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.780
because eventually where you
have the talent, definitely

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.400
the employers will gravitate
towards that platform.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.000
So it was initially more scaled
towards the job seeker side,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.590
and then gradually we started
building some traction

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.860
on the employer side.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.530
In terms of vastness,
there are a lot

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.690
of countries on the continent.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.380
But we also know that we
are very limited in terms

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.880
of our ability to be able
to execute very well.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.170
So we are definitely
very selective in terms

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.200
of the country we
try and take on.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.050
We also understand that in order
to be able to win in Africa,

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.190
we don't really have to have
a physical presence on the 53

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.440
countries.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.780
We rather prefer to be the best
and to be maybe the biggest

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.880
in terms of our placement
than to grow very thin

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.440
and be in 53 countries
in Africa without being

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.130
able to have the impact we were
trying to have at the moment.
