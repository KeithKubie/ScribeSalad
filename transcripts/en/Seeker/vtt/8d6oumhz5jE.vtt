00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.100
Hyena females may be the most powerful ladies
in the animal kingdom.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.000
Hyena societies are entirely matriarchal,
which means that adult females are the ones

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.110
in charge.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.490
The dominant females are highest on the social
scale, followed by their own cubs, then lower

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.529
ranking females and their cubs, and finally,
adult males.

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.060
And it’s impossible for these male to have
sex with a female if she’s not on board

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.789
with the action, due to the female’s unique
‘masculinized’ genitalia.

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.880
It’s impossible to tell the difference between
young hyena males and females just by looking

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.040
at them.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.180
It looks so similar that it’s actually termed
a pseudopenis.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.080
In addition, the females’ labia are fused
together, and they also hang from the body,

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.270
which looks like a scrotum.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.470
In fact, this is called - you guessed it-
a pseudoscrotum.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.810
In order for a male to have sex with a female,
she must first invert her pseudopenis into

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.300
her own body - much like turning a sock inside
out.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.980
Once her pseudopenis is tucked into her own
body, the male can then insert his penis.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.550
If she doesn’t tuck in her pseudopenis,
he’s completely out of luck.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.090
But before we get too carried away in singing
the praises of female hyenas, we must also

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.370
remember that they have to give birth through
their unique penile structures.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:30.410
Both first-time moms and their cubs have an
unusually high death rate during birth.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:36.160
Cubs can become asphyxiated very easily during
their journey down a 30 centimeter tube that

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.030
is a mere four to five centimeters in width!

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.260
As the first cub is born, it usually rips
open the females’ pseudopenis such that

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.640
future births are less traumatic (but still
highly so).

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.369
While it must feel good to be a powerful female
hyena, it isn’t always a walk in the park.

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.680
The most natural question to pose in this
situation is WHY?

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.440
Baby hyenas have strong jaws and sharp teeth.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.630
Siblicide is common especially on female cubs.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.500
Females stand to climb higher on the social
ladder without sisters around.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.650
And males, well, males would do better if
they had no sisters at all.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.290
So they’ve evolved to be physically identical
to each other so that they do not specifically

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.349
target the females in acts of siblicide.

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.150
Isn’t family great?

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.810
