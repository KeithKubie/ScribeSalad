00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:08.342
- THIS IS IT?

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:10.377
YOU FOUR THINK
YOU CAN STOP ME?

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.879
- DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.

00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:14.781
HE'LL USE HIS LIES TO TRY
TO MAKE US TURN ON EACH OTHER.

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:16.250
- THE PREACHER SAID
YOU'RE A PUSSY.

00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:17.684
- WHAT?

00:00:17.718 --> 00:00:19.586
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
- LIKE THAT.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.222
THAT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE
OF WHAT WE SHOULDN'T LET HIM DO.

00:00:22.256 --> 00:00:23.924
- [laughing]

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:27.394
- OH, LAUGH NOW, ANTICHRIST.
BECAUSE SURPRISE!

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:30.130
WE'VE ASSEMBLED
AN EXORCISM DREAM TEAM!

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:31.398
FATHER QUINN!

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:33.467
- I'M GOING TO NEED TO BE ALONE
WITH THE CHILD.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.102
YOU DON'T HAVE
A NANNY CAM, RIGHT?

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:37.004
- RABBI MALTZMAN!
- NO, NO.

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:39.406
YOU STAY IN THERE, DEMON.
AS LONG AS YOU'RE COMFORTABLE.

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:41.775
I SCHLEPPED ALL THE WAY HERE
FROM BROOKLYN.

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:43.210
BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:45.045
- AND WITCH DOCTOR KUZNIAK!

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:47.314
- LUCKY FOR US, I WENT
TO MEDICAL SCHOOL IN HAITI.

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:50.184
- AND JORGE,
WHO'S SEEN <i>THE EXORCIST</i>

00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:52.352
7 1/2 TIMES
AND LET US USE HIS CAR.

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:54.488
- I'M NOT WITH THEM!
I'M ON YOUR SIDE!

00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:56.390
- JORGE, SHUT UP.

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:58.492
- COME ON,
LET ME SELL YOU MY SOUL.

00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:00.427
I'LL SIGN WHATEVER CONTRACT
BEN AFFLECK SIGNED.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.562
WHATEVER!

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:03.664
- [sighs]
I WAS UP FOR A CHALLENGE.

00:01:03.697 --> 00:01:06.166
THIS IS GOING TO BE
FAR TOO EASY.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.935
- THE POWER OF CHRIST
COMPELS YOU!

00:01:07.968 --> 00:01:09.469
THE POWER OF CHRIST
COMPELS YOU!

00:01:09.503 --> 00:01:10.771
- SHUT UP.

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:12.606
[all exclaim]

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:16.610
SO WHO WANTS TO CHOOSE
HOW I WILL KILL THE REST OF YOU?

00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:19.613
- BLOWJOBBED TO DEATH?

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:22.783
- YOU GOT IT.
BY RABID HELL HOUNDS.

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:24.518
AND HERE WE--

00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:27.120
[crying]

00:01:27.154 --> 00:01:30.490
- I'M GOING TO WRITE KATE UPTON
A NOT-SO-NICE YELP REVIEW.

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:32.526
ETHEL, WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON HERE?

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:35.095
- WE'RE DOING AN EXORCISM
ON YOUR CRAZY-ASS DEVIL BABY!

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:38.332
- AND WE ALMOST GOT BLOWJOBS,
UNTIL YOU SHOWED UP!

00:01:38.365 --> 00:01:40.234
- CONNIE, WE'VE GOT
TO TRUST THE LORD.

00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:42.169
JUST LIKE IT SAY
IN THE BIBLE:

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:44.705
"IF THE EXORCISM
DON'T GO SO BUENO,

00:01:44.738 --> 00:01:47.307
THROW THAT GODDAMN BABY
IN A VOLCANO." HA!

00:01:47.341 --> 00:01:48.542
- WHAT? NO!

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:49.776
- SORRY, CONNIE,

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.411
BUT IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO STOP THE APOCALYPSE.

00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:53.013
- YOU'RE LUCKY
WE GOT A VOLCANO RIGHT HERE.

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:54.481
MOST PEOPLE WITH DEVIL BABIES
GOTTA PAY

00:01:54.515 --> 00:01:55.816
FOR A PLANE TICKET TO HAWAII.

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:58.218
- SCREW YOU GUYS!
COME ON, DONNIE.

00:01:58.252 --> 00:02:00.220
I'LL PROTECT YOU,
I PROMISE!
