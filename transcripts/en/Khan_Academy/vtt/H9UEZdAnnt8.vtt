00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.870
Every year this apple farmer
produces one million pounds

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:05.375
of apples.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.510
But he's got a problem.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.520
Every year the apple price
jumps around a bunch.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.690
Sometimes it sells after
the harvest for over $0.30,

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.320
and this guy makes a
ton of money per pound.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.060
And then sometimes it drops
down to $0.10 per pound,

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.860
and this guy can't
even cover his costs.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.450
And on the other
side of the equation,

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.060
you have this pie
chain right over here.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.440
So they specialize
in making apple pies.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.140
And when the price of
apples goes super high,

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.070
these guys can't
cover their costs.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.410
They start running a loss.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.230
But when the price
goes really low,

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.590
they have this kind of bonanza.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.580
But neither party here
likes this scenario.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.610
They don't like the
unpredictability

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.090
of one year having a feast and
then one year having a famine.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.790
So what they can
do is, let's say

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.520
we have the harvest coming up.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.590
The pie farmer is
kind of afraid.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.920
Well, what if the price of pies
goes back down to $0.10 per

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.600
pound?

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.100
Then he's going to go broke.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.650
The pie chain is afraid.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.120
What the price of pies
goes up to $0.30 a pound?

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.240
Then these guys are
going to go broke.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.880
So what they can do is
agree ahead of time,

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.300
regardless of what the
actual market price of pies

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.670
ends up being after
the harvest, they

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.760
could agree to transact
at a specified price.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.710
So they could set up a
little contract right here.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:36.140
So they could set up a contract
where the chain agrees to buy

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.660
one million pounds at
a specified date,--

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.960
let's just say
after the harvest--

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:50.400
at the harvest
for $0.20 a pound.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.240
This works out well for the
chain because regardless

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.190
of what the market
price ends up being,

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.020
they can ensure that they
will pay $0.20 a pound,

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.710
which is a good price where
they could make a decent profit

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.960
and at least they have the
predictability and they can

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.800
plan on things.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.850
And it works out for the farmer
because he knows that a $0.20

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.420
a pound, he can cover his costs
and pay his rent and pay his

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.740
employees and feed his family.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.920
And it also takes out
the unpredictability,

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.180
the volatility for him as well.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.580
So what we have
set up right here

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.970
is actually called
a forward contract.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.900
This is a forward contract.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.700
And what it is, as you
can see, is in agreement

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.320
and it's an obligation
for both parties

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.200
to transact in the future
at a specified price.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.797
So at the time of this harvest
when they write this contract,

00:02:42.797 --> 00:02:45.380
they would specify this date--
I don't know what it might be--

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.750
November 15.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.620
And at November
15, this farmer is

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.210
obligated to deliver
million pounds of apples.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.040
And then this pie chain is
obligated to produce the money,

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.450
to pay $0.20 a pound or
essentially produce $200,000.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.310
And that way, they
both are essentially

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.750
able to avoid the
volatility and make sure

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.809
that they can survive.
