00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.440
- [Instructor] We are asked to find

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.310
these three different limits.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:05.520
I encourage you like always,

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.260
pause this video and try to do it yourself

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.330
before we do it together.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.590
So when you do this first one,

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.990
you might just try to find the limit

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.800
as x approaches negative two of f of x

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.120
and then the limit as x
approaches negative two of g of x

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.510
and then add those two limits together.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.530
But you will quickly find a problem,

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:21.520
'cause when you find the limit

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.850
as x approaches negative two of f of x,

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.490
it looks as we are
approaching negative two

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.700
from the left, it looks
like we're approaching one.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.020
As we approach x equals
negative two from the right,

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.640
it looks like we're approaching three.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.690
So it looks like the limit

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.270
as x approaches negative
two of f of x doesn't exist,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.020
and the same thing's true of g of x.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.010
If we approach from the left,

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.610
it looks like we're approaching three.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.930
If we approach from the right,

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.790
it looks like we're approaching one.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.540
But it turns out that
this limit can still exist

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.150
as long as the limit as
x approaches negative two

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.520
from the left of the sum,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.473
f of x plus g of x,

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.420
exists and is equal to the limit

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.160
as x approaches negative two
from the right of the sum,

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.870
f of x plus g of x.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.490
So what are these things?

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.380
Well, as we approach
negative two from the left,

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.780
f of x is approaching, looks like one,

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.710
and g of x is approaching three.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.910
So it looks like we're
approaching one and three.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.170
So it looks like this is approaching.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.240
The sum is going to approach four.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.110
And if we're coming from the right,

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.600
f of x looks like it's approaching three

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.513
and g of x looks like
it is approaching one.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.750
Once again, this is equal to four.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.900
And since the left and right handed limits

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.210
are approaching the same thing,

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.100
we would say that this limit
exists and it is equal to four.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.700
Now let's do this next
example as x approaches one.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.090
Well, we'll do the exact same exercise.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.260
And once again, if you look
at the individual limits

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.020
for f of x from the left and
the right as we approach one,

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.410
this limit doesn't exist.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.470
But the limit as x approaches
one of the sum might exist,

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.820
so let's try that out.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.020
So the limit as x approaches one

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.020
from the left hand side
of f of x plus g of x,

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.053
what is that going to be equal to?

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.380
So f of x, as we approach
one from the left,

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.420
looks like this is approaching two.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.850
I'm just doing this for shorthand.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.840
And g of x, as we approach
one from the left,

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.120
it looks like it is approaching zero.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.150
So this will be approaching
two plus zero, which is two.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.750
And then the limit,

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.270
as x approaches one
from the right hand side

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.270
of f of x plus g of x
is going to be equal to.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.080
Well, for f of x as we're approaching one

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.040
from the right hand side,

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.090
looks like it's approaching negative one.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.280
And for g of x as we're approaching one

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.140
from the the right hand side,

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.770
looks like we're approaching zero again.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.880
Here it looks like we're
approaching negative one.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.900
So the left and right hand limits

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.300
aren't approaching the same value,

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.210
so this one does not exist.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.010
And then last but not least,

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.430
x approaches one of f of x times g of x.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.840
So we'll do the same drill.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.840
Limit as x approaches one
from the left hand side

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.303
of f of x times g of x.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.770
Well, here, and we can
even use the values here.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.030
We see it was approaching
one from the left.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.620
We are approaching two, so this is two.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.300
And when we're approaching
one from the left here,

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.723
we're approaching zero.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.860
We're gonna be approaching
two times zero, which is zero.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.250
And then we approach from the right.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.010
X approaches one from the right

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.770
of f of x times g of x.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.360
Well, we already saw when
we're approaching one

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.410
from the right of f of x,

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.900
we're approaching negative one.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.510
But g of x, approaching
one from the right,

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.150
is still approaching zero,

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.670
so this is going to be zero
again, so this limit exists.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.550
We get the same limit

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.600
when we approach from
the left and the right.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.160
It is equal to zero.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.100
So these are pretty interesting examples,

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.310
because sometimes when you think

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.380
that the component limits don't exist

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.450
that that means that the sum

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.010
or the product might not exist,

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.950
but this shows at least two examples

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.300
where that is not the case.
