00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.120
Nobody’s perfect, and everybody makes mistakes-
especially on the job.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.389
But when you do your work with the knowledge
that it could be scrutinized by millions of

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:16.930
people, it’s important to make sure you
can stand behind it 100%.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.180
Sometimes despite everyone’s best efforts,
tiny mistakes slip through the cracks.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.520
And once you know them, they cannot be unseen.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.480
These are Screen Rant’s 10 Disney Movie
Mistakes That Slipped Past You.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.270
The Jungle Book
The live-action 2016 remake of Disney classic

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.880
The Jungle Book is made of pure hollywood
magic- also known as CGI.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.980
The story follows Mowgli, a young boy raised
by animals in the jungle.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.731
And since we haven’t figured out how to
train real animals to speak English, computer

00:00:41.731 --> 00:00:43.660
generated ones take their place.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.480
Director Jon Favreau has stated that his focus
was always on the realism of the animals.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.320
And for the most part, he succeeds.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.010
But when the majority of audience members
found themselves wrapped up in the action,

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.620
a few began to wonder something simple: how
come the raindrops don’t splash off the

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.090
characters?

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.423
Star Wars: The Force Awakens
It is very possible that the films in the

00:01:03.423 --> 00:01:06.030
Star Wars franchise are the most scrutinized
on Earth.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.909
The space opera has an intensely loyal fanbase,
but that doesn't mean they won’t notice

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.680
the plethora of continuity errors in 2015’s
The Force Awakens.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.880
While a lot of the goofs are tiny and wardrobe-related,
there is one instance that’s hard to overlook.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.740
In the intense interrogation scene with Kylo
Ren, very visible tears roll down Rey’s

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.740
face.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.570
But when the camera changes angles, they’re
completely gone.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.780
If you missed it the first time around, we
don’t blame you- it’s a pretty powerful

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:29.979
moment in the film.

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.939
But now that you know, keep your eyes out
for it.

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.079
Finding Dory
Octopuses are super smart, they have three

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.740
hearts, and they’re one of the oldest living
species on the planet.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.350
It’s no wonder why the people behind Finding
Dory would want to include one in their movie.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.609
And while he’s technically the same species,
Hank refers to himself as a “septapus”

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:49.020
instead, because he only has seven arms.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.700
Except… that’s not really possible.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.500
Because another thing that makes octopuses
cool is their real-life ability to regenerate

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.520
lost limbs.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.679
Looks like Hank’s gonna have to find another
way to stand out from the crowd.

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:04.900
Wreck It Ralph
Computer animation is a beautiful thing, and

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.079
Disney continues to be a pioneer in the field.

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.690
In 2012, they took the opportunity to show
off a little with Wreck-It Ralph.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.450
If you’ve ever wondered what the characters
inside video games do after the arcade closes,

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.959
this is the movie for you.

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.120
Packed with cameos, the film shows Ralph interacting
with characters from a few different franchises.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.180
But when he finds out that the ones from his
own game are celebrating without him, he takes

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.480
it out on the cake.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.480
Except, there isn’t actually any cake anywhere.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.989
Sure, we see the icing go flying.

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.170
But shouldn’t there be some cake with it
too?

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.660
Cinderella
Let’s be honest, we’ve all dreamed of

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.209
having a Fairy Godmother.

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.170
The thought of a sweet old lady showing up
and fixing all the world’s problems is a

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.580
nice one, however far-fetched.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.129
Of course, the most notorious Fairy Godmother
is Cinderella’s.

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.890
After living way too long under the rule of
her heinous stepmother, Cinderella catches

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.670
herself a husband at the Royal Ball.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.210
The dresses worn by Disney princesses are
always iconic, and Cinderella’s is no exception.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.370
But if you take a closer look, you’ll notice
that the wedding dresses don't exactly match

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.370
up.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.629
Income frames it has long sleeves, but in
others it’s short with long gloves.

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.370
Given how many kids grow up using this movie
as inspiration for their future weddings,

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.739
this could be a very important detail.

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.930
Beauty and the Beast
You’ve heard the stories.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.450
No one’s slick as Gaston.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.260
No one’s quick as Gaston.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.510
And in a spitting match, nobody spits like
Gaston.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.840
Yet, despite all this, Belle from 1991’s
Beauty and the Beast does not want to marry

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.840
Gaston.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.410
He chases her around the house after his failed
proposal, but falls through the doorway and

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.410
into the mud.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.550
Both when he enters and exits the house, the
door opens to the outside.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.689
But when it cuts back to show Belle placing
his boots outside, it’s clearly opened inward.

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:43.120
Given that an entire team of people were responsible
for the animation, it’s surprising to see

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.930
this interruption to the continuity of the
scene.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.780
Tron: Legacy
A movie anchored in the world of video games

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.280
has a lot to work with, and 2010’s Tron:
Legacy has even more going for it.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.280
Being a sequel to the 1982 original, Legacy
had a built-in fanbase.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.250
With original actors returning to reprise
their roles, Daft Punk signed on to do the

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.489
music, and 21st century graphics, the film
had something for everyone… including gaming

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:09.629
historians.

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:14.020
As Flynn walks through an arcade that had
supposedly been locked up in 1989, some eagle-eyed

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.750
viewers spotted Mortal Kombat.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.709
And while that may not seem like a big deal,
it’s actually a pretty glaring oversight-

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.770
since that title wasn't released until 1992.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.400
Three years after the arcade closed.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.740
Given its intense focus on gaming, we’re
surprised this one slipped through the movie’s

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.979
cracks.

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:35.440
Inside Out
In 2015 Disney and Pixar set out to illuminate

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:43.670
the inner workings of a young girl’s mind,
and the result is amazing.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.370
Inside Out tells the story of Riley, a kid
learning to cope after her family moves to

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.370
San Francisco.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.419
Thankfully, she has some very well-intentioned
emotions to guide her along the way.

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.440
But it wouldn’t be a Disney movie if there
wasn’t some heartbreaking tension.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.990
And as two of the characters try to intervene,
they find themselves in need of a shortcut.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:05.750
After Boing Boing incorrectly interprets the
danger sign as saying “shortcut”, Joy

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:06.970
and Sadness follow him.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.570
But at a different point in the movie, Sadness
talks about having read some manuals.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.169
So, if she can read, why didn’t she say
anything about the sign?

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.060
WALL-E
In a scary vision of the future where humans

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.960
have abandoned earth, one little robot named
WALL-E works to pick up the garbage.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.050
He also falls in love with a lady robot named
EVE and, through an interesting twist of fate,

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.400
ends up in space.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.160
The whole thing is actually pretty adorable,
and even has the show tunes to match.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.660
But it’s not perfect.

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.240
One scene where WALL-E is flying through space
shows the stars twinkling in the background.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.030
While the effect adds some whimsy, it’s
not scientifically sound.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.639
Stars appear to twinkle in the night sky because
of changes in the earth’s atmosphere.

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:47.289
But if we were to look at them from space,
in the absence of any atmosphere, their light

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:52.780
would remain constant.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.569
Frozen
It’s not easy to write a song, never mind

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:56.930
writing a song fit for a Disney princess.

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.319
But for years, the company has been churning
out musical after musical and finding only

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:02.319
success.

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:06.349
Their soundtracks have always been strong
sellers, but in 2013 audiences lost their

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:08.880
collective mind with the release of Frozen.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.229
Quickly reaching the top of the charts, the
soundtrack was full of original music.

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:16.110
It was so popular that even people who hadn’t
seen the movie knew all the words to “Let

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.110
It Go”.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.740
And while the tune may be catchy, it’s not
exactly accurate.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.550
The movie is set in the 17th century, but
the song references the word “fractals”

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.160
which wasn’t utilized until 1975.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:59.280
If you think that’s a little nit-picky,
feel free to let it go.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.479
What do you think of our list?

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:02.710
