[APPLAUSE]

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.860
MARIETTE DICHRISTINA:
Thanks a million.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.360
I have been looking forward
to seeing you all week.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.575
So it's Friday, and I've
been waiting all week.

00:00:12.575 --> 00:00:13.480
So, hello.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.830
How nice to meet you.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.785
I'm Mariette, and you're
probably thinking, wow, two

00:00:17.785 --> 00:00:18.660
chiefs in your title.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.455
That's pretty cool.

00:00:20.455 --> 00:00:22.780
The Chief Judge of Google
Science Fair part of it

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.090
is by far the most fun part of
it, most awesome part of it.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.700
So I hope you will think
about the Google Science Fair,

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.990
but let me talk to you for
just a minute about the 170

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.059
years of "Scientific
American" part,

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:36.350
and "Scientific American"
was started right here in New

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.040
York, where you guys all are.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.940
And the guy who started it had
this great name, Rufus Porter,

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.630
which I loved, and
he had offices here

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.380
where scientists and inventors
would actually come to visit.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.920
So you all know
what your iTunes,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.840
or whatever you're listening
to, your music-- the first time

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.215
voice was ever heard outside
of the labs of Thomas Edison--

00:01:02.215 --> 00:01:04.340
raise your hand if you've
heard of this guy, Thomas

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.070
Edison, the
lightbulb, but he also

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.200
invented this thing that in the
time was called the phonograph.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.019
And he brought it to
"Scientific American."

00:01:12.019 --> 00:01:14.310
And you could probably imagine
the editors are probably

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.530
thinking what's this
giant box this guy has.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.530
He puts this cylinder on it, and
it plays, and it says, hello.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.230
How do you like the talking box?

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.890
That was pretty
surprising and awesome,

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.950
and he did that using science.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.500
And it took him a
long time to do it,

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.190
and he worked away
at it, and then

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.910
Thomas Edison-- a lot
of other inventors

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.060
made a lot of other things,
a lot of which we're all

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.670
using right now-- this
microphone, the phones

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.100
that you're not allowed
to tweet, and Snapchat on,

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.610
and everything else on
that we've been told about,

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.450
the building we're in, all of
this stuff-- all of this stuff

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.940
was invented, improved
through the process

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.500
that we call science,
because science is not

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.330
something you read
about in a history book

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.260
like we might read
about Thomas Edison.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.840
No.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.400
It's a way we think.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.050
It's a way we do stuff.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.990
It's a way we ask a question.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.752
How could we hear
stuff from people

00:02:08.752 --> 00:02:09.960
when they're not in the room?

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.220
Well, phonograph, later
phone, microphone.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.410
How could we cure diseases?

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.810
How could we solve
problems for people?

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.730
So science is all
about that, and it's

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.630
about a way of exploring
and discovering,

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.580
and anybody can do it.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.610
So maybe you think
that's something

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.330
that people do in
a lab, or you have

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.630
to be a genius
like Thomas Edison.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.192
Maybe you-- well, I don't know.

00:02:34.192 --> 00:02:35.400
Let me ask you this question.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.420
Raise your hand if you've
ever met a scientist.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.145
You ever met one?

00:02:40.145 --> 00:02:43.270
I see a lot of good hands,
but actually everybody

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.890
put your hand up.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.170
Everybody was born a scientist.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.880
Everybody here was
born a scientist.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.800
How do I know that?

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.480
Because I told you science is
a way of looking at the world

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.330
and thinking.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.795
Think of a baby in a high chair.

00:02:56.795 --> 00:02:58.503
Do you ever watch a
baby in a high chair?

00:02:58.503 --> 00:02:59.722
There's a meatball there.

00:02:59.722 --> 00:03:00.650
There's Cheerios.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.610
Baby goes.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.400
Watch what happens.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.224
Throw the Cheerio.

00:03:05.224 --> 00:03:05.636
Hm.

00:03:05.636 --> 00:03:06.650
Cheerio goes down different.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.983
If they have a feather, feather
falls differently still.

00:03:08.983 --> 00:03:12.430
That is a baby scientist
running an experiment,

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.650
and you all can do that.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.950
Everybody does that.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.719
Everybody does it every day.

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:21.260
You just don't think
of it like that.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.390
You just don't call it
that, but that is science.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.280
And so I encourage you--
and by the way, this thing

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.160
of science-- I told
you, inventions and so

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.200
on-- for the grown ups in the
room, between World War II

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.490
and now, about a third to
a half of all of the US's

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.020
economic growth is from
basic research that

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.390
led to inventions like the
ones we're all enjoying today.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.890
And so let me just
tell you tell you

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.270
guys who are listening
to me-- ask the question.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.960
Ask a question.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.130
Ask something you want.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.700
Apply the testing.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.390
Find out what happens, and
when you find out what happens,

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.970
you should really think about
entering the Google Science

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:57.990
Fair.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.050
So now I'd would
love to introduce you

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.369
to one of my favorite
scientists, Shree, who you've

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:04.410
heard a little bit about.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.440
And I first met in 2011 when
I was the first time Chief

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.400
Judge of the Google
Science Fair,

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.640
and I was inspired
by her questions.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.590
So Shree saw a problem.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.329
She had her-- I feel
very awful about it--

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.620
her grandfather dying of cancer.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.710
And she had a question of why do
some therapies not work anymore

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:24.380
with cancer?

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.430
And she worked on that question,
and she kept working on it,

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.250
and has done so many other
amazing things since.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.830
So I know you're all so lucky
as I am to meet her here

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.665
and to hear what she's
going to tell us all,

00:04:35.665 --> 00:04:37.123
and I can't wait
to hear it myself.

00:04:37.123 --> 00:04:38.882
So welcome, please, to Shree.

00:04:38.882 --> 00:04:42.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.520
SHREE BOSE: All
right, I am really

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.150
excited to be here today, guys.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.520
So excited.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.260
I am really excited about
doing something a little bit

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.150
different today.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.390
So instead of just
talking at you guys,

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.170
I want to make sure you
talk back at me, all right?

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.120
So be sure-- please interact.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.414
Please engage.

00:05:03.414 --> 00:05:05.580
If there's something that
doesn't make sense to you,

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.910
type in questions and ask
me whatever you want to.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.960
So I'm a scientist, which means
I'm trained to ask questions.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.010
That's how everything
I've done started.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.500
So during this talk,
I want you guys

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.490
to channel your inner
scientist, and whenever

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.650
you think of a
question, I want you

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.170
to go to this link that's gonna
appear on the screen and just

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.120
type it in so I can see it.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.530
And throughout my entire
talk, I want you guys

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.600
to keep asking those questions.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.850
So by the end, we
can answer them

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.820
and see what matters to you
guys, what you guys care about,

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.550
and we can get
some answers going.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.105
Is everyone going to do that?

00:05:51.105 --> 00:05:51.730
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:52.460
SHREE BOSE: Yeah?

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.740
OK, awesome.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.600
Well, I told you guys
I like questions.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.110
Well, I wasn't
kidding about that.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.070
So I want to answer
the types of questions

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.510
that can change the world, but
when I was that little kid,

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.000
I wasn't really
always like that.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.450
I mean, at the time, I was
really a self centered science

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:18.350
geek.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.900
Well, what does that mean?

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:25.570
Well, that meant that I
liked thinking of problems

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:26.950
that I had.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:31.180
I liked playing with science
to make my life better,

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.750
and that led to some
pretty crazy projects.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.160
I'm not going to lie to you.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.280
In third grade, I literally
did my first science project

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.580
because I didn't like
eating my vegetables.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:49.010
So a quick show of hands-- how
many of you guys like spinach?

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.780
Whoa.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.420
How many of you guys
don't like spinach?

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.170
I'm with you guys.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:54.950
I'm with you haters.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.720
So when I was in
third grade, I decided

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.420
that I wanted to make
spinach more exciting to eat,

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.490
so I was going to turn it blue.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:04.420
Sounds great, right?

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.830
Blue spinach-- that's
something you'd eat.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:11.430
So my parents, bless
their souls, went out,

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:15.230
bought me a spinach plant,
some blue food coloring,

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:16.970
and a syringe.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.440
You should not give a syringe to
a third grader for the record,

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.530
but I took this
blue food coloring,

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.870
and I proceeded to inject
it into the spinach plant,

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.470
and then I forgot about
it for two months.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.730
And I remember on the
day of this science

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:37.110
fair I pulled out this dried,
withered, gross spinach

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:40.690
plant with blotches
of blue on it,

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.780
and I took that in as my
very first science project.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.030
And I wish I could say
it got better from there,

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.530
but my next project
I literally did

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.620
because I didn't like
taking out the trash.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:58.020
In fact, I hated the idea of
rolling that giant garbage can

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.280
to the curb every
week so much that I

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.400
decided to build a remote
controlled garbage can.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.650
I mean, how lazy is that?

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:13.210
And I remember I built this
little model of a trash can,

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:15.910
and it was a tiny
little replica,

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:18.370
and on the day of the
science fair, I took it in,

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:21.040
and the science fair
was held in our gym.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.580
And I remember I just spent the
day piloting this little trash

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.690
can around other
people's projects

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.511
instead of actually
presenting it.

00:08:29.511 --> 00:08:31.080
And these were fun times.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.669
They were fun projects.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:33.840
Everyone was laughing.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.350
It was a lot of fun, but
I wasn't really asking

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:42.270
the types of questions that
could change the world.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:47.310
In fact, I really didn't ask the
important scientific questions

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:50.640
until I turned 15
years old, and then I

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.220
became-- I went
from this kid who

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.590
was doing silly science
projects to a kid who

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.240
wanted to cure cancer.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.480
When I was 15, my
grandfather passed away.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:07.340
My grandfather was one of
the most organized people

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.240
I've ever met.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.430
He was the kind of person who
would save hundreds of horribly

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:16.060
taken pictures from
family road trips that

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:19.200
were blurry and awful, and he
would label them and keep them

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.260
in photo albums for years.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.990
And he had these
file cabinets that

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:26.915
were just full of
chronologically ordered

00:09:26.915 --> 00:09:31.580
"National Geographic" magazines
that were 30 years old,

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:37.000
but that wasn't the man I saw
towards the end of his life.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.340
My grandfather had
become bedridden.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.890
He was dependent.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:47.110
He wasn't the same grandfather
I had grown up with,

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:48.680
and that was hard.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.590
That was really hard to
see, and he wasn't alone

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:52.940
in that experience.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.460
I mean, a lot of people
all over the world

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.720
are affected by cancer--
maybe some of you

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.620
guys, maybe some of
your family members.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:05.320
I mean, by the numbers,
there are millions,

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.910
but usually it just
takes one to really want

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:10.620
to make a difference.

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:14.600
And for me, my
grandfather was my one,

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.510
and I knew I had
to do something.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:23.330
So what do you do when you have
a lot of big questions and very

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.080
few answers?

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.950
Well, I did what any 15-year-old
would do, and I googled it.

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:33.790
I started reading everything
I could get my hands on.

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:36.300
I read scientific articles.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.520
I read blog posts
from cancer patients

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.690
who were going
through chemotherapy.

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:45.160
I even read some
pretty nutty conspiracy

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:49.780
theories about cancer,
and I remember I learned.

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:50.930
I learned a lot.

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:54.550
I was learning every
day, and I would

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:56.796
go to-- I would learn
outside of class,

00:10:56.796 --> 00:10:58.420
and then I would go
into the classroom,

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.910
and we would see these diagrams
of how cancer supposedly

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:03.090
happened.

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:06.090
And I remember one
day sitting in class,

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:09.820
seeing this diagram
of this piece of DNA,

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.730
and there was a tiny
lightning bolt hitting it.

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:15.540
And my teacher said,
that's how cancer happens.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.290
It's just genes getting damaged.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:19.010
That's it.

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:21.540
And I remember staring
at that, staring

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.430
at that tiny little
lightning bolt,

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:28.740
and thinking this
is just not enough.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.510
And so all of the
reading I was doing,

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:32.980
all of the information
that I had gathered,

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:34.870
all of the questions
I was asking

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:37.350
that I was getting
answers to, all of it

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:39.720
was building to
something bigger.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:44.210
At some point, I realized the
questions that I was asking

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:48.150
were actually listed as
questions on the research goal

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.760
pages for professors,
and universities,

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.290
and graduate labs.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:57.540
The same questions I was
asking as a 15-year-old

00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:01.040
were questions that the
entire scientific community

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:05.490
was asking, and
that was incredible.

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:10.800
That was the stepping stone,
and I realized at that point

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:16.000
that I couldn't have the sort of
impact I wanted to make alone.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.510
I had to find help.

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:21.990
So in a similar way to how
you would find a restaurant

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:25.510
to eat at tonight by searching
a few keywords on Google,

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:27.420
I found professors.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:32.420
I started emailing hundreds
of professors at local labs

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:37.630
and universities, and I
started off all of my emails

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:42.330
with the first line saying,
hi, my name is Shree Bose.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:47.370
I'm 15 years old, and I
want to do cancer research.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:48.710
Sounds insane, right?

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:50.720
Well, all of the
professors I e-mailed

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:57.000
must have thought so, because
I got rejected by all of them.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.150
I mean, it got to a point
where the rejections almost

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:01.680
didn't faze me anymore.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.920
It was almost like
my knee jerk reaction

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.420
to one rejection
would, OK, we're

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:08.730
on to the next professor,
the next opportunity,

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:11.120
the next chance.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.360
I was on a mission,
and I wasn't going

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.580
to stop until I found
somebody to take me on.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.650
So, fully expecting
another rejection,

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:23.430
I e-mailed Dr. Alakananda
Basu, a professor

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:26.730
at the University of North
Texas Health Science Center.

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:30.270
Same e-mail, and
for the first time,

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:34.430
I got a response that
wasn't, oh, you're too young,

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:38.810
or, oh, please don't
contact me again.

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:42.790
It was come into my
lab, and we can chat.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:45.980
We can see why you're
excited about this,

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:48.280
what makes you tick.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:51.820
And so I remember on
this beautiful spring

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:55.820
day in Fort Worth, Texas
I made my mom drive me

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.950
to a graduate lab.

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:01.910
And I remember I was sitting
in this graduate lab.

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:03.530
There were researchers
next to me.

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:06.860
They're pouring buffers and
doing cool looking stuff,

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.260
and that was before
I knew the science.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:13.010
And I remember
sitting there shaking.

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:17.060
I was physically shaking,
because all I wanted to do

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:21.060
was to work in this lab,
and I was so scared.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.430
And I remember at the time
the e-mail I was writing

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:25.150
to all of these
professors actually

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:29.180
had an idea for a project that
I kind of thought might work,

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:31.210
and it was a cool idea.

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:34.070
And Dr. Basu walks
into this lab,

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:37.300
and one of the first things
out of her mouth is, you know,

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:41.960
I read your proposal, and
it didn't make any sense.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.830
It would never work.

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:46.885
And I remember all of
my muscles tensed up.

00:14:46.885 --> 00:14:48.990
I was like, oh god, here
comes the rejection.

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:50.740
Here we go.

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:52.740
And then she went
on, and she said,

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.440
but I like the way you
thought through it.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.140
I liked where you were going.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:01.270
I liked the way you questioned
this entire problem,

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:05.790
and so if you want, you can come
work in my lab for the summer,

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:06.662
and that was it.

00:15:06.662 --> 00:15:08.490
That was where it all started.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:13.380
After these months of absolutely
making a fool of myself

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:17.420
and just writing nonsensical
ideas to these professors who

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:21.080
knew so much more
than me, it was really

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:27.310
that that gave me the chance
to do something amazing.

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:29.560
So don't be afraid
to ask for help.

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.860
Don't be afraid to reach out
when you realize that you can't

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:35.730
have the sort of
impact you want alone,

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:39.100
because it's one of the most
powerful things you can do.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.130
For me, I started
working in this lab

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:43.970
as a freshman in high school.

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:46.240
I had just finished freshman
year of high school.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.640
I was working in this lab.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:52.000
I was assigned this project
on drug resistance in breast

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.870
cancer, so basically
understanding

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:59.270
why some cells stop
responding to a drug.

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:05.550
And for the first summer, I
remember I just bumbled around.

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:07.640
I broke glassware.

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:12.430
I dropped experimental results
that took days to redo.

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:16.130
I annoyed literally
everybody in this lab

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:19.530
all the time asking
the dumbest questions,

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:22.640
and I remember along
the way I learned.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:26.420
I learned a lot of really,
really, really cool things,

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.760
and I remember as I was
learning I kind of fell

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.840
in love with research.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.040
It was incredible.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.290
I felt like it was
just so powerful to be

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:39.370
able to think through a
problem and go from beginning

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:43.880
to end and have an experimental
result that could tell you

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:47.880
something about a cancer
patient who might be suffering

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.900
from breast cancer or a
patient who's being told

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.940
that the breast
cancer has come back,

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:56.900
and that was incredibly
powerful to me.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.430
Also, I never looked
like that in the lab.

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:01.646
That's a very intense picture.

00:17:01.646 --> 00:17:03.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:08.490
But I remember at the time
I was so excited about what

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:12.329
I was working on, and I wanted
to share it with everybody

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:14.560
who would listen to me.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:18.640
And I remember at the end of
the summer we had this project.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.380
I had finished this
complete project.

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.750
It was on drug
resistance, breast cancer,

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:26.710
and I was ready to enter
in to another science fair.

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:29.200
And I mean, this is a science
fair I've been competing in

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.770
since I was a little
kid, and this project

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:34.790
is better than blue spinach and
remote controlled garbage cans,

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:36.250
right?

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:39.150
And I remember I went
to the science fair.

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:43.240
I presented my project,
and at the awards ceremony,

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.420
I won nothing.

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:49.130
I remember I walked out of this
room, and I was empty handed.

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:50.780
I was sad.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:55.130
I had a feeling like I never
wanted to do research again.

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:59.180
I mean, I had fallen in love
with biology and medicine,

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.570
and I thought it was
the coolest thing ever.

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:05.950
And it turned out I
kind of sucked at it,

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:08.040
and that was dark.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.060
That was a crushing,
crushing sort of feeling,

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:14.550
and I remember at
the time I decided

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:16.500
I would turn my attention
away from research.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.550
I would stop doing that.

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:21.490
I was going to focus
on poetry and moping.

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:23.410
Those were going to
be my two things.

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:24.162
That was it.

00:18:24.162 --> 00:18:25.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.430
And I kept it up for
quite a few months.

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:33.190
I remember I felt just so
downtrodden by everything that

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:35.670
had happened, but
after three months,

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:38.220
I was still sitting
in biology class

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:43.980
and still what I was learning
still was not enough.

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:48.330
And I remember the reason I had
joined a lab in the first place

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.300
was because I wanted
to make a difference.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:52.340
I wanted to understand.

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.370
I wanted to know how
this disease that

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:58.910
had killed my grandfather
worked and how

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:01.180
we could make it
better for everybody

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:03.220
else who was suffering.

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:05.570
And so I went back
the next year.

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:09.390
I remember I was given
the choice-- I was given

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:13.010
the choice to either work on
this project on breast cancer,

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:17.826
or I could come up with a new
project on ovarian cancer,

00:19:17.826 --> 00:19:20.232
and I just jumped
at that opportunity.

00:19:20.232 --> 00:19:20.940
I was like, that.

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:22.140
I'll do that.

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:25.070
And so over the course
of the next summer,

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:29.560
I actually developed this really
cool project on drug resistance

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:32.530
in ovarian cancer
along with my mentor.

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:36.120
And so basically what that meant
is we wanted to understand why

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:40.850
some cells died when we gave
them a chemotherapy drug

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:43.580
and why some cells didn't.

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:46.750
And so that basically
would correlate--

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:49.880
that would mean that we
could understand better

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.650
why some patients
stopped responding

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:55.540
to some medicines--
really big stuff.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.300
And we discovered a really
cool thing-- basically

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.750
that this one energy
protein that's

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:04.310
involved in how
cells process energy

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:08.770
is actually really important
in how that switch happens.

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:13.070
And so I remember at the time
I did this really cool project.

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:14.950
I really wanted to
share it with the world,

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:18.170
but it was science fairs,
and I was kind of scared.

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:23.600
And one day, I got a call from
my dad, and my dad said, hey,

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.580
have you been on the home
page of Google today?

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.970
There's something right
under the search bar

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:31.160
that I think you would
be interested in.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.640
So I said, no, and
then I went online.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.400
And right under
the search bar it

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:42.250
said, introducing the first
ever Google Global Science Fair.

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:45.750
And I thought, you know, I
wouldn't have done any of this

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:50.010
without Google, and I want to
share what I have figured out

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:51.530
with the world.

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:55.160
So all of my work, all of my
passion, all of my excitement--

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.350
I put that all into this
really cool website,

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:01.680
and I sent off the link,
and a few months later, I

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:05.120
found out that I was
going to Mountain View.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:09.250
So I was one of 15
global finalists, which

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:11.470
meant that, when I
went to California,

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:16.880
I was with 14 other kids
who also were doing projects

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.270
that could change the world.

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:22.090
And I mean, I
remember at one point

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:25.250
we had to have these public
booths where you brought

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:28.240
stuff and showed it off to
the public who would come in

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.217
and want to know
about your project.

00:21:30.217 --> 00:21:31.800
And they told us to
bring in something

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.680
that was either
representative of us

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.310
or representative
of our project.

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:39.420
And I worked with cancer,
so you can't really

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:41.360
bring in cancer cells.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:45.100
So I decided, since
I'm from Texas,

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:50.790
I would bring in a cowboy boot
and a statue of a cowboy, which

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:52.520
is a great idea if
you think about it.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:53.560
It's great.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:54.510
Only problem--

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:55.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:55.910 --> 00:22:00.340
Only problem was that
at some point in transit

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:03.380
the cowboy's head came off.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:08.280
So on my table, I had a
headless cowboy statue,

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:13.020
and the kid next to me had a
fully functional robotic LEGO

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.162
arm.

00:22:14.162 --> 00:22:16.370
And at that point, I was
like, all right, we're done.

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:17.800
We're done here.

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.100
We're not winning.

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:20.570
OK, it's fine.

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:25.040
And so I remember just knowing
that made me so much calmer.

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:29.200
So when I went in to talk
to the judges, I was honest.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.490
Mariette was one
of my judges, and I

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:33.790
remember I was brutally honest.

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:37.600
There were points I would
talk about messing up in lab,

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:40.230
and getting rejected,
and why I was

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:44.550
so excited to be able to
work on a project like this.

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:48.080
And when I won the Google
Science Fair in 2011,

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.070
it didn't feel like
I was winning just

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:51.710
because of the work.

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:56.880
It felt really like it was
an award for my passion,

00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.400
for how determined I
was, for how excited I

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.640
was to be able to work on this
thing that had affected me

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.230
so closely.

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:09.840
It felt like it was really
an award for all of the kids

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.590
who have ever been
told that they're

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:15.950
too young to do something or
that-- or kids who have told

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:20.250
themselves that they can't
do something because of age,

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:24.120
or gender, or opportunity.

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:27.480
It was an honor to win
the Google Science Fair,

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:30.720
and after that, I got to
do a lot of really, really

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:36.880
cool things, including getting
to meet President Obama twice,

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.910
and there was just
something about seeing

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:42.250
such a powerful person who was
so passionate about getting

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:46.300
kids excited about science, and
technology, and engineering,

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.920
and math that just
made me excited to be

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.520
able to share my mentorship
with the entire world.

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.210
And over the past
few years, I have

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:57.830
gotten to do a lot of
really exciting things.

00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:02.390
I mean, I've made some of
my best friends at Harvard.

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:06.150
I started a company to
help kids get started

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:08.270
with building
technology and learning

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:11.020
about engineering hardware.

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:14.180
I was one of "Glamour"
magazine's top 10 college

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:16.610
women, where they put
a lot of makeup on you

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:18.790
and make you look a lot better.

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:20.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:23.480
I've gotten to do research
at Harvard Medical School,

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:27.510
and I'm going on to start
my career in medicine

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:31.680
and research, and it's been
a really, really exciting

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:35.950
journey, but you know, I
never thought of myself

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:42.480
as an inventor, or a
scientist, or an entrepreneur.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.850
Honestly, I just
asked the questions

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:48.970
that mattered the most
to me, whether that

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:54.770
was how to turn spinach
blue or how to cure cancer.

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:58.780
And so today I want you
to do something with me.

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:03.060
I want you to think about the
problems that matter to you.

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:05.700
The world is this
giant beautiful place,

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:09.969
and there's so much left
to explore and discover.

00:25:09.969 --> 00:25:11.510
So let's think about
it for a second.

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:14.720
What are those questions
that matter to you?

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:18.240
And now I want you to go
do something with that,

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:21.480
because that's where
everything I have done so far

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:24.400
has begun-- with a question.

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.630
And that's where I want your
stories and your journeys

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:29.640
to begin, as well.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:34.280
So today I want you to
find your questions,

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:38.800
make your opportunities,
and create your own answers,

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.090
because together
I know we can do

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:46.670
incredible things in this world
if we only begin to ask, how?

00:25:49.436 --> 00:25:50.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.180
Thank you, guys.

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:03.400
So you guys did a really great
job with asking questions,

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.660
so I'm going to go
to these questions.

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.502
Oh, we've got a lot.

00:26:07.502 --> 00:26:08.960
MARIETTE DICHRISTINA:
Yeah, you do.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.340
SHREE BOSE: Yes.

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:14.830
Let's go with the top
voted one from Leila,

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:17.610
who asks, making the
world better sounds hard.

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:19.300
How do I even start?

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.160
And I love this question,
because it's not something

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.430
you really think about.

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:25.850
You don't start off
by saying, well,

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:27.110
I want to change the world.

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:30.440
You start off by saying this
is something that bothers me,

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.870
and I want to figure
it out, and then

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:35.900
you find out that this thing
that bothered you actually

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:39.540
bothers a lot of people
that's how it all starts.

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:42.490
So you asked, how
do you even start?

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:43.660
Good question.

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:46.540
I want all of us
to take one second

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.420
and think about a
problem that you've

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:51.786
run into today-- just today.

00:26:51.786 --> 00:26:53.160
Maybe it's not
even your problem.

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.320
Maybe it's a problem that
your parents ran into,

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.530
or a friend, or somebody
else, but let's think

00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:00.580
of that problem.

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:03.520
Got it?

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:08.470
Now I want you to think
about how you would solve it.

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:12.040
Is there an easy way to do that?

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:13.350
We'll start with that.

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:15.340
That's how you start
changing the world.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:17.490
That's how everything
begins-- is really

00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:20.900
finding a problem
that impacts you

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:23.970
and then trying to come up
with solutions that can matter

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:27.420
to everyone, but that's
a really great question,

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:30.680
and thank you, Leila.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:34.700
So, second question
is, what was it

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:36.720
like to meet President Obama?

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.600
Oh, I was so starstruck.

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:41.590
I remember this.

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:42.750
I was so starstruck.

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:46.090
They had us in this little
waiting area outside the Oval

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:48.910
Office at the very beginning,
and the Oval Office

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:50.590
has a lot of hidden doors.

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:54.380
So there's no really
blatant doors anywhere,

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:55.840
and so I remember
I was standing.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.920
I was facing somebody
else talking,

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.380
and there was a wall behind
me, and I turned around,

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:02.300
and all of a sudden
the wall was gone.

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:05.560
It was a door, and President
Obama is standing there,

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:08.020
and he goes in
for the handshake.

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.440
And I'm so panicked
at that point

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.880
that I just bear hugged him.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.742
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:14.742 --> 00:28:18.100
So it was amazing to
meet President Obama,

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:23.330
but absolutely honestly it
was incredible to really see

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:25.950
somebody who is in such
a high position who

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:29.670
very evidently cared so much
about getting kids started

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:30.790
in science.

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:33.130
That's a really
powerful thing, and I

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:36.820
think it sets a tone for how we
approach STEM in this country,

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:39.530
and that's incredible, and
that's something all of us

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:42.890
will benefit from.

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:45.790
Thank you, Steven, for
that wonderful question

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:49.700
where I got to share
my bear hug with Obama.

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:51.490
Our next question is from Dre.

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:53.800
How can we bridge
the gap with the lack

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.450
of women of color in
science and STEM--

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:59.710
so science, technology,
engineering, and math--

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:02.230
and that is a really,
really good question

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:06.300
because that's something I'm
especially passionate about.

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.320
I mean, I grew-- I
was really lucky.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.490
I grew up in a household
where it didn't really

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:13.610
feel like I couldn't
do something.

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:15.410
That really wasn't a big thing.

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:17.190
So when I wanted
to start research,

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:20.750
it didn't feel like there were
any barriers to making that

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:25.750
happen, and so actually when
I was first starting this tech

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:29.690
company with my co-founder,
who happens to be a man,

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:31.930
we ended up going to
this tech conference.

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:36.010
And our boxes actually look
like they're made out of wood,

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:39.360
so they look kind of
just like regular boxes

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.860
that you might carry
snacks around in.

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:46.480
And this tech conference was
full-- it mostly-- 80% men.

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.470
And I remember we
were walking around,

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:50.750
and I was holding
the box, and I got

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:56.820
asked three times if there
were cookies in the box.

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:59.210
And after the third time,
I was like, this is weird.

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:00.340
This is definitely weird.

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:02.860
So I handed it off
to my co-founder,

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:05.240
and for the next hour,
he carried it around.

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.090
The questions he got were,
what cool piece of tech

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:08.946
is in that box?

00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:15.870
It's really hard to say that
these gender divides don't

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:17.950
still exist, and they do.

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:20.540
And I think one of the
most powerful things we

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:24.030
can do to bridge that gap
that you're talking about here

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:26.020
is actually better mentoring.

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:28.150
I think that's
the key to letting

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:31.820
amazing thoughts and amazing
people come to the forefront

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:35.300
and giving them the chance to
really do what they want to do.

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.310
My entire journey
started with mentoring,

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:40.810
and I think it's a
very powerful thing.

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:41.710
So thank you, Dre.

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:53.080
My next question is
from Steve, who asks,

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:56.360
how did you figure out how to
get started with your cancer

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.380
research?

00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:59.630
And this is an awesome
question, because honestly I

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:02.640
didn't have a plotted
out way to do things.

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:05.870
I started reading and
reading everything

00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:10.040
I possibly could, and then just
proposing nonsensical ideas

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.000
to people who knew
a lot more than me,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.406
but I would say the
first step to my journey

00:31:15.406 --> 00:31:17.030
on getting started
with cancer research

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:18.760
was by finding a mentor.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:21.000
And so for a lot of you
students out in the audience,

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.400
and even actually for
parents and Googlers,

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.314
I think one of the most
powerful things you

00:31:25.314 --> 00:31:27.730
can do when you want to change
something or make something

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:31.560
better is to find the
people who can help you

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:34.600
and to not be afraid to
reach out to those people,

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.890
make a fool of yourself
if you have to,

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:40.470
but eventually that's
what makes the difference.

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:41.620
That is it.

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:44.757
Going out and doing something
is the very first step,

00:31:44.757 --> 00:31:46.590
whether that's reading
and then figuring out

00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:50.290
that you need to find mentors
or just reaching out and talking

00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:52.719
to people who might
be able to help you.

00:31:52.719 --> 00:31:53.760
So really great question.

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:54.526
Thank you, Steve.

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:06.700
So my next question
is from anonymous,

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:08.950
who asks, any tips
for anyone who

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:11.900
wants to apply for the
Google Science Fair?

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:14.460
This is a really good question
because the Google Science

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:16.337
Fair is about to open.

00:32:16.337 --> 00:32:16.920
Show of hands.

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.820
How many of you guys
are going to apply now?

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:19.640
There we go.

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:20.540
There we go.

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:21.920
Woo!

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:26.450
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:29.030
So my tips for the
Google Science Fair

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:33.260
would be to get your
projects in early.

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:36.400
So make your
websites before it's

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:42.190
due in a, week which is what I
did, but seriously actually go

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:42.690
online.

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:45.140
Start making your sites
as soon as possible.

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:48.710
If you have yet to do a
project, start finding mentors,

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:50.650
ask questions that
matter to you,

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:52.770
and really follow
the templates that

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:54.450
are given for the
Google Science Fair

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:56.590
on how to think through
those questions,

00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:59.990
because they're really a good
starting point if you don't

00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:02.730
know how to go about things yet.

00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:07.100
So those are probably one of the
best tips I can give, actually.

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:16.420
So my next question--
as you guys are voting,

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:18.710
it actually pops to the top.

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:23.670
So I get to see in real time
what you guys care about,

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:27.870
and that's an incredible thing.

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:31.470
So the next-- I
love this question.

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:34.790
What's the next question you'd
like to answer with science?

00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:37.770
So I think I've done a
lot of really cool things

00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:40.360
over the past few years,
from starting the company,

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:43.470
to doing research, to
getting to talk to kids

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:49.000
and figure out how to mentor
and how to really create

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.750
networks that matter.

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:52.570
And so the next
question I'm really

00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:55.320
excited to answer with
science is actually

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:57.970
about my initial
passion for cancer,

00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:03.630
for understanding how
cancer cells process energy

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:06.370
in different ways
than normal cells

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:08.320
and whether we can
figure out a better

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:11.260
way to target cancer
cells by understanding

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:12.560
those differences.

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:18.300
So that's sort of the next
big question I'm going for.

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:23.650
And I think I have time
for one last question,

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:25.840
and let me find it.

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:26.400
Let's see.

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:27.630
MARIETTE DICHRISTINA: You can
do a couple more, if you'd like.

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:28.219
SHREE BOSE: A couple more?

00:34:28.219 --> 00:34:28.514
Oh, sweet.

00:34:28.514 --> 00:34:29.560
MARIETTE DICHRISTINA: Should
we hear a couple more answers?

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:30.100
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:31.433
SHREE BOSE: Couple more answers?

00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:36.280
I love this question.

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:39.130
What was your most
inspiring learning memory

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:41.409
in school and outside of school?

00:34:41.409 --> 00:34:42.860
So this is from Jonathan.

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:45.139
Thank you, Jonathan.

00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:50.159
I think in school one of my
most inspiring learning moments

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:53.920
was actually with
my biology teacher.

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:56.020
At one point, when I
wasn't understanding

00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:58.590
what was happening in class, I
went in, and I talked to her,

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:01.490
and I said, you know,
this doesn't make sense.

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:03.010
And she was one of
the first people

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:05.510
who said, if this
doesn't make sense,

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:08.140
try to find some
higher level things.

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:11.410
And I remember at the time
the things I was reading

00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:12.770
didn't really make sense.

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:16.560
The scientific articles
were full of jargon.

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:21.360
So I went from having to
Google every other word,

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.690
and as I read more, I would
have to Google every fifth word.

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:26.900
And that was
progress, but that was

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:28.360
one of my most
inspiring moments--

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:31.230
was this teacher
really telling me,

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:34.830
you know, learn outside
of just this classroom.

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:38.540
Learn as much as you possibly
can and use all of the tools

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:44.280
you have to figure out what
information you want to get.

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:48.370
Outside of school, actually,
is one of my earliest memories

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:52.160
with science that
actually solidified why

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.810
I was excited about science.

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:56.510
I grew up with an older brother.

00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:59.450
He's two years older
than me, super cool.

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:01.390
And when we were
little, I remember

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:05.300
he would come home
every day, and since I

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:08.780
was younger and the only
person he could boss around,

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:12.040
he would make me sit down, and
he would explain everything

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:14.030
he learned in science class.

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:16.930
And I remember he had
this spark in his eye,

00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:20.810
and there was just something
magical about being taught

00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:25.480
by somebody who is so obviously
excited about what he is saying

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:29.430
that just I remember
looking at him and thinking,

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:31.090
I want to be that excited.

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:34.170
I want to be that excited
about atoms, and molecules,

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:36.640
and cells, and things that
I didn't even understand,

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:41.480
but let us break apart the world
and put it back together again.

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.130
And so I think that
was one of my most

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:46.190
inspiring just general
memories in life--

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:48.840
has been the influence
of my older brother

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:52.230
and having him teach
me, and still teach me

00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:54.919
throughout my entire life.

00:36:54.919 --> 00:36:55.793
A few more questions.

00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:04.465
So let me go up.

00:37:04.465 --> 00:37:07.000
I really like this question
because it's actually

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.773
very relevant to all of the
students in the audience.

00:37:09.773 --> 00:37:12.380
So [INAUDIBLE], thank you.

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:16.310
How did you balance school
work with being a scientist?

00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:17.330
And that's hard.

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:20.920
You know, I did a lot of these
projects during my summers.

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:23.757
My friends were out
having a good time,

00:37:23.757 --> 00:37:25.590
and we would meet up,
and they would tell me

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:28.630
about this cool amusement
park they went to

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:30.131
or the time they
went out to coffee.

00:37:30.131 --> 00:37:32.505
And I'd be like, do you want
to hear about breast cancer,

00:37:32.505 --> 00:37:33.090
though?

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:33.826
I think you do.

00:37:33.826 --> 00:37:34.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:39.030
And then I would proceed to
explain my project, but I mean,

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:40.520
it's a level of balance.

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:45.030
It really is, and when I was
working as a college student

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:48.140
I did research while doing
classes at the same time,

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:50.480
and it ends up being
a juggling act,

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:54.730
but I will say what
made that possible

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:59.340
is the fact that I loved every
single thing that I was doing.

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:01.600
So when I was doing
research and when

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:04.120
I was doing class work
really late at night,

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:07.270
it wasn't because I
had to be doing it.

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:09.710
It was because I
wanted to be, and I

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:14.170
think if you can find the things
that you love that balance

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:17.360
becomes so much easier,
but it is a balancing act,

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:19.530
and it really requires
a level of organization

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:23.410
that I think you will definitely
develop when you find what you

00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:24.886
love and you're working on it.

00:38:28.471 --> 00:38:29.346
A few more questions.

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:39.260
This is from anonymous.

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:43.880
What was the most enjoyable
part of your research?

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:46.530
Oddly, I've told you
so many experiences

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:49.060
of messing up in lab.

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:52.070
I told you about breaking
things, and messing up results,

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:54.620
and asking questions
that made no sense,

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:58.500
but I think that my most
enjoyable part of research

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:03.180
was actually getting results
that made sense I mean,

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:06.540
I remember there was a moment
in lab where I actually

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:12.160
got this film-- the result
came out as this film,

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:14.330
and it just had blobs on it.

00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:16.500
And for anybody else
looking at this result,

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:17.700
it would make no sense.

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:21.260
It just looks like
blobs on this film.

00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:23.610
And I remember I
was standing in lab.

00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:26.370
I was looking at it, and one
blob was bigger than the other,

00:39:26.370 --> 00:39:28.250
and that meant something.

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:30.840
That meant something for
why the cancer cells weren't

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:34.550
responding, and I was
holding these results,

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:37.310
and I was thinking
of patients who

00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:40.640
would be impacted by the
results that I was getting.

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:43.590
And just that feeling of
being able to think through

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:47.870
from beginning to end and
get something that mattered

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:51.840
was one of the most powerful
feelings I have ever had.

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:54.380
And that's been my most
enjoyable part of research,

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:56.790
and it continues to
be, even many years

00:39:56.790 --> 00:40:00.170
later when I've been doing
research for many more years.

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:02.130
So if you ever start
research, I hope you--

00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:03.950
or research or
anything really, I

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:06.585
hope you hold on to
that sort of passion

00:40:06.585 --> 00:40:08.953
and that sort of
excitement for what you do.

00:40:13.159 --> 00:40:14.450
MARIETTE DICHRISTINA: Last one.

00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:15.533
SHREE BOSE: Last question?

00:40:15.533 --> 00:40:18.860
OK, let me pick a good one.

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:20.300
So many.

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:21.384
You guys did a good job.

00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:29.340
This is an important
question, and thank you

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:32.040
to C Sutton for asking it.

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:34.510
Did your friends
ever make fun of you

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:36.980
and call you a nerd for
being so into science?

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:37.920
So hands up.

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:41.840
How many of you guys is
that a concern for you?

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:42.340
Yeah.

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:42.965
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:42.965 --> 00:40:44.010
SHREE BOSE: Yeah.

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:48.030
It definitely is, and
I think that's why

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:49.880
things like the
Google Science Fair

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:52.380
are so important,
because they make it

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:56.030
into this platform
that's awesome.

00:40:56.030 --> 00:41:00.390
You come back as a rock star,
and that's an incredible thing,

00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:04.240
but I mean, yes, you
might get called a nerd.

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:06.280
You might be called a geek.

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:09.160
You might get called a lot
of names along the way,

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:15.030
and what you always have to
remember when that happens,

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:18.460
when that ever
happens, is that you

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:21.570
are doing things that matter.

00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:24.600
What you are doing is
something you love,

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:29.900
and the questions you are asking
will be the sorts of things

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:31.640
that you solve,
and the solutions

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:33.720
will matter to the world.

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:37.870
And in 10, 20 years-- I know
the whole it-gets-better thing

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:42.320
is cliched, but I want you
to remember that that love

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.570
and that passion that
takes you into science

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:49.910
is stronger than any name
you will ever be called.

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:52.330
And as long as you
always remember that,

00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:55.740
and as long as you have
people in your life,

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:58.790
including me, who are willing
to look at you and say,

00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:03.460
what you are doing is amazing
and the scientists that you are

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:06.000
is incredible, I
think you're never

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.560
going to find yourself wanting
to go away from science,

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:12.020
because it's truly an amazing
thing to be a part of.

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:14.800
And it's truly the way
you can change the world.

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:17.130
So I think that was
my last question.

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:18.752
MARIETTE DICHRISTINA: Awesome.

00:42:18.752 --> 00:42:22.384
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:22.384 --> 00:42:24.092
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank
you so much, Shree.

00:42:24.092 --> 00:42:25.330
That was so goo.

00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:27.110
Everyone, can we
please give a big round

00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:28.700
of applause for Shree.

00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:30.250
[APPLAUSE]
