00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.050
Stupid air, floating around all invisible
like it’s better than me.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.050
Get out of here!

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.050
What do I even need you for?

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.050
Oh, right, the breathing.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.049
Forgot about breathing.

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:19.570
Hello there, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.439
Have you ever wondered why we breathe?

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.920
I mean, you’re doing it all the time (hopefully),
but why do you have to?

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.929
Well as I’m sure you’re aware, you need
that rich, tasty oxygen or else after a couple

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.220
minutes you suffer from a severe case of dead.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.860
It’s because that oxygen is a vital cog
in the organic machine that is you, or more

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.070
specifically your cells.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.040
Cells need to release chemical energy to do
work and keep functioning.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.780
They need to somehow remove waste, copy DNA,
and move motors.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.820
They get this energy through a process called
Cellular Respiration, and all living cells

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.820
do it.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.120
There are multiple methods of Cellular Respiration
but humans, along with

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.010
other animals and plants, have a special organelle
in most of their cells that supercharges energy

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.710
production called the Mitochondrion.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.739
Mitochondria make a frankly ludicrous amount
of stored chemical energy for your cells but

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.100
there’s a catch: they need oxygen to do
it.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.080
When they have it, cells can get complicated
and specialized and allow for complex life

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.080
like us!

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.360
Fun fact: in humans and most creatures, the
DNA to make mitochondria (mtDNA) is passed

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.940
down unchanged from your mother, so next mother’s
day you can tell her she gives you all the

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.830
energy you need to live.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.780
And I mean that literally, because when the
mitochondria don’t work but cells have become

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.450
dependent on that energy, well… it’s bad.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.500
Cells just can’t do the work to keep functioning
and in our case, this is a less than ideal

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.290
situation for your brain.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.800
Neurons need a lot of energy to send electrical
signals and keep you humming along.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.750
They send these pulses by swapping charged
ions of sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) across

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.750
their membrane.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.640
The problem is, potassium ions naturally move
outside the membrane, while sodium wants to

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.810
be inside because that’s where each is less
concentrated.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.000
So to load up the neuron again and send another
signal, the cells need to force the ions back

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.760
to where they started with a pump.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.850
The ion pump also keeps calcium ion (Ca2+)
concentrations from getting too high.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.780
If your brain has its oxygen supply cut off,
it starts a sort of resonance cascade; the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.200
neuron’s ion pumps quickly exhaust the energy
supply, the mitochondria can’t use oxygen

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.479
to make more, the pumps shut down, and your
neurons experience Anoxic Depolarization.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.040
Pretty quickly your neurons short circuit
as the calcium causes Excitotoxicity, where

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.459
the overactivation of receptors causes permanent
damage or cell death.

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.560
So you avoid this by breathing in oxygen,
and after your body has used it to keep you

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.010
happy and healthy, you breathe out CO2.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.560
We could wrap up the episode here but there’s
one small note I’d like to cover.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.150
You might remember I said plants have mitochondria
too, but you were taught plants breathe CO2

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.310
and exhale oxygen.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.730
Both are actually true; plants use Carbon
Dioxide and sunlight to create stored energy

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.560
in the form of glucose, and then immediately
break down that glucose using oxygen and cellular

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.150
respiration to get energy to grow and function.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.709
They’re so good at making glucose and oxygen
that they vastly overproduce it for when it’s

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.680
dark but their mitochondria are still chugging
along.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.469
They’ve basically found the infinite energy
cheat, and thanks to them we have the oxygen

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:02.230
we need to function, and, if you go far enough
down the food chain, they’re the source

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.370
of all the glucose we use in cellular respiration
too.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.220
Double whammy, nice one, autotrophs!

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.120
You don’t drool, you rule!

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.790
Air is more complicated than just Oxygen or
CO2.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.639
Trace explains exactly what air is and where
we think it came from in this video.

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:17.639
Check the description if you’re on your
mobile.

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:18.639
If you’d like to know the more complicated
details of cellular respiration, I actually

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.650
wrote an episode on it already and it’s
really complex and technical but it has some

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.109
dumb jokes and South Park references I’m
very fond of.

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.889

see it and I’ll see you next time on DNews!
