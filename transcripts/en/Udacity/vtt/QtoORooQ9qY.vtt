The whole tenant of utility computing is that, resources are

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.520
being shared by several potential clients. And we've gotta

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.670
have a mechanism for billing them, so it's extremely important that we have

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.330
good ways of measuring the usage of every one of these resources.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.310
Whether the CPU, memory, storage, or network. And virtualized

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.357
environments have mechanisms for recording both the time

00:00:31.357 --> 00:00:36.404
and the space usage of the resources that it possesses, so

00:00:36.404 --> 00:00:41.329
that it can accurately bill the users of the resources.
