00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:03.170
MY GUEST TONIGHT, UNITED STATES
SNARKTS REPRESENTING THE GREAT

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:04.271
STATE OF KENTUCKY!

00:00:04.271 --> 00:00:06.340
HIS NEW BOOK, MOVING BEYOND
PARTISAN POLITICS TO UNITE

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.075
AMERICA.

00:00:08.075 --> 00:00:09.376
THAT'S LIKELY

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:10.477
(LAUGHTER)

00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:12.779
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE
PROGRAM, SENATOR RAND PAUL!

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:16.583
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:23.490
HAVE SOME WATER, I KNOW YOU MUST
BE TIRED.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.293
WHAT WAS THAT, 11 HOURS OF
FILIBUSTERING.

00:00:26.293 --> 00:00:28.662
YOU GOTTA BE EXHAUSTED.

00:00:28.662 --> 00:00:29.696
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:30.964
CAN YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM?

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:33.667
DO YOU GET 30 SECONDS, CAN YOU
GO?

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:35.535
&gt;&gt; NO, YOU HAVE TO STAND THE
WHOLE TIME.

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:37.971
YOU CANNOT SIT DOWN OR LEAVE THE
FLOOR.

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:39.673
&gt;&gt; Jon: CAN YOU HAVE A
SUBSTITUTE COME IN FOR JUST

00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:40.974
A MINUTE?

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:42.209
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:45.812
NOW, THERE  A STORY OF STROM
THURMAN ONCE UPON A TIME GOING

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:48.482
TO THE CLOAK ROOM DOOR AND
RELIEVING HIMSELF INTO A WASTE

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:51.351
BUCKET.

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:54.021
&gt;&gt; Jon: THERE ARE A LOT OF
STORIES ABOUT STROM THURMAN.

00:00:54.021 --> 00:00:56.823
THAT MIGHT BE THE NICEST ONE.

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:59.559
&gt;&gt; BUT THE THING IS THAT WAS
BEFORE TV -- AND I DIDN'T WANT

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.298
TO IMPRESS THEM, YOU KNOW, WITH
THE EOMITION THING.

00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:05.799
&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH, I GET THAT.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.234
RESPECT.

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:14.408
THIS IDEA, BY THE WAY, YOU KNOW,
YOUR PARTY IS KNOWN FOR WANTING 

00:01:14.408 --> 00:01:19.246
TO DEFEND THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA
FROM GOVERNMENT OVERREACH, 

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:21.648
TO PROTECT LIBERTY, I BELIEVE
THEY CALL IT, THEY HAVE SIGNS --

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:23.717
(LAUGHTER)

00:01:23.717 --> 00:01:25.452
-- "DON'T TREAD ON ME" FLAGS.

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:28.522
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO GOVERNMENT
SURVEILLANCE, WHEN IS COMES TO

00:01:28.522 --> 00:01:33.927
THE SECURITY STATE, THEY SEEM
VERY WILLING TO ALLOW THE

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:36.663
GOVERNMENT, WITH WHAT APPEARS TO
BE VERY LITTLE OVERSIGHT, TO GET

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:38.498
WHATEVER THEY WANT.

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:40.334
&gt;&gt; YOU DIDN'T SEE THE OTHER SIGN
THEY HAVE?

00:01:40.334 --> 00:01:42.903
WE DON'T LIKE BIG GOVERNMENT
UNTIL WE DO LIKE BIG GOVERNMENT.

00:01:42.903 --> 00:01:44.438
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT, BUT THAT'S MY
POINT.

00:01:44.438 --> 00:01:47.941
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THERE IS AN
INCONSISTENCY THERE AND I THINK

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.710
THAT'S WHAT SEPARATES SOME OF US
WHO ARE MORE FROM THE 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.245
LIBERTARIAN WING OF THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY.

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:55.248
WE DON'T LIKE BIG GOVERNMENT
ANYWHERE.

00:01:55.248 --> 00:01:58.318
&gt;&gt; Jon: NOW, IS THAT -- WHEN
YOU TALKING LIKE THAT, IS THAT

00:01:58.318 --> 00:02:01.121
WHY LINDSEY GRAHAM ROLLS HIS
EYES, OR WERE YOU WEARING 

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:02.956
WHITE BEFORE MEMORIAL DAY?

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:04.691
(LAUGHTER)

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:06.893
WHAT WAS IT THAT CAUSED HIM --
AND WAS IN UNCOMFORTABLE --

00:02:06.893 --> 00:02:07.995
DID THEY TAUNT YOU ABOUT
THAT?

00:02:07.995 --> 00:02:10.530
DO THEY THINK, RAND, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.732
WHAT, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:02:11.732 --> 00:02:14.301
&gt;&gt; IT WAS MOSTLY, I THINK,
PEOPLE ARE UNHAPPY ABOUT 

00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:16.103
DEBATING THE BILL OF RIGHTS WHEN
THEY COULD HAVE BEEN ON 

00:02:16.103 --> 00:02:19.506
MEMORIAL WEEKEND, AND I THINK
IT SHOULD BE THE OPPOSITE.

00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:21.408
&gt;&gt; Jon:  IN TERMS OF
GOVERNEMTN SURVEILLANCE, LET'S

00:02:21.408 --> 00:02:24.011
LOOK AT WHERE THE MAJORITY ARE
AT -- 

00:02:24.011 --> 00:02:25.912
THERE HAVE BEEN MORE SCHOOL
SHOOTINGS, WOULDN'T YOU AGREE,

00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:28.548
THAN TERRORISM IN AMERICA OVER
THE LAST 15 YEARS.

00:02:28.548 --> 00:02:31.018
&gt;&gt; IT'S VERY EMOTIONAL, THOUGH,
I DON'T WANT TO DISCOUNT

00:02:31.018 --> 00:02:32.185
TERRORISM.

00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:35.655
&gt;&gt; Jon: WE'RE NOT DISCOUNTING IT
BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:36.957
REALISTICALLY.

00:02:36.957 --> 00:02:40.160
&gt;&gt; THAT'S THE THING, RIGHT NOW
THEY'RE USING SCARE TACTICS

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.361
AGAINST ME.

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:44.831
THEY WANT ME TO BACK DOWN
BECAUSE IF  ANYTHING HAPPENS, IF

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:47.000
ANYONE DIES FOR ANY REASON IN
THE WHOLE WORLD, I'M NOW

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.035
RESPONSIBLE FOR IT.

00:02:48.035 --> 00:02:51.571
14 PEOPLE DIED LAST NIGHT FROM
MURDER IN BALTIMORE.

00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:53.974
IS THE POLICE CHIEF RESPONSIBLE
FOR THAT?

00:02:53.974 --> 00:02:56.076
MAYBE THE PEOPLE WHO DO THE
KILLING ARE RESPONSIBLE AND THE

00:02:56.076 --> 00:02:59.913
REST OF US NEED TO PROTECT
SECURITY BUT ALSO NEED TO

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:01.181
REALIZE WHAT WE'RE FIGHTING
AGAINST.

00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:03.483
IF WE'RE FIGHTING THIS WAR
AGAINST TERRORISM WE'RE FIGHTING

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:04.684
TO DEFEND OUR FREEDOMS.

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:08.488
IF WE GIVE UP WHO WE ARE IN THE
ROCESS, I'M WORRIED WILL THE

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:09.623
BATTLE HAVE BEEN WORTH IT.

00:03:09.623 --> 00:03:13.427
THE PROBLEM NOW IS WE ARE IN A
WAR THEY SAY IS PERPETUAL.

00:03:13.427 --> 00:03:16.663
THEY SAY THE BATTLEGROUND IS
EVERYWHERE AND IT WILL GO ON

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:18.732
FOREVER, THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

00:03:18.732 --> 00:03:21.034
AND SO WHEN ARE WE GETTING OUR
FREEDOMS BACK.

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:24.871
BUT I KNOW YOUNG MEN WHO HAVE
LOST TWO LEGS, YOU KNOW, LOST

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:28.508
THREE LIMBS, AND I ASK THEM WHAT
THEY FOUGHT FOR AND THEY SAID

00:03:28.508 --> 00:03:33.113
THEY WERE FIGHTING FOR  BILL OF
RIGHTS, SO I THINK IT'S A

00:03:33.113 --> 00:03:35.315
DISSERVICE TO THEIR MEMORY FOR
ME TO SAY, OH, WELL, I'M GOING

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:37.851
TO JUST ROLL MY EYES AND THE
BILL OF RIGHTS IS OUT THE WINDOW

00:03:37.851 --> 00:03:42.255
BECAUSE I'M NOT WILLING TO STAY
HERE ON THE WEEKEND AND FIGHT

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:44.324
FOR SOMETHING OUR FOUNDING
FATHERS THOUGHT WAS

00:03:44.324 --> 00:03:45.926
PRETTY IMPORTANT -- IMPORTANT TO
PUT INTO THE FOURTH AMENDMENT.

00:03:45.926 --> 00:03:47.561
&gt;&gt; Jon: I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T
FRAME THAT IN AN INFLAMMATORY

00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:49.563
WAY.

00:03:49.563 --> 00:03:54.000
(LAUGHTER)

00:03:55.502 --> 00:03:58.171
I'M THE KIND OF GUY WHO DOESN'T
MIND WORKING A WEEKEND IF IT

00:03:58.171 --> 00:04:00.440
MEANS OUR SOLDIERS DIDN'T DIE
IN VAIN.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.042
(APPLAUSE)
96
00:04:02,042 --&gt; 00:00:00,000
I GUESS LINDSEY GRAHAM'S A
DIFFERENT KIND OF GUY.
