00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's look at the position and the velocity of the weight that forms the end of a standard pendulum

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that swings and eventually stop swinging.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
What happens to a given area in the phase space of that system?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Does it remain constant, does it shrinks to half the original size, does it shrink to zero,

00:00:21.000 --> 09:59:59.000
does it grow to infinity, or does it grow to twice the original size.
