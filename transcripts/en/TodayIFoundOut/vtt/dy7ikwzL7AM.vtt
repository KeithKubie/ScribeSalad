00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:13.669
Even the most ardent fans of Christmas will
agree – the song “The Twelve Days of Christmas”

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:17.630
does not make a whole lot of sense.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.170
What is a partridge doing in a pear tree?

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.400
Partridges are ground-nesting birds!

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.720
So where did perhaps the most earworm inducing
Christmas song in history come from, and why

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.400
are there twelve days in it, instead of just
one?

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.820
To begin with, while most people today only
celebrate one day of Christmas, the holiday

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.930
actually is supposed to encompass twelve days
for many religious groups.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.000
While the exact days differ depending on the
sect of Christianity, for most, the holiday

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.310
begins on December 25th (Jesus’s birth)
and ends on January 6th, which is known as

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.470
the “Epiphany.”

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.260
In between there are three feasts to celebrate
the birth of Jesus and the “Incarnation,”

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.500
as in the embodiment of God in human flesh.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.080
Hence, the “12 days” of Christmas part
of the song.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.100
Now to the origin of the song itself: For
this, we’re going to start by dispelling

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.540
the amazingly popular myth that is touted
by many an otherwise reputable source, despite

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.930
a complete lack of evidence supporting the
notion.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.210
To wit, many believe The 12 Days of Christmas
is a Catholic catechism- as in it was written

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.140
to help teach Christian values and a better
understanding of religious tenants.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.530
As to why the lyrics are coded, the hypothesis
goes that it was written at a time when Catholics

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.210
were legally barred from practicing many aspects
of their religion in Britain and Ireland via

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.370
Penal Laws.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.270
So, each seemingly bizarre gift in the song
is supposed to be a code for a particular

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.340
symbol in the Catholic faith.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.271
While sources differ slightly on what exactly
the symbols mean, it’s usually stated that

00:01:40.271 --> 00:01:44.340
the “true love” is either God or Jesus
Christ; the partridge in the pear tree is

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.670
Jesus (however, there are discrepancies on
the interpretations of the particular action

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.850
Jesus is supposed to be doing nestled in the
pear tree); the two turtle doves are the old

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.749
and new testaments; the French hens are the
theological virtues, faith, hope and charity;

00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:02.229
the four calling birds are the four gospels
of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John (or representing

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.580
the individuals themselves); the five golden
rings are the first five books of the Old

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.610
Testament; the six geese are the six days
of creation; the seven swans are the seven

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.890
sacraments of the Holy Spirit; the milking
maids are the eight blessings in the sermon

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.580
on the Mount of Olives; nine ladies are the
Holy Spirit’s nine fruits; ten “Lords

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.420
a-leaping” are actually the Ten Commandments;
eleven pipers piping are the eleven apostles;

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.510
and, finally, twelve drummers drumming are
the twelve points of belief in the Apostles’

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.510
Creed…

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.459
Much like the idea that the candy cane was
invented to symbolize Jesus, his purity, and

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.270
his blood shed on the cross being complete
fiction (see: The Truth About the Origin of

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.780
the Candy Cane), the 12 Days of Christmas
lyrics don’t appear to have any such religious

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.140
symbolism, though of course there’s nothing
wrong with creating such symbolism around

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.560
existing traditions.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.560
But the subject of this article is the actual
origin of the song, so you’ll forgive us

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.190
if we have to dispel the widely touted symbolic
origin story.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.250
As for that, the idea that the 12 Days of
Christmas was a vehicle to secretly teach

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.989
Christian tenets seems to have been first
proposed in 1979 by Hugh D. McKellar in a

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.660
piece titled, “How to Decode the Twelve
Days of Christmas.”

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.430
Much more famously, a few years later Father
Hal Stockert came up with his own version

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.690
of the same idea.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.560
When he later repeated this in an article
published online in 1995, the notion spread

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.300
like wildfire.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.480
As for how he claims he uncovered the “truth”
about The 12 Days of Christmas, Fr.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.970
Stockert responded to the naysayers, stating,

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.069
Over the years since this was written, in
about 1982, and first put out for the online

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.980
world to enjoy, I have been deluged every
year with hundreds of “you can’t prove

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:38.980
this!”

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:39.980
kinds of letters.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.300
Obviously, I cannot prove *anything* to anyone
who doesn’t care to believe.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.409
However, for those who ARE interested in the
provenance of the data, and to save myself

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:51.290
the burden of having my inbox filled with
notes asking for evidence to beat debunkers

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.791
over the head with, I will simply add this
and leave it to the reader to accept it or

00:03:55.791 --> 00:03:57.980
reject it as he or she may choose.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.209
I found this information while I was researching
for an entirely unrelated project which required

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.920
me to go to the Latin texts of the sources
pertinent to my research.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.280
Among those primary documents there were letters
from Irish priests, mostly Jesuits, writing

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.879
back to the motherhouse at Douai-Rheims, in
France, mentioning this purely as an aside,

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.299
and not at all as part of the main content
of the letters.

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.009
In those days, even though there are those
who will deny this, too, it was a sufficient

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:29.030
crime between 1538 and nearly 1700 just to
BE a Jesuit in England to find oneself hanged,

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.749
drawn and quartered if he fell into the hands
of the authorities…

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:35.490
Whether you believe it or not is irrelevant
to me.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.210
You can enjoy it or not, as you choose.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.919
I hadn’t written it as a doctoral thesis,
simply as some delicious tidbit I thought

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.949
the world would be delighted to share over
a holiday season.

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:48.419
It seems, however, that there is more than
one grinch, and I am not at all interested

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.659
in feeding the others who remain past the
one in the Christmas cartoons.

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:53.659
Believe if you will.

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:54.659
Dissent if you choose.

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:56.830
Let the rest enjoy the story.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:02.110
When asked to produce said primary documents
to back up his assertions, he stated, “I

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.669
wish I could give them…, but all of my notes
were ruined when our church had a plumbing

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:07.919
leak and the basement flooded…”

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.699
The good father would later recant slightly,
noting on an update to his original 1995 webpage

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:13.699
on the subject,

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:14.699
P.S.

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:18.279
It has come to our attention that this tale
is made up of both fact and fiction.

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:20.780
Hopefully it will be accepted in the spirit
it was written.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.610
As an encouragement to people to keep their
faith alive, when it is easy, and when any

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.389
outward expressions of their faith could mean
their life…

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:31.830
And, indeed, it turns out, despite extensive
research done on the origins of this song

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.309
to find such a connection, there has never
been any documented evidence whatsoever linking

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:37.619
it to such religious symbolism.

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:42.469
Beyond the lack of evidence, this hypothesis
strains credibility on a number of points.

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:47.050
First, nothing in any of that stated symbolism
would have been anything the Catholics couldn’t

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.979
have sung or talked about directly under the
aforementioned Penal Laws, as the stated symbolism

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:56.009
doesn’t touch on anything uniquely Catholic-
it’s all stuff the Church of England and

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:59.650
most other Christian denominations have as
part of their core doctrine.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.740
So members of those churches would have been
more than happy to sing a song about such

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.149
things directly.

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:08.750
Others try to get around this point by purporting
that it wasn’t a song for Catholics, but

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.089
written for all Christians who couldn’t
practice their faith openly.

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:17.479
However, the song is literally titled the
The 12 Days of Christmas and contains mention

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:21.800
of Christmas in the lyrics as a core element
of the song going back to the earliest known

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.039
version…

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:27.889
Perhaps not the best choice if one wanted
to avoid letting on your celebration and lyrics

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:29.939
have some connection to Christianity.

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:33.800
And, of course, finding somewhere in the Western
world around the time the song was written

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:39.720
where all sects of Christianity were harshly
banned is something of an effort in futility.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.770
Next up- the lyrics and order of items varied
considerably not just over time but at any

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:45.899
given time.

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:50.149
The most common version most are familiar
with today was put together by composer Frederic

00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:51.949
Austin in 1909.

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:56.199
These many variations right from the start
not only results in some of the symbolism

00:06:56.199 --> 00:07:00.319
breaking down, but also further illustrates
said symbolism is a modern invention based

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:02.680
on the relatively modern version of the song.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.550
For instance, the “four calling birds”
is supposed to symbolize Matthew, Mark, Luke,

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.349
and John in some way.

00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:12.330
This sort of makes sense, until you learn
that the original lyrics were not “calling

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.650
birds” but “collie birds,” which was
just another way to say “blackbirds.”

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:21.199
Other early versions included such things
as “11 bulls a-beating” and “12 bells-a-ringing.”

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:25.469
The “five golden rings” are also not thought
to originally refer to actual rings, but,

00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:30.369
in keeping with the theme of bird gift giving,
probably refer to the necks of ring-necked

00:07:30.369 --> 00:07:31.369
pheasants.

00:07:31.369 --> 00:07:35.020
(If you haven’t picked up on it yet, the
song is essentially just a silly song about

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:39.119
feasting on birds and milk for several days
and then dancing about for fun.)

00:07:39.119 --> 00:07:43.479
On top of that, connections between the lyrics
and the supposed symbols they represent are

00:07:43.479 --> 00:07:48.090
absurdly tenuous in most cases, meaning if
this song was really meant to teach children

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:53.259
Catholic precepts, as is so often stated,
they must have had a lot of confused kids

00:07:53.259 --> 00:07:56.389
on their hands, requiring a lot of explaining
to get the message across, with little hope

00:07:56.389 --> 00:07:57.389
said urchins remember what was said the next
year when it was time to sing the song again.

00:07:57.389 --> 00:07:58.389
In that sense, the song would much better
serve to teach the children how to count to

00:07:58.389 --> 00:07:59.389
twelve than teach religious canon.

00:07:59.389 --> 00:08:01.280
So what does the actual hard documented evidence
say about where the song The 12 Days of Christmas

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.280
came from?

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.209
There are three known French carols that are
exceptionally similar to the Twelve Days of

00:08:05.209 --> 00:08:09.439
Christmas and pre-date it by a good margin,
with versions possibly going all the way back

00:08:09.439 --> 00:08:12.349
to the 8th century, but this isn’t fully
clear.

00:08:12.349 --> 00:08:16.520
Notably, these songs also include giving a
partridge as the first gift given, though

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.220
instead of being in a pear tree describes
a “merry little partridge.”

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:24.239
As to how this is thought to connect to the
English version’s nonsensical giving of

00:08:24.239 --> 00:08:29.020
a partridge in a pear tree, the Old French
for partridge is “pertriz.”

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.719
As for the first known published version of
the English version of the song that has survived

00:08:32.719 --> 00:08:39.019
through today, this came about in a 1780 children’s
book called Mirth Without Mischief under the

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:42.620
title “The Twelve Days of Christmas sung
at King Pepin’s Ball.”

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:47.050
In the book, the song does not have any religious
connotation outside of mention of Christmas,

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:51.780
but is explicitly stated to be a song to be
used in a children’s memory-forfeit game.

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:55.610
Essentially, if a child stumbled over a verse,
they were more or less “out,” with the

00:08:55.610 --> 00:09:00.509
song not only being difficult due to the number
of items one must keep track of, but, as professor

00:09:00.509 --> 00:09:04.009
of classics Edward Phinney, notes, “It’s…
full of tongue-twisters.”

00:09:04.009 --> 00:09:08.170
While there are various ways in which these
sorts of memory-forfeit games could be played,

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:12.190
Phinney also notes that in such children’s
games, the singers would often split into

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.350
sides of boys and girls with each trading
verses.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:18.720
When someone got out, they had to kiss someone
on the opposite side or were otherwise made

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.100
to pay a trifle penalty.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:25.141
Illustrating this usage, Thomas Hughes notes
in his 1862 work, The Ashen Faggot: A Tale

00:09:25.141 --> 00:09:26.141
for Christmas,

00:09:26.141 --> 00:09:29.810
When all the raisins had been extracted and
eaten . . . a cry for forfeits arose.

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:33.879
So the party sat down round Mabel on benches
brought out from under the table, and Mabel

00:09:33.879 --> 00:09:37.829
began, ‘The first day of Christmas my true
love sent to me a partridge and a pear tree

00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:39.170
. . . And so on.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:43.920
Each day was taken up and repeated all round;
and for every breakdown (except by little

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:48.389
Maggie, who struggled with desperately earnest
round eyes to follow the rest correctly, but

00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:52.740
with very comical results) the player who
made the slip was duly noted down by Mabel

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.180
for a forfeit.’

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.790
Fast-forward to today and there are literally
hundreds of modern versions of “12 Days

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:03.910
of Christmas”- some more Muppet-y than others-
to go along with the countless variations

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.600
sung historically.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.959
While the original versions weren’t meant
to have religious symbolism embedded in them,

00:10:09.959 --> 00:10:13.819
they were at least meant to be fun; so no
matter if you are partial to Donny Osmond

00:10:13.819 --> 00:10:17.810
or you really love the Rugrats remix, perhaps
we can all agree that we should definitely

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:41.740
re-establish the practice of giving a kiss
when you forget a lyric 

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.009
of the song.
