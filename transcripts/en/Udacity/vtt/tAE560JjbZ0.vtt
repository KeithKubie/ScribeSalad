00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.576
We know from our identity properties that we want to use a log of the same base

00:00:03.576 --> 00:00:09.848
as we see for this exponent here. A log of base e is the natural log. Taking

00:00:09.848 --> 00:00:15.710
the natural log of both sides gives us ln of e to the x equals ln of 46. Now,

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.396
conveniently, ln is the button on the calculator. So let's plug this in and see

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:27.780
what number we get. Any natural log of 46. And here is our long number.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.285
Remember, even this decimal is rounded. But we're only going to look at the

00:00:31.285 --> 00:00:36.154
first three decimal places. You know, the left hand side of our equation is

00:00:36.154 --> 00:00:41.660
just going to equal x and that decimal we got rounds to 3.829. This should

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.165
really be an approximately equal to sign. Awesome. We solved a more complicated

00:00:46.165 --> 00:00:48.124
exponential equation.
