00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Oh

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.060
Dating may seem impossible at times especially if you're not used to putting yourself out there

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.390
It's scary when you have to worry about putting your heart on the line

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.809
Not only that but it's a lot of hard work and time investment

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.480
You've discovered that even though you're actively dating you're still on the search for a meaningful connection with someone

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.229
Here are five ways to find true love if you're an introvert and hate dating

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.709
One go to events and places that reflect your favorite hobbies and interests

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.050
Forget hitting the bar or club to meet people if that's not where you feel like you can be your natural self

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:49.329
Meeting new people that you can potentially get to know over time requires a certain sense of self confidence

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.620
By going to events and places that Harbor your hobbies and interests

00:00:53.629 --> 00:01:01.088
It'll be easier for you to strike up conversations based on similarities alleviating some of the stress introverts face when it comes to small talk

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.649
To be prepared to go through trial-and-error

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.609
Love is in a fairy tale and while you may hate the superficial

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.340
Aspects of dating you certainly can't go through it without getting your heart broken a few times or breaking someone else's

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.349
There's always a lesson to be learned in the world of dating for instance you might be used to

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.840
Internalizing your thoughts and feelings as an introvert

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.439
But while dating you'll learn to get better at communicating with your partner and even though that might be difficult at times it isn't impossible

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.210
3 have honest conversations

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.629
Don't be afraid to show who you are right from the beginning as

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.860
An introvert you value authenticity and depth anyway if you want to skip out on trying to impress others be honest

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.250
Have the difficult

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.340
Conversations ask them if they know where the both of you are headed see if the two of you actually have chemistry

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.280
but also

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.260
Communicate that you're willing to make things work

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:00.519
If you're serious about dating you shouldn't have to worry about waiting for a certain amount of time to pass before responding back to text

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.670
Messages or coming off as desperate or clingy to like someone is to still choose to be with them even on their worst days

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.890
Four: only make time for people you're really interested in don't date someone because they seem impressive on paper

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.899
Or if there's someone your parents and friends will approve of ask yourself what you really want in a partner

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.690
And only make time to meet up with people who you truly believe you are compatible with at the end of the day

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.680
You're the one dating that person not anyone else as an introvert

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.889
You most likely don't like creating conflict and rejecting those

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.419
You don't think you can have a relationship with it'll help you be one step closer to finding the right match

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.690
Additionally don't settle just because you're afraid to be alone

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.830
Five keep an open mind

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.100
This includes dating extroverts who operate in a different way who's to say dating someone who's your opposite

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.949
Can't work out? the key word is compromise as long as you and your partner respect each other's boundaries

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:04.660
There's no real reason as to why things can't work out even if misunderstandings may arise from time to time that's normal in any relationship
