So we just asked you what your favorite application

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.170
is. So, Isabelle, let me ask you. What is yours?

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.210
&gt;&gt; My favorite application would have to be Google Now.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.040
&gt;&gt; That's a good choice because I just so, it just so happens I have a

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.250
screen shot of it right here. So what do you like about it? What is it?

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.840
&gt;&gt; Well, I really love Google Now. It's basically an application that

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.880
combines all these different data sources or signals about me and kind of

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.430
anticipates the information that I might need. First of all, the visual

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.500
design is really amazing. I think they really got that right. If you

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.630
look at the agency meeting card they just took a lot of information, and put

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.140
it in a nice, glanceable way. And it's just really clean and easy to see.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.580
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.020
&gt;&gt; I really like the engineering aspect of

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.620
this. So they took so many data sources and

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.590
put them into one card. And they, and

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.660
the information is really accurate. Another thing that I

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.040
really like is the interaction design. Really in

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.960
two ways when I first started using Google Now

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.270
I didn't have to fill out a lot of

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.910
forms or tell a ton of information about myself

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.330
to get it set up, it just started kind of learning

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.720
from the way I used it. And also the calls to

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.970
action or, or the contentional actions off the cars are really

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.470
awesome. There's just a few of them and they're really useful.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.966
&gt;&gt; That's awesome, so how would this have gone wrong for you? Like, for

00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.773
example, in the user interface or engineering

00:01:07.773 --> 00:01:09.590
interaction, can, can you give me examples.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.790
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.210
&gt;&gt; of what happens if you get UI wrong, for example?

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.410
&gt;&gt; If you were to get the UI

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.840
wrong, the cards would no longer be glanceable. Basically,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.830
you have to stop and really study and read them. They

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.370
would no longer be easy to glance at and get information from.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.890
&gt;&gt; Oh, so if I'm on the go, which is the whole

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.400
point of this app, that would pretty much make it useless for me.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. So what if they got the engineering wrong?

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.970
&gt;&gt; If they got the engineering wrong, basically it would kind of erode your

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.630
trust in the application. Like if it told me that my flight was at a

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.660
certain time tomorrow, it really wasn't then, or if that wasn't even my terminal

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.400
or gate number. You would kind of never

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.560
trust the app, and probably stop using it.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.030
&gt;&gt; That's true.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.780
Or if it gave you walking directions to work, that would be really awful.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.790
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that'd be a very long walk. What about this

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.560
interaction design thing you talked about? What if they got that wrong?

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.780
&gt;&gt; I think it's really crucial how the setup

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.100
of Google Now works. It just starts presenting cards

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.030
based on your usage, and asking you whether or

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.310
not that's useful information for you. So if it had

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.260
asked me to fill out, you know, ten pages

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.970
of forms, like, like when you're going to a new

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.770
doctor's appointment and tell it everything about me I

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.760
would have never set it up in the first place.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.610
&gt;&gt; That's true. So it sounds like design is everyone's responsibility.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:10.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.490
&gt;&gt; And if everyone does their

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.970
job, in UI engineering, interaction assignments, and

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.890
so on, then the user ends up having an awesome experience with their app.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:17.800
&gt;&gt; Yup.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.130
&gt;&gt; So let me ask you this again. Like, whose responsibility is design?
