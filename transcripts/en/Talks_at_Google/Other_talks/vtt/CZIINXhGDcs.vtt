&gt;&gt; Male Presenter: Welcome everybody on behalf
of Authors@Google to another Authors@Google

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:07.880
talk.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:16.090
Today's guest David Graeber, his new book
DEBT: The First 5,000 Years of it.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.650
Please welcome David Graeber.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.650
[applause]

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.370
&gt;&gt;David Graeber: Thank you, thanks so much
for having me here.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:30.250
I guess I wanted to talk a little bit about
how I came to write the book.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:39.212
It's an odd book, in a way, because it starts
from trying to grapple with kind of a moral

00:00:39.212 --> 00:00:41.039
and political problem.

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:47.600
Just what is this hold that the idea of debt
has over people's imaginations, that morality

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.410
itself comes to be thought of as a matter
of paying one's debts?

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.109
I guess I was first really confronted with
it, started to conceive the notion of writing

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:06.300
this book when I was, for some reason or another,
I was at a garden party at Westminster Abbey

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.710
and won't go into how I got there, but it
was a curious experience.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.200
The priest was a very nice man named Father
Graeme was sort of introducing me to everyone

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.040
there but he had this very annoying way of
doing it, he would sort of bring me up to

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.630
people and say, "Hello I'd like you to meet
David Graeber.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.110
He's an anarchist," [chuckles] which kind
of limited conversations --

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.110
[laughter]

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.920
possibilities a lot.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.320
But after a while he introduced me to this
person who he said was I'd have a lot in common

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.670
with, activist lawyer who's involved in a
lot of community work and various things like

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.670
that.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.010
So I chatted with her and she was talking
about her activism and asked me about mine

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.991
and I was talking about campaigns that I'd
been involved with, involved in the Global

00:01:51.991 --> 00:01:57.800
Justice Movement for many years, about the
IMF Structural Adjustment Policies and our

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.200
effects on various parts of the world.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:08.031
I had spent two years in Madagascar and Madagascar
had undergone all sorts of IMF structural

00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:14.099
adjustment over the years with various confusing
effects; some of them were actually kind of

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.400
ironically quite good like the state basically
sort of pulled up stakes and left large parts

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.540
of the countryside because they figure they
weren't getting any taxes out of the countryside

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.120
anyway and people sort of managing their own
affairs completely autonomously and that was

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.120
cool.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.510
But they also did things like withdraw support
for mosquito eradication programs, the idea

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:41.579
being IMF would set the terms for debt rescheduling
and demand various budget cuts.

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:47.340
In this case, there was a program that had
been put in 50 years before to wipe out malaria

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.549
in the highlands which had been very successful,
people had all lost their immunity but they

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.989
couldn't afford to keep it up anymore when
they had to cut the budget.

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:54.989
And as a result --

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.349
[pause]

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:05.680
I believe, 15,000 people died, 10 or 15 depending
on the accounts because the epidemic came

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.400
back, everyone had lost their immunity.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.739
At least 5,000 of those were children and
this had happened right before I came to Madagascar.

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.910
A lot of people were naturally quite devastated
by the experience.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.079
And I was telling this story and she was very
sympathetic and she said, "Well, yes, but

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.609
what were, as an activist what were you proposing
to do about this?

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:31.419
And I said, "Well we were involved in the
Drop the Debt campaign this thing called Jubilee

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:36.930
2000,' I said the debt of the global south
should be forgiven.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:37.930
Her reaction was --

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:38.930
[pause]

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.209
somewhat shocked and mortified.

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:47.329
She was like, "Well, they borrowed the money,
I mean, surely people have to pay their debts."

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:53.999
There was something about the way it was just
so commonsensical and as an activist your

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:57.730
first reaction when you say this you say,
"Uh-oh, that conversation, alright.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.650
And I thought this was a friend.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.159
Okay, wait, which one do I do?

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:03.310
There's like 12 different responses you can
do.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.189
Do I say, "Well they didn't really borrow
the money, some dictator who put it in a Swiss

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:08.189
bank account."

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:12.699
Do you say, "Well, actually, they paid the
money about 20 times over at this point just

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:16.750
through the miracle of compounded interest;
they'll never get out."

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.920
There's a million different responses.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.900
Actually, the response I think I came up with,
what would be most effective in that context

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.750
was the economical one which is if profits
are your reward for taking risk, well, you're

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.150
supposed to be taking a risk.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.190
So I mean the whole point of a financial system
is to guide money towards wise investments

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.790
and if you have a system like the IMF imposed
on most of the world where you're going to

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.250
get paid back no matter what you do, there's
absolutely no incentive to make intelligent

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.650
loans.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:54.260
But what really struck me was that sort of
commonsensical like, "You have to pay your

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.260
debts."

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.090
I mean, I thought, "Well, this is a very nice
person she just heard a story which involved

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:09.120
7,000 dead babies how, what other circumstance
would she try to justify killing 7,000 babies?”

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.130
Probably none.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.450
So what is it about the idea of debt that
it can justify things in peoples' minds that

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:16.450
you'd almost never –

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:17.980
[pause]

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.690
imagine defending otherwise?

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:29.230
And it set me off and I started thinking about
debt itself; the history of debt, what is

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:33.870
debt, where does it come from, how long have
we been thinking in these terms, how long

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:34.980
has it had this moral power?

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.790
And I quickly, when I started doing the initial
research, discovered a number of rather surprising

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:40.790
things.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:48.300
One of them was that no one has ever written
the history of debt which is kind of shocking

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.840
because really there aren't that many things
that no one's ever written a history of.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.810
Think about it, people have written histories
of salt, people have written histories of

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.150
different types of fish.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:06.151
There's a French historian who wrote a history
of shit, it's actually in a --

00:06:06.151 --> 00:06:07.151
[laughter]

00:06:07.151 --> 00:06:08.151
human waste disposal over the years.

00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:12.560
[laughs] Pretty much anything you can think
of there is a guy who's written a history

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.560
of that.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.640
How is it that no one's ever written a history
of debt?

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.060
And people have written lots of histories
of money, but the histories of money almost

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.950
invariably turn out when you look at it to
be histories of coinage which itself is interesting

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.740
when you consider that most transactions over
world history have been credit transactions.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:35.530
And you can find histories of credit but it's
not exactly the same thing.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.720
So here's this thing which pervades every
aspect of our lives.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:45.520
Modern nations run on deficit financing; consumer
economies run on debt; international relationships

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.100
are all about debt.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:53.071
Yet no one's quite sure what it is and no
one has written a history of the phenomena.

00:06:53.071 --> 00:07:01.820
So I started to work and one of the first
things I found was that most of our sort of

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.960
basic common sense reigning assumptions about
this are completely wrong.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:11.650
The other thing I found out is that this moral
ambivalence, which was interesting, that sort

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:16.990
of commonsensical but of course you have to
pay your debt and then the argument but actually

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.870
really no that doesn't make sense.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:24.490
That conversation has been happening for about
5,000 years itself.

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:29.870
Throughout the history of debt, conversations
like that keep happening.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:36.890
It seems that there's almost no time and place
where you can't find people, on the one hand,

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.830
treating the payment of debts as simple morality
or even treating simple morality as the paying

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.920
of debts.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.460
[pause]

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.650
But at the same time, then concluding there's
something very wrong with this and they need

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:54.120
to imagine some other way to think of it but
it not being clear what that is.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.340
[pause]

00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:00.639
I could multiply examples endlessly but one
or two will just give you the idea: Plato's

00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:02.050
Republic.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:03.650
Plato's Republic begins, "What is justice?"

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:08.230
It's the founding work of Western political
philosophy, right?

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:14.500
And from wealthy arms manufacturer, Kefalos,
who's name actually means capital.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:20.310
He says, "That's simple just pay your debts
and don't lie," and that's justice.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:25.181
Socrates blows that one out of the water right
away, of course, he says, "Well, okay, some

00:08:25.181 --> 00:08:29.560
guy lends me his sword and then he goes violently
insane and wants it back to kill people.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.840
Like, do I give it back?

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:36.380
Of course not and probably I'll make up some
lie as to why I can't."

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:40.610
So they start with that and so right well
right not that something else, maybe I mean

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:41.610
it metaphorically.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:46.020
And the rest of the book is basically the
okay not that maybe something else then.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.020
But that --

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:48.340
[pause]

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.870
it's debt right and no actually it's not.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:51.870
[laughter]

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:56.240
[chuckles] That shows up over and over and
over again.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.860
In a way all the world religions start that
way too.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:07.340
You have the Brahmans, sort of first grade
theological text of Hinduism after the Rig

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:13.650
Veda, they're discussing debt and debt and
sin are actually the same, debt and guilt

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:17.330
and sin are really the same word in the Sanskrit.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:22.000
So they start with this idea of cosmic debt:
what is life, life is a debt we owe to the

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000
gods.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.190
So we owe our lives to the gods, we pay interest
in the form of animal sacrifice and other

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:32.290
rituals and then gradually we pay the principal
back when we die.

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:38.140
So they pose this as this sort of, human existence
itself is a debt, all morality is debt.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:42.440
And when they, but as soon as they start extending
it, it becomes clear that that's not really

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:49.000
what they mean because they say, "Well you
also have a existential debt not only to the

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.800
gods and to the cosmos but you have an existential
debt to your parents.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.800
How do you pay them back?

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.260
You become a parent.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:10:00.770
You owe a debt to the sages who created wisdom
like you're reading now.

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:02.810
How do you pay that back?

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:06.990
You become a sage; you learn things.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.270
You owe a debt to humanity as a whole for
making your life possible.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:13.420
How do you pay back that, you're hospitable
to strangers.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:20.190
But in every case what you're doing is you
are undermining the basis for saying there

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:24.480
even is a debt, you're not paying it back
'cause after all, as in the example of parents,

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.200
somebody lends you money and you give the
money to someone else, you're not actually

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.730
paying it back.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:33.990
But what you are doing is you owe a debt to
your parents and then you become a parent

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:35.890
so your annihilating the difference.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:41.400
You owe a debt to the sages you become a sage;
you owe a debt to humanity you become humane.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.480
[pause]

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.480
Could that apply to the cosmos?

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:48.050
Well, yes, according to most Hindu scripture
that's exactly what's happening because you

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:49.080
are the cosmos.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:54.320
And if you think about it the idea that you
owe a debt to the cosmos, and this crops up

00:10:54.320 --> 00:11:01.670
again and again, debt to nature, debt to society,
debt to these huge institutions larger than

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:06.250
yourself, is kind of absurd because a debt
is a business transaction.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:10.430
And a business transaction is by definition
an arrangement between two legally equivalent

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:13.220
entities; they make a deal.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:19.660
Now how would you enter into a business transaction
with the entire universe, everything that

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.730
is or has ever been including yourself?

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:25.250
You kinda make a deal with them.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:26.250
Well, it's absurd.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:29.770
The only way to actually sort of undo the
debt is what they're saying you realize and

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:33.310
rituals if you're doing them right is that
you are the cosmos, there is no difference.

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:36.520
So there's no basis to say there's a debt
at all.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:40.470
So again it's the same thing: you start morality
is just debt, everything is a debt but they

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:43.740
say it in such a way that once you figure
out what they're really saying, they're really

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:47.460
saying, "No, actually it's not; debt is absurd."

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:50.300
Same thing happens in the Bible.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:51.300
In Aramaic –

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.700
[pause]

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:56.100
the word for debt and sin is also the same
word.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:01.020
Actually the Lord's Prayer which we always
remember through the Anglican translation

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:06.310
which is, "Forgive us our trespasses just
as we forgive those who trespass against us,"

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:10.250
sort of translated into this odd private property
terms.

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:15.380
But the original Aramaic and the original
John Wycliffe translation is debt.

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:19.200
"Forgive us our debts just as we forgive those
who owe us money."

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:24.260
But, of course, there's kind of a message
there right because we don't actually forgive

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.350
those who owe us money generally speaking.

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:30.490
So in a way it's a way of saying like you
are a sinner, [chuckles] you don't deserve

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:35.070
anything, but, in fact, grace will come and
[chuckles] you'll be forgiven.

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:39.750
But so what is sacred isn't actually paying
debts it's forgiveness of debts which was

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:44.500
a tradition going back to ancient Mesopotamia
and debt forgiveness and the biblical to believe

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.610
which is adopted from that where periodically
debts are canceled.

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:49.370
And that is a divine act.

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:56.240
So what's divine is not paying debts, what's
divine is forgiving debts; cancellation.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:01.610
So over and over you have that same situation
where people start with an assumption that

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:07.120
morality and debt are the same and they, immediately,
say except really they aren't and sort of

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:12.420
cast around for some other basis on which
to think of a universal morality, often having

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.450
a great deal of difficulty in doing so.

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:20.930
It's even more complicated because when you
do think of debt as sin --

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:23.470
[pause]

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.770
there's a question of who is the sinner.

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:29.630
This crops up over and over again, too, just
about everywhere.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:33.700
The person who borrows the money has probably
done something wrong, especially if they haven't

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:38.730
paid it right away; the person who lent is
not doing much better.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:43.350
In fact one thing that happens over and over
again in so many different traditions is you

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:46.089
find that borrowing money or --

00:13:46.089 --> 00:13:48.920
[pause]

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:53.210
they frame morality as the obligation of the
borrower to pay it back.

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:58.410
So obligation and debt are considered the
same thing; morality is just doing your obligations

00:13:58.410 --> 00:13:59.610
as paying your debts.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:03.839
On the other hand in almost every one of those
traditions, money lenders are assumed to be

00:14:03.839 --> 00:14:04.839
evil.

00:14:04.839 --> 00:14:07.110
Well, it's kinda hard to square those.

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:11.240
And sometimes in the same text they'll just
be sort of jockeying back and forth trying

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.040
to figure out who's the bad guy.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:18.480
There's a great Buddhist story from medieval
Japan I use in the first chapter because just

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:22.920
brings it home some clearly, it's kind of
a case of premature reincarnation.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:30.900
There is a Buddhist monk telling this story
about some book about strange events in Japan

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:35.590
in my day, which is maybe like 700 A.D.

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:40.010
There's some woman who's wife of the governor
is notorious local loan shark and she terrorizes

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:45.060
people and is always chasing them down and
were fleeing the province in droves from her

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:46.060
depredation.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:51.810
And she dies and after three days of saying
prayer over the body something horror happened,

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:57.420
the coffin opens and she jumps out but she's
half an ox and this horrible monster sort

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:02.080
of lingers for a few days and the family panics
and is trying to give back all the money that

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:06.410
they'd extracted from people hoping she'll
just mercifully die and the whole episode

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:08.980
will be over, which eventually she does.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:13.620
But the monk is reflecting on this and he
says, "Well, you know it says in the Sutras

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:20.100
that if you owe somebody money and you don't
pay, well, now this is bad because you're

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:24.000
in mortal danger you could be reborn as an
ox in their barn."

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.520
It's what happens to debtors a lot.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:31.210
But he says, "I guess, well, if somebody owes
you money and you're really giving them a

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:35.279
hard time then you could get reborn an ox
in their barn."

00:15:35.279 --> 00:15:38.250
And that must be what was about to happen
to her but she was so bad it wasn't even clear

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:42.860
who's ox she was gonna be born in so she kind
of turned into this monster.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:47.550
I thought about this and I thought, well,
yeah, a perfect example like because nobody's,

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:51.530
you're not gonna be shakin' somebody down
unless they didn't pay.

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:54.930
But if they didn't pay then they're in danger
of being born an ox in your barn.

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:59.800
So, like, who's gonna get, you can't both
get born an ox in the other guy's barn.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.459
[chuckles] Somebody's gotta be worse so who
decides?

00:16:03.459 --> 00:16:07.779
There's some sort of Karmic balance, its touch
and go, either one could actually end up an

00:16:07.779 --> 00:16:09.420
ox.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:13.029
And I think that [chuckles] really brings
home the problem you always have in debt:

00:16:13.029 --> 00:16:18.150
one party is in moral peril definitely, the
other one probably.

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:24.930
And when you imagine all human relations as
exchange, that's what crops up.

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:25.930
[pause]

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:30.580
There's a terrible ambivalence there for about
the very nature of human sociality.

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:33.370
Yet sometimes people do it in a positive way.

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:37.230
I should point out that one of the points
I make in the book is that human relations

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:41.930
are not all exchange, there are many different
moral registers in which we interact with

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:44.070
one another and exchange is just one.

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:47.440
But when you have exchange, exchange is a
relationship between two equal partners where

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:52.210
they, based on reciprocity, they should actually
give each other an equivalent, maybe on the

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:53.440
spot, maybe over time.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:57.380
If the transaction is not complete, there's
a debt, but once it is complete they're equal

00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:59.050
once again and they walk away.

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:02.880
But the curious thing about that is it means
that you only –

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:04.910
[pause]

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:09.200
if you're working on the level of exchange,
then you only have relationships with one

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.890
another when the exchange is incomplete in
which case one party is definitely to blame

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:18.059
because they haven't paid back what they owe,
the other one might well be.

00:17:18.059 --> 00:17:23.790
It implies that sociality itself, human relations
only exist when somebody's done something

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:24.790
wrong.

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:28.810
If you have deeply commercial philosophies
of life often that's the conclusion.

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:34.760
Other places debt becomes good, it becomes
the basis of sociality.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:42.130
It's very, very common in a lot of places
-- it's a great story always like sort of

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:46.340
brings us home about these people called the
Tiv who live in Central Nigeria and this anthropologist

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:53.540
named Laura Bohannan who wrote up of her experiences
when she first did field work there.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:59.240
So she shows up, gets a house, doesn't really
know the language very well.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:05.290
People immediately start appearing with gifts
and somebody'll bring a little basket of okra,

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:10.490
somebody'll bring some fish, some grain, potatoes,
and she doesn't know what to do, of course,

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:14.060
she's an anthropologist, she gets out her
little notebook and writes everything down;

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:20.210
her living room gradually filling up with
baskets and various types of goods.

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:24.940
And eventually someone takes pity on her and
says, "Okay, look this is the deal.

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:28.620
Those are gifts but you have to give people
something back.

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:34.890
Figure out what they're worth, but the key
is you can't give them back something of the

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:38.520
exact same value of what they just gave you.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:42.270
So that okra's worth three shillings.

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:47.260
Give them something worth two shillings or
give them something worth four shillings.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:50.730
Never give them something worth three shillings
because if you do you're saying, "I don't

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:53.140
want to have anything more to do with you.'"

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:58.070
So people have to be in each others' debt
just a little bit and that way you always

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:02.730
have an excuse to like, "Oh, by the way, I
still owe you a shilling."

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:05.210
So everybody has an excuse to see each other.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:09.770
So in a way, sociality is dead, everybody
has to be just a little bit in debt to everybody

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:10.770
else.

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:14.920
And if you look at the way communities work
over the course of history where they do have

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:19.000
money very often that's what's like being
a neighborhood means.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.880
Everybody's a little bit in debt to everybody
else.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:31.490
Medieval England, I think somebody calculated
that 97 percent of all transactions in a typical

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:38.630
English village, and this is true through
to at least the 1700's, were by credit.

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:42.130
Partly there just isn't a lot of money floating
around, partly people don't like to use it

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:43.740
with neighbors.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:48.590
As we'll see actual physical money is associated
with war, violence, soldiers, people you really

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:52.040
don't wanna hang out with, criminals.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:56.020
People, nice people operate on credit and
trust.

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:59.320
So everybody's doing these credit transactions
and everybody's keeping track in their heads,

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:03.630
"Oh, I owe him five shillings, he owes him
three," and every six months to a year they

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:05.419
have what they call communal reckoning.

00:20:05.419 --> 00:20:10.169
So, everybody sits down in a big circle and
they say, "Alright I owe you seven shillings,

00:20:10.169 --> 00:20:15.070
he owes him seven shillings, he owes him,
he owes me, okay big circle we can cancel

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:16.070
that one out."

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:19.450
And they just do a bunch of loops and they
gradually whittle it down until they figure

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:24.799
out there's about three shillings left over
between this guy and that guy, what is actually

00:20:24.799 --> 00:20:26.710
owed, and then somebody gives somebody a pig
--

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:27.710
[laughter]

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:32.930
some cheese [chuckles] whatever it might be
and they settle it and go back to zero again

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:34.850
and start.

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:40.180
And that's community, community means everybody
owes everybody something else, everybody remembers

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:43.960
what they owe and eventually they all settle
it and start over again.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:50.340
Now, so in that sense, debt isn't a terrible
thing.

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:56.070
But there's always that shadow, like sin,
floating over it.

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:57.950
[pause]

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:01.530
And there's that terrible ambivalence, that
way of saying one party's guilty and the other

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:02.750
one might be.

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:06.750
Where does that come from?

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:07.750
And --

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:08.750
[pause]

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:13.660
when I began explaining this one of the first
things I looked at was the history of money

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:14.660
itself.

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:16.522
Because, we have to say, okay, what is a debt?

00:21:16.522 --> 00:21:22.230
A debt is essentially a promise which you
can phrase in exactly quantifiable terms,

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:29.610
because you can quantify it it's impersonal,
if I, because it's impersonal, it's transferable.

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:34.740
So if I promise you that I will meet you at
five o'clock, you can't actually transfer

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:39.080
that to someone else normally speaking, I
guess, in some circumstances you could.

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:42.890
But a promise which is quantifiable, "I promise
to give you exactly this amount of things,"

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:47.590
you actually can turn over to someone else
and in way, according to many theories, that's

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:53.790
money actually is is a transferable promise
to render a certain amount of goods.

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:54.930
[pause]

00:21:54.930 --> 00:22:00.220
One of the great questions is how that comes
about, why the need to quantify promises happens

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:03.130
or quantify them precisely.

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:07.170
And we've had a story about why this happens,
that you're readin' your basic Economic 101

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:13.730
textbook actually invented by Adam Smith in
1776, The Wealth of Nations, is the first

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:16.590
time you see someone really making the argument
in detail.

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:17.590
[coughs]

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:21.820
And it continues to be the story that everybody
knows and learns and they pick up somewhere

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:28.920
or another, that becomes common sense, it's,
and if you're, as an anthropologist, I must

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:33.790
say, that I have a kind of a pet peeve in
this respect because, well it's a professional

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:40.830
pet peeve on the part of anthropologists,
because this story was told over 200 years

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:41.830
ago --

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:42.830
[pause]

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:46.730
almost immediately, we started going out in
the world trying to find examples of people

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:49.210
who do it and we couldn't.

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:50.210
It's not true.

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:53.320
[laughs] But they never changed the textbooks.

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.559
We just can't get them to come up with a different
story.

00:22:55.559 --> 00:22:58.210
But alright here's the story, you've all heard
it before.

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:04.160
Once upon a time people lived in villages
and they used to swap things, there was barter.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:10.549
Say I wanted somebody's cow; well, I said,
"Alright hey I need a cow, tell you what I'll

00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:13.030
give you 30 chickens for that cow."

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:19.400
And the guy's like, "Well, I don't know, 30's
not much, 40 chickens, 45, alright sold."

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:24.830
So you come to some sort of arrangement, swap,
go home.

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:29.160
But the problem is maybe the guy doesn't want
chickens, maybe you don't happen to have anything

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.160
he wants right now.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.160
What happens?

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.559
Well, you can't make a deal, right?

00:23:32.559 --> 00:23:38.460
So the only way out of this problem, as it
crops up more and more over time, is to settle

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:45.170
on something that everybody usually wants,
like gold for some reason; shiny metal but

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:48.110
it's kind of handy and it's pretty.

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:51.720
And there's a virtuous circle the moment you
start using it as a general equivalent, everybody

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:55.420
needs it all the time, it turns into money.

00:23:55.420 --> 00:24:00.309
So barter's inconvenient, you get money, government
gets involved and starts stamping the stuff,

00:24:00.309 --> 00:24:05.180
through uniform weights and quality, although
it started cheating all the time and debasing

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:08.330
the currency because governments are bad in
this version.

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:15.300
Gradually, you invent credit systems and it's
an evolutionary series: barter, money, credit,

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:19.930
securitized derivatives of whatnot are just
sort of the last link of the chain, it follows

00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:20.930
logically.

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:22.300
Alright, so that's the story.

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:27.760
As I say there's one big problem we've been
scouring the world for over 200 years now

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:33.130
and we have never found a single community
where everyday transactions take the form

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:35.750
of "I'll give you 40 chickens for that cow."

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:37.090
They don't exist.

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:41.500
And Adam Smith himself had no way to know
this he was just speculating, but now we do

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.799
and they keep on telling this story.

00:24:43.799 --> 00:24:48.830
I mean if you look at contemporary economic
textbooks, the old ones used to say, "Well

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:54.250
primitive people do this," and now that they
kinda know it's not true they don't wanna

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:59.809
stop so instead they say, "Well imagine you
didn't have money what would you have to do?

00:24:59.809 --> 00:25:00.809
How would you get breakfast?

00:25:00.809 --> 00:25:04.179
Well you'd have to barter wouldn't you?"

00:25:04.179 --> 00:25:10.760
And they tell this story as a kind of parable
which is basically what it is.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:16.110
There's an obvious reason, if you think about
it, there's obviously problem with this story,

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:21.260
why it wouldn't happen, which is you're taking
a Neolithic village here a bunch of people

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:25.960
who are neighbors and you are assuming that
they will only deal with each other with what

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.780
economists like to call the spot trade.

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:31.660
"Here, I'm gonna give you this, you're gonna
give me that," we walk away.

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:35.679
But, of course, why would they do that right?

00:25:35.679 --> 00:25:37.080
I mean, they're neighbors.

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:41.740
If the guy doesn't want my chickens he knows
I'm gonna have something he wants because

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:46.040
I'm his neighbor, in fact, it's rather nice
to have your neighbor in your debt, it's useful

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.630
for all sorts of things.

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:52.430
So even if you take this imaginary scenario
here these two guys in a Neolithic village,

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:56.789
one wants a cow, what would really happen?

00:25:56.789 --> 00:26:04.020
Well, in fact in many human societies it is
the case that if you praise somebody else's

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:11.280
possession it's almost impossible not to give
it to the person who praises it.

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:17.030
This is another one of those things which
has a very, very strange moral power; so much

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:21.150
so that you really can't break out of it.

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:25.919
I mean there's a great story I always tell
from New Zealand, a Maori story about a guy

00:26:25.919 --> 00:26:29.419
named Te Ringa who is a sort of a notorious
glutton.

00:26:29.419 --> 00:26:33.340
He rarely did much fishing himself, everybody
else in the neighborhood was a fisherman,

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:38.900
he would sort of walk up and down the beach
lookin' for people coming back from fishing

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:43.030
and check out their catch and say, "Oh looky
that's squid, oh I love squid, that's my favorite."

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:48.080
Or, "Wow that's a beautiful fish," and they
would be like, "Okay, here's a fish, okay,

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.080
here's a squid."

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:53.000
So [chuckles] they just have to give it to
him.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.480
After about two years of this people got fed
up so they formed a war party and they killed

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.480
him.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.480
[chuckles]

00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:59.480
[laughter]

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:02.559
It was actually easier to just bash the guy's
head in than to say, "No, I'm not gonna give

00:27:02.559 --> 00:27:03.559
you the fish."

00:27:03.559 --> 00:27:07.210
So, such is the moral power of some customs.

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:13.630
At any rate, so here you have so if you praise
someone's, I have a friend from Lebanon where

00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:19.090
she grew up it was the same thing somebody
praises your scarf or piece of jewelry you

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:20.620
just have to say, "Take it."

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:24.650
There's only one way out actually which is
to say, "Oh you like, it was a gift."

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:25.650
[laughs]

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:26.650
[laughter]

00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:33.880
At any rate, so alright here you have this
situation so I wanna cow, I go up I say, "Wow

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:37.350
that is one magnificent cow, that's a really
beautiful cow you got there."

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:41.130
So the guy there's only one thing he can do
he says, "Oh, you want the cow, well, please

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:45.320
take the cow it's a really stupid cow but
if you like it you should really have it.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:49.630
No, no don't even think about giving anything
back, it's a gift of course, we're neighbors,

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:53.020
we love each other just take the cow."

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:55.320
Now, he owes you one.

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.480
[chuckles]

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:57.650
[laughter]

00:27:57.650 --> 00:27:59.750
And everybody knows that, nobody'll say it.

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:00.750
But what does he owe?

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:03.270
He owes you something roughly like a cow.

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:08.400
And that's what you get in communities like
this you get this sort of rank type system

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.610
of types of things.

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:14.020
So a cow, a canoe, a very nice necklace are
roughly the same, or you could give one back

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:15.340
for the other.

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:19.880
Or it's not necessarily bad because you could
give something back to him or he could just

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:25.870
show up because you owe him one and he could
just say, "Well, wow, that's a beautiful necklace

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:27.370
you have.”

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:31.120
Or he could say, “You know, my son is deeply
in love with your daughter.”

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:37.410
It could be a lot of things, doesn't necessarily
a material good, “I really need help with

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:38.539
something”.

00:28:38.539 --> 00:28:41.809
So, but you have this sort of quantified rank
system.

00:28:41.809 --> 00:28:43.760
And there's all sorts of ways you can head
it off.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:50.340
You can play games you could like say, "Oh,
I hate owing that guy a cow, I know, I just

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:52.170
got a whole bunch of yams, I'll give them
to him.

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:56.030
I'll be off the hook," and he'll be like,
"Oh, yams; great, thanks."

00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:57.030
[chuckles]

00:28:57.030 --> 00:28:58.030
[laughter]

00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:03.880
But so he might mock you as a cheapskate which
is a devastating thing in a small community.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:08.929
But here's the thing, he's very unlikely to
come up with a mathematical formula for exactly

00:29:08.929 --> 00:29:11.900
how cheap he thinks you were, right?

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:17.110
And that's the problem: how do you get from
like a cow is roughly like this to 27 yams

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:20.799
equals one cow but not three, how many chickens
equals a cow.

00:29:20.799 --> 00:29:25.700
In the barter story there's a mechanism but
if there's this sort of rough credit system

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:31.930
is what you'd actually have and what you actually
do observe in places about money, well, how

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:37.350
does that turn into something where you can
figure out exact proportional equivalents?

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:40.940
The answer to that seems to be when somebody's
very angry.

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:45.350
Now when people are being nice to each other
there's really no need to calculate but occasionally

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:48.590
it will happen that people, violence ensues.

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:55.690
Say I am mocking someone for giving me these
yams and he's drunk, I'm drunk, violence ensues,

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:58.059
somebody's ear gets cut off.

00:29:58.059 --> 00:30:00.620
Well then there's numbers.

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:04.690
Very often it is the case that even in places
where you don't have markets for goods, you

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:12.230
do have incredibly elaborate series of fines
and penalties for damaged limbs, if you lose

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:15.990
a finger it's worth this much, if you lose
a thumb it's worth that much, if you lose

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:21.370
an eye, if you have a gash like this large
and they'll measure the gash, and how many

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:27.100
chickens or heifers or silver plates or whatever
it might be.

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:31.809
What they call the Barbarian Law Code, seemed
like every society in early medieval Europe

00:30:31.809 --> 00:30:36.039
wrote up a schedule of fines like this and
some of them are incredibly detailed.

00:30:36.039 --> 00:30:41.510
The early Welsh and Irish ones are especially
interesting because we know they didn't have

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:44.920
markets, you couldn't buy or sell things,
most things.

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.370
But they did have prices on everything.

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:52.039
In fact, they specified the exact value of
every single object likely to be found in

00:30:52.039 --> 00:31:00.529
a person's house, ranging from the silverware
to the roof beams, everything, the curtains.

00:31:00.529 --> 00:31:01.740
Why?

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:08.840
Because you will end up in a situation often
where the law says you owe me 27 heifers or

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:15.429
this means war, swords are pulled, people
are not willing to compromise, you killed

00:31:15.429 --> 00:31:18.590
my brothers, you insulted my mother, whatever
it might be.

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:21.350
You need to pay penalties and you don't have
heifers.

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:26.750
Well, then you actually need to figure out
exactly what's equivalent to what.

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:31.370
So in those circumstances and in legal situations,
particularly where there's a danger of a feud

00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:35.620
or outbreak of violence, in fact people do
need to quantify and it seems like that's

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:40.160
the first circumstance where you have something
like money emerging.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:48.350
That association then of money and violence
is a constant, and it helps to explain a lot

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:58.429
about why debt, particular tends to take on
this incredibly powerful moral hold.

00:31:58.429 --> 00:32:03.700
One way I like to put it is that if you are
in a situation of inequality –

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.850
[pause]

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:08.570
of violent inequality.

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:13.200
Probably the more effective technique ever
invented to make, not only make that seem

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:17.210
moral but to make it seems like victim is
to blame, is to frame it in the language of

00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:18.900
debt.

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.370
Mafiosi understand this perfectly well, right?

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:25.429
But sort of heads of conquering armies, you
come in you say, "Alright, I've just conquered

00:32:25.429 --> 00:32:29.809
you guys," and it's actually important to
bear in mind here that there's a famous line

00:32:29.809 --> 00:32:33.610
from Benjamin Franklin, "There's nothing certain
in life but death and taxes."

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:37.220
That's not actually true, it's only death.

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:44.559
In many societies they did ancient Sumer communities
didn't tax themselves, taxes were just placed

00:32:44.559 --> 00:32:45.790
on conquered populations.

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:49.309
The same was true in Athens, in fact, they
had negative taxes in Athens, the government

00:32:49.309 --> 00:32:55.150
gave you money, you were paid to vote, just
gave periodic handouts from government resources,

00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:57.210
Rome had bread and circuses.

00:32:57.210 --> 00:33:01.160
So citizens didn't actually have to pay taxes,
taxes was tribute placed on people who'd been

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.160
conquered.

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:05.290
But the general excuse was debt, "You owe
me your lives.

00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:07.881
Why do you owe me your lives because I coulda
killed you and I didn't so --

00:33:07.881 --> 00:33:11.110
[pause]

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:14.700
of course, I expect payment for this, compensation.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:20.230
I'm a nice guy; I'm gonna let you off the
hook for six months and if you're in trouble

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:23.360
we can negotiate something but I do expect
payment."

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:29.140
Voila, you've turned a relationship of violent
inequality into a relation where the victims

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:34.080
are running around feeling inadequate all
the time, making terrible apologies for themselves

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:37.020
and you get to be the magnanimous nice guy.

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:41.100
It happens over and over again in world history
and it's very, very effective.

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:46.179
The problem is it tends to blow up in your
face because from the prospective of power

00:33:46.179 --> 00:33:50.260
there's that little worm in the bud which
is this is you're translating things into

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:55.230
the language of the business deal which implies
that you should be equal, you are equal on

00:33:55.230 --> 00:34:00.980
some level if you owe a debt to someone, there's
a contract here, but one party has failed

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:03.440
to live up to their end of the contract.

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.520
[pause]

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:10.950
Now if you think about it there's a real explosive
potential there and if you look at world history,

00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:17.619
in fact, the vast majority of rebellions,
revolutions, insurrections, peasant revolts

00:34:17.619 --> 00:34:21.570
that you see are not about the kind of thing
you'd probably think it would be.

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:28.140
They're not about slavery, I mean, slave revolts
happen but they're pretty rare, they're not

00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:34.609
about caste systems, they're not about serfdom,
absolute declared systems of inequality.

00:34:34.609 --> 00:34:36.669
They're always about debt.

00:34:36.669 --> 00:34:42.820
Moses Finley, the great classicist once said
that there was basically one revolutionary

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:47.990
program throughout antiquity: just cancel
the debts and redistribute the land; in that

00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.990
order.

00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:52.869
When peasants, like, take over a town the
first thing they do is they find the debt

00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:54.750
records and burn them.

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:59.570
After that they go after the land registers
and maybe the tax documents.

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:01.171
And this remains true throughout history.

00:35:01.171 --> 00:35:07.720
I mean, I was actually going through just
recently some of the writings of John Adams

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:12.640
and others of the founding fathers, their
reflections on democracy, which, of course,

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:15.980
they were totally against; those guys hated
democracy.

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:19.720
And John Adams has this quote saying, "Well
we can't have majority vote.

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:23.359
If we had majority vote then we'd have two
million people with property, nine million

00:35:23.359 --> 00:35:25.300
people without property, you know what's gonna
happen?

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:28.990
The moment we allow everybody to vote first
thing that's gonna happen is they'll cancel

00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:31.580
the debts, after that they'll redistribute
the land."

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:32.580
[laughter]

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:35.760
It's just common sense.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:40.910
So this is the program and why debt, why does
debt mobilize people in this way?

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:42.700
Because it implies that you're equal.

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:47.290
So if you say you are inferior, you're a peasant,
you're a serf, I'm a lord, well, it's not

00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:50.820
gonna make people very happy but you can live
with that.

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:56.260
But if you say, "Well, you're supposed to
be my equal but you messed up.

00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:57.720
You are morally inadequate."

00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:02.810
Well, it's kind of hard not to take that and
say, "Now wait a minute if we're equal like

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:03.869
why are you saying I messed up?

00:36:03.869 --> 00:36:06.780
I mean who owes what to who here really?"

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:11.281
And that is, of course, what people have said
for the last 5,000 years when confronted with

00:36:11.281 --> 00:36:15.810
that almost invariably the response is who
owes what to who.

00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:20.270
But once you do that, you're using the language
of debt, right?

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:23.800
You are saying that debt is morality, you're
saying, "Well, wait a minute we make your

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:26.190
food.

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:31.040
In terms of any reasonably morality, I'm the
guy, you should be owing me rather than me

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.040
owing you."

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:35.570
But suddenly the language of debt does become
all pervasive 'cause you have to use the master's

00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:36.570
language.

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:39.400
And I think that's what we're dealing with
with all this religious text, with all this

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:44.300
philosophical text which start by saying debt
is just morality and then say except actually

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:45.300
it's not.

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:49.920
You're stuck with the language of debt as
a way of arguing about politics.

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:56.800
We don't know if this is 2000 D.C. in Mesopotamia
and two guys are sitting around the tavern

00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.450
arguing about politics what kind of phrases
and language they're using.

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:05.110
But we can be pretty certain that debt is
a big one in there.

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:08.089
And we can also be pretty certain that when
we're reading all these great religious texts

00:37:08.089 --> 00:37:13.290
that language of ordinary, everyday, political
argument is in there.

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:17.650
The thing is we don't have this anymore so
we're probably reading all these sort of Mesopotamian

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:22.550
equivalent of “it's the economy stupid”
or all these various catch phrases that everybody

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:24.970
knew at the time that we just don't know anymore.

00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:29.440
So they're just throwing them around in this
lodge and this is why all this moral language

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:34.270
becomes this financial language and you talk
about redemption and reckoning, and so forth

00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:39.240
and debt and sin and so forth and so on.

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:43.880
So you're stuck with this language of debt
except it periodically blows up.

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:49.480
Next, when I started looking the broad sweep
of history I thought, "Well, you can look

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:58.410
at social movements and organization of society
in those terms and perhaps one of the most

00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:02.380
revealing ways of doing that is looking at
the history of money itself."

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:06.240
Remember we have this paradigm: first there
is barter, then there's money, then comes

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.540
credit, and that's wrong.

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:14.030
Not only it is wrong, it's actually backwards;
credit comes first.

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:17.390
Somehow or other, by the time the sort of
curtain comes up around 3500 B.C., in Mesopotamia

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:22.020
you already have very elaborate credit systems.

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:28.480
Actually the very first document we have which
talks about interest rates is a political

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:34.020
document by a King [inaudible ] I believe
his name is, a Sumerian King who's complaining

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:39.480
about his neighbors like occupying a stretch
of territory which is rightfully his and he

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:42.220
says, "Well you know, they've been occupying
this land for 20 years.

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:46.440
If we calculate the rent we would have charged
them had they been renting this same land

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:51.560
and then add a compounded interest rate, I
calculate that they would actually owe us

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:57.540
13 trillion shekels or whatever, [chuckles]
some insanely sum that no one could possibly

00:38:57.540 --> 00:38:58.540
pay.

00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:00.030
Obviously this means war.

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:05.589
[chuckles] So you've already got compounded
interest rates and so forth going on in the

00:39:05.589 --> 00:39:10.000
very, very first records that we have people
have expense accounts, bar tabs.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.599
It seems like almost all everyday transactions
are on credit.

00:39:14.599 --> 00:39:20.200
And the evidence for that is scales, because
they were denominating debts in silver but

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:24.430
they didn't actually make scales accurate
enough to weigh out the tiny amounts of silver

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:29.550
that would have been required to buy like
a shirt or a hammer or something like that

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:30.620
in the marketplace.

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:33.680
I mean, they had the technology to do so they
just didn't bother.

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:37.270
So clearly, people weren't actually using
silver to buy this stuff they were running

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:38.680
up a tab.

00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:42.211
Alright, so you've got the Sumerian situation,
but the same King you know what he does after

00:39:42.211 --> 00:39:47.680
he declared war on Legash or the rival place
wins, and what does he do after that he declares

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:48.680
a debt cancellation –

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:52.320
[pause]

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:57.890
for everybody in the kingdom because it seems
that the problem when you have these credit

00:39:57.890 --> 00:40:04.510
systems, money is basically in a set of IOU's,
denominated in silver unless you're merchants

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:09.300
dealing with large transactions rarely actually
changes hands.

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:11.680
The problem is in bad years people fall into
debt –

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.109
[pause]

00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:18.079
because also the silver and grain are fixed
in relation to each other; that's what money

00:40:18.079 --> 00:40:25.390
actually is but that a pretty problem if you,
if there's a bad harvest, the price doesn't

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:26.390
go up.

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:30.130
You're stuck, the farmers fall terribly into
debt.

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:34.300
As a result people start taking away their
flocks, taking away their fields, taking away

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.160
members of their family.

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:44.050
Debt peonage becomes a huge phenomena, they
start running away joining nomad bands outside

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:50.770
the city, society seems to be breaking down
so kings will normally come in and sort of

00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:52.470
declare a clean slate.

00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:57.000
"Alright, commercial debts can stay on the
books usually but consumer debt, we'll wipe

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.579
them out and start over again."

00:40:59.579 --> 00:41:03.960
This becomes a habit and become systematized
in the Biblical Jubilee every 7 to 49 years

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:05.770
depending on your reading.

00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:07.589
Debts are wiped out; everybody gets to go
home.

00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:12.570
In fact the first recorded word for freedom
in any human language is the Sumerian word

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:17.200
"amargi" which literally means return to mother
because that's what happens.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:22.349
They declare debt cancellation, all the debt
peons get to go home.

00:41:22.349 --> 00:41:23.349
[pause]

00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:27.490
So, this virtual money systems comes first
which is always very entertaining because

00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:31.890
people have this tendency to write about virtual
money as a new phenomena; we're in this brave

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:32.890
new world.

00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:35.370
Actually it's the original form of money.

00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:36.700
Coins come later.

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:42.970
Barter, incidentally, tends to only really
show up when you have people who are used

00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:46.380
to using money but actually can't get their
hands on any.

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:50.820
So you do have documented places where people
do say, "I'll give you 20 chickens for that

00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:54.920
cow," but in almost every case it's something
like Russia in the 90's where the economy

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:59.140
falls apart where the money supply vanishes
and people are trying to carry on as if they

00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:00.750
had money without money.

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:05.920
Or in a prison, they turn cigarettes into
money because they're all used to using money.

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.240
[pause]

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:14.680
Now, here's the interesting thing: coins are
invented nearly simultaneously, it happens

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:20.089
first in Lydian in the Eastern Mediterranean,
but shortly thereafter at least in broad historical

00:42:20.089 --> 00:42:26.310
terms it happens in the Ganges Plain in Northern
India and in the plains of Northern China,

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:28.230
Ganges Valley, I'm sorry.

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:29.230
And --

00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:31.849
[pause]

00:42:31.849 --> 00:42:38.500
in every case there were different physical
techniques; in one case stamped, in one case

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:39.820
cast, but –

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:40.820
[pause]

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:45.270
social situation seems to be the same which
is that money, in the physical sense, currency,

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:48.520
is actually invented to pay soldiers.

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:52.849
And it makes perfect sense if you think about
it because gold and silver are what money's

00:42:52.849 --> 00:42:58.030
denominated with and you can use it for exchange
but it just isn't usually done.

00:42:58.030 --> 00:43:01.811
But soldiers are exactly the sort of people
who are most likely to be doing this, first

00:43:01.811 --> 00:43:08.660
of all from the perspective of a soldier,
gold and silver has a huge advantage over

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:14.460
a credit arrangement because you can't actually
steal a credit arrangement; you can't run

00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:15.720
off with it.

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:19.490
On the other hand, gold and silver it's kind
of your equivalent of the suitcase full of

00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:24.030
hundred dollar bills and nobody knows where
it's from, nobody asks, anybody'll take it.

00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:27.410
So for soldiers that's very nice, you can
also melt it down whatever, divide it up into

00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:28.660
small portions.

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:32.440
So soldiers are likely to be carrying around
loot.

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:36.830
And second of all, if you have elaborate credit
arrangements as the major way of transacting,

00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:43.079
well, a heavily armed guy who's just passing
through is probably the person you'd least

00:43:43.079 --> 00:43:47.700
like to extend credit to if you can possibly
avoid it, if he's carrying around little bits

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:49.910
of gold and silver, well, good.

00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:55.490
So cash markets insofar as they seem to first
emerge will tend to emerge right around where

00:43:55.490 --> 00:44:01.710
ever armies are parked or where they have
recently looted things and are trying to get

00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:04.820
rid of the little bits of gold and silver
and acquire the wine, women, and song, and

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:07.930
various other things that they like.

00:44:07.930 --> 00:44:09.800
[pause]

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:15.210
Governments very quickly get in on the deal
and, in fact, one interesting thing is, by

00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:21.380
the Adam Smith account, if money just sort
of emerges from the need to get over the inconveniences

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:29.000
of barter, well it would be very hard to understand
why governments demanded taxes in money.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.980
It might seem self evident but the moment
you think about it it isn't because if gold

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:36.840
and silver are just money well why not just
grab the gold and silver mines?

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.840
And in fact governments would do that.

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:42.670
I mean, ancient kings would normally grab
the gold and silver mines and, in theory,

00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:46.630
you have all the gold and silver you want,
you've got all the money.

00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:51.420
Why would you then take the stuff, stamp your
picture on it, give it to people, and say,

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:53.849
"Okay, everybody in the kingdom has to give
me one of these back again?"

00:44:53.849 --> 00:44:56.890
Think about it, it's kind of odd.

00:44:56.890 --> 00:44:59.570
But it makes perfect sense if you're trying
to feed an army.

00:44:59.570 --> 00:45:04.770
Here you have this army of 100,000 people,
they're sittin' in a town on the border, well,

00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:06.990
how are you gonna get food to them?

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:13.550
Under ancient conditions unless they're next
to the ocean where it's easy, relatively easy

00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:17.481
to move stuff around, it's extremely difficult
to move around large amounts of grain, they're

00:45:17.481 --> 00:45:21.930
gonna eat everything within walking distance
in a matter of weeks.

00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:22.930
So what are you gonna do?

00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:29.771
Either you have to employ another 100,000
people just bringing them stuff or you can

00:45:29.771 --> 00:45:33.060
give them all tiny little pieces of metal
with your picture on it and say, "Okay, everybody

00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:35.140
in the kingdom has to give me one back."

00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:41.260
Voila you've just employed your entire population
getting soldiers things they want.

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:42.360
[laughter]

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:46.890
And that's [chuckles] essentially what taxation
systems have done throughout world history.

00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:50.349
I mean, colonial empires did this very, very
self consciously like in Madagascar where

00:45:50.349 --> 00:45:54.730
I was, first thing the French did they said,
"Okay we've just conquered you, that was very

00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:59.619
expensive outfitting an army, you're going
to have to pay us back for the cost of having

00:45:59.619 --> 00:46:01.150
conquered you.

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:08.810
We will issue paper money and you will have
to give 10 of those back to us every year."

00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:12.390
It was a way of creating a market.

00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:17.460
Somehow or another you're gonna have, they
actually called it the moralizing tax to teach

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:20.390
people the value of work.

00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:28.050
So money and taxes have been used throughout
the centuries as ways of creating markets

00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:32.860
which is very interesting because we have
this assumption that markets and governments

00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:39.750
and particularly war-making governments are
opposed principles and that political choice

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:44.710
for the last century or so has largely revolved
around which one we're gonna slant to.

00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:47.060
Are we gonna go more on the government side,
more on the market side?

00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:50.210
Those are the two sort of logical human possibilities.

00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:56.349
Ever since people like Herbert Spencer early
19th century we've always assumed there's

00:46:56.349 --> 00:47:03.100
an opposition between these things, historically
in fact no.

00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:08.390
Markets tend to be created by governments
as a side effect of military operations.

00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:15.950
They sometimes take on a life of their own
but the origins have very closely linked.

00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:21.940
So to go back to these periods of history:
so you have this first period of virtual money,

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:28.370
coinage is invented around 600 B.C., Karl
Jaspers, the German existential philosopher

00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:33.160
who coined the phrase, "the Axial Age" for
this period and he pointed out that almost

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:38.710
all major schools, both of world philosophy
and the great world religions, crop up in

00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:40.869
a relatively short period of time.

00:47:40.869 --> 00:47:46.690
If you extend it from 600 B.C. to 600 A.D.
it's exactly, it starts happening exactly

00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:49.700
the times and places where they invent coinage;
uncanny.

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:54.790
It's even in the same city, it's in Greece,
Miletus, which is a place where they, the

00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:58.650
first Greek city, where they're using coins
in everyday transactions, is where they invent

00:47:58.650 --> 00:48:01.579
Greek philosophy at exactly the same time.

00:48:01.579 --> 00:48:05.170
In China it happens, in India it happens,
world religions arise.

00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:11.200
World religions arise largely as peace movements
against these empires that are using the coins

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:18.339
and people have talked about Axial Ages as
being characterized by a military coinage

00:48:18.339 --> 00:48:22.070
slavery complex, actually they say military
coinage, but I'll throw in slavery because

00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:27.340
the chattel slavery which isn't a major institution
either before or after, in Indian and Chinese

00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:32.200
history, for example, becomes really big in
just in this little slice of time.

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:36.070
People take these standing armies, they pay
them in cash.

00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:41.280
Alexander's Army for example I think it took
half a ton of silver a day to pay the army.

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.329
Where did they get the silver?

00:48:42.329 --> 00:48:46.430
Well the armies would besiege cities, take
lots of prisoners, enslave them, send to the

00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:49.099
mines, and they made more metal to feed the
army again.

00:48:49.099 --> 00:48:51.800
So, it became this giant cycle.

00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:55.869
So, coins are actually found pretty much where
armies are throughout the ancient world.

00:48:55.869 --> 00:49:00.670
In Rome it was in Italy, I mean, 90 percent
of all finds of Roman coins are in Italy and

00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:04.410
along the border where the armies were stationed.

00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:12.770
Alright, so Axial Age you have this rise of
world religions, they start as peace movements,

00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:19.160
there's this kind of mutual division of social
territory in a way because before you don't

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:21.480
really have impersonal markets, you have credit
markets.

00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:27.830
When you have impersonal markets based on
cash the idea is well, it's almost like saying,

00:49:27.830 --> 00:49:31.140
"Well, here's a space where, well just think
about material goods and getting as much of

00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:33.640
them for yourself as possible."

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:38.180
And it almost makes sense that if you do that
someone else will also say, "Alright and here's

00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:42.380
a space we'll call it religion where we think
about why material things are not important

00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:46.160
and why it's better to give than to receive,"
and charity and things like that always crop

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:50.980
up as an idea that never really existed before
as a conception in human history, exactly

00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:55.770
the same place as you get these impersonal
markets as part of these religions.

00:49:55.770 --> 00:50:01.030
So you get that but gradually the empires
come to a crisis, they start crumbling, they

00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:06.290
adopt the world religions, Confucianism in
China, Ashoka adopts Buddhism, Constantine

00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:10.640
goes for Christianity at exactly the moment
the empire's starting to fall apart, doesn't

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:13.420
really work, empires dissolve.

00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:19.760
And you get the Middle Ages where once the
armies, standing armies dissolve, all the

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:23.840
gold and silver basically gets put back in
churches and monasteries, people go back to

00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:28.980
credit systems and the world religions take
over the regulation of these large, elaborate

00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:30.030
credit systems.

00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:36.510
And so, for example, in the Middle East checks
are invented and widely used.

00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:41.111
Already in Basra around 800 or 900 people
were reporting majority of transactions in

00:50:41.111 --> 00:50:42.630
the marketplace are by check.

00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:45.990
Check is actually an Arab word meaning check.

00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.990
[chuckles]

00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:47.990
[laughter]

00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:53.540
Yeah, I always like to point out to people
when they talk about financial globalization

00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:55.470
as if this is somehow a new phenomena.

00:50:55.470 --> 00:51:02.310
Like, think about the terms "cash" and "checks,"
cash or a check, like, check is an Arab word

00:51:02.310 --> 00:51:07.480
meaning check and cash, well, has a double
etymology but one of them apparently is originally

00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:10.770
a Tamil for Chinese money.

00:51:10.770 --> 00:51:13.960
How did that happen?

00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:19.609
Alright, so you have this world where people
are going back to use of credit and we say,

00:51:19.609 --> 00:51:23.370
"Oh, in the Middle Ages, the Europe reverted
to barter."

00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:24.780
Not true.

00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:28.230
In fact, if you look at the records they're
not bartering things they're actually using

00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:30.640
money but they're using money that doesn't
physically exist.

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:34.890
So, they're still using Roman currency and
denominating everything in Roman currency

00:51:34.890 --> 00:51:40.040
until Charlemagne and then they're using Carolingian
currency.

00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:44.520
But the Carolingian currency only actually
exists for maybe 20 years and some of it doesn't

00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:45.520
exist at all.

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:49.040
It's like pounds, shillings, and pence originally
come from Charlemagne's system.

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:52.570
He never actually made pounds, he never got
around to it, but they were using it to measure

00:51:52.570 --> 00:51:55.470
things and they actually called this imaginary
money.

00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:58.700
So whatever the king was actually putting
out that was one thing, but you had this sort

00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:03.300
of ideal system which spanned Europe, everybody
knew what it was so you could trade and do

00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:06.119
it on the basis of this money that didn't
actually exist.

00:52:06.119 --> 00:52:11.390
And they even had a phenomena they used to
call crying up or crying down the currency.

00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:18.210
So a king could say, "Alright, whatever we're
using right now, it used to be 17 of these

00:52:18.210 --> 00:52:23.050
pennies were a shilling; I'm gonna change
it, now it'll be 13."

00:52:23.050 --> 00:52:26.560
If he--, so he could inflate the currency
if he was in debt or if he wanted to raise

00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:27.650
taxes he lowered it.

00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:33.540
So, he just rearranged whatever the currency
was being used which was only used for occasionally

00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:38.870
things because again most transactions were
on credit in relation to, or they could recall

00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:39.870
it.

00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:42.960
I mean, the king said, "Okay let's recall
the money and I'll give it back again next

00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:43.960
year."

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:47.000
And commerce would not stop because everything
was based on credit systems.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.599
Similarly in China they invent paper money
which originally comes out of the government

00:52:50.599 --> 00:52:57.339
taking credit instruments that people are
using and adopting it themselves.

00:52:57.339 --> 00:53:02.390
That's what they do in China anytime there's
innovation first they try to suppress it and

00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:05.829
they say, "Okay, okay we'll do it for you."

00:53:05.829 --> 00:53:10.319
So it's all privatized in the Islamic world
and it becomes public in China.

00:53:10.319 --> 00:53:14.140
Actually they are very opposite principles
but –

00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:15.319
[pause]

00:53:15.319 --> 00:53:21.490
in Islam, in particular, in this period, you
get the first real free market ideology.

00:53:21.490 --> 00:53:25.730
And this is a fascinating thing I mean a lot
of people will be very annoyed to learn this,

00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:32.740
but Adam Smith actually got most of his best
ideas and best lines from medieval Islam.

00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:39.070
Like the pin factory actually comes from al-Ghazali
in 1100 he had a needle factory.

00:53:39.070 --> 00:53:40.070
Okay.

00:53:40.070 --> 00:53:41.070
And it's made possible by what?

00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:46.920
By Sharia, because [chuckles] Sharia is civil
law that operates outside the purview of state,

00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:52.119
and, as a result, you can have markets and
since they get rid of usury, that's the other

00:53:52.119 --> 00:53:56.220
thing that happens, instead of debt cancellation,
which has continued in China but in other

00:53:56.220 --> 00:54:01.040
places they, instead, just get rid of interest
taking, it's illegal, debt peonage becomes

00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:02.040
illegal.

00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:06.589
And so in Islam, since they don't have that,
they can these markets that operate completely

00:54:06.589 --> 00:54:09.550
outside of the purview of the state and you
could write a check in Mali and cash it in

00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:12.300
Indonesia and it's all civil courts that take
care of it.

00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:16.390
So it's the first time you really get an idea
that markets run by themselves and don't really

00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:17.920
need governments.

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:25.099
But since they had a real free market which
isn't enforced by the state, they don't assume

00:54:25.099 --> 00:54:27.810
it's all about competition, that's like a
minor element.

00:54:27.810 --> 00:54:31.460
The assumption is that it's all really an
extension of mutual aid.

00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:37.040
Alright, so be this as it may you get that
world in the Middle Ages which looks surprisingly

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:38.880
good, slavery largely disappears.

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:43.310
I mean it's kind of rough in Western Europe
but Western Europe is kind of a barbarian

00:54:43.310 --> 00:54:44.310
backwater anyway.

00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:45.310
[chuckles]

00:54:45.310 --> 00:54:46.650
Alright, so what happens?

00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:54.040
Around 1450 it starts to go bad, then by 1492
you get the all this gold and silver coming

00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:55.040
in from America.

00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:58.810
As you go back to gold and silver currency,
slavery comes back in a big way, standing

00:54:58.810 --> 00:55:02.859
armies and giant empires come back in a big
way.

00:55:02.859 --> 00:55:05.470
And that's the period that's ending now;

00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:06.500
[pause]

00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:11.250
1971 is the date that most people set for
when we go off the gold standard and Nixon

00:55:11.250 --> 00:55:16.300
sort of takes the dollar off the gold standard
as this sort of key point of transition.

00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:22.369
And very rapidly after that you see a whole
series of changes.

00:55:22.369 --> 00:55:26.770
Of course, we get credit cards which hardly
anybody's using in '71, very quickly taking

00:55:26.770 --> 00:55:31.390
over so that you had cashless transactions
become the rule within a generation or two.

00:55:31.390 --> 00:55:36.599
You have financialization of capital, most
profits for American companies no longer come

00:55:36.599 --> 00:55:40.940
from making or selling anything, but largely
from financial speculation.

00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:48.670
You have credit's gonna save the world, microcredit
will save the Third World, 401k's and mortgages,

00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:50.750
all that stuff that blows up in 2008.

00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:53.961
And the question is why?

00:55:53.961 --> 00:55:56.490
Why it seems to have gone so horribly wrong?

00:55:56.490 --> 00:56:00.609
Because we have a series of terrible debt
crises, first the Third World debt crisis,

00:56:00.609 --> 00:56:03.450
now the debt crisis that's hitting everybody
other than the Third World right now --

00:56:03.450 --> 00:56:05.040
[pause]

00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:07.920
have happened ever since.

00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:12.930
And the reason, I would say, is because in
a way we're doing things backwards.

00:56:12.930 --> 00:56:17.430
If we do look at this in broad historical
perspective what we learn is that whenever

00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:23.460
you have a system of virtual money where people
don't assume that money is a thing but assume

00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:28.730
it's a promise, it's an IOU, it's a social
arrangement such as in ancient Mesopotamia,

00:56:28.730 --> 00:56:32.990
such as in the Middle Ages, well, you have
to set up some sort of mechanism to make sure

00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:35.140
the thing doesn't go crazy.

00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:40.380
Usually that means, invariably that means,
setting up some mechanism to protect debtors.

00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:44.800
So you could have periodic debt cancellation,
you can have anti-usury laws where interest

00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:50.309
taking is banned entirely and instead you
have profit sharing, there's a number of things

00:56:50.309 --> 00:56:51.640
you can do.

00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:56.470
Usually it's some giant overarching, cosmological
system beyond the purview of any state, whether

00:56:56.470 --> 00:57:03.680
it's sacred kings or biblical prophets, or
the world religions, canon law, Sharia.

00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:06.840
Be it as it may it has to be something big.

00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:11.140
Now we do set up giant, overarching institutions
like that nowadays but what do we do?

00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:14.280
We set up the IMF to protect creditors against
debtors.

00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:16.410
Basically, we did it backwards.

00:57:16.410 --> 00:57:20.940
S&amp;P all these other institutions like that
they come up with this idea that nobody should

00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:24.240
ever default which is absurd.

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:27.740
And sure enough we have endless series of
debt crises.

00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:33.310
In fact, I like to say I mean when I'm being
provocative, which is often, I like to say

00:57:33.310 --> 00:57:39.640
that that sort of idea that people had in
most of world history of the worse case scenarios

00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:44.130
everybody falls so deeply into debt that they
start having to sell themselves into slavery.

00:57:44.130 --> 00:57:47.040
It's like nightmare scenario, this is what
we always wanna prevent and that's why we

00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:48.040
have all these laws.

00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:53.260
Well, you know if Aristotle were here today
he would probably think that the distinction

00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:57.970
between being so indebted that you are selling
yourself to work for others all day long,

00:57:57.970 --> 00:58:02.010
12 hours a day, or being so indebted that
you are renting yourself to work for others

00:58:02.010 --> 00:58:05.380
all day long, 12 hours a day, as something
of a legalistic distinction.

00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:09.410
He would think this is it, this is the nightmare
debt trap and most people in the world are

00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:11.980
falling into it.

00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:16.030
But if you look at this in broad historical
terms, you'll also see that 30 years or 40

00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:22.520
years is nothing; we're talking about 500
year cycles here, and people are beginning

00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:24.450
to wake up to this.

00:58:24.450 --> 00:58:26.800
We still have time to get it right.

00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:33.920
And I think the social movements that are
coming out since 2008 around issues of debt

00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:37.369
are precisely recognizing that.

00:58:37.369 --> 00:58:43.349
If we're moving into a period of virtual money,
money is just a promise that we make to each

00:58:43.349 --> 00:58:48.360
other, it's just a set of IOU's and social
arraignments, arrangements; those can always

00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:49.360
be rearranged.

00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:56.040
Make a promise to someone, circumstances change,
you negotiate and the big players always do

00:58:56.040 --> 00:59:01.220
that with each other as we've discovered in
2008 when trillions of dollars of debt was

00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:05.130
made to disappear by the waving of various
types of magical wands.

00:59:05.130 --> 00:59:06.130
[chuckles]

00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:07.130
[laughter]

00:59:07.130 --> 00:59:13.059
So what people are saying is if democracy
is to mean anything now it means that everybody

00:59:13.059 --> 00:59:16.390
gets to weigh in on what sort of promises
are made, what sort of promises are kept,

00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:21.050
and when circumstances change what sort are
renegotiated and I think that's the political

00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:23.099
moment that we're in right now.

00:59:23.099 --> 00:59:24.099
[pause]

00:59:24.099 --> 00:59:25.099
[applause]

00:59:25.099 --> 00:59:26.099
[pause]

00:59:26.099 --> 00:59:29.550
Ah, a question, yes.

00:59:29.550 --> 00:59:46.130
&gt;&gt;Male #1: So when this, I have to say it's
fascinating and along the same lines, in this

00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:52.120
era if you have currency with runaway debt
explosions what, if I can ask you to speculate,

00:59:52.120 --> 01:00:00.390
what do you think would be a good way to look
at, what would be a good rate of risk, what

01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:04.330
would be a good pre-rate of return on investment
as an adjustment to?

01:00:04.330 --> 01:00:07.440
&gt;&gt;David Graeber: Risk free rate of return,
go on.

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:09.869
&gt;&gt;Male #1: If we had a fair society --

01:00:09.869 --> 01:00:10.869
&gt;&gt;David Graeber: Um-hum.

01:00:10.869 --> 01:00:15.369
&gt;&gt;Male #1: if you could define a fair society
by edict --

01:00:15.369 --> 01:00:16.960
&gt;&gt;David Graeber: Okay, I'm now the dictator.

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:24.500
&gt;&gt;Male #1: how, we used to have, you say we
used to have jubilees and cancel debts --

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.710
&gt;&gt;David Graeber: Um-hum.

01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:35.089
&gt;&gt;Male #1: so short of having a jubilee, debt
is a strange thing, somebody mentioned exactly

01:00:35.089 --> 01:00:37.660
if you have idle grain and it gets eaten by
rodents and slowly diminished and rots --

01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:38.680
&gt;&gt;David Graeber: Um-hum.

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:40.170
&gt;&gt;Male #1: but debt is funny because it accumulates
over time rather than --

01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:41.170
&gt;&gt;David Graeber: Yeah, um-hum.

01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:42.170
&gt;&gt;Male #1: diminishing over time.

01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:43.660
Would you argue for us having a negative free
rate of return on investment?

01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:45.960
&gt;&gt;David Graeber: I would argue actually --

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:48.280
&gt;&gt;Male #2: David, could you please repeat
the question?

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:49.900
&gt;&gt;David Graeber: The question, what's that?

01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:50.900
&gt;&gt;Male #3: [unintelligible]

01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:52.339
&gt;&gt;David Graeber: Oh I understand, yes.

01:00:52.339 --> 01:00:59.080
So the question is if I could dictate my own
economic policy what sort of rate of return

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:00.080
would I dictate?

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:07.980
A negative one such as occurred through natural
spoilage equivalent rather than imposing an

01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:10.150
idea that money necessarily has to grow.

01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:12.200
That's an interesting question.

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:17.859
I mean it's interesting that our entire sort
of perspective on what money should do and

01:01:17.859 --> 01:01:23.710
has to do goes back to arguments about this
in the Middle Ages.

01:01:23.710 --> 01:01:28.690
Since usury was illegal the way they got around
it was to come up with the notion of interest

01:01:28.690 --> 01:01:32.890
which was originally a late fee.

01:01:32.890 --> 01:01:36.470
So the idea is you're not paying interest,
you're not renting money which is wrong, you're

01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:40.840
just charging people for failure to return
it on the basis of the idea that money would

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:45.099
grow because this is all between merchants
at first, if you were investing it.

01:01:45.099 --> 01:01:48.800
So you can ask for five percent rate of return
because money would normally, you'd get about

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:51.320
a five percent investment rate.

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:57.310
And that five percent number has kind of stuck
with us, in a way, because it's about the

01:01:57.310 --> 01:02:03.960
number that like any economy is expected it
really ought to grow, if it doesn't there's

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:04.960
a problem.

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:12.640
And it's interesting it is exactly the amount
of the originally stipulated rate of return.

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:20.400
And there were usury laws until quite recent,
I guess 1980 they actually got rid of them,

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:26.700
which held it down to a fairly reasonable
rate or what was considered so at the time.

01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:30.730
I mean, myself, I actually do think a Jubilee
would be reasonable [chuckles] so in a way

01:02:30.730 --> 01:02:32.500
I would jump forward from this.

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:40.369
I end the book by throwing that out and I'm
a radical so I'm not gonna be like stipulating

01:02:40.369 --> 01:02:41.369
rates of return.

01:02:41.369 --> 01:02:45.059
I'm gonna say like we just need to wipe the
slate clean conceptually altogether and come

01:02:45.059 --> 01:02:47.190
up with a new way of thinking about the system.

01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:55.049
So I think a Jubilee is useful as an idea
because it, not only would it be nice because

01:02:55.049 --> 01:03:01.190
a lot of people could really us debt forgiveness
right now, a lot of the big players got it

01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:03.280
and everybody else didn't.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:08.520
But because it would allow us to reconceptualize
what we're doing here and realize that money

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:11.049
isn't what we thought it was.

01:03:11.049 --> 01:03:18.309
So what kind of system we'd come up with in
the wake of that, I've got a lot of ideas

01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:23.780
but I wanna leave that as open as possible
so I just sort of ended the book by saying

01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:28.870
rather than come up with a plan like that,
we just sort of create this sort of cataclysmic

01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:34.390
event which will sort of allow us to start
asking those questions.

01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:42.460
I've heard recently, I didn't know this, somebody
told me that the Boston Consulting Group which

01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:47.460
is guess if Jeffrey Sachs' people, ran a model
to see what would happen if they actually

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:51.030
did a Jubilee.

01:03:51.030 --> 01:03:58.069
And they said that it would cause severe economic
disruption but rather less than you would

01:03:58.069 --> 01:03:59.630
get if you don't have a Jubilee.

01:03:59.630 --> 01:04:00.630
[chuckles]

01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:01.630
[laughter]

01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:04.970
So either way we're screwed but you'd be a
little less screwed if we did it that way.

01:04:04.970 --> 01:04:08.700
So it turns out that it might not be a bad
idea.

01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:11.920
I mean I think that we should start thinking
about completely radically different forms

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:15.800
of money entirely.

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:19.099
Interest free systems would be possible.

01:04:19.099 --> 01:04:22.730
The reason why things like Islamic banking
don't work is because not everybody's doing

01:04:22.730 --> 01:04:23.730
it.

01:04:23.730 --> 01:04:28.790
If you force people to do profit sharing rather
than interest taking, if everybody did it,

01:04:28.790 --> 01:04:30.010
it would work.

01:04:30.010 --> 01:04:31.010
[pause]

01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:32.440
&gt;&gt;Male #3: One, two, three.

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:39.059
Is money [unintelligible] amount to the debt
we're seeing today, governmentally and personally

01:04:39.059 --> 01:04:43.900
in America and how it's all over the globe
at sometime [unintelligible]?

01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:45.680
&gt;&gt;David Graeber: Yeah it's really odd because
--

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:46.730
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Could you repeat the question?

01:04:46.730 --> 01:04:49.520
&gt;&gt;David Graeber: Yeah, okay me repeat the
question: is there any precedent for the sheer

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:51.010
amount of debt?

01:04:51.010 --> 01:04:57.380
I would say probably not but I mean unless
you wanna count the South Sea bubble or something

01:04:57.380 --> 01:04:58.540
like that.

01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:04.830
You do have these speculative crises that
crop up periodically, but the mystery is just

01:05:04.830 --> 01:05:09.750
how many people owe things to each other and
you have to start asking yourself, "Well,

01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:10.849
who's it all owed to?

01:05:10.849 --> 01:05:17.190
Everybody seems to be in debt, this is sort
of puzzling in a way."

01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:24.240
And I would say, no, and one reason why is
because there seems to be this feeling since

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:28.610
the 70's that basically all social problems
can be solved through debt.

01:05:28.610 --> 01:05:38.510
One theory I saw, which is kind of interesting,
it's the autonomist reading, Midnight Notes

01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:42.240
Collective, it's a group of Italian autonomist
Marxists.

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:45.109
But they had this very interesting reading
of the two phases of post-war capitalism.

01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:50.540
What they basically said is that after World
War II they kinda gave a deal to the North

01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:55.220
Atlantic white working class and they said,
"Okay, if you guys don't become commies we'll

01:05:55.220 --> 01:06:00.130
give you free education, free health care
in most places anyway, we'll give you social

01:06:00.130 --> 01:06:01.470
benefits of various kinds."

01:06:01.470 --> 01:06:07.240
And social struggles between 1945 and 1975
where more and more people asking in on the

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:08.240
deal.

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:11.410
And there is a tie between productivity and
wages.

01:06:11.410 --> 01:06:16.280
So whenever, and the lines go up together,
increases of productivity are met with increases

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:17.280
of wages.

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:21.490
Since the 70's the deal is clearly off and
one reason is because they reached kind of

01:06:21.490 --> 01:06:28.450
crisis of inclusion that you can't actually
give that deal to everybody without fundamentally

01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:30.200
changing the nature of the system.

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:34.260
So first minorities, so you have the Civil
Rights Movement, other people who've been

01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:38.859
left out of the deal want in, people in the
Global South want in, women want in, feminist

01:06:38.859 --> 01:06:39.859
movement.

01:06:39.859 --> 01:06:46.900
It reaches a point where it just sort of snaps
and you have this fiscal crisis, oil crunch,

01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:52.020
ecological crisis and they say, "Alright,
deal off, we'll give you another deal.

01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:58.609
No longer will wages be connected with productivity,
you can all have political rights because

01:06:58.609 --> 01:07:03.640
political rights don't necessarily give you
any economic benefits, but you can have credit."

01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:07.630
So the credit solves everything, everybody's
being, that's why you have microcredit saves

01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:12.290
the Third World, why you have 401k's and mortgages
and there's this huge extension of credit.

01:07:12.290 --> 01:07:15.150
And you could say the same thing happened,
right?

01:07:15.150 --> 01:07:20.030
More and more people want in on the deal and
more and more people are getting credit to

01:07:20.030 --> 01:07:24.579
the point where people they're just doing
these crazy sub-prime scams and things like

01:07:24.579 --> 01:07:27.069
that are beginning to run the system.

01:07:27.069 --> 01:07:30.920
And when it cracks it looks almost exactly
the same, you get the oil shock, you get the

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:33.829
financial crisis, you get the visions of ecological
catastrophe.

01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:39.110
It's the same thing all over again except
at this point it's not clear what they're

01:07:39.110 --> 01:07:41.630
[chuckles] gonna come up with next.

01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:48.160
So, in that sense, yeah, you have this unprecedented
series of bubbles, built on bubbles, built

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:49.230
on bubbles.

01:07:49.230 --> 01:07:53.540
And I'm speaking as someone who's working
the Global Justice Movement and we were like

01:07:53.540 --> 01:08:00.141
doing our studies for the G20 as part of like
several intellectual collectives where they

01:08:00.141 --> 01:08:03.950
kind of, the activists kind of told us, "Alright,
well, they're all meeting to come up with

01:08:03.950 --> 01:08:07.890
their evil plan and tell us what their evil
plan is likely to do so we can oppose it."

01:08:07.890 --> 01:08:14.140
And so we figure it and I guess they're gonna
have to do green capitalism, declare an emergency,

01:08:14.140 --> 01:08:17.069
we had various ideas for what would be a viable
solution.

01:08:17.069 --> 01:08:20.980
And they kept not doing it; they just fight
each other.

01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:23.959
In fact one of the reasons why the Global
Justice Movement fell into such a problem

01:08:23.959 --> 01:08:30.259
is, like, at least in 2000 we knew what their
evil plan was [laughs] and we could oppose

01:08:30.259 --> 01:08:31.259
it.

01:08:31.259 --> 01:08:34.369
And now they don't seem to be able to come
up with one, we had better ideas for their

01:08:34.369 --> 01:08:35.670
evil plan than they did.

01:08:35.670 --> 01:08:36.670
[chuckles]

01:08:36.670 --> 01:08:39.900
So we were sitting around and saying, "Well,
come on guys come up with your formula and

01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:41.389
we can fight you."

01:08:41.389 --> 01:08:44.819
And they wouldn't so they were sort of stuck
on this credit like bubble system that fell

01:08:44.819 --> 01:08:48.759
apart and they haven't quite come up with
what they're gonna do next.

01:08:48.759 --> 01:08:50.810
So I'm waitin'.

01:08:50.810 --> 01:08:51.810
[laughter]

01:08:51.810 --> 01:08:52.810
[pause]

01:08:52.810 --> 01:09:02.489
&gt;&gt;Male #4: So taking the other side of the
coin [unintelligible] extra help why should

01:09:02.489 --> 01:09:03.489
anybody pay their debt at all?

01:09:03.489 --> 01:09:04.489
&gt;&gt;David Graeber: Why should anybody pay debt
at all?

01:09:04.489 --> 01:09:09.029
Well, I mean you could say the same question
of all those guys who were bailed out, the

01:09:09.029 --> 01:09:12.409
bankers, I mean, moral hazard works on both
sides.

01:09:12.409 --> 01:09:13.409
[pause]

01:09:13.409 --> 01:09:16.114
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Well, I mean, it's the same case.

01:09:16.114 --> 01:09:17.114
&gt;&gt;David Graeber: Yeah, I mean --

01:09:17.114 --> 01:09:19.042
&gt;&gt;Male #4: I don't think that they should
have been helped either.

01:09:19.042 --> 01:09:20.042
&gt;&gt;David Graeber: Hum.

01:09:20.042 --> 01:09:24.469
Yeah I know a lot of people think that but
it's interesting that they got helped because

01:09:24.469 --> 01:09:28.549
as a lot of people point out all this mortgage
debt if they just paid off the mortgages that

01:09:28.549 --> 01:09:31.659
would have bailed out the banks in itself,
but they chose to give it to the banks and

01:09:31.659 --> 01:09:33.269
not to the mortgage holders.

01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:39.269
And this is a pattern that you do see throughout
world history is that debt means something

01:09:39.269 --> 01:09:42.900
totally different; depends on who it's between.

01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:48.309
When you have debt between two poor people
like somebody wants to make a loan to their

01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:52.779
brother, it's usually because they wanna give
them a gift but they don't wanna say that,

01:09:52.779 --> 01:09:54.880
save face, say it's a loan.

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:57.969
If he can pay you back, he will.

01:09:57.969 --> 01:10:03.599
Between equals, between people who know and
like and trust each other, debt is just a

01:10:03.599 --> 01:10:07.849
broad moral feeling that you should come through
for somebody.

01:10:07.849 --> 01:10:09.909
And between the big players it's the same,
too.

01:10:09.909 --> 01:10:12.260
I mean you see this all throughout history.

01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:16.869
Like, even the earliest Sumerian documents
you have people saying, "Oh well of course

01:10:16.869 --> 01:10:21.320
you're not gonna charge me interest because
we're both gentlemen," this sort of thing.

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:26.280
And when the big players are in trouble, debt
can always be renegotiated, too.

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:32.840
What seems to be sacred or treated as if it
were sacred is not debts between equals but

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:37.380
debts between the people on top and the people
on the bottom because all of a sudden it takes

01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:39.150
on a completely different color.

01:10:39.150 --> 01:10:43.679
So, yeah, I suppose you could come up with
a morality saying like, "Even equals should

01:10:43.679 --> 01:10:47.449
treat debt as exact [ inaudible ] quantifiable
and unforgivable."

01:10:47.449 --> 01:10:56.110
But it seems that you're not going to convince
people who actually like each other to not

01:10:56.110 --> 01:10:57.999
forgive each other when they're in trouble.

01:10:57.999 --> 01:11:05.809
Instead it seems more reasonable to expect
everybody to do it, apply that uniformly rather

01:11:05.809 --> 01:11:12.330
because that philosophy of debt as something
that can never be forgiven, as something that

01:11:12.330 --> 01:11:16.540
is sacred, really only crops up in situations
of sort of structural coercion of extreme

01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:17.540
inequality.

01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:18.540
[pause]

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:27.400
&gt;&gt;Male #5: How much of our sense of debt is
biological, how much of it is from society

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:28.400
and how much of it is regulatory?

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:29.989
&gt;&gt;David Graeber: Okay, so the question is
how much of our sense of debt is biological

01:11:29.989 --> 01:11:32.489
and how much of it is from society and how
much is regulatory.

01:11:32.489 --> 01:11:34.460
By regulatory you mean just sort of imposed
by --

01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:37.429
&gt;&gt;Male #5: In order to make everything work
right.

01:11:37.429 --> 01:11:39.090
&gt;&gt;David Graeber: Right, I see.

01:11:39.090 --> 01:11:46.769
Well I mean in terms of biological, my argument
in terms of biological instincts is it's not

01:11:46.769 --> 01:11:48.099
like they don't exist, clearly they do.

01:11:48.099 --> 01:11:52.039
I think it's pretty naive when people say,
"Oh we're just Tabula Rasa," written on by

01:11:52.039 --> 01:11:53.039
society.

01:11:53.039 --> 01:11:56.939
No, we're not, we have all sorts of urges,
but that I would emphasize the all sorts.

01:11:56.939 --> 01:12:02.789
Generally speaking in any situation we have
biological drives like making us do a thousand

01:12:02.789 --> 01:12:04.179
different contradictory things.

01:12:04.179 --> 01:12:08.939
So freedom is deciding which one to act on.

01:12:08.939 --> 01:12:13.869
In the book, I sort of map out three different
sort of ways of thinking about the morality

01:12:13.869 --> 01:12:19.540
of giving and taking of things, one of which
I call communism from each according to their

01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:22.760
ability to each according to their needs;
one of which I call exchange; and one of which

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:26.309
I call hierarchy.

01:12:26.309 --> 01:12:29.900
Exchange is based on principles of reciprocity,
but hierarchy is based not, on the opposite.

01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:33.439
It's like if you do something you're expected
to do it again.

01:12:33.439 --> 01:12:38.349
And all of these things are operative at any
moment and you could, like, call, and usually

01:12:38.349 --> 01:12:41.719
what you're doing is kind of a mix of these
different types of principles.

01:12:41.719 --> 01:12:48.760
So biologically and even that kind of fundamental
sociality, yeah, there is a degree to which

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:52.739
you're always gonna be able to think of things
in terms of debt, but it's never the only

01:12:52.739 --> 01:12:53.739
way.

01:12:53.739 --> 01:12:56.900
So you're always playing around with all these
sort of different ways you could frame it.

01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:58.030
And in terms of regulation –

01:12:58.030 --> 01:12:59.320
[pause]

01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:06.030
well, what's interesting is when you try to
justify things in the big picture very often

01:13:06.030 --> 01:13:09.179
that's when you fall back on language of debt
and reciprocity.

01:13:09.179 --> 01:13:16.039
You see this all the time dealing with feudal
lords in the Middles Ages.

01:13:16.039 --> 01:13:18.900
If you give somebody a gift you're expected
to do the same thing again next year.

01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:23.209
In fact you need a special document, like,
if I give a gift to a king I have to make

01:13:23.209 --> 01:13:26.139
him sign a paper saying I don't have to do
that next year because anything you do between

01:13:26.139 --> 01:13:29.150
unequals the precedent, you have to do it
again.

01:13:29.150 --> 01:13:34.820
However, then when they wanna talk about what
is justice, why is our society just, they'll

01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:40.800
say, "Well it's all reciprocity, lords fight
for everyone and priests pray for everyone

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:45.130
and peasants make food for everyone and it's
all this sort of equal swap."

01:13:45.130 --> 01:13:49.409
It's a completely, it has nothing to do with
the way things actually operate on the ground.

01:13:49.409 --> 01:13:55.749
Somebody might call this a sort of like overall
social regulatory or justification level where

01:13:55.749 --> 01:14:00.909
people are saying, nobody actually says, "Well,
you haven't really been fighting for me very

01:14:00.909 --> 01:14:05.769
much this year so I'm gonna give you less
food" [chuckles] or "You're prayer level is

01:14:05.769 --> 01:14:08.570
down or you've been praying more so we're
gonna give you more."

01:14:08.570 --> 01:14:12.019
It's nothing to do with the way people actually
interact but they like to think of this idea

01:14:12.019 --> 01:14:16.829
of debt and reciprocity as a language to justify
social relations that often operate on completely

01:14:16.829 --> 01:14:17.829
different principles.

01:14:17.829 --> 01:14:18.829
[pause]

01:14:18.829 --> 01:14:19.829
Uh, yes.

01:14:19.829 --> 01:14:20.829
&gt;&gt;Male #6: I live in San Francisco and there's
14,000 people since 2008 who have either had

01:14:20.829 --> 01:14:21.829
their houses foreclosed or are in the process
--

01:14:21.829 --> 01:14:22.829
&gt;&gt;David Graeber: Um-hum.

01:14:22.829 --> 01:14:25.459
&gt;&gt;Male #6: as a [unintelligible] houses [unintelligible]
mortgages paid.

01:14:25.459 --> 01:14:27.679
&gt;&gt;David Graeber: Um-hum.

01:14:27.679 --> 01:14:32.110
&gt;&gt;Male #6: and in Northern California.

01:14:32.110 --> 01:14:44.659
Are there historical precedents or what would
it look like to build a movement for a Jubilee

01:14:44.659 --> 01:14:49.830
to relieve our debt instead of bankers?

01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:53.449
&gt;&gt;David Graeber: Well there's a huge history
of that.

01:14:53.449 --> 01:14:54.929
Peter Linebaugh has --

01:14:54.929 --> 01:14:55.929
&gt;&gt;Male #7: Could you repeat the question?

01:14:55.929 --> 01:14:58.860
&gt;&gt;David Graeber: Oh I'm sorry, the question
is, there's massive foreclosures going on

01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:03.199
here in California including San Francisco,
people are being kicked out of their homes

01:15:03.199 --> 01:15:07.280
by banks that have themselves been bailed
out by the public including those people who've

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:12.469
been kicked out from their homes and what
would it take to create a mass movement?

01:15:12.469 --> 01:15:15.400
Are there historical precedents for that?

01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:17.360
The answer is yeah.

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:22.679
As I say the vast majority of social movements
that have existed in history have been about

01:15:22.679 --> 01:15:23.679
debt.

01:15:23.679 --> 01:15:29.090
There have been debt strikes, there have been
seizing and destroying the records which of

01:15:29.090 --> 01:15:35.249
course electronically is now harder to do.

01:15:35.249 --> 01:15:43.179
In the Depression there was a systematic policy
of disrupting sales when they'd foreclose

01:15:43.179 --> 01:15:47.999
on farms all the farmers in the neighborhood
would show up at the auction with guns and

01:15:47.999 --> 01:15:53.230
somebody would bid one dollar [chuckles] and
no dared to say anything else and they'd give

01:15:53.230 --> 01:15:55.809
it back to the farmer again.

01:15:55.809 --> 01:16:00.320
So there is a [chuckles] huge amount of precedent
for that sort thing, but you can never do

01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:02.849
it the same way twice.

01:16:02.849 --> 01:16:08.860
The problem with organizing debtors politically
is that debt is very alienating; it's must

01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:11.530
easier to organize people when you have a
bunch of farmers in a neighborhood they know

01:16:11.530 --> 01:16:12.690
each other.

01:16:12.690 --> 01:16:17.849
But what we have now is most people who have
student loan debt, mortgage debt, don't actually

01:16:17.849 --> 01:16:22.440
know people in the same situation or people
are even ashamed to admit it.

01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:27.439
There's really no forum in which people can
compare notes and come up with common strategies.

01:16:27.439 --> 01:16:31.959
So one strategy that people have been using
has been some sort of pledge, some people

01:16:31.959 --> 01:16:38.070
are doing a student loan project where they're
saying, "Alright, if we get a million signatures

01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:40.710
we'll all stop paying simultaneously."

01:16:40.710 --> 01:16:46.110
But it has to be something like that because
it's very, very difficult to build, you're

01:16:46.110 --> 01:16:50.060
taking such a risk when you default or when
you threaten to.

01:16:50.060 --> 01:16:54.150
You're taking such a risk that it's very difficult
to do that based on trust of other people

01:16:54.150 --> 01:16:55.349
you don't know.

01:16:55.349 --> 01:16:56.349
[pause]

01:16:56.349 --> 01:17:02.320
So that's the question how you organize people
to be and what to do.

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:03.320
Um --

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:04.320
&gt;&gt;Male presenter: commentator: Let's take
one more question and then we have stuff to

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:05.320
do.

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:06.320
&gt;&gt;David Graeber: Okay you can decide who then.

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:07.320
[laughter]

01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:08.320
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Is there [unintelligible] how
debt is handled for those who are [unintelligible]

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:26.080
and those who are not such parents and children,
such as very traditionally men and women?

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:28.769
&gt;&gt;David Graeber: Okay, the question is in
traditional societies or other societies are

01:17:28.769 --> 01:17:34.059
their differences between how debt is handled
in the paid labor force and unpaid relations

01:17:34.059 --> 01:17:35.059
like --

01:17:35.059 --> 01:17:36.300
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Like the debt between those two
groups.

01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:39.030
&gt;&gt;David Graeber: Debts, oh, oh, how debt between.

01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:40.919
So you're talking, give me an example.

01:17:40.919 --> 01:17:42.809
&gt;&gt;Female #1: What children owe their parents
--

01:17:42.809 --> 01:17:44.320
&gt;&gt;David Graeber: Which I thought you meant
that.

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:45.320
&gt;&gt;Female #1: or before you could only work
inside the home you couldn't really [unintelligible]

01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:48.810
go outside of that [unintelligible].

01:17:48.810 --> 01:18:02.460
&gt;&gt;David Graeber: Right so how do you deal
with the relationship between, right, debts

01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:07.840
between people within a household or where
there's a community of property between you

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:08.840
and outsiders?

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:14.219
It's an interesting question because, in fact,
it's a perfect example of what I was talking

01:18:14.219 --> 01:18:19.150
about how we try to frame everything in terms
of exchange or some need to do so, even things

01:18:19.150 --> 01:18:21.429
that don't work that way at all.

01:18:21.429 --> 01:18:26.699
And the other point that I was making about
how we try to frame things morally in terms

01:18:26.699 --> 01:18:27.699
of debt.

01:18:27.699 --> 01:18:33.099
'Cause you'll often find people saying, "Well,
this is how we repay our parents for the pains

01:18:33.099 --> 01:18:35.800
of childbirth and what they do."

01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:40.770
But in almost every case it's a metaphor,
it has nothing to do with how people actually

01:18:40.770 --> 01:18:42.169
related to each other.

01:18:42.169 --> 01:18:47.820
So often when you see how people are actually
interacting it's on a principle that has nothing

01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:50.889
to do with debt, you're not calculating equivalents
at all.

01:18:50.889 --> 01:18:55.119
But then when you want to think about it in
a bigger picture, suddenly you're trying to

01:18:55.119 --> 01:18:57.329
figure out some way to say it's all about
debt.

01:18:57.329 --> 01:19:01.780
So I actually use this story about this famous
Canadian naturalist whose father presented

01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:05.940
him with a bill for everything he owed him
up to the age of 21.

01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:09.760
He said, "Okay, here's how much it cost to
pay the doctor to deliver you, here's your

01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:10.969
primary education."

01:19:10.969 --> 01:19:17.130
He had it all worked out and he gave him the
bill and the guy paid it and said, "Fine,

01:19:17.130 --> 01:19:20.070
the hell with you, I'm never going to speak
to you again," and walked off.

01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:24.749
But that's what it basically means because
when you're paying a debt it implies we need

01:19:24.749 --> 01:19:26.900
have no further relations.

01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:32.229
So the idea of actually paying a debt between
people that you love is utterly insulting;

01:19:32.229 --> 01:19:35.780
you'd only do it if you really wanna have
nothing further to do with each other.

01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:38.539
But nonetheless people like to frame it in
those terms.

01:19:38.539 --> 01:19:43.829
One of the most fascinating concepts I discovered
when researching this was the notion of the

01:19:43.829 --> 01:19:45.590
milk debt.

01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:49.409
This is a medieval Chinese Buddhist concept.

01:19:49.409 --> 01:19:53.990
What they did was they calculated what they
thought was the exact number of pecks of milk

01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:59.539
you absorb from your mother [chuckles] in
the first years of your life and that's a

01:19:59.539 --> 01:20:08.030
fundamental debt you owe to your mother and
said, "Okay, you owe exactly 37 pecks of milk."

01:20:08.030 --> 01:20:15.260
But then they would say, "Alright, to pay
back even like one day's worth of milk would

01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:19.619
in fact take 400,000 years of feeding her
off your own personal flesh.

01:20:19.619 --> 01:20:26.119
[laughs] I mean so it was a way of saying,
"You could not conceivably pay this debt."

01:20:26.119 --> 01:20:28.449
So why are they calculating as a debt at all?

01:20:28.449 --> 01:20:32.159
It's again that same tension if you wanna
frame debt as morality and they say they're

01:20:32.159 --> 01:20:35.780
the same thing, but as soon as you do you
say, "Except not really, it's completely ridiculous

01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:37.949
isn't it?"

01:20:37.949 --> 01:20:43.561
So that tension like the need to pretend that
it's a debt but then once you say it, like,

01:20:43.561 --> 01:20:44.561
it's actually not a debt at all.

01:20:44.561 --> 01:20:50.110
It's absurd to even think of a debt, why are
we saying this, recurs over and over and over

01:20:50.110 --> 01:20:51.110
again.

01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:54.709
And it's because commerce gives us this idea
that we wanna frame everything in commercial

01:20:54.709 --> 01:21:00.480
terms, that we really ought to, that we start
doing that and then we say, "No, actually,

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:01.480
we can't."

01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:02.480
[pause]

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:04.650
