he just doesn't know that it's foolish
and idiotic uh I will say this that I

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:03.860
and idiotic uh I will say this that I
 

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.040
and idiotic uh I will say this that I
think this used to I see this coming up

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:06.050
think this used to I see this coming up
 

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:08.740
think this used to I see this coming up
more and more in stuff where it's like

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:08.750
more and more in stuff where it's like
 

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:10.900
more and more in stuff where it's like
because the mindset before I think at

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:10.910
because the mindset before I think at
 

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:12.610
because the mindset before I think at
least I know when I was growing up there

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:12.620
least I know when I was growing up there
 

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.159
least I know when I was growing up there
so we sorted this mindset of if I try

00:08:15.159 --> 00:08:15.169
so we sorted this mindset of if I try

you so much you know that sort of
 

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:24.880
you so much you know that sort of
mindset and I think that probably came

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:24.890
mindset and I think that probably came
 

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:27.310
mindset and I think that probably came
from like a lot of programming growing

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:27.320

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.890
that more clear may because there have
been so many years of you know just

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:09.900
been so many years of you know just
 

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.110
been so many years of you know just
looking at a person as a prize you know
