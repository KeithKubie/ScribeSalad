00:00:10.218 --> 00:00:13.647
Flying through the night, 
I watch over this world,

00:00:13.647 --> 00:00:22.686
a silent guardian, a watchful protector,
a dark knight, I'm...

00:00:22.686 --> 00:00:25.884
Okay, fine. So, I'm not Batman.
I'm just a bat.

00:00:25.884 --> 00:00:28.933
But like Batman, I'm often misunderstood.

00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:31.712
People think I'm scary, 
strange and dangerous.

00:00:31.712 --> 00:00:36.841
If they only knew my story, though,
I'd be cheered as a hero.

00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:38.276
When people think of bats,

00:00:38.276 --> 00:00:41.602
many think of vampires 
who want to suck their blood.

00:00:41.602 --> 00:00:44.459
But the truth is 
that out of over 1200 bat species,

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:47.500
only three are vampire bats.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.678
Out of these three, 
only one prefers the blood of mammals,

00:00:50.678 --> 00:00:54.462
and even these bats mostly feed on cattle.

00:00:54.462 --> 00:00:56.425
Maybe that still doesn't seem so great,

00:00:56.425 --> 00:01:00.540
but vampire bats 
can be a great help to humans.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.506
A chemical known as desmoteplase 
found in vampire bat saliva

00:01:04.506 --> 00:01:06.517
helps break down blood clots,

00:01:06.517 --> 00:01:10.925
and is being tested 
by recovering stroke victims.

00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:16.339
Of the remaining 1000+ species of bats, 
about 70% feed on insects.

00:01:16.339 --> 00:01:19.014
These bats help control 
the real vampires:

00:01:19.014 --> 00:01:22.384
mosquitos, whose nasty bites
are not just annoying

00:01:22.384 --> 00:01:25.706
but spread diseases, like West Nile virus.

00:01:25.706 --> 00:01:29.955
A single little brown bat 
can eat 1000 insects every hour,

00:01:29.955 --> 00:01:34.587
and a colony of Mexican free-tailed bats 
can eat several tons of moths

00:01:34.587 --> 00:01:36.423
in just one night.

00:01:36.423 --> 00:01:37.727
In the United States alone,

00:01:37.727 --> 00:01:41.559
bats provide an estimated 
3.7 billion dollars worth

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:44.072
of free pest control for farmers,

00:01:44.072 --> 00:01:47.547
which benefits everyone 
who eats the foods that they grow.

00:01:47.547 --> 00:01:51.231
Fruit bats, also called megabats 
because of their large size,

00:01:51.231 --> 00:01:54.656
are important for the role 
they play in plant pollination.

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:58.138
By traveling between flowers 
while feeding on nectar and fruits,

00:01:58.138 --> 00:02:02.791
these bats transport the pollen 
and seeds that help plants reproduce.

00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:04.402
In Southeast Asia, for example,

00:02:04.402 --> 00:02:09.396
the cave nectar bat is the only pollinator
of the durian fruit.

00:02:09.396 --> 00:02:11.716
Other bats pollinate peaches, bananas,

00:02:11.716 --> 00:02:15.131
and the agave plants 
that tequila is made from.

00:02:15.131 --> 00:02:15.880
Without them,

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.214
many of our food plants would be unable 
to produce the tasty fruits we enjoy.

00:02:20.214 --> 00:02:25.821
As heroes of the ecosystem, 
bats have their own unique utility belts.

00:02:25.821 --> 00:02:29.245
Bats have been a source of inspiration 
for the design of flying robots

00:02:29.245 --> 00:02:32.297
and even an energy-efficient spy plane,

00:02:32.297 --> 00:02:39.146
as they are the only mammal 
capable of true powered flight.

00:02:39.146 --> 00:02:44.520
Echolocation, a type of biological sonar,
is also used by bats as a way to navigate

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.798
and find prey in the dark.

00:02:46.798 --> 00:02:49.670
Although there's a common 
misconception that bats are blind,

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.539
in truth, all species of bats have sight.

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:57.489
And some have even adapted 
large eyes to see better in dim lighting.

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.374
Many people worry 
about getting infected by bats,

00:03:00.374 --> 00:03:04.260
and like any other animals,
bats can carry diseases, like rabies.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.813
In reality, though, less than .5% of all bats
carry this virus.

00:03:09.813 --> 00:03:13.216
That's about the same odds as getting 
the same result on a coin flip

00:03:13.216 --> 00:03:19.045
eight times in a row.

00:03:19.045 --> 00:03:21.169
The perception that bats 
are often diseased

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:23.323
may come from the fact that sick bats,

00:03:23.323 --> 00:03:26.813
who may show unusual behavior, 
emerge during the daytime,

00:03:26.813 --> 00:03:28.672
or be unable to fly,

00:03:28.672 --> 00:03:31.408
are more likely to be 
encountered by people.

00:03:31.408 --> 00:03:34.966
So a good way to protect yourself 
is to protect bats as well,

00:03:34.966 --> 00:03:37.334
keeping them healthy,
protecting their habitats,

00:03:37.334 --> 00:03:40.997
and reducing their risk 
of transmitting disease.

00:03:40.997 --> 00:03:44.338
In North America, bats are threatened 
by a devastating sickness

00:03:44.338 --> 00:03:46.760
called white-nose syndrome.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.293
This fungal infection 
causes bats to wake up

00:03:49.293 --> 00:03:51.474
while hibernating during a winter.

00:03:51.474 --> 00:03:54.571
Unable to find food, 
they expend large amounts of energy,

00:03:54.571 --> 00:03:57.064
and eventually starve to death.

00:03:57.064 --> 00:04:00.376
White-nose syndrome has wiped out
entire caves full of bats,

00:04:00.376 --> 00:04:04.231
with a mortality rate that can exceed 90%.

00:04:04.231 --> 00:04:05.935
Climate change and habitat destruction

00:04:05.935 --> 00:04:08.780
also pose serious threats 
to bat populations.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.535
For example, in January 2014,
a record heat wave in Australia

00:04:13.535 --> 00:04:18.095
caused over 100,000 bats 
to die from heat exhaustion.

00:04:18.095 --> 00:04:20.519
Some people just want 
to watch the world burn,

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.264
and bats all over the world are threatened
by damage to the places that we call home,

00:04:25.264 --> 00:04:26.647
including mangrove swamps,

00:04:26.647 --> 00:04:28.284
old-growth forests,

00:04:28.284 --> 00:04:31.337
and, of course, bat caves.

00:04:31.337 --> 00:04:35.636
So even though I'm the hero of the story,
I do need to be saved.

00:04:35.636 --> 00:04:38.051
And now that you know 
the true story about us bats,

00:04:38.051 --> 00:04:40.992
you can learn how to protect 
such heroic animals.

00:04:40.992 --> 00:04:44.218
Install a properly designed bat box,

00:04:44.218 --> 00:04:47.388
one of the easiest ways 
to provide shelter for bats.

00:04:47.388 --> 00:04:50.278
Discourage the use of pesticides,
which can harm bats

00:04:50.278 --> 00:04:54.451
when we try to feed on the insects 
you want to get rid of in the first place.

00:04:54.451 --> 00:04:57.967
Avoid going into caves 
where you might disturb hibernating bats,

00:04:57.967 --> 00:05:02.000
and always decontaminate 
your gear after visiting a cave.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.917
If you have unwanted bats 
living in an attic or barn,

00:05:04.917 --> 00:05:09.233
contact your local government 
to safely and humanely relocate us.

00:05:09.233 --> 00:05:12.615
And if you come across a bat, 
do not attempt to handle it,

00:05:12.615 --> 00:05:16.934
but instead, call Animal Control.

00:05:16.934 --> 00:05:19.768
Batman might want to keep 
his identity secret,

00:05:19.768 --> 00:05:23.727
but a great way to help real bats
is by continuing to learn about them

00:05:23.727 --> 00:05:27.432
and spreading the truth 
that they are real heroes,

00:05:27.432 --> 00:05:30.554
even if their good deeds are often unseen.
