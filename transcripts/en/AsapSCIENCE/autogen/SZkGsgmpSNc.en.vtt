00:00:00.501 --> 00:00:05.661
 With work, study or any table full of stress it will be difficult to find time or energy 

00:00:05.661 --> 00:00:10.631
 For an extra round in the bedroom - to practice love - but can science have a solution to our sexual problems? 

00:00:10.631 --> 00:00:12.021
 Maybe he can ... 

00:00:12.021 --> 00:00:16.550
 Sexual desire in women and men is controlled by hormones, when it drives you 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.980
 Something to be "stimulated", sends both brain and nervous system signals to the pelvic area, causing 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.431
 Aneurysms, heart rate will increase, your brain will release hormones: 

00:00:25.431 --> 00:00:29.790
 Norepinephrine, dopamine and other neurotransmitters 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.821
 Your body will understand that you are having fun. 

00:00:31.821 --> 00:00:37.011
 Man has long tried to improve this biological response throughout history. Unfortunately 

00:00:37.011 --> 00:00:41.531
 There is no scientific evidence in popular culture that oysters or chocolate 

00:00:41.531 --> 00:00:46.211
 Or other so-called "sexual arousal stimuli" will make you sexually motivated, Viagra can prolong erection 

00:00:46.211 --> 00:00:51.181
 Contrary to the popular belief that it will make you feel. Viagra works 

00:00:51.181 --> 00:00:55.891
 Slowly to inhibit a certain enzyme and thus will increase blood flow to the penis and it works on 

00:00:55.891 --> 00:01:00.501
 Peripheral nervous system only. So taking a blue pill will not increase libido 

00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:06.471
 An erection will not occur without prior stimulation. Needless to say, it has no effect on women. 

00:01:06.471 --> 00:01:11.051
 But it turns out that scientists have mistakenly found a new secret about sex ... 

00:01:11.051 --> 00:01:15.771
 During the attempts to create industrialization agents, scientists studied melanocortin 

00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:21.611
 - A specific protein in the brain that can control the coloration of the skin - when injecting ten milligrams of an industrial version of it called melanotane 2 

00:01:21.611 --> 00:01:27.151
 In male, an erection will occur immediately and without stimulation 

00:01:27.151 --> 00:01:33.921
 And will remain for eight hours continuous accompanied by nausea and vomiting, at 2.5 mg 

00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:40.001
 The erection lasted from two to three hours with little nausea but when the dose was 1.25 mg 

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:44.781
 The males were sexually aroused and had a steady erection without any nausea, from the sudden 

00:01:44.781 --> 00:01:49.091
 It has been approved by the government drug to be taken by nasal spray "stimulation by sniffing" any one? 

00:01:49.091 --> 00:01:52.791
 Moreover, the drug works on females as well. 

00:01:52.791 --> 00:01:57.841
 When a female rat was injected along with some methylated beta-estradiol 3 benzoate hormones 

00:01:57.841 --> 00:02:02.861
 Along with progesterone, females increased their jumping, throwing love arrows and moving their ears in front of their male counterparts. 

00:02:02.861 --> 00:02:07.330
 All these signs are designed to create sexual desire and to invite males to have sex. 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.130
 But before you go on to find this magical miraculous love you have to learn 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.240
 That it has not been ratified or legislated anywhere in the world yet, anyway 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.111
 One of its derivatives, called pralmanotide, is currently being tested in human clinical trials as a possible treatment. 

00:02:21.111 --> 00:02:26.021
 When there is a large sexual deficit such as failure to occur sexual desire in females. 

00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:30.011
 When the main event occurs directly in the central nervous system it works on both sexes. 

00:02:30.011 --> 00:02:31.061
 Gender. 

00:02:31.061 --> 00:02:35.871
 You can eat avocados, oysters or chocolate as sources of nutrition only ... and let the science take over sex. 

00:02:35.871 --> 00:02:36.811
 Sex. 

00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:40.281
