- I was running through
the 6 with my woes.

00:00:04.937 --> 00:00:05.871 line:0%
Do you know what that means?

00:00:05.871 --> 00:00:07.373
The 6 is an area in Toronto.

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:08.408 line:0%
And woes...

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:09.575 line:0%
I'm James Davis.

00:00:09.575 --> 00:00:11.043 line:0%
And this is Swagasaurus.

00:00:11.043 --> 00:00:12.078 line:0%
Woes means your crew.

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:13.546 line:0%
Your woes are your squad.

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:15.414 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
When you first hear Drake
claiming he was with his woes

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:18.051 line:0%
it's easy to assume something
sad or woeful is going on.

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:19.919 align:start size:84% position:16%
Maybe he's just being
Emo Drake again.

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:21.721
Maybe woes is just
a personification

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:22.955
of the rapper's emotions.

00:00:22.955 --> 00:00:24.557
But really, the word stands for

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:27.727 align:start size:84% position:16%
working on excellence
and represents a
brand of friendship.

00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:29.062 align:start size:81% position:19%
Woes aren't merely
acquaintances.

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:30.729
Your woes aren't just
any group of buddies.

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:32.632
Woes are stand up individuals

00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:34.266
who are primed to
accomplish goals

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.567
and win as a team.

00:00:35.567 --> 00:00:36.803
Just because you're in
a class with someone

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:38.237 align:start size:84% position:16%
or you're friends
with him on Facebook

00:00:38.237 --> 00:00:39.772
doesn't make them a woe.

00:00:39.772 --> 00:00:40.740
To be someone's woe,

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.975
you all have to be tight

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:44.043
and have a history
or significant bond.

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:46.079
Matt Damon and Ben
Affleck, they woes.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.047
Hell, Ben and Jerry,
the ice cream guys

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:49.415
they got to be woes too

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:51.117 align:start size:81% position:19%
cause their ice
cream is on fleek!

00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:54.120
Jed Apatow, Seth Rogen,
Jonah Hill, James Franco,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.788
they're each other's
woes and all they do

00:00:55.788 --> 00:00:58.490 align:start size:84% position:16%
is make funny movies
with their woes.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:59.826
And you know how that shit goes.

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:01.294
I'm starting to feel like

00:01:01.294 --> 00:01:03.429 align:start size:97% position:3%
everyone who checks out
Swagasaurus with me is my woe.

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:04.330
We hang out.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.164
We talk about women.

00:01:05.164 --> 00:01:05.999
We stare at my jacket.

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.833
It's amazing.

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:07.667
It's friendship.

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:08.600
It's woeship.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.835
I couldn't do this without you.

00:01:09.835 --> 00:01:11.404
I can't wait to holler
at all my woes next week

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:12.439
with a brand new word.

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:13.473
And remember,

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:15.809
you're my woe.
