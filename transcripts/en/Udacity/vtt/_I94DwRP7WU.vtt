00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.520
For Flick Finder, we'll be utilizing
the flickr.photos.search method

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.290
of the Flickr API.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.860
This method allows us to search for
images using a text string, or for

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.320
images that are geo-tagged
near a certain latitude and

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.900
longitude, amongst other things.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.190
Of all the methods in the Flickr API,

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.160
this one probably has
the most possibly arguments.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.940
But luckily for us,
we'll only need a few.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.890
Let's start with the arguments
we'll need for a text search.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.080
The only required argument of
course is the API key, but

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.369
the next argument of interest is called,
text.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.004
The text argument is used to find images
that have a title, a description or

00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:39.886
tags containing a text
value that we provide.

00:00:39.886 --> 00:00:41.140
If we continue down,

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.010
the next argument that we're
going to use is called safe_search.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.260
What safe_ search will allow us to
do is to filter results to show

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.890
only images containing
content that's deemed safe.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.540
The remaining arguments are ones
that we've previously used in

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.260
the Sleeping In The L ibrary app, and

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.580
I'll show them all in
the API explorer now.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.000
So for text I'm going to
enter the Atlanta Braves,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.489
which is my favorite baseball team.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.560
And then for safe_search, I'll enter 1.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.990
And the last argument I'm
going to specify is for extras.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.180
Again, we need to use
the url_m value in extras so

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.000
that we get urls for
medium images in the results.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.160
And before we call this method,
let's change the output type to JSON.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.170
And it looks like there are thousands
of photos for the Braves.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.720
Let's just pick one.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.840
I'll copy the URL into
the address bar and

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.450
remove the backslash characters
that were added by Flickr.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.430
Remember these backslashes will get
removed when we create NS URLs.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.800
And there we go, this is
a picture actually of the Brave's

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.800
new baseball stadium that's being
built in Cobb County, Georgia.
