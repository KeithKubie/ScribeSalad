Managing focus when you navigate
on the page is really important.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.550
But sometimes you'll need to manage
focus at the component level as well,

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.570
especially if you're building
a complex custom widget.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.460
To show you what I mean, take a look
at this native select tag and

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.450
notice how I can focus it.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.470
And once there, I can use the arrow
keys to expose additional functionality,

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.098
like selecting different options.

00:00:23.098 --> 00:00:26.850
If you were building a custom
select element yourself or

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.810
something similar like a drop-down,

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.030
you would need to expose these same
kinds of behaviors so that your users

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.170
who rely primarily on the keyboard
could still interact with your control.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.040
Now knowing which keyboard behaviors
to implement can be a bit of a guessing

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.950
game but, thankfully there's a really
helpful guide which you can refer to.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.760
The ARIA design pattern stock,
lists various kinds of components

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.670
as well as the sorts of keyboard
interactions that they support.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.420
Now, Alice is going to cover ARIA in
more detail in the following sections,

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.360
but for now, let's use this guide
to help us add keyboard support

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.910
to a new component which
we're going to build.
