00:00:02.514 --> 00:00:03.483
- [Instructor] What we're going to do

00:00:03.483 --> 00:00:07.130
in this video is think about
all of the different ways

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.695
that a supply curve or
a demand curve can shift

00:00:10.695 --> 00:00:13.004
and that's why we actually
have eight versions

00:00:13.004 --> 00:00:15.562
of the exact same diagram.

00:00:15.562 --> 00:00:17.204
Each of them is showing

00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:20.181
where we are right now,
let's say in a given region

00:00:20.181 --> 00:00:22.177
in the ice cream market.

00:00:22.177 --> 00:00:24.080
It's important to title your graphs,

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.085
especially if you were taking some type

00:00:25.085 --> 00:00:28.005
of a standardized exam like an AP exam

00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:29.595
and in the vertical axis

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:31.410
we have P representing price,

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.779
and then the horizontal axis,
Q representing quantity,

00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:37.204
we have our upwards sloping supply curve.

00:00:37.204 --> 00:00:40.504
I'm calling this S1 just as
kind of our starting point

00:00:40.504 --> 00:00:44.143
and then we have our downwards
sloping demand curve, D1

00:00:44.143 --> 00:00:45.566
and where they intersect,

00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:48.921
that gives us our equilibrium price, P1

00:00:48.921 --> 00:00:51.611
and our equilibrium quantity, Q1

00:00:51.611 --> 00:00:52.657
and once again, if you were taking

00:00:52.657 --> 00:00:53.965
some type of a standardized test,

00:00:53.965 --> 00:00:55.923
it's important that you
label all of these things

00:00:55.923 --> 00:00:57.325
including P1 and Q1

00:00:57.325 --> 00:00:59.317
and show this dotted line

00:00:59.317 --> 00:01:01.100
where it intersects the horizontal axis,

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.606
this is Q1 and where it
intersects the vertical axis,

00:01:03.606 --> 00:01:04.744
it is P1.

00:01:04.744 --> 00:01:06.216
Now with that out of the way,

00:01:06.216 --> 00:01:09.867
let's think about what happens
to the equilibrium price

00:01:09.867 --> 00:01:11.173
and the equilibrium quantity

00:01:11.173 --> 00:01:14.003
given different shifts in the supply

00:01:14.003 --> 00:01:17.258
or the demand curve or both of them.

00:01:17.258 --> 00:01:19.197
So, in this first scenario,

00:01:19.197 --> 00:01:21.663
let's imagine that all of a sudden

00:01:21.663 --> 00:01:24.413
a major ice cream producer enters

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:26.922
into the market,

00:01:26.922 --> 00:01:29.701
so here we're going to this first one,

00:01:29.701 --> 00:01:30.757
we're gonna think about a situation

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:32.962
where the supply goes up.

00:01:32.962 --> 00:01:34.402
So, one way to think about it

00:01:34.402 --> 00:01:36.383
is at any given price,

00:01:36.383 --> 00:01:40.260
people are willing to
supply more quantity,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.427
so here we would have our
supply curve shift to the right,

00:01:45.713 --> 00:01:48.546
I'll call this S2 right over here,

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.947
it's shifting to the right and down

00:01:51.947 --> 00:01:52.914
and so, given this,

00:01:52.914 --> 00:01:54.634
what happens to our equilibrium price

00:01:54.634 --> 00:01:57.442
and our equilibrium quantity?

00:01:57.442 --> 00:01:59.175
Well, you see it right over here.

00:01:59.175 --> 00:02:01.978
If I draw a dotted line,

00:02:01.978 --> 00:02:05.958
we see our equilibrium price P2 is lower

00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:09.458
and our equilibrium quantity Q2 is higher,

00:02:12.321 --> 00:02:13.786
once again, assuming that we have

00:02:13.786 --> 00:02:15.835
a downwards sloping demand curve like this

00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:18.326
which is what you would typically see

00:02:18.326 --> 00:02:20.166
and so, in this case,

00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:21.605
let me just write it here,

00:02:21.605 --> 00:02:23.355
we have our quantity,

00:02:24.772 --> 00:02:26.125
actually, let me write it this way,

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:28.375
we have our price goes down

00:02:29.836 --> 00:02:31.919
and our quantity goes up.

00:02:33.163 --> 00:02:35.115
All right, now let's do this example

00:02:35.115 --> 00:02:37.222
and let's imagine the other way,

00:02:37.222 --> 00:02:39.529
let's imagine in this scenario

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:41.279
our supply goes down.

00:02:42.817 --> 00:02:45.560
What is going to happen to this graph

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.562
and in particular, what's going to happen

00:02:46.562 --> 00:02:50.597
to our equilibrium price and
our equilibrium quantity?

00:02:50.597 --> 00:02:54.014
Well, in this situation for a given price

00:02:54.902 --> 00:02:57.003
people are willing to supply less,

00:02:57.003 --> 00:02:59.010
that's how I would like to think about it,

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.408
so we would have a shift to the left

00:03:00.408 --> 00:03:04.575
and up and so, we could
call this supply curve two

00:03:05.944 --> 00:03:09.762
right over here and that what
is our equilibrium point?

00:03:09.762 --> 00:03:11.512
It's right over there

00:03:13.215 --> 00:03:16.517
and so, this would be our new price,

00:03:16.517 --> 00:03:17.694
it has gone up

00:03:17.694 --> 00:03:20.171
and this would be our new quantity,

00:03:20.171 --> 00:03:21.789
it has gone down,

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:23.507
so price has gone up

00:03:23.507 --> 00:03:25.428
and quantity has gone down

00:03:25.428 --> 00:03:28.153
and once again, in
either of these scenarios

00:03:28.153 --> 00:03:31.129
hopefully this feels a
little bit like commonsense.

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.390
If you have a supplier
enter into the market,

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.746
quantity might go up

00:03:35.746 --> 00:03:37.620
and there's more competition

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.500
and so, a lot more suppliers

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.227
and so, the price would go down.

00:03:41.227 --> 00:03:43.668
Here where the supply goes down,

00:03:43.668 --> 00:03:46.734
maybe some of the ice
cream stores close down,

00:03:46.734 --> 00:03:49.122
well, now the quantity will go down,

00:03:49.122 --> 00:03:50.578
there's just less people supplying

00:03:50.578 --> 00:03:52.808
but the price goes up.

00:03:52.808 --> 00:03:54.181
For the ice cream that's there,

00:03:54.181 --> 00:03:57.520
the equilibrium price
is going to be higher.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.989
Now let's do the same thing
with the demand curve.

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.290
Let's think about a situation

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.619
where first let's think about a scenario

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:06.369
where demand goes up.

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:12.526
What is going to happen in this world?

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:15.559
Well, demand might go up

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:18.442
because maybe there's some type of report

00:04:18.442 --> 00:04:20.373
that ice cream is much healthier for you

00:04:20.373 --> 00:04:23.422
than expected and so, at a given price,

00:04:23.422 --> 00:04:27.808
people are willing to
demand a higher quantity,

00:04:27.808 --> 00:04:28.828
so for example, at that price,

00:04:28.828 --> 00:04:30.367
people would demand a higher quantity

00:04:30.367 --> 00:04:33.033
and so, we would have a
shift to the right and up,

00:04:33.033 --> 00:04:36.126
let's call this D2 right over here

00:04:36.126 --> 00:04:39.045
and this is our new equilibrium point

00:04:39.045 --> 00:04:42.712
and then notice what
has just happened here.

00:04:43.584 --> 00:04:45.618
At our new equilibrium point,

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:48.951
this is Q2 and then this right over here

00:04:51.857 --> 00:04:55.294
is P2, our new equilibrium price

00:04:55.294 --> 00:04:56.690
or our new equilibrium quantity.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.818
In this situation where demand goes up,

00:04:58.818 --> 00:05:02.318
both price and quantity are going to go up

00:05:05.783 --> 00:05:10.038
assuming we have this upwards
sloping supply curve again.

00:05:10.038 --> 00:05:11.408
And once again, that makes sense.

00:05:11.408 --> 00:05:13.458
More people just wanna buy ice cream,

00:05:13.458 --> 00:05:17.381
the supply curve dynamics
have not changed,

00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:19.652
so we're gonna move
along that supply curve

00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:21.754
to the right and up,

00:05:21.754 --> 00:05:23.894
so both price and quantity go up.

00:05:23.894 --> 00:05:25.745
Well, if demand goes down,

00:05:25.745 --> 00:05:28.735
you could imagine the
opposite is going to happen.

00:05:28.735 --> 00:05:31.818
So, here if we have demand goes down,

00:05:35.011 --> 00:05:36.773
let's say a big study comes out

00:05:36.773 --> 00:05:38.909
that ice cream is even unhealthier

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:40.215
than we originally thought,

00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:41.481
well, then at a given price,

00:05:41.481 --> 00:05:43.514
people are going to want,

00:05:43.514 --> 00:05:45.929
they're going to demand less ice cream

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:48.878
and so, our demand curve
would shift to the left

00:05:48.878 --> 00:05:52.518
and down, so we'll call
this D2 right over here

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:55.938
and then we can see our
equilibrium price and quantity,

00:05:55.938 --> 00:05:59.655
so let's show that new equilibrium price

00:05:59.655 --> 00:06:01.405
is P2 right over here

00:06:02.776 --> 00:06:05.356
and then our new
equilibrium quantity is Q2

00:06:05.356 --> 00:06:08.736
and notice, both price
and quantity go down.

00:06:08.736 --> 00:06:10.068
People just don't wanna
buy ice cream as much

00:06:10.068 --> 00:06:11.795
because they think it's unhealthy now,

00:06:11.795 --> 00:06:14.929
so price goes down and quantity goes down.
