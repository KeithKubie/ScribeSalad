00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.370
The Story of the Tsar Bomba

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.620
The Tsar Bomba, or “Big Ivan” as the Soviets
nicknamed it, is the single most powerful

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.260
man-made explosive device in human history.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.860
But why was such a device even made?

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.140
Well, for similar reasons as to why the U.S.
once thought it would be fun to nuke the moon-

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.630
basically, the bomb was little more than the
Soviet Union demonstrating its military might

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.019
and ingenuity; it was simply too massive to
be easily deployed in regular warfare, particularly

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.380
nearly impossible for the Soviets to effectively
deploy against the U.S.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.030
The bomb itself was so powerful that the survival
rate for the pilot and crew aboard the plane

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.390
that dropped it was estimated at 50%, and
they were 10 km (about six miles) in the sky

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:50.350
and 45 km (28 miles) away when the parachuted
bomb detonated at an elevation of about 4

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.469
km (2.5 miles).

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.620
And this is after they reduced the total yield
of the bomb by half.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.030
So surely such a device was tens of months,
if not years in the making, no?

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.280
Of course it wasn’t, we’re talking about
a country where popular alcoholic beverages

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.500
are practically weapons grade.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.700
All in all, the bomb was built (and designed)
by a small team of scientists and physicists

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.579
in, and this is where sources are hazy, between
14 and 16 weeks…

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:20.579
Seriously.

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:25.939
The bomb was the brain child of Nikita Khrushchev,
who was keen to demonstrate the Soviet Union’s

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:27.610
nuclear ingenuity.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.329
Khrushchev arranged a meeting with his lead
weapon designer, Andrei Sakharov, and basically

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.490
told him that he wanted him to do something
to “show the imperialists what we could

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.490
do”.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.590
It’s not clear when the idea of making it
a 100 megaton bomb came about or who made

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.229
the suggestion; what we do know is simply
that Khrushchev tasked Sakharov with building

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.770
a device of “record breaking power“.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.310
Keen to do his boss proud, Sakharov gathered
a team of crack experts (three of whom were

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.619
called Yuri, for maximum Russian-ness) and
between the five of them- yes there were only

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.200
five of them- in less time than it normally
takes to knit a blanket, they created a bomb

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.379
capable of turning a city into a dark smudge.

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.530
While the bomb was being designed and built,
Khrushchev positively reveled in the fuss

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.040
the bomb was creating.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.590
As the device was being built for little more
than a show of force, the usual secrecy measures

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.530
were ignored and Khrushchev loved that.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.510
In fact, Khrushchev took great satisfaction
in casually explaining the sheer power of

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.920
the device and how they’d have to make it
less powerful.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.660
Sakharov was decidedly more reserved when
quizzed, only answering that the bomb was

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.340
a symbolic “dagger of Damacles” hanging
over the heads of anyone who might oppose

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.340
Russia.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.700
In regards to Khrushchev’s comments, the
device did indeed need to be severely limited

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.020
in power partially because of concerns over
nuclear fallout, but also because, as noted

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.959
above, the pilot and crew dropping the bomb
only had a 50% survival rate; if the device

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:01.900
had been detonated at its maximum potential,
this would have almost certainly been 0%.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.159
The device did indeed have the potential to
be detonated with a yield of 100 megatons,

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:11.760
though, but after some modifications- particularly
using a lead tamper instead of one made of

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.879
depleted uranium in at least one of the three
stages, and possibly two, this was halved

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:23.299
to a “mere” 50 megatons, which for your
reference is over 3000 times more powerful

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.770
than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.150
The modifications also helped the device break
yet another record, along with being the most

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.301
powerful nuclear bomb ever detonated, it’s
also the cleanest relative to the yield, as

00:03:35.301 --> 00:03:41.540
the modifications along with halving the yield
also removed 97% of the device’s potential

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.590
fallout.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.620
On the 30th of October 1961, preparations
had been finalized and Russia was ready to

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.190
show the world just what a 50 megaton explosion
looked like.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.019
However, even the final preparations were
a tricky task as finding a plane capable of

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:01.420
even holding the bomb was something that required
a team of engineers and a slew of modifications

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.129
to the chosen plane.

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:07.970
In the end, the bomb was carried by a heavily
modified Tupolev Tu-95.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.129
By heavily modified, we mean half of its bottom
section was ripped out to make room for the

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:17.220
bomb, with half of the device awkwardly protruding
from the plane.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:23.050
The bomb itself weighed in at over 25 tons
and measuring over 8 metres in length.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.960
After the plane was painted with reflective
paint (to partially protect it from the heat

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.860
from the explosion), they handed the keys
to Major Andrei E. Durnovtsev.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.550
When detonated, the bomb released a shock-wave
so powerful it was noted to have circled the

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.180
Earth 3 times and was sufficiently powerful
enough to shatter the windows of a building

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.670
900 km away… in Finland.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.920
To say that the explosion absolutely decimated
the area immediately surrounding it is an

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.920
understatement.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:57.530
The “total destruction” blast radius of
the bomb was a full 35 km (22 miles) and every

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:04.190
building in a small abandoned village 55 km
(34 miles away) was also leveled.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.700
The team surveying the area afterwards noted
that the land surrounding the site was akin

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.890
to a perfectly smooth “skating rink“…
and that’s the image we’d like to leave

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:18.650
you with, Russian scientists gleefully skating
around in full scientists garb, presumably

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.160
tossing a Geiger counter back and forth in
a friendly game of keep-away.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.590
It’s a damn sight less scary than the image
of a bomb made by a handful of scientists

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.430
in just a few months that was so powerful
it could reduce any city on Earth to a sheet

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.900
of glass in under a minute.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.520
Bonus Fact:
• The Tsar Bomba was the last weapons project

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.120
Sakharov worked on; horrified by the power
of the device he’d helped create, he became

00:05:43.120 --> 00:06:01.280
a staunch opponent of nuclear weapons shortly
after the test was completed.
