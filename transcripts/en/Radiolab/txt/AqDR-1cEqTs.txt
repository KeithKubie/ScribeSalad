Speaker 1:          00:01          Listening to radio lab radio from W N Y. S. C. Yep. Hello, I'm Jet Apple Rod. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab, and today we have a story from a longtime contributor of ours, uh, who's up to something new these days. A Gregory Warner. Yes. If you've listened to this program, you know his work because he's been on our show so many times. He brought us stories from upstate New York about faith healers, thinks as 12 years ago. Then a story from Afghanistan about the quote Afghan Elvis, a couple of stories from Kenya, one from Ethiopia and exploring a cure to alcoholism by some crack in Moscow. In other words, he's like all over the place. He is a foreign correspondent for national public radio, and recently NPR decided to give him his own podcast. It's called rough translation and it's killer, but we're going to just begin today with sampling one of his new pieces. It again takes us to a peculiar place with an improbable result. Yeah. Here's Greg Warner.

Speaker 2:          01:05          The six months before Mohammad went to prison with the best six months of his life, he'd landed this great job managing a Pepsi plant and he'd found true love on his first date. We went to a small restaurant, where do we leave? Her name was Ismahan 20 years old teller at a state bank. I know we were talking and shyly of course, you know, she was British I and, and we realized we want to get married. That's it. Love it for censored in a sense. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:41          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:41          Mohammad said he was just so struck by how generous she was smart and they connected about everything from the future of their country to the music they liked. Whatever images the word Somalia calls to mind. The Somalia where Muhammad lived was in a cultural renaissance. This was 1981 it was under communist rule and the dictator, he was a dictator, but he was also a big fan of Somali culture in music. Music was sexually a big part of how Mohammad courted his Mohan. He made her mix tapes. This was the 80s to song sense, stuff like that. Yeah. Did you sing or did she say, oh, she's a bit to sing?

Speaker 3:          02:22          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          02:22          a few months after Mohammad and his mom got married, Mohammed got a phone call from the director of the local public hospital. Please help me bring some donations from the communities. He was desperate for donations or medicine for bedding. In fact, that music loving dictator, his name was, see at Bari, he'd cut off supplies to the hospital in retaliation for an independence movement in the region. The doctor had been calling all his friends and secret. Yeah. We were talking a little time saying, you know, you work for Pepsi, you have connections, you know, people can, we raise the money discreetly ourselves. But Mohammad wanted to go big. I suppose maybe I wanted to share my happiness. What do you mean by share your happiness? You know, contribute. Cause there are other people who are less fortunate than us. Mohammed was in that stage of new love when you just kinda think the world is full of good feeling.

Speaker 2:          03:13          And if everybody knew what was going on, they would do the right thing. And he takes this bold and pretty risky move. He writes a letter, some kind of a nice letter about the hospital conditions. Yes. Filling the conditions of the country, essentially implying that the dictator is not doing right by us and we've got to step up ourselves. A couple of weeks later, Mohammed and spawn heard a knock on their door in the middle of the night, national security to be one. They don't have no warrant or anything like that. It's just said we needed to take him and I could see that my wife actually member had it and had eyes what was in her eyes? No love the tariff. Mohammad is accused of treason and sentenced the life in solitary confinement, blindfold handcuff and sent to a seven and this is where the story really begins. Mohammed cell is tiny, maybe six feet by six feet concrete walls hole on the floor for a toilet and a window

Speaker 4:          04:24          high up that lets in just a little bit of light. It's very dark and cook roots come from the toilet, cockroaches, cook carrots and they will fly off the wall, which you and split them into their feet. Sweet. The on their feet would be excreted from the toilet. Yeah. Yes, yes. After the cockroaches come the rats at the mice and the mosquitoes, the most of the mosquitoes. Oh, like an engine jet engine. But even worse than that sound now is the buzzing in his own mind.

Speaker 5:          05:01          Uh,

Speaker 4:          05:01          because in this prison there is one rule to a strictly forbidden to talk to your neighbor. He's forbidden to speak to the other inmates. So you will faraway them backward pacing back and forth. And this isn't just a tiny place to walk back and forth tee shots. So like three short steps forward, three shorts, those back with resources. Photos.

Speaker 5:          05:23          Yes.

Speaker 4:          05:27          So that is his life now.

Speaker 5:          05:31          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          05:33          until one day he hears a knock on the wall

Speaker 5:          05:40          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          05:41          and that knock becomes words from another time and another place. All happy families are alike.

Speaker 6:          05:52          Unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.

Speaker 2:          06:01          This is rough translation. The show from NPR bringing you Greg, are you there? Yeah. Hey guys. Hey, we say, do you want to just tell us what rough translation is? Yes. So I've been, uh, been making a podcast this year. Um, basically the idea is that in every episode we follow a conversation we're having in the United States here, how that's playing out in a different place. One episode we might hear about how fake news is playing out in Ukraine, which has been getting fake news for longer and in higher doses than anything Americans going to imagine. We're hearing about a trend that's happening more and more now, where Chinese women are hiring American surrogates to have their babies. So basically every episode we're trying to do the same thing. It's just sort of see something we have, see what the other folks, yeah. Which is not like what we said. Yeah. And I guess in this one, we have a guy locked away in a Somali prison. Should we just keep playing? See what happens? Yeah. Yeah. It's rough translation. It's eight months into Mohammed's prison sentence and he's in his cell as always. He's alone.

Speaker 4:          07:02          Not quite though. There were so many different types of answers. Swells is unseen. Tiny one is really just like watching a film. Gatesville the way deal. They look around for food. Do we have t three t should have it when you give them time. It's another world I would have loved to go see at that hill. They're, they're homeless. They where they were staying, but I couldn't because it was so concrete.

Speaker 2:          07:33          And then one evening when the guard is at the other end of the line of cells, just out of your shot, the guy in the cell next to Muhammad whispers. So with the door saying lan a, B, c through the wall, then ABC through the wall, learn a, B, c through the wall. But he remembers and, and does that make any sense to Muhammad at that one 0 million cents?

Speaker 4:          07:54          I look at the world between. So, but then, but then he knocked on the wall [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          08:00          and when Mohammed leaned over to the wall, he could hear this sound that's shot

Speaker 7:          08:08          that too.

Speaker 2:          08:09          So you have a sharp sound and a kind of dull sound. And with those two sounds, he immediately clicks. Oh, this is the alphabet. Oh, this is the guy saying, learn this code, this code.

Speaker 8:          08:21          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          08:22          Yes, I understand that. And he starts with this,

Speaker 7:          08:26          B, c, d, e, f,

Speaker 2:          08:32          first and alphabet. And then

Speaker 8:          08:34          words. What do you, what was the first sentence that you heard?

Speaker 4:          08:40          So number, which means peace in Somalia and what it means. How are you also, yeah, no, but I could've beat that with or that day fell without doing anything else. And so Mohammad

Speaker 2:          08:56          can now spend most of the day tapping back and forth to talk with the guy in the next cell about politics, to share a childhood memory.

Speaker 9:          09:05          But at night when he can't sleep, he turns again to the concrete. And then again, and again,

Speaker 4:          09:14          I was only sleeping few, maybe half an hour, then wake up a half an hour.

Speaker 2:          09:18          Mohammed would wake up from a nightmare, sweaty and in a panic, I guess. My sleep, are you awake? I can't sleep. I need to talk.

Speaker 6:          09:34          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          09:34          when I try to sleep, when I'm falling asleep, sitting in my heart face is so fast. So I was thinking there was space that this is the smell of death. What is the smell of death? I think fear.

Speaker 2:          09:53          Mohammed had a lot of fearful thoughts in that prison cell,

Speaker 4:          09:57          especially about his wife. I could not imagine how how she is because there are no news from from the world, from those side where it's really difficult to imagine where she is even with she's alive.

Speaker 2:          10:12          Then there was a meaner thought as well.

Speaker 4:          10:13          The government was encouraging wives to be forced their husbands. The government was saying, you should divorce. Yes, of course, Daddy. Three trustees write in prison. Even some chefs from granite faces to support that

Speaker 2:          10:28          divorce in Somali society in Islam is usually the husband's exclusive. Right, but there are these Quranic verses that can allow a wife to choose to divorce her husband if the husband's absent for some time and shakes. Loyal to the dictator, use those verses to pressure the wives of political prisoners.

Speaker 4:          10:46          Quite a number of people who were forced from their request.

Speaker 2:          10:50          All right. I was thinking sometimes the shoe could, she was only 20 years old. They'd only been married for three months and he was sentenced to life. You think she's probably enjoying herself? She's living her life and I am in this place. At first it's just a little twinge of resentment and then the feeling comes back stronger and sharper. He thinks she should be visiting me, but wait, she can't visit me. Nobody come to see this place and nobody can get in touch and he's still, you blame her for not getting in touch with you and what do you think about her in those moments when you're blaming her for not visiting you? Pretty far from love. You probably hate that at that particular time.

Speaker 10:         11:39          Every time that Mohammed tapped one of these dark thoughts onto the wall, someone was listening and the someone on the other side of the wall was a doctor, doctor at an Abacor is also an inmate in this prison and is the doctors to these taps on

Speaker 2:          11:54          the wall. He's also diagnosing them acute anxiety. Who was telling me the symptoms through the wall? I should tell you that doctor Addon and Mohammad were actually friends before prison. Yeah. Yeah. The doctor was the director of the public hospital. The one had called him up and asked him for donations. He did not ask Mohammed to write that letter complaining about the hospital conditions

Speaker 6:          12:19          cause there were no press allowed, no newspapers, no free press. And that's the moment the government decided that they should do something about us.

Speaker 2:          12:28          But if the doctor blames Mohammad for writing the letter that got them both thrown in prison, he didn't show it. Every time that Mohammed knocked, whatever the hour the doctor would knock back,

Speaker 6:          12:39          he used to have these nightmares. So he jumps, he has a knife man and then he knocks on the, on the wall again. So I have to wake up and then again start conversation, you know, so that they can fall asleep. I get just like a baby, you're taking a baby to Tibet and making you fall asleep, you know?

Speaker 5:          12:59          Okay.

Speaker 2:          12:59          If Dr add and seems fairly unsentimental about some of the more dramatic aspects of Mohammed's life, just like a baby, you know, it's partly that these two men are such different personalities. While Mohammad described that nighttime arrest as a moment of shock and terror. Dr Adnan seems to have met those same secret police with a bag packed and ready for prison and bag of clothes and lots and lots of books.

Speaker 6:          13:21          Huh? Why books? Books is the best friend and in a prison. Then when you go to the prison that was taken away, the bag was taken away. Even old glasses were taken away.

Speaker 5:          13:31          So

Speaker 2:          13:32          tell me about the day you learn the language. Learn the knocking language. Well,

Speaker 5:          13:39          okay.

Speaker 6:          13:39          It was the most exciting day in our life.

Speaker 5:          13:42          Okay.

Speaker 6:          13:45          This was the most exciting and we couldn't sleep. Wait, so Greg, let me ask this. This knocking, this is something that they are, they all were doing together. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          13:52          Particular Line of Eight prisoners. So these eight prisoners, there was a particular guy in the, in the middle there who had once heard of Morse code and just lying there in prison one day thought, hey, what if I indent the language and we can talk? Oh, so this was actually a homespun? Yeah, he did not know Morse code. He just knew of it. And the guards couldn't hear that. That was some, that was their own right. I mean literally they could, this was kind of the magic of it. They could be just tapping on the wall. They could be having a whole conversation and the guard would have no idea what they were saying.

Speaker 6:          14:28          We started practicing in the whole day and the whole night and if there is a joke and somebody loves everybody starts knocking on the wall and asking that thread was that joke about that that guy starts sending the message, the joke and it goes from,

Speaker 2:          14:43          I could take an hour to send a tiny joke from one cell to the next cell to the next, there were eight of them in this prison. The gods, of course, they

Speaker 6:          14:52          don't know that we are knocking on the wall because they can't hear. And then when they see us all laughing, they just say, well, this get it. These guys are also losing their sanity.

Speaker 2:          15:01          Meanwhile, on the other side of the wall, Mohammed really was worried that his mind was slipping.

Speaker 4:          15:07          I was frightened enough going to a safe and area in my mind when I would commit suicide without knowing, without wanting to, is it almost like a, the fear of going crazy? It was making me crazy. Yes. The fear, the fear was, you know you could, you can imagine people who were crazy and you could imagine that maybe going crazy was the point of no return. So you are frightened of that

Speaker 6:          15:33          while the doctor on his side of the wall and I was trying to counsel him and explain to him through the wall and he's not going to go with Matt and that he's not going to die, but you can't cancel person through a wall.

Speaker 2:          15:48          Months go by. Then a whole year, finally it's two years into their prison sentence and something happens. Dr Addin is summoned to the office of the warden to get a change of clothes.

Speaker 6:          15:59          The room was empty and there was a bench and they ask you to sit on the bench and then he asked, he asked one of the guys to go and bring your back. Just the whole bag with all your clothes, your books, everything. Yeah. And then he you, oh, you open that bag and then he tells you to choose something in here to wear and you don't choose anything else. He says don't choose anything else. No. That was the regulation.

Speaker 2:          16:22          The doctor is getting his first change of clothes since he arrived in prison. So then you showed back two years later to choose your next tee shirt. Yes, but then the doctor turns to the warden. He looks him right in the eye.

Speaker 6:          16:34          Can I have one book? I said even I did not expect that he will agree to give me, so I'll just, I'll just try it, you know? And they said, yes, you can choose one all of your books. So then I started thinking of the, Oh, the biggest book I can take a few minutes later. If the doctor is walking back to his cell with the fattest book in his bag under his arm, you can picture him fantasizing about just getting to lie down and read about when he returns to his cell. There's that sound at the wall. It's all clear to me the thought that, why don't I read this before he went to the wall and distract the negative thoughts.

Speaker 2:          17:14          Meanwhile, I'm Muhammad on his side of the wall. Here's the new set of taps,

Speaker 4:          17:19          have a book club, a book, and I'm ready to chapter by chapter and I couldn't credit now, Huh?

Speaker 2:          17:30          Anna Karenina, the famous novel by Leo Tolstoy, published in 1878 the English translation that they're using is 800 pages, 350,000 words, nearly 2 million letters, each letter, a set of taps so the doctor prepares himself.

Speaker 6:          17:46          So to start, I took piece of my

Speaker 2:          17:50          pitch sheet and I posted around around my wrist, like he's prepping for a medical procedure, wrapping the sheet around his wrist and knuckle because it will, it will damage my reserve. I continued like that. So then I started

Speaker 11:         18:05          okay and he started listening. All happy families are alike. Each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. Everything was in confusion and the upland skis house, the wife had discovered that the husband was carrying the effect. The dose taps and that book had on Mohammed's mind is after the brain.

For example, I met J K Rao wing and I met Bono. Those aren't the same. To hear these stories and more, come on over to two dope queens wherever you get your podcasts. Oh, the memories, the memories bottle. I love you. Not the same.

Speaker 2:          19:32          Okay, we're back. This is Radiolab and we now return to the tale told by Gregory Warner from his new podcast. Rough translation. The day that the novel Anna Karenina entered their lives, marked a new phase for Mohammed and the doctor. Each morning, Dr Addin would carefully wrap his hand and open the novel Mohammed on his side of the wall,

Speaker 11:         19:55          but listen, when he was stressed, step on our Katovich sprinkled some center on himself. [inaudible] district brought the whole story to your right pocket book matches and watch with its double chain and seals and shaking out his handkerchief feeling can self-clean fragrant, healthy and physically at ease. In spite of his unhappiness, he walked with a slight swing on each leg into the dining room where coffee was already.

Speaker 2:          20:23          If it's been a while since you've cracked open on a [inaudible], here's what you need to know. Ana is a noble woman in 19th century Russia. She's married to a man much older than herself. She goes to a ball and a black velvet dress line with lace and falls in love with the soldier count front skis. He's kind of a rich boy. Careless and love Mohammed immediately hates him is because he's also in uniform and I was hating anything. A uniform. Actually, this is very impersonal. Yeah. Mean I can feel that he's in the military. And you were in the military prison. Yeah, I was a military person. Definitely. See you really didn't like rod scheme. So anyway, the soldier of Wronski heat seals on his heart. He gets her pregnant even though she's still married to the other guy. And then Ana makes a choice that really changes everything because instead of having a secret affair, like all the others in your social set, she makes her love public. She leaves her husband and society. The Russian nobility cut her off. They isolate her. Wronski is a man, so he pretty much able to go on with his life as before, but honest, realizing how alone she is. She staying in a room wondering what Brodsky's up to when he's not with her. Okay. Just the same as Mohammed was wondering what his wife was doing outside the prison walls. Muhammad reads me this one sentence from the book, if you love it hard.

Speaker 2:          21:43          So if, if we love it hot, he would understand all the difficulty of that situation and he would treat squad from it. If he loved her, he would rescue her from her situation. It's interesting because on a is traps by reviews about women and maybe desire and and all that, but you are trapped by real waltz. He says it didn't matter how different their lives seemed on the outside. Inside she was suffering all the time. He felt exactly like Ghana. He also was jealous, crazily jealous, and also hating himself for being jealous. And all of a sudden he meets this fictional character who is suffering in exactly the same way. And this suffering is driving her into a state that Mohammad most feared for himself going to assist an area in my mind when I would commit suicide without knowing, without wanting to. So it's now 750 pages into the book and two months surpass since the doctor first started tapping the book letter by letter.

Speaker 2:          22:49          Ana and Bronski are now living in Moscow and it's summer, so it's hot and suffocating. And on this particular day, Vronsky is off visiting his mom, which on a hates because she thinks she's trying to set him up with a young princess and Ana's in the state of mind where she both thinks that she's a burden to front ski and she thinks he'd be better off without her, but also she wants him to suffer her absence. The way she's suffering. It's in this state that ANA finds herself walking down a train platform. The train is hurdling down the tracks

Speaker 15:         23:23          and this thought possessor. Fie knew what she had to do, whether rapid lights step. She went down the steps that led from the tank to the rails and stopped quite near the approaching train. As Mohammad is listening to this and he's thinking about, she is about to do [inaudible] for her, but he realizes his tears are not just for Ana. That's when I remember my wife.

Speaker 2:          23:56          He's remembering Ismahan his wife missy. She's suffering.

Speaker 15:         24:01          Yes. The books, the one that brought me back to think about how to Latin end, he finds himself asking a question that in two years in prison he has not asked himself before. Did I do well in those few months we were together? Had he been a good husband? Yeah. Should I treat a CBC

Speaker 2:          24:22          instead of thinking she's left him and also hating himself for thinking that she's left him. He's thinking why did he take himself away from her by writing that stupid newsletter? Maybe we could have done it in a different way. That letter that got them all thrown in prison. You'd be, you could have talked to them and putting himself in his wife's shoes like that. It kind of took him out of his own misery. He could think about like she suffered the worst, you know than me cause I was only in prison but she was in the outside where he goes from self-pity to pity for her. Oh I think that's related to the book tell story. It's fate actually famous for that. That's like his magic crazy talent. Can you say more about that magic? Crazy talent. Cause like when I was rereading, I told Elif Batuman about Muhammad Story.

Speaker 2:          25:09          You've heard her reading the Tolstoy passages for us. She's also a writer, novelist herself and totally obsessed with unaccredited. I like it a lot. When I told her about Mohammad's experience, she had this idea about why that book in particular might've helped Muhammad make this mental leap from hating his wife to imagining everything through her eyes tell story gives a lot of weight to, to all of the characters like even suggest like a newlywed young girl. You spend a lot of time and her thoughts and the, there's like a scene where she's trying to eat a mushroom on a plate and it keeps flipping from under her fork ton. I ain't even been to spirit, this obedient, slippery mushroom. We had a shaking delays through which had showed why. It's a book that takes the subjectivity of young women seriously and not just young women.

Speaker 2:          25:55          Everyone that servants and I'm the dog. There's a hunting scene in this that's actually goes to the perspective of the dog and everything just seems so true. You read that and you're like, that's definitely what that dog was thinking and so she says the experience of reading Tolstoy is the experience of being constantly confronted with how differently. The same thing can look from a slightly different perspective. Like he's just, he never gets bored of showing that and in the book, the characters themselves actually judge each other and then are able to expand that and to see each other a little bit more generously. That's what LF thinks that Tolstoy's book gave to Muhammad is different. It's Kent did that. It definitely, definitely in a place like, like that prison people become very selfish. You think everybody has forgotten about me at the beginning for concern about me, so

Speaker 4:          26:44          I nobody cares about me like that. But when you think about other people's situation, then you, you understand. It helped me survive. It's helping me even sleep better.

Speaker 2:          26:56          Tolstoy actually had one more role to play in Mohammed's life. Eight years after his arrest, the Somali political winds had shifted and the dictator was trying to appease his enemies. Mohammad and the others were suddenly released. He discovered his region of Somalia was flattened by civil war, but Muhammad also discovered something else. His wife is mine. She was still his wife. She had not given up on him and she had suffered in his absence working at the state bank. She'd been pressured by your boss to divorce the trader Mohammed when she refused. She was relocated and by the time Mohammed was released, she was living in a refugee camp in Germany. She couldn't even make it back to Somalia to see him.

Speaker 4:          27:39          So I wait to another, uh, that was for another say about 10 months, I think, to, to see each other.

Speaker 11:         27:47          Finally, they figured out a way that they can reunite in a neighboring country and though it's been almost a decade since they've seen each other, you recognized her immediately from a distance and it's, they drew closer. Ismahan opens her arms to give her husband a hug and he reaches out. And all that he could do in that moment is shake her hand.

Speaker 5:          28:15          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          28:17          Why do I not feel as I felt even even in prison, I was feeling so much in love with that. And yet when we met, it wasn't the same. She was like a stranger or something like that. Wow. I mean, I was asking myself, why are you not as in love with heart as before

Speaker 16:         28:42          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          28:42          and is, this was a moment that we found really interesting and uh, you know, as we were talking about it with Greg, oh no, no, no. It was a studio. Greg said that it was really in this moment, this period of doubt, he was overcome by a momentary doubt of the possibility of setting up that new life you dreamed of on the way that the book came back to Muhammad again. Except this time he didn't think of the main character Anna Karenina. He thought of a different character in the book. A guy by the name of Levon. This is a character who is, uh, also in love, also has like strong emotions. And like Muhammad in that one moment with his wife love and spends the entire book just racked by doubts, doubts about everything, an eternal dissatisfaction with yourself, vain attempts to improve and failures and then internal expectation of the happiness and standing there with his wife, not just weirded out by his own lack of feeling. Mohammad had two thoughts like, oh, I'm like living in this moment and what happens to live in at the end?

Speaker 2:          29:46          And what's really cool about Levin's conclusion at the end of the book is he finally just decides like, I'm not going to worry about how weird my feelings are. Like he doesn't actually come, he doesn't make himself whole as he wants to be. He wants to the whole book. He wants to be, um, fully in love with Kitty and not just with his heart, but with his mind and his soul. And he wants to be a good Christian and everything has to sort of make sense to him, but you know, but he's just a complicated sort of guy and he's got many different feelings. But at the end of the book he kind of feels like, you know, I'm going to stop just thinking obsessive Lee about how awkward I am in this situation and I'm just going to do and I'm supposed to, I'm going to be the dad, I'm gonna be the husband

Speaker 1:          30:32          and Mohammed thought to himself, uh, like maybe I need to do that too because like who knows where I'm at right now. I was in a cell for eight years in the prison in a way you hadn't to living, you are still inside yourself. You had not, you have to open any figured like opening back up is probably going to take some time and some work we have to learn to love each other again and that he says is what they did.

Speaker 4:          31:00          Hey told us. That had a lot to do with it. You think Tolstoy helps you fall in love again? Yeah, I mean, I mean feeling of, look, you know, it wasn't so easy to become a love again. This man has been experienced as she was leaving [inaudible] life. It's difficult for people to grow the, to live with someone who has been in solitary confinement for so long. I was probably very difficult to live with at that particular time. And you're saying that knowing that you are hard to live with, knowing yes. Yes. It's made it easier for us to talk to each other, to live, to learn to live with each other. Because you knew that yes, your heart was not. Yes, yes. Quite working yet. Yeah.

Speaker 17:         31:52          [inaudible]

Speaker 15:         31:53          [inaudible] I shouldn't be the monument for that book. Hey, one last thing. There is someone else to give credit to here. Besides the great Russian author, every detail the Tolstoy wrote into that book, every perspective shift that helped Mohammad escape his prison cell. All of a sudden it has had to be tapped out on a concrete wall by a friend. No, I could imagine him getting tired because he was at work and God at ain't working out. Dr Addons said that Mohammed was his last patient after their release. He was just too out of practice to return to medicine and after prison, the doctor did try to read the novel on a Corena. Again, I went a bull show, but when I tried to read the, couldn't read it too many bad memories, but he knew someone who could use it. Somebody, a friend who was in prison here in Samala, the journalist, a friend, and I took that book to him and I told him that's the best thing, Mr President you can have in a prison is a book.
