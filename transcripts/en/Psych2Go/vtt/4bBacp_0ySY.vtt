Today's episode is sponsored by Copy That,
an addictive memory game. Make sure you stay

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.820
till the end of the video to find out how
you can win a brand new Iphone 7. Take a look

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.230
at the 4 squares on the screen. The squares
will glow in a particular order. When the

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:45.030
words your turn appear, play along and copy
the sequence. Ready? Here are the answers.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.620
How did you do? Sequence A on average can
be done by 6 year olds. Sequence B by 8 year

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.589
olds and Sequence C by 11 year olds. This
test is called the knox cube test developed

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:01.870
by howard andrew knox to measure nonverbal
intelligence in children. It turns out how

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.470
well children do on this test is positively
correlated with their IQs later in life. It

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.190
is also said to measure short term memory
and attention span. So I decided to do a similar

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:20.640
test on myself who has a college degree in
psychology and my cousin, who is in high school.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.200
I can already tell this is going to be embarrassing.
Instead of using the knox cube test. We'll

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.830
be playing the game, Copy That which takes
this test to the extreme. How old are you?

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:37.000
I'm 14. So you're in high school right? yeah.
how do you think your memory is? It's pretty

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:51.850
good, I guess. Some things I forget. I have
a bad memory, I think I'm going to lose. bam

00:01:51.850 --> 00:02:10.200
level 2. this game is unfair. what the heck.
maybe its your phone. your screen is so dirty

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:17.920
right now. Thanks Jewel. Oh my gosh. Why wasn't
I paying attention? Obviously I am horrible

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:53.459
at this game and my memory is horrible, but
its your turn. Please please mess up. She

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:13.689
beat my level already. What the heck? It's
not hard. Lame. its not fair. how? how is

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:25.510
this happening? your phone is really hot.
My phone is recording what you're playing.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:33.659
Oh crap. Oh my. Well that's it. I was beat
by a high school student. Here are some tips

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:38.120
to help you improve your memory and to even
improve your score on this game. Wish I had

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.879
known these before I played. Tip number one,
chunk it. If you're from the United States,

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:48.150
telephone numbers come in ten digit bundles
like this. Research has shown the brain to

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.700
only hold 7 pieces of information in short
term memory, but when chunked together like

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:59.349
this it can hold more. you can do the same
with the game by imagining the first three

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:05.549
steps as one chunk, the second as another
chunk, and so on. Tip number 2 organize it.

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.950
I'm going to show you a list of words for
10 seconds. Try and memorize as much as you

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:25.770
can before time is up. Now pause the video
and try to recall them. chances are you what

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.639
helped you memorize the words was by categorizing
them by fruits and furniture. you can try

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:35.080
this out in the game as well, whether it be
by number of steps like the first five or

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.840
area the circles appear. So I hope you use
these tips to your advantage. Whether its

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.580
memorizing information for a test or beating
my cousin's high score. Don't forget to check
