Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. Are you fully committed to the beard now? Yeah, I want to keep it as long as I can. [inaudible] man, you know, as trim to trim a little, I trim it a little bit. Uh, I just like the lady who cuts my hair trims it every like four weeks when I go in for a haircut, but I don't touch it at all. I'm afraid if I tried to trim it I would just ruin it. But I've love, love having a beard. Why do you love having a beard is like, it's like sunglasses for the bottom half of your face. Ah. You know what I mean? Hide from the world kind of. Yeah. Like it's, it chills me out a little more. Yeah. Especially on stage. [inaudible] you're under the lights, you know? Uh, and I'm, I, my lip would study a little bit sweaty and I'm thinking about my lip and I'm like, should I wipe this?

Speaker 1:          00:46          Should I move it? And then I start to sweat more. But now that I have the beard and mustache, my lip gets a little sweaty. You can't tell. So I don't get more anxious. Uh, interesting. Yeah. So you used to like think, boy, there's a little couple of beads. The upper lip. Yeah. And I'm like, can they see it? Should I wipe? Is it like too much? If I'm wiping, I drives me crazy. You know, it gets me boogers. If I think I have a booger, like, like what is going on with my nose? What is that? Is that a booger shit? Can they see that? Oh, I check for sure before I go on stage. There's always approve your check. But I, I'm so animated and I'm always yelling and screaming. I'm always worried that something is like hanging off the tip of my nose.

Speaker 1:          01:23          Yeah. And the people in the front row can't even enjoy it. Like, what the fuck man? Your nose, Bro. I've never had that. I've had like definitely a fly down situation. Oh, you never, uh, never, never like a booger that ruin the show. This is the two things that people love to laugh at. Your fly down. And if you put a beer down on stage and the foam comes over the top, like your beard's coming. Ooh, those are those things. Right. [inaudible] hi. Humor. Yeah. High Humor. Sweat. Like, like weird sweat stains. Like, um, when I've done specials speaking, which Anthony Jessalyn looks new comedy special comes out tonight. I here. Yep. This evening. Midnight. I guess Netflix does it. Yeah. Excited. Very excited. Wow. I've been seeing your set. It's fucking fantastic. Thank you. Thanks. I think this is the best, uh, I've ever done, so I'm uh, I'm pumped for it.

Speaker 1:          02:13          So beautiful thing about comedy, man. Keep working, keep paying attention to it. You get better at it, you know, really. I mean, Dom Irrera and I had this conversation just a couple of months ago. He looked Joe, he goes, I'm never been better. He goes, I'm fucking a thousand years old because I've never been better at comedy. Yeah. As long as you don't quit, you don't, you don't, you don't ever get worse, I don't think. Right. You don't, as long as you don't give up because some guys don't quit, but they give up. Exactly. Yeah. They just go through the same material every single time. You're like, what are you doing here? You're just like, you're just trying to get out of the house. You're not trying to get better. I was a little of that. Yeah. Yeah. It's like if you're not right, that's, I guess that's a difference between also guys who put out specials or I say women too or, and people who don't.

Speaker 1:          02:56          Some people just don't put anything out. Yeah, no. Yeah. Once you put it out, like I put it out because I'm like, I'm, I'm done with this now it's getting boring. It's not going to get better. It's good as I can make it, but because of that, then I have to come up with a new hour. If I did any specific schedule you like to fall too, right? If I'm correct, I try. I did it. I did a year in La, like at the store every night, you know, and like once a month I do Largo and try it all out at once. And then a, at the end of that year, I had about 40 minutes, went to clubs for a year every weekend for a year. And then once that I had the hour after that, then I did a year of theaters and at the end of that year I taped the special and, and uh, and was done with it.

Speaker 1:          03:36          So you're on like a three year plan? Pretty much, yeah. And that might change, you know, as I've gotten older, uh, the idea of a four year plan sounds a little bit nicer and you have other things going on that, uh, that it's not as, I'm not as worried. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I was trying, I think two years seems to be right for me, but it might be better to give it a little more time. Right. Just a little bit more time to tighten things up and Polish and you know, add layers and add extra punch. It's like, you know those guys like in when I started out in Boston, there was guys that had been doing the same set forever. There's pros and cons to that and the pro is God damn. They had that shit down tight where it was just punchline, rapid punchline, pause, punchline.

Speaker 1:          04:23          They knew the, the economy of words was perfect. There was no, no fat in the bits they had. They had tightened all that stuff up. Yeah. My one of my biggest fears is like taping the special and then coming up with like a great tag. You know what I mean? Like that. I want it to be done when I shoot it because that feeling is awful. It's the worst. Done that. Yeah. So by sucks it sucks back in. I once went back in my last special thoughts and prayers I ADR to line. I like walked off stage and was like, oh fuck, I should use this word. And I, it just occurred to me in the moment that I was using the wrong words. So I went back and 80 yard and you can obviously tell that it's like me talking and then it's like clearly a different, like a different voice. A just one word. But I had to do ADR stand for, I know what it means, but what does it stand for? Jamie knows he's an actual audio guy. Automated Dialogue Replacement and why it's automated is lost in my head forever, but that's what it means. Ah, okay. I wouldn't have guessed that in a million years.
