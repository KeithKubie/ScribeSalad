00:00:02.068 --> 00:00:03.970
Narrator:<i> Rick and Steve
 had no idea</i>

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.372
<i> what type of bones,
 they were looking at.</i>

00:00:06.372 --> 00:00:08.041
<i> But, they
 seemed intriguing.</i>

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:13.446
<i>They took pictures and decided
 to show them to Pedro.</i>

00:00:14.013 --> 00:00:16.382
Pedro:<i> So, needless to say,
I called Professor Berger.</i>

00:00:16.782 --> 00:00:19.185
<i> He didn't answer his
 phone and we decided</i>

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:21.620
<i> we're going to drive
 to his house.</i>

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.757
<i> Because now we're all
excited, bubbling, of course.</i>

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.058
Pedro:<i> Arriving at his home</i>

00:00:26.058 --> 00:00:28.695
I rung the bell and when he
answered, my words to him was

00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:31.831
"Lee, you really
want to talk to us."

00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:33.199
( laughs )

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:38.037 line:0%
Lee:<i> I knew immediately that
that was a Fossil Hominid.</i>

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:39.371
It was not a human.

00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:41.407
I could tell by the
proportions of the teeth

00:00:41.407 --> 00:00:43.342
I could tell by its size.

00:00:43.342 --> 00:00:45.778
You can see that fine
scientific scale

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.214
<i> that I'm lucky, we have
 not got in trouble for.</i>

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:51.951
<i>Because if you read carefully,
it says, "Home Sewing Aid Only"</i>

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:53.686
<i> on the side of it.</i>
( laughs )

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.160
But I could see, that this
was something...

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:01.995
extraordinary.

00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:06.399
Second to that, it was just
lying there on the ground.

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.301
Now, that doesn't happen
in South Africa.

00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:10.570
I assure you, it doesn't
happen in South Africa.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.238
That skull that you saw

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:14.040
that Matthew had found in
that hard rock

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.875
that rock is like concrete.

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:18.044
That skull and skeleton

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:21.681
just one of them took about
22,000 preparation hours

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:23.683
to get to that state.

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:25.351
This is lying there.

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:27.187
The next picture confirmed

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:29.588
<i> that this was something
 truly extraordinary.</i>

00:01:29.588 --> 00:01:32.325
<i>Every one of those bones,
 I realized was Hominid.</i>

00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:33.525
<i> Believe me, they are.</i>

00:01:33.525 --> 00:01:36.228
<i>Anyone trained from me would
look at that and say, "My Gosh!"</i>

00:01:36.762 --> 00:01:39.765
And they're just
lying there in dirt.

00:01:39.765 --> 00:01:42.468
Even more extraordinary,
there was a skull.

00:01:42.468 --> 00:01:44.337
Can you see the curvature there?

00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:48.007
<i> Just sitting in dirt,
 on a floor.</i>

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:49.976
<i> And it looked tiny.</i>

00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:53.546
So, I decided I needed
to put someone in there

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:55.081
that I absolutely trusted.

00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:58.017
That could take a scientific
photograph of these things.

00:01:58.017 --> 00:02:01.120
And I happened to know someone,
who fit

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.656
the physiological profile
that could get down that cave.

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:07.794
Who I trusted immensely my,
then six foot four...

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:09.562
son

00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:11.230
who's sitting in the
audience today.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.865
Who is
physiologically appropriate

00:02:12.865 --> 00:02:15.001
to get down a
seven and a half inch slot.

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:16.869
Showed him how to use a
scientific camera

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:20.539
gave him a scale and...
a few days later...

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:24.276
<i> We went into this cave,
 a torturous route</i>

00:02:24.276 --> 00:02:25.978
<i>that took us almost 50 minutes</i>

00:02:25.978 --> 00:02:27.680
<i> to get to the base
 of Dragon's Back.</i>

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.750
<i>Up we went, up this thing, where
if you slip off, you die.</i>

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.752
<i>We get to the edge of that
crevice and we look down it</i>

00:02:33.752 --> 00:02:36.222
and... down I sent Matthew
with Rick and Steve.

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.591
Because I'm trying for
"Father of the Year".

00:02:38.591 --> 00:02:40.693
( audience laughter )

00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:42.262
There I sat in the dark

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:45.731
looking at this
impossible route.

00:02:45.731 --> 00:02:49.902
How in the world was I
going to accomplish

00:02:49.902 --> 00:02:52.171
an expedition
and excavation here?

00:02:52.838 --> 00:02:56.042
Forty five minutes or so go
by and I hear scrabbling.

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:58.211
Matthew's head pops up.

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:00.379
Because I'm going for
"Father of the Year"

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.114
I didn't go, "Are you okay?".
I went, "And?"

00:03:02.114 --> 00:03:04.850
( audience laughter )

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:08.821
And Matthew handed me
the camera and said

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:10.189
"Daddy...

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:12.392
it's amazing, It's beautiful."

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:16.395
<i>It was everything that those
original pictures had said</i>

00:03:16.395 --> 00:03:19.331
<i> and that's when I knew I
 had to push the button.</i>

00:03:19.798 --> 00:03:21.867
<i> Except, I didn't know
 what button to push.</i>

00:03:21.867 --> 00:03:24.070
<i> 'Cause I needed people
 to work in there.</i>

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.708
I needed people to...
effectively risk their lives

00:03:29.075 --> 00:03:30.610
in a well-known cave

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.178
down a seven and a half
inch slot, underground.

00:03:33.178 --> 00:03:35.981
In a fragile, relatively
shallow environment

00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:37.349
that could have gases in it.

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.084
It could collapse at any time.

00:03:39.084 --> 00:03:42.488
I had no idea how I was gonna
find people with skills.

00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:44.157
They had to be
paleoanthropologists

00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:46.358
or archeologists,
they had to be able to excavate

00:03:46.358 --> 00:03:48.595
they had to have climbing
skills, all these things.

00:03:49.728 --> 00:03:52.164
I did what any one
of you would do...

00:03:52.164 --> 00:03:53.632
I put a Facebook Ad out.

00:03:53.632 --> 00:03:55.001
( audience laughter )

00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:59.271
<i> That Facebook Ad asked
 for skinny scientists.</i>

00:03:59.271 --> 00:04:01.841
<i>They had to be able to work
in underground environments</i>

00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:04.610
<i> climbing skills,
 not claustrophobic.</i>

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:05.911
<i> They wouldn't tell them
 what to do.</i>

00:04:05.911 --> 00:04:07.379
They had to drop everything

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.082
be ready within
three weeks from that date

00:04:10.082 --> 00:04:11.684
to come for a month
to South Africa.

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:12.919
I wasn't going to pay you.

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.654
Oh and by the way, you have
to have a PhD or a Masters

00:04:15.654 --> 00:04:18.825
in paleoanthopology,
archeology, etc.

00:04:20.493 --> 00:04:22.394
Hit send,
thinking there were probably

00:04:22.394 --> 00:04:25.998
three people in the world
that would fit that.

00:04:25.998 --> 00:04:31.103
Within 10 days, I had almost
60 qualified applicants.

00:04:31.403 --> 00:04:34.139
Eighty percent of which
were young women.

00:04:34.606 --> 00:04:38.210
<i> I selected from that,
six extraordinary scientists</i>

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.046
<i> who just happened
 to be young women.</i>

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:46.285
These extraordinary scientists,
dropped everything

00:04:46.285 --> 00:04:48.654
and flew to South Africa
within three weeks.

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:53.626
We'd put together a
60 person expedition.

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:58.030
All the support teams you need,
the safety cavers

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.600
planning this extensive
underground expedition.

00:05:02.067 --> 00:05:07.740
At the same time, this great
society took another risk.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.545
They agreed to do this
live to the world.

00:05:12.878 --> 00:05:18.384
Because I thought, this may be
the last moment in history

00:05:18.384 --> 00:05:21.554
where we actually
can bring the world

00:05:21.554 --> 00:05:24.824
the recovery of
a Fossil Hominid skeleton.

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:28.594 line:0%
<i>And so, they let us create
 this blog and website</i>

00:05:28.594 --> 00:05:30.062 line:0%
all ready to tweet

00:05:30.062 --> 00:05:31.897
and Facebook and blog

00:05:31.897 --> 00:05:33.899
and go live on the day
we went underground.

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:36.101
A very brave move, by the way.

00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:38.704
Because, if I was wrong

00:05:38.704 --> 00:05:41.373
this was going to be a
rather large embarrassment.

00:05:41.373 --> 00:05:45.645
<i> On November the seventh,
 that 60 team expedition</i>

00:05:45.878 --> 00:05:47.479
<i> launched in the field.</i>

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:49.381
<i>Over the next couple of days</i>

00:05:49.381 --> 00:05:52.117
<i> we laid three and
 a half kilometers</i>

00:05:52.117 --> 00:05:55.654
<i> of military grade
 audio-visual cables.</i>

00:05:55.654 --> 00:05:59.926
<i>Cameras, all the machinery
 that we would need</i>

00:05:59.926 --> 00:06:03.329
<i>to conduct this excavation,
 live underground.</i>

00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:06.932
<i> We would create
Command Centers, Caving Tents</i>

00:06:06.932 --> 00:06:10.035
<i> a Science Tent to take
 this skeleton out</i>

00:06:10.035 --> 00:06:11.570
<i>live in front of the world.</i>

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.307
<i>On November 10th, we launched
the Rising Star Expedition.</i>

00:06:15.307 --> 00:06:19.712
There, we sent those
scientists into this cave

00:06:20.012 --> 00:06:21.847
led initially by Matthew.

00:06:21.847 --> 00:06:24.250
And we watched these
amazing images.

00:06:24.684 --> 00:06:27.253
Very quickly,
these amazing scientists

00:06:27.253 --> 00:06:29.121
became known as
"Underground Astronauts".

00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:31.490
And yes, I have received
enough hate mail

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.258
about why they shouldn't
be called, "Astronauts".

00:06:33.258 --> 00:06:36.261
They should be called,
"Terranauts" or "Troglonauts" or

00:06:36.695 --> 00:06:39.632
some other version of
that and I apologize.

00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:44.036
But, I'm not that sorry,
because it really was

00:06:44.036 --> 00:06:46.438
like watching astronauts
on a spacewalk.

00:06:46.438 --> 00:06:48.974
<i> They would get up in the
 safety gear, helmets on</i>

00:06:48.974 --> 00:06:50.142
<i>all this stuff and equipment</i>

00:06:50.142 --> 00:06:51.444
<i> and they would vanish
 from our sights.</i>

00:06:51.444 --> 00:06:54.447
<i> And they would appear in
these black and white images</i>

00:06:54.447 --> 00:06:57.083
<i> as they crawled through
 these cave systems.</i>

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.286
<i>Taking often 40-45 minutes
 to get to that chute</i>

00:07:01.286 --> 00:07:04.056
<i>and then they would vanish
 from our communications</i>

00:07:04.056 --> 00:07:05.724
<i>as they went down this slot</i>

00:07:05.724 --> 00:07:08.427
<i>where they could wear no safety
gear, 'cause it's so tight.</i>

00:07:08.427 --> 00:07:10.496
<i> And they began to
 excavate material.</i>

00:07:10.496 --> 00:07:13.165
<i>And these are the kind of
images that we were watching.</i>

00:07:13.165 --> 00:07:15.034
I could communicate
live with them.

00:07:15.034 --> 00:07:18.504
They couldn't see me,
but I could talk to them.

00:07:19.505 --> 00:07:23.443
<i> The collection began,
 we designed technology</i>

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.944
<i> that had never been used
 before, underground.</i>

00:07:25.944 --> 00:07:27.679
<i>White light, laser scanners</i>

00:07:27.679 --> 00:07:31.650
<i>that were giving us real time
scans on computers like that</i>

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:34.386
<i> down to resolutions of
 0.3 of a millimeter</i>

00:07:34.386 --> 00:07:36.455
<i>as we were mapping underground
 with these scanners.</i>

00:07:36.455 --> 00:07:37.956
<i> It was amazing!</i>

00:07:37.956 --> 00:07:39.658
<i>And material began to come out.</i>

00:07:40.092 --> 00:07:44.663
<i> And by the second day,
we realized, I had been wrong.</i>

00:07:44.663 --> 00:07:47.066
<i> It was not a skeleton.</i>

00:07:47.066 --> 00:07:50.303
It was...
more than one skeleton.

00:07:51.437 --> 00:07:55.741
By day two,
we had three right femurs.

00:07:55.741 --> 00:07:57.510
I assure you, there is
no primate in the world

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.145
that has three right legs.

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:01.547
As we would go, by the
end of the first week

00:08:01.547 --> 00:08:05.818
we had discovered more
Fossil Hominid material

00:08:06.318 --> 00:08:09.788
than in the richest
site ever discovered

00:08:09.788 --> 00:08:13.125
in the search for human
origins in Southern Africa.

00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:14.660
In one week.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:18.097
And I could see that site,
right out my command center

00:08:18.097 --> 00:08:20.199
because it was less
than a mile away.
