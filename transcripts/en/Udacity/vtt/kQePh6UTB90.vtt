00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.150
Thanks again, Dean. Let's cut up the exploration Dean just

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.540
described. First, we should use the set seed function to

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.580
make this reproducible. Running this one line of code will

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.890
also allow you to see the same households in my

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.550
explorations, if you use the same seed number. Now, let's

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.640
sample 16 of the households from our yogurt data set,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.250
from yogurt ID. Notice that I'm sampling from the levels

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.170
because those are all of the different households that I have.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.270
I'll run the code for the sample ID's. And then, I'll

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.830
print out the sample ID's. There's the 16 of them. Now

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.810
we can plot each purchase occasion for each of the households

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.810
that we sampled. We have the time of the purchase, the

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.330
price per item of the yogurt, and the number of items.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.910
Here, I'm using the size parameter to add more detail to

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.220
my plot. I'm passing at the all purchases variable, so that

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.320
way I can consider the number of items in terms of size

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.100
of the point on the plot. So, before I run this

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.180
code, I want you to take a minute to think about

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.650
what type of plot this code will produce. You maybe want

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.650
to pause for a moment and give yourself some time to

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.570
think. Now you might also notice this new syntax here. This

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.490
percent in percent sign. This just tells us to loop over

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.770
the IDs, so that when we go through and create a

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.830
panel plot, for each ID of our households. And here's the plot.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.610
Notice how we get panels for each of the households

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.210
that we had in our sample. From these plots, we

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.190
can see the variation and how often each household buys

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.710
yogurt. Here, a lot and here, not to much. And

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.250
it seems that some household purchases more quantities than others

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.240
with these larger circles indicating not here. For most of

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.210
the households, the price of yogurt holds steady, or tends

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.030
to increase over time. Now, there are, of course, some exceptions,

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.440
like in this household and in this household, and even here,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.820
we might think that the household is using coupons to drive the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.360
price down. Now, we don't have the coupon data to associate with

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.180
this buying data, but you could see how that information could be

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.090
paired to this data to better understand the consumer behavior. So

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.950
now, let's have you do something similar. Your task is to create

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.230
a similar plot and provide your own insights for another set of

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.220
16 houses. I like you to create a discussion post that includes

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.850
your seed number and the title and in the post, you can include an image of your

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.440
plot and any observations that you make. You may

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.170
want to try this for a few households to

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.540
get a better feel for the data and the

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.870
plot. There won't be any solution video here, so

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.570
we'd love to hear from you all and see

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.870
you all discuss what's going on in the discussions.
