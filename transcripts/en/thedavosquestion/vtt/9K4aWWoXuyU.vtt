Randi Zuckerberg &gt;&gt; Hi, my name's Randi and

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:07.839
I'm thrilled that the Obama administration
is doing what they are doing with the internet.

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:12.910
I think that what they are doing to encourage
dialog between constituents and politicians

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.810
all over the world is definitely going to
change the world and change the way that people

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.680
view politics.
I think the Obama administration is inspiring

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.750
international politicians all over the world
to communicate in this way with-ah-their supporters

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.439
and I'm very excited to see how this dialog
grows and democracy on the internet continues

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.690
over the next four years.
