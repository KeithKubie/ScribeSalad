[music playing]

00:00:04.367 --> 00:00:08.567
JASON SILVA: I think that
I was a restless kid,

00:00:08.567 --> 00:00:12.700
a very creative but restless
kid that wanted answers.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.433
So I was afflicted by
the bug of question

00:00:15.433 --> 00:00:17.200
and questioning everything.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.533
And that inquiry sent me
to beautiful spaces of mind

00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:24.600
and imagination, but also
sent me to very dark spaces,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.667
whether it was thinking
about mortality

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:29.867
or thinking about impermanence
and all these horrible things.

00:00:29.867 --> 00:00:34.000
I felt that my way of dealing
with pushing away the darkness

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.734
was by losing myself in
beautiful things, so ineffable,

00:00:38.734 --> 00:00:41.867
transcendent experiences,
the rhapsody of poetry,

00:00:41.867 --> 00:00:44.667
or the high you get from a
beautiful film when it sucks

00:00:44.667 --> 00:00:48.900
you into its wonderland, or
the orgasmic ecstasy of falling

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.233
in love, ineffability, magical
transience spaces of mind that

00:00:54.233 --> 00:00:56.867
were characterized by
feelings of selflessness

00:00:56.867 --> 00:00:58.233
and timelessness.

00:00:58.233 --> 00:01:01.834
So losing yourself
essentially became my escape

00:01:01.834 --> 00:01:03.333
from existential dread.

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:06.600
And I felt like it
was my responsibility

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.667
to find a way of clothing
these numinous experiences.

00:01:10.667 --> 00:01:13.700
That's where the
verbosity, the desire

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.567
to bring back these experiences
and share them with others

00:01:16.567 --> 00:01:17.900
has come from.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.333
So in the same way that a
musician might find inspiration

00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:22.600
and then he composes a song
to describe that [inaudible]

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.900
experience, or the way that a
poet might have some inspired

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.133
rhapsody with a
lover and then he

00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:29.934
comes back and then
writes a few words

00:01:29.934 --> 00:01:31.734
that touch a billion people.

00:01:31.734 --> 00:01:34.033
People say some things just
can't be put into words.

00:01:34.033 --> 00:01:35.166
I disagree.

00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:36.433
I think that's a
form of laziness.

00:01:36.433 --> 00:01:38.767
I think that what's
magical about words

00:01:38.767 --> 00:01:41.333
is that they can be used
to describe everything.

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.667
I really do believe that.

00:01:42.667 --> 00:01:46.567
And so the more complex,
sublime, beautiful,

00:01:46.567 --> 00:01:48.467
and ineffable an
experience, the more

00:01:48.467 --> 00:01:51.767
I want to try and make a piece
of content about what that is.

00:01:51.767 --> 00:01:55.834
It's me in a way having
a creative battle

00:01:55.834 --> 00:01:57.400
against ineffability.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.600
It's like the universe is
saying you cannot explain me.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.133
And I'm like, oh, yes, I can.

00:02:03.133 --> 00:02:05.066
So that's kind of my thing.

00:02:05.066 --> 00:02:07.700
It's a control issue for sure.
