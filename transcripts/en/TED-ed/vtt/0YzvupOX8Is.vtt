00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:18.609
Whether you like it or not,
we use numbers every day.

00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:20.734
Some numbers, such as the speed of sound,

00:00:20.758 --> 00:00:22.458
are small and easy to work with.

00:00:22.482 --> 00:00:24.499
Other numbers, such as the speed of light,

00:00:24.523 --> 00:00:26.868
are much larger
and cumbersome to work with.

00:00:26.892 --> 00:00:29.815
We can use scientific notation
to express these large numbers

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:31.505
in a much more manageable format.

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.855
So we can write
299,792,458 meters per second

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.181
as 3.0 times 10 to the eighth
meters per second.

00:00:41.205 --> 00:00:42.992
Correct scientific notation

00:00:43.016 --> 00:00:45.107
requires that the first term
range in value

00:00:45.131 --> 00:00:47.467
so that it is greater than one
but less than 10,

00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:50.706
and the second term represents
the power of 10 or order of magnitude

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.596
by which we multiply the first term.

00:00:53.156 --> 00:00:56.309
We can use the power of 10 as a tool
in making quick estimations

00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:59.313
when we do not need or care
for the exact value of a number.

00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:01.432
For example, the diameter of an atom

00:01:01.456 --> 00:01:04.281
is approximately 10 to the power
of negative 12 meters.

00:01:04.305 --> 00:01:07.523
The height of a tree is approximately
10 to the power of one meter.

00:01:07.547 --> 00:01:11.154
The diameter of the Earth is approximately
10 to the power of seven meters.

00:01:11.178 --> 00:01:13.868
The ability to use the power of 10
as an estimation tool

00:01:13.892 --> 00:01:15.741
can come in handy every now and again,

00:01:15.765 --> 00:01:18.693
like when you're trying to guess
the number of M&amp;M's in a jar,

00:01:18.717 --> 00:01:21.111
but is also an essential skill
in math and science,

00:01:21.135 --> 00:01:24.052
especially when dealing with
what are known as Fermi problems.

00:01:24.076 --> 00:01:26.858
Fermi problems are named
after the physicist Enrico Fermi,

00:01:26.882 --> 00:01:29.756
who's famous for making rapid
order-of-magnitude estimations,

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.585
or rapid estimations,
with seemingly little available data.

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:35.842
Fermi worked on the Manhattan Project
in developing the atomic bomb,

00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:38.571
and when it was tested
at the Trinity site in 1945,

00:01:38.595 --> 00:01:41.054
Fermi dropped a few pieces
of paper during the blast

00:01:41.078 --> 00:01:43.830
and used the distance they traveled
backwards as they fell

00:01:43.854 --> 00:01:47.356
to estimate the strength of the explosion
as 10 kilotons of TNT,

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.670
which is on the same order of magnitude
as the actual value of 20 kilotons.

00:01:51.694 --> 00:01:54.730
One example of the classic
Fermi estimation problems

00:01:54.754 --> 00:01:56.968
is to determine
how many piano tuners there are

00:01:56.992 --> 00:01:58.855
in the city of Chicago, Illinois.

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:01.141
At first, there seem to be
so many unknowns

00:02:01.165 --> 00:02:03.180
that the problem appears to be unsolvable.

00:02:03.204 --> 00:02:06.132
That is the perfect application
for a power-of-10 estimation,

00:02:06.156 --> 00:02:07.790
as we don't need an exact answer -

00:02:07.814 --> 00:02:09.341
an estimation will work.

00:02:09.365 --> 00:02:12.768
We can start by determining how many
people live in the city of Chicago.

00:02:12.792 --> 00:02:14.364
We know that it is a large city,

00:02:14.388 --> 00:02:17.656
but we may be unsure about exactly
how many people live in the city.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.713
Are the one million people?
Five million people?

00:02:20.737 --> 00:02:22.296
This is the point in the problem

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.178
where many people become frustrated
with the uncertainty,

00:02:25.202 --> 00:02:28.139
but we can easily get through this
by using the power of 10.

00:02:28.163 --> 00:02:30.917
We can estimate the magnitude
of the population of Chicago

00:02:30.941 --> 00:02:32.366
as 10 to the power of six.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.304
While this doesn't tell us exactly
how many people live there,

00:02:35.328 --> 00:02:38.451
it serves an accurate estimation
for the actual population

00:02:38.475 --> 00:02:40.445
of just under three million people.

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.550
So if there are approximately
10 to the sixth people in Chicago,

00:02:43.574 --> 00:02:44.819
how many pianos are there?

00:02:44.843 --> 00:02:47.541
If we want to continue
dealing with orders of magnitude,

00:02:47.565 --> 00:02:49.566
we can either say that one out of 10

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.959
or one out of one hundred
people own a piano.

00:02:51.983 --> 00:02:55.462
Given that our estimate of the population
includes children and adults,

00:02:55.486 --> 00:02:57.121
we'll go with the latter estimate,

00:02:57.145 --> 00:03:00.243
which estimates that there are
approximately 10 to the fourth,

00:03:00.267 --> 00:03:02.191
or 10,000 pianos, in Chicago.

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:05.359
With this many pianos,
how many piano tuners are there?

00:03:05.383 --> 00:03:09.045
We could begin the process of thinking
about how often the pianos are tuned,

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.163
how many pianos are tuned in one day,

00:03:11.187 --> 00:03:13.325
or how many days a piano tuner works,

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.515
but that's not the point
of rapid estimation.

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:17.468
We instead think in orders of magnitude,

00:03:17.492 --> 00:03:21.476
and say that a piano tuner tunes roughly
10 to the second pianos in a given year,

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.651
which is approximately
a few hundred pianos.

00:03:23.675 --> 00:03:26.960
Given our previous estimate
of 10 to the fourth pianos in Chicago,

00:03:26.984 --> 00:03:31.083
and the estimate that each piano tuner can
tune 10 to the second pianos each year,

00:03:31.107 --> 00:03:34.940
we can say that there are approximately
10 to the second piano tuners in Chicago.

00:03:34.964 --> 00:03:36.796
Now, I know what you must be thinking:

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.598
How can all of these estimates
produce a reasonable answer?

00:03:39.622 --> 00:03:41.034
Well, it's rather simple.

00:03:41.058 --> 00:03:42.837
In any Fermi problem, it is assumed

00:03:42.861 --> 00:03:45.988
that the overestimates and underestimates
balance each other out,

00:03:46.012 --> 00:03:47.227
and produce an estimation

00:03:47.251 --> 00:03:50.491
that is usually within one order
of magnitude of the actual answer.

00:03:50.515 --> 00:03:53.340
In our case we can confirm this
by looking in the phone book

00:03:53.364 --> 00:03:55.686
for the number of piano tuners
listed in Chicago.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.344
What do we find? 81.

00:03:57.368 --> 00:04:00.209
Pretty incredible, given
our order-of-magnitude estimation.

00:04:00.233 --> 00:04:02.600
But, hey - that's the power of 10.
