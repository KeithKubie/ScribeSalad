00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.840
As you know India is a land of about 1.3 billion people,

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.480
has a big demographic divide

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.560
with people of multiple income levels,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.640
multiple literacy levels, multiple languages.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.600
What technology can do is to create a common layer

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.760
and can actually improve the quality of life of people.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.640
I think the greatest tool we have today in front of us is the smartphone.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.680
And, there's a hell of a lot of things you can do with that

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.320
and real world problems you can solve with that.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.200
A mobile phone along with an internet connectivity

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.720
just makes everybody stand at the same level.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.000
HealthifyMe is India's largest health and fitness app.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.840
Slowly but surely, an app a day we are keeping

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.960
the health momentum and revolution going in the country.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.440
There were no calorie counting tools for this country.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.360
And we are the diabetic and heart problems capital of the world.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.560
And I felt thatâ€™s a problem of hundreds of millions of Indians

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.480
and someone had to build Indian nutritional database.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.160
UrbanClap is an app which helps you

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.000
buy very high quality and trusted home services

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.600
everything from a beautician to an interior designer

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.880
and everything else in the middle.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.520
If you look at the service professional ecosystem in India,

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.800
the vast majority of these people,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.520
even though they're good at their craft,

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.600
make ten to fifteen thousand rupees a month.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.840
And multiple reasons hinder them from becoming

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.200
a fully organised micro-service entrepreneur

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.480
who can make forty/ fifty/ sixty thousand rupees a month

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.840
and be a real part of India's middle class.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.200
RailYatri is about helping travellers in India

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.280
who use railways as a mode of transportation

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.680
to make smart decisions.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.120
We have gotten used to tracking an envelope

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.760
going from one part of the country to the other part of the world,

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.520
why can't we track about half a kilometre long train?

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.640
We clearly knew that people use

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.240
language for content consumption.

00:01:43.474 --> 00:01:45.400
If you look at the readership of newspapers,

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.277
if you look at the readership of Bollywood movies,

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.560
I mean, they are all in local languages.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.880
So, that came intuitively

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.714
rather than any market research done around it,

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.720
we intuitively thought about that as a core pivot and

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.759
a core reason why people will use our app.

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.077
DailyHunt app is one of the most popular apps in the country.

00:02:00.077 --> 00:02:03.520
95% of our consumption is in local languages which is non-English.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.992
Today the app is used by three million users everywhere.

00:02:05.992 --> 00:02:08.632
We have got nearly 200 coaches and nutritionists

00:02:08.632 --> 00:02:09.592
spread all over the country

00:02:09.592 --> 00:02:11.712
and our app is one of the highest rated apps in India.

00:02:11.712 --> 00:02:16.158
On a monthly basis, we are reaching to about nine million people.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.076
Over a period of time now, we have added

00:02:18.076 --> 00:02:20.396
all the routes, hospitals, information and all.

00:02:20.918 --> 00:02:23.358
We have about seventy thousand service partners,

00:02:23.358 --> 00:02:25.278
who use our app literally every single day.

00:02:25.231 --> 00:02:28.407
We continue to serve more than ten thousand customers every single day.

00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:31.375
We want to create a million jobs in the service sector in India.

00:02:31.375 --> 00:02:33.775
I think my suggestion to everybody

00:02:33.775 --> 00:02:36.695
who is thinking about doing something of their own

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.380
is don't be scared.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.380
Nobody to the best of my knowledge, has died of entrepreneurship.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.711
If you've got a great idea, just keep at it!

00:02:44.712 --> 00:02:46.312
You need to get out of your offices

00:02:46.312 --> 00:02:48.072
and go into the real Bharat in India

00:02:48.078 --> 00:02:50.518
if you really want to build an app

00:02:50.518 --> 00:02:51.998
which has to be successful in India.
