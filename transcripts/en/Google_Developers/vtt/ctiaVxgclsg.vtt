TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.530
I am Timothy Jordan, and
this is an introduction

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.340
to Android Auto.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.550
Commuters in the US spend
an average of one hour a day

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.330
in their car, and a person
checks their smartphone

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.900
an average of 125 times per day.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.410
Now, cars get us
where we're going,

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.990
while our phones
keep us connected.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.730
But using your phone while
driving can be distracting.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.170
In fact, 25% of
accidents in the US

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.540
are caused by people
fumbling with their phones.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.270
What if you could stay
connected using your phone,

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.300
but in a safer and
more convenient

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.400
way that's integrated
with your car?

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.550
And better yet,
what if developing

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.550
for this new platform
was easy and familiar?

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.450
Welcome to Android Auto,
bringing Android to the car.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.060
It's the same
platform you already

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.240
use for phones, tablets,
televisions, watches, and more.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.670
In fact, all these experiences
will often be in the same APK.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.040
But now, your app
can also extend

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.290
to the car in a way
that's safer and more

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.290
efficient for the driver,
so they can stay connected,

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.880
but with their
hands on the wheel

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.000
and their eyes on the road.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.270
Now, using Android Auto is easy.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.930
Users go to the Google Play
Store and download apps

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.090
onto their phone that
support Android Auto.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.300
They then connect
their phone to the car.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.580
The phone goes into Car mode
and casts the Android Auto

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.560
experience to the car's screen.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.640
Now, this means that although
all the apps and services are

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.800
actually running on
the phone, they're

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.840
displayed in the car's dash.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.880
And you can interact with them
using the vehicle's controls,

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.710
such as a built-in
touchscreen and microphone.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.840
You know what?

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.420
Let me show you how this works.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.265
So I'm here in the
Android Auto building,

00:01:41.265 --> 00:01:42.950
where the team's
getting some developer

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.700
tools ready for all of us.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.700
Now, let's see if I can find
Daniel and borrow his car.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.520
Hey, Daniel.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.770
DANIEL: Hey, Timothy.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.380
TIMOTHY JORDAN: How's it going?

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.450
DANIEL: Good times for
Android Auto developers.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.658
Getting ready for the launch.

00:01:57.658 --> 00:02:00.280
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah,
it's going to be awesome.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.600
Hey, the jet pack's working!

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.520
OK.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.509
So I'm sitting in a
brand new Kia Soul.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.630
And some people like this car
for the panoramic sunroof.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.880
I like it for Android Auto.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.790
I'm going to connect
my phone to the car.

00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:23.790
And you'll see it
goes into Car mode.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.030
I'll touch here, and Android
Auto starts up in the car.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.430
Cool, huh?

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.020
Now, this is the
overview screen.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.670
It's where you start, and
it contains contextual cards

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.540
based on the location,
the time of day, and more.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.860
It's also the place where I
can find my notifications.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.030
The activity bar is
here at the bottom,

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.300
and it contains a set
of common actions--

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:50.170
Navigation, Communication,
Audio, and car-related stuff.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.170
You'll also notice
the microphone up here

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.920
in the corner.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.500
I'll get back to
that in a moment.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.680
But first, let's
play some music.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.016
Let's tap here and
play this song.

00:03:01.016 --> 00:03:04.467
[MUSIC THE MOWGLI'S, "SAN
 FRANCISCO"]

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.710
You'll notice that even though
I'm in someone else's car,

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.640
everything is
running on my phone.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.110
So it's all my stuff,
from my notifications

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.680
to my Play music account.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.069
Anyhow, right now
we're in the App view.

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.360
Now, this is one of the most
interesting things for you

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.300
as a developer, because this
is where your app lives.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.660
For user interface
consistency and to ensure

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.740
that all apps adhere to
the same safety guidelines,

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.130
the Android Auto framework
will display your app

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.360
in the standard UI template.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.580
Now, this is also
what makes it so easy

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.280
to extend your app for Auto.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.700
You don't need to worry about
the wide variety of display

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.050
configurations,
resolutions, different input

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.520
controls, or even that much
about driver distraction.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.590
You just provide resources, such
as image assets, strings, color

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.750
palette, and supported
playback controls

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.730
to customize your
app without having

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.180
to define the entire
user interface yourself.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.470
[BING]

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.130
Oh, hey, look, a text
message from Wayne.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.674
I'll just tap it to play.

00:04:06.674 --> 00:04:07.590
ANDROID: Hey, Timothy.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.630
I hear you lifted
an Android Auto car.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.165
Wanna ghost-ride it?

00:04:11.165 --> 00:04:13.790
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Now, this is the
other really interesting thing

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.350
for you as a developer right
now-- message notifications.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.880
You can take advantage of
these by using the Car extender

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.420
in the same way you use
the Wearable extender

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.897
for Android Wear.

00:04:23.897 --> 00:04:25.480
Now, the last thing
I want to show you

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.380
is the voice interface,
which is where

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.070
I can reply to text
messages or search.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.610
I just need to
tap the microphone

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.300
in the top right of the screen.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.100
[BING]

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.487
Define "joy riding."

00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:41.320
ANDROID: Joy riding--
the action or practice

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.892
of driving fast and dangerously
in a stolen car for enjoyment.

00:04:45.892 --> 00:04:47.850
TIMOTHY JORDAN: [LAUGHS]
This thing is awesome.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:48.160
All right.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.180
Let's head back to the
studio and wrap this up.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:55.190
OK.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.160
Just a few last things.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.080
Android Auto works by
projecting apps and services

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.100
running on the user's phone
onto the car's screen.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.360
Now, this means you just need
to extend your existing Android

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.560
apps to work on the car.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.950
And there's two great use
cases for that today--

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.340
audio and messaging.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.565
Audio apps, such as music,
radio, and audio book players--

00:05:16.565 --> 00:05:18.940
which are an awesome way to
stay entertained while you're

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.250
driving-- can now be
extended to the car.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.880
APIs are available to expose
content, receive playback

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.040
control, and customize the UI.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.050
Messaging applications,
which are a great way

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.210
to stay connected
while you're driving,

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.140
can now be extended
to the car, as well.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.480
Now, APIs are available to
show notifications, play back

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.570
the message, and
reply with speech.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.400
Android Auto brings the
Android platform to the car.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.470
You can simply extend
your existing app

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.350
to work in the car,
allowing drivers

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.380
to be connected to
their virtual worlds

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.710
while staying focused
on the road ahead.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.250
Please check out these
great developer resources

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.830
at this URL.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.280
I'm Timothy Jordan, and
I'll see you on the road.
