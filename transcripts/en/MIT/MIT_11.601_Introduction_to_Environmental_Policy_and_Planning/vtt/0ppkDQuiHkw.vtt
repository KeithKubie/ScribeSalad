00:00:10.104 --> 00:00:11.270
GUEST SPEAKER: Good morning.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.580
Thank you for
inviting me here today

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.620
to speak to you about
the liquefied natural gas

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.630
facility in Boston Harbor.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.300
Based on my experience as
director of the Boston Harbor

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.690
Associates, I believe that
the risks of this LNG facility

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.000
are too high and that
a new risk assessment

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.940
is needed to properly
evaluate these risks.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.440
This morning I'd
like to tell you

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.660
about the problems with
the current risk assessment

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.940
and then provide my
recommendations for a new risk

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.030
assessment going forward.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.340
As you know LNG has a very--

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.940
it comes with the
possibility of a gas

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.480
leak, which could lead to a
fire and a large explosion.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.880
Although this happening
is fairly unlikely,

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.490
the severity of the damages that
would happen if it did occur

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.820
would be extremely large.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.690
And risks are
greater when LNG is

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.727
transported through the water.

00:00:58.727 --> 00:01:01.060
If a spill occurs in water,
it would spread more quickly

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.950
and be more
difficult to contain.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.549
So we can expect that if a spill
did happen in Boston Harbor,

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:08.090
it would be very
difficult to manage.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.964
It would quickly spread
to the Harbor Islands

00:01:09.964 --> 00:01:14.440
and also around the city, and
could cause a large explosion

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.320
that would not only have
major damage on infrastructure

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.300
and property, but
also could cause

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.119
a major loss of human life.

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.160
I know that you're all
well aware of these risks,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.618
but you probably are assuming
that the risk assessment that

00:01:26.618 --> 00:01:28.870
was done when the
facility was built--

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.560
several decades ago-- accurately
takes into account these risks.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.810
However, I believe that
there are major problems

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.246
with that risk assessment.

00:01:37.246 --> 00:01:38.620
First of all, the
risk assessment

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.010
assumes that everything
possible to manage these risks

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.030
is being done.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.150
It doesn't leave any possibility
for human error or negligence,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.810
or any mistakes happening.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.940
However, there's very
little evaluation

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.460
to ensure that all of
these safety measures

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.720
are being taken
100% of the time.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.080
There's site visits by
the regulatory agency

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.940
only several times
a year, and these

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.310
are announced ahead of time.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.010
So they don't accurately reflect
whether the safety measures are

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.350
being taken day in and day out.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.789
We know that human
error can lead

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.560
to major industrial accidents.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.440
Just look at the case of
Three Mile Island, where

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.680
the accident was made worse
by inadequate training

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.670
and the plant operators failing
to respond to the problem

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.680
as it was unfolding and
making the problem worse.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.990
So given that we know that
human error and negligence can

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.810
lead to major accident, I'd
like to propose a new risk

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.700
assessment that takes
these into account.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.230
My recommendation for
a new risk assessment

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.560
follows a 2-step process, in
which the estimation of risk

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.570
is separate from the
decision making process.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.700
So in the first step,
the government--

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.760
all of your
respective agencies--

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.560
with input from
the public, would

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.590
determine what level of risk
it is willing to accept.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.290
For example, is it willing to
accept some water pollution

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.860
permanently?

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.360
What about property damage?

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.070
What about loss of life?

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.992
What level of risk can you,
as a society, tolerate?

00:03:06.992 --> 00:03:08.950
It's very important that
you involve the public

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.324
in determining the level of risk
that you're willing to accept.

00:03:12.324 --> 00:03:14.740
Not only will this help them
feel like they have ownership

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.350
in the decision that
effects their home,

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.610
but it will also help them think
about the likelihood of risk

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.790
and whether this
technology is appropriate.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.990
While I'm sure that they're
not necessarily scared

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.540
about the risks, but rather
that they understand what

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.670
might happen with
this technology.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.640
So after you've determined
what level of risk

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.280
you, as a society,
are willing to accept,

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.620
I would recommend that you
hire a group of scientists

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.780
to conduct the risk
assessment itself,

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.160
and to figure out both
the harms from a gas

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.794
leak that are possible and the
likelihood of this occurring.

00:03:47.794 --> 00:03:49.210
In addition, it's
really important

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.960
that as part of this
risk assessment,

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.780
you assume that some degree
of human error will occur

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.750
and that safety measures will
not be followed all the time.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.930
The scientists can estimate this
based on accidents at other LNG

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.480
facilities around the world,
and what led to these accidents,

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.940
and whether or not
safety measures were

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.235
being followed there.

00:04:07.235 --> 00:04:09.590
After the risk
assessment is completed,

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.990
the government can
look at the results

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.870
and decide whether it meets the
previously set determination

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.380
of risk that the society
is willing to accept.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.390
And if it does, to go forward
and keep the facility open,

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.940
and if not, close the facility.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.330
One important thing
to note is that if you

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.220
do decide to keep
the facility open,

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.470
it's very important that
there is a mechanism in place

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.590
for regular monitoring
of safety at the plant,

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.180
and to ensure that
all of the safety

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.429
measures that were assumed
and the risk assessment are

00:04:40.429 --> 00:04:43.880
actually being followed.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.280
Finally, it's very important
to compare the alternatives.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.280
LNG, natural gas, is a
major source of energy,

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.890
especially for heating,
in the Boston area.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.490
And if it's found too risky, we
need to replace this facility

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.240
with another source of energy.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.940
So whether that comes
from natural gas

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.210
through pipelines,
or oil heating,

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.070
or some kind of
renewable energy,

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.507
all of these energy sources
have some kind of risk.

00:05:06.507 --> 00:05:08.840
So it's important to measure
the risks of those as well,

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.500
and make sure that we're
not replacing the LNG

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.050
with something even riskier.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.290
So to conclude, I believe
that the risks of this LNG

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.290
facility in Boston
Harbor are very high,

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.990
and that the current risk
assessment is inadequate.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.510
I hope you'll follow my
recommendations for a new risk

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.000
assessment that better
takes into account both

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.670
the dangers of this technology
and the level of risk

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.940
that society is
willing to accept.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.670
Thank you.
