00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.570
We were given two dice to roll.

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.930
One is black with six sides.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.050
The other is white
with four sides.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.490
So a four-sided die is kind
of a pyramid-looking thing.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.420
It has exactly four sides.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.370
It would be a pyramid
with a triangular base.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.078
For a given roll, what
is the probability

00:00:17.078 --> 00:00:19.900
that the dice add up to 10?

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.340
If it helps, you may select
the matching outcomes below.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.610
Your selections aren't
checked with your answer.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.230
So this might look a little
bit strange at first.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.688
You're like, what
is this triangle?

00:00:28.688 --> 00:00:32.940
This triangle is the face
of the four-sided die

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.570
that is facing you.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.740
So this is the roll
of the four-sided die.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.380
So this is a roll of 1 and 1.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.089
So these clearly are
not adding up to 10.

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:43.254
So let's think about all
the ones that add up to 10.

00:00:43.254 --> 00:00:44.316
So this adds up to 2.

00:00:44.316 --> 00:00:46.510
This adds up to 3.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.580
This adds up to 4.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.137
This adds up to 5.

00:00:50.137 --> 00:00:51.720
Let's see what
actually adds up to 10.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.560
So if we go all the way-- so
clearly, if we get a 4 and a 6,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.450
that's going to add up to 10.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.010
And are there any
other possibilities

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.860
that add up to 10?

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.440
Well, the highest possible roll
I can get on a four-sided die

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.790
is a 4.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.010
So that's my best scenario.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.660
That's the highest
possible roll.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.270
And even if I get that, I still
need the highest possible roll

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.650
on the six-sided die.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.650
So this is the only
scenario that adds up to 10.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.316
You can look at any
of these other ones.

00:01:18.316 --> 00:01:20.250
They'll add up to
something less than 10.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.130
So there's one possibility
that satisfies our constraints.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.960
The dice add up to 10.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.750
And how many total equally
likely possibilities

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:29.530
were there?

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.030
Let's see.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.930
This grid shows all the
equally likely possibilities.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.120
This is 1, 2, 3, 4
times 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.970
There are 24 equally
likely possibilities,

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.320
and that comes from you
have 6 possibilities

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.376
from the six-sided die
times 4 possibilities

00:01:45.376 --> 00:01:46.750
from the four-sided
die gives you

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.440
24 equally likely possibilities.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.440
Only one satisfies
the constraint

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.520
that the dice add up to 10.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.390
Let's do a few more of these.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.280
So you're given two
six-sided dice to roll.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.990
For a given roll, what
is the probability

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.500
that the dice add to 6?

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.340
So here we have the
tops of both of my dice.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.786
And now what are all the
scenarios where the dice add up

00:02:12.786 --> 00:02:13.285
to 6?

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.950
Well, let's think about this.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.640
If I have a 1 and a 5,
that's going to add up to 6.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.650
In this entire column,
that's the only way

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.320
that I add up to 6.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.260
Right over here, let's see.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.550
If I have a 2 on the black
die, then I'm going to need a 4

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.410
on the white die to add up to 6.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.620
If I have a 3 on the black
die, I'm going to need a 3

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.572
on the white die to add up to 6.

00:02:38.572 --> 00:02:40.780
If I have a 4 on the black
die, I'm going to need a 2

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.990
on the white die.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.550
If I have a 5 on the black
die, I'm going to need a 1

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.620
on the white die.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.370
And then if I have 6
six on the black die,

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.190
it's actually impossible that
the sum will be exactly 6.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.790
So there's no zero
on the white die.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.510
So none of these
meet the constraint.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.790
So here I have one, two,
three, four, five possibilities

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.060
where my dice add up to 6.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.620
So I have five
possibilities out of a total

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.070
of 36 equally likely ones.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.950
This is a six by
six grid, and it

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.490
comes from six
possibilities for one

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.120
die times six possibilities
for the other die.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.690
So 5 possibilities
satisfy my constraint

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.371
out of a total of 36.

00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:19.120
Let's do one more.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.410
This is actually a lot of fun.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.692
You're given two
six-sided dice to roll.

00:03:26.692 --> 00:03:28.400
For a given roll, what
is the probability

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.720
at least one die is a six?

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.540
So let's see.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.700
So we just have to look
for all of the situations

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.500
where at least one
of the dice is a six.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.870
So that one, that one.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.492
Every time I see a six, I
should just click on that.

00:03:44.492 --> 00:03:45.436
That one.

00:03:45.436 --> 00:03:46.130
That one.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.554
And then obviously all of these
scenarios right over here.

00:03:49.554 --> 00:03:51.720
So these are all of the
scenarios where at least one

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.990
of the dice is a six.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.390
Here, of course, is where
both of the dice are a six.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.000
So how many scenarios are there?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.900
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.640
So there are 11
possibilities out

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.220
of a total of 36
equally likely ones.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.560
Remember, 6 times 6.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.730
There's 36 equally
likely outcomes.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.400
So let's check our answer.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.404
And we got it right.
