00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now we talked about the easy thing, which is the mean.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We're now going to move on to a much more challenging proof which is the σ².

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I once again started with the probability of data

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
which is the very familiar product expression over here.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And let me lay out the entire proof for you.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
As before, we start with the probability of data and as before we take the logarithm of it.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And since I've already done this, I'll just restate what we previously derived.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This would look familiar. If not, go back and watch the previous video.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Now the key thing is that we take the derivative of spectral sigma.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Let me lay out the entire proof for you. So here's how it looks.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We take the logarithm this time with respect to sigma of all expression

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
to arrive with this thing over here.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We simplify this by multiplying something into here, factor out something over here,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and we arrive at our desired result.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Plug in those numbers as before.

00:01:00.000 --> 99:59:59.000
There's a total of 10 of those for seven open expressions on the left.
