00:00:12.936 --> 00:00:16.351
It was October 13, 2012,

00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:18.489
a day that I will never forget.

00:00:18.892 --> 00:00:24.408
I was on my bike, pushing up what seemed
like a never-ending barren hill.

00:00:24.432 --> 00:00:26.246
And it wasn't just any hill:

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.000
it was a 15-mile climb
up to a town called Hawi

00:00:30.024 --> 00:00:32.205
on the Big Island of Hawaii.

00:00:32.776 --> 00:00:34.721
And it wasn't just any ride:

00:00:34.745 --> 00:00:37.323
it was at the Ironman World Championship.

00:00:37.926 --> 00:00:40.862
I can still feel my muscles burning.

00:00:40.886 --> 00:00:43.434
I was struggling, tired and dehydrated,

00:00:43.458 --> 00:00:45.084
as I could feel the heat

00:00:45.108 --> 00:00:48.838
emanating from the asphalt,
measuring almost 98 degrees.

00:00:49.727 --> 00:00:52.045
I was near the halfway point
of the bike portion

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:55.028
of one of the most prestigious, longest,

00:00:55.052 --> 00:00:57.687
single-day endurance race
events in the world.

00:00:59.346 --> 00:01:01.100
Every year, during my childhood,

00:01:01.124 --> 00:01:04.101
I watched this very race on TV
in our family living room.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.554
I sat next to my dad on our 1970s-style
orange and brown sofa,

00:01:09.578 --> 00:01:11.460
and I remember being in utter awe

00:01:11.484 --> 00:01:14.508
at how these athletes
pushed themselves to their limit

00:01:14.532 --> 00:01:15.863
in this grueling race.

00:01:15.887 --> 00:01:17.856
And just so you don't get the wrong idea,

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.306
my family members weren't just spectators.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.481
They were incredibly athletic,

00:01:22.505 --> 00:01:25.503
and I always participated
from the sidelines,

00:01:25.527 --> 00:01:29.963
cheering on my three siblings
or handing out water at local races.

00:01:29.987 --> 00:01:34.392
I remember wanting so badly
to be able to compete, but I couldn't.

00:01:35.475 --> 00:01:37.269
Even though I couldn't play sports,

00:01:37.293 --> 00:01:39.507
I decided to be active in my community.

00:01:39.531 --> 00:01:42.394
I volunteered at the local
hospital in high school.

00:01:42.418 --> 00:01:45.569
In college, I interned at the White House,

00:01:45.593 --> 00:01:46.919
studied abroad in Spain

00:01:46.943 --> 00:01:49.450
and backpacked through Europe
all by myself

00:01:49.474 --> 00:01:51.172
with my leg braces and crutches.

00:01:51.807 --> 00:01:56.232
Upon graduating, I moved to New York City
for a job in management consulting,

00:01:56.256 --> 00:01:58.209
earned an MBA, got married

00:01:58.233 --> 00:02:00.089
and now have a daughter.

00:02:00.457 --> 00:02:03.811
(Applause)

00:02:03.835 --> 00:02:08.201
At age 28, I was introduced
to the sport of hand-cycling,

00:02:08.225 --> 00:02:10.236
and then triathlon,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.299
and by luck, I met Jason Fowler,
an Ironman World Champion,

00:02:14.323 --> 00:02:17.056
at a camp for athletes with disabilities.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.874
And like me, he competed in a wheelchair.

00:02:19.898 --> 00:02:23.114
And with his encouragement, at age 34,

00:02:23.138 --> 00:02:25.342
I decided to go after Kona.

00:02:26.291 --> 00:02:28.167
The Kona, or Hawaii Ironman

00:02:28.191 --> 00:02:31.559
is the oldest Iron-distance
race in the sport,

00:02:31.583 --> 00:02:35.709
and if you're not familiar,
it's like the Super Bowl of triathlon.

00:02:35.733 --> 00:02:38.091
And the Ironman,
for a wheelchair athlete like me,

00:02:38.115 --> 00:02:42.301
consists of a 2.4-mile open-water swim
in the Pacific Ocean,

00:02:42.325 --> 00:02:45.952
a 112-mile hand cycle ride
in lava fields --

00:02:45.976 --> 00:02:47.381
now, that sounds exotic,

00:02:47.405 --> 00:02:50.564
but it's not as scenic as it sounds,
and it's pretty desolate --

00:02:50.588 --> 00:02:53.636
and then you top it off with a marathon,

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.281
or a 26.2-mile run in 90-degree heat

00:02:57.305 --> 00:02:59.438
using a racing wheelchair.

00:02:59.462 --> 00:03:06.033
That's right, it's a total distance
of 140.6 miles using just your arms

00:03:06.057 --> 00:03:08.120
in less than 17 hours.

00:03:08.596 --> 00:03:12.502
No female wheelchair athlete
had ever completed the race

00:03:12.526 --> 00:03:16.271
because of the strict,
seemingly impossible cutoff times.

00:03:17.034 --> 00:03:18.229
And so there I was,

00:03:19.102 --> 00:03:21.281
putting it all out on the line.

00:03:21.967 --> 00:03:25.512
And when I finally reached the top
of that 15-mile climb,

00:03:25.536 --> 00:03:27.146
I was discouraged.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.051
There was no way I was going
to make that swim in my time limit

00:03:31.075 --> 00:03:32.226
of 10 and a half hours,

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.995
because I was almost two hours off pace.

00:03:36.365 --> 00:03:39.713
I had to make the agonizing decision

00:03:39.737 --> 00:03:40.887
to quit.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.466
I removed my timing chip,
and I handed it over to a race official.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.162
My day was done.

00:03:48.377 --> 00:03:51.233
My best friend Shannon
and my husband Shawn

00:03:51.257 --> 00:03:54.812
were waiting at the top of Hawi
to drive me back to town.

00:03:54.836 --> 00:03:57.476
And on my way back to town,
I began to cry.

00:03:58.191 --> 00:03:59.341
I had failed.

00:04:00.111 --> 00:04:03.865
My dream of completing
the Ironman World Championship

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:05.588
was crushed.

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:07.026
I was embarrassed.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.430
I felt like I'd messed up.

00:04:09.454 --> 00:04:12.955
I worried about what my friends,
my family and people at work

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:14.201
would think of me.

00:04:14.225 --> 00:04:16.860
What was I going to put on Facebook?

00:04:16.884 --> 00:04:18.034
(Laughter)

00:04:18.058 --> 00:04:20.026
How was I going to explain to everyone

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:23.096
that things didn't go the way
I had assumed or planned?

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:28.375
A few weeks later I was talking
to Shannon about the Kona "disaster,"

00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:29.661
and she said this to me:

00:04:30.546 --> 00:04:35.467
"Minda, big dreams and goals can only
be realized when you're ready to fail."

00:04:36.033 --> 00:04:39.946
I knew I had to put that failure behind me
in order to move forward,

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.027
and it wouldn't be the first time
that I had faced insurmountable odds.

00:04:44.752 --> 00:04:46.693
I was born in Bombay, India,

00:04:46.717 --> 00:04:50.479
and just before my first birthday,
I contracted polio,

00:04:50.503 --> 00:04:53.256
which left me paralyzed
from the hips down.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.858
Unable to care for me, my birth mother
left me at an orphanage.

00:04:58.538 --> 00:05:01.268
Fortunately, I was adopted
by an American family,

00:05:01.292 --> 00:05:03.265
and I moved to Spokane, Washington

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:05.271
just shortly after my third birthday.

00:05:05.753 --> 00:05:08.801
Over the next few years,
I underwent a series of surgeries

00:05:08.825 --> 00:05:11.634
on my hips, my legs and my back

00:05:11.658 --> 00:05:14.578
that allowed me to walk
with leg braces and crutches.

00:05:15.432 --> 00:05:18.594
As a child, I struggled
with my disability.

00:05:19.196 --> 00:05:21.370
I felt like I didn't fit in.

00:05:21.788 --> 00:05:24.022
People stared at me all the time,

00:05:24.046 --> 00:05:27.523
and I was embarrassed
about wearing a back brace and leg braces,

00:05:27.547 --> 00:05:30.641
and I always hid my chicken legs
under my pants.

00:05:30.977 --> 00:05:34.407
As a young girl, I thought thick,
heavy braces on my legs

00:05:34.431 --> 00:05:36.406
did not look pretty or feminine.

00:05:37.465 --> 00:05:42.639
Among my generation, I am one
of the very few individuals in the US

00:05:42.663 --> 00:05:45.131
who are living with paralysis
by polio today.

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.801
Many people who contract polio
in developing countries

00:05:48.825 --> 00:05:52.373
do not have access to the same
medical care, education,

00:05:52.397 --> 00:05:55.206
or opportunities
like I have had in America.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.571
Many do not even live to reach adulthood.

00:05:59.362 --> 00:06:02.918
I have the humbling knowledge
that, had I not been adopted,

00:06:02.942 --> 00:06:05.541
I most certainly
wouldn't be in front of you today.

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:08.224
I may not even be alive.

00:06:09.541 --> 00:06:11.801
All of us, in our own lives,

00:06:11.825 --> 00:06:14.786
may face seemingly insurmountable goals.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.960
I want to share with you what I learned

00:06:16.984 --> 00:06:18.134
when I tried again.

00:06:19.851 --> 00:06:22.653
One year after my first attempt,

00:06:22.677 --> 00:06:25.257
on a sunny Saturday morning,

00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:26.516
my husband Shawn

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.815
dumped me into the ocean at the Kona Pier

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:32.377
and, with 2,500 of my closest
friends and competitors,

00:06:32.401 --> 00:06:35.863
we started swimming as that cannon
went off promptly at 7am.

00:06:35.887 --> 00:06:39.132
I focused on one stroke at a time,
staying in between bodies,

00:06:39.156 --> 00:06:40.370
counting my strokes --

00:06:40.394 --> 00:06:43.338
one, two, three, four --

00:06:43.362 --> 00:06:45.395
and lifting my head to sight
every so often

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:47.404
just so I wouldn't get too off track.

00:06:47.428 --> 00:06:49.382
And when I finally reached the shoreline,

00:06:49.406 --> 00:06:52.726
Shawn picked me up,
and he carried me out of the water.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.861
I was so stunned and thrilled
when Shawn had told me I had managed

00:06:56.885 --> 00:07:00.698
a one-hour-and-43-minute swim time.

00:07:00.722 --> 00:07:02.746
On to the bike segment.

00:07:03.554 --> 00:07:09.458
I had eight hours and 45 minutes
to complete the 112-mile bike course.

00:07:09.968 --> 00:07:13.642
I broke up the course
in seven- to 10-mile segments in my mind

00:07:13.666 --> 00:07:15.969
just to reduce the enormity of the race.

00:07:15.993 --> 00:07:20.588
The first 40 miles, they clipped by
as we benefited from a little tail wind.

00:07:20.612 --> 00:07:24.771
By 4pm, I had made it to mile 94,

00:07:24.795 --> 00:07:28.769
and I did the math and I realized
I was in serious time jeopardy

00:07:28.793 --> 00:07:32.063
because I had 18 miles to go
and less than 90 minutes,

00:07:32.087 --> 00:07:35.333
and that included
a few sizable hill climbs.

00:07:35.357 --> 00:07:37.092
I was stressed out, and I was scared

00:07:37.116 --> 00:07:39.723
that I wasn't going to make
that time cutoff again.

00:07:39.747 --> 00:07:43.548
At this point, I pushed
my internal voice aside that said,

00:07:43.572 --> 00:07:45.769
"This hurts. Quit."

00:07:45.793 --> 00:07:48.433
And I told myself,
"Minda, you better focus.

00:07:48.457 --> 00:07:50.079
Focus on what you can control,

00:07:50.103 --> 00:07:52.694
and that is your attitude
and your effort."

00:07:52.718 --> 00:07:56.322
I resolved to be OK being uncomfortable,

00:07:56.346 --> 00:07:57.926
and I told myself, "Push harder,

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:59.259
forget about the pain,

00:07:59.283 --> 00:08:01.663
and keep that laser focus."

00:08:01.993 --> 00:08:08.087
For the next 90 minutes, I cranked
as though my life depended on it.

00:08:08.971 --> 00:08:10.694
And when I rolled into town,

00:08:10.718 --> 00:08:12.392
I heard on the loudspeaker,

00:08:12.416 --> 00:08:16.804
"Minda Dentler is one of the last
competitors to make the bike cutoff."

00:08:17.701 --> 00:08:18.851
I did it!

00:08:19.289 --> 00:08:24.146
(Applause)

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.948
By only three minutes.

00:08:25.972 --> 00:08:27.373
(Laughter)

00:08:27.397 --> 00:08:30.596
It was 5:27pm,

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.952
and I had been racing
for 10-and-a-half hours.

00:08:34.696 --> 00:08:37.324
The first 10 miles of the run
went pretty quickly,

00:08:37.348 --> 00:08:40.729
as I was so excited to finally pass people

00:08:40.753 --> 00:08:43.738
with my three wheels to their two feet.

00:08:43.762 --> 00:08:45.095
The sun quickly went down,

00:08:45.119 --> 00:08:48.879
and I found myself pulling up
to the bottom of Palani hill,

00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:52.173
looking straight into a half-mile hill
that looked like Mt. Everest

00:08:52.197 --> 00:08:54.602
at mile 124 of the race.

00:08:54.626 --> 00:08:57.047
My friends and family
were ready at their stations

00:08:57.071 --> 00:08:59.428
to talk me up that hill.

00:08:59.452 --> 00:09:00.960
I was struggling, tired,

00:09:00.984 --> 00:09:04.445
desperately gripping those rims
just so I wouldn't tip backwards.

00:09:04.469 --> 00:09:07.143
When I finally reached
the top of that hill,

00:09:07.167 --> 00:09:13.150
I turned left onto a very lonely
15-mile stretch onto the Queen K Highway,

00:09:13.174 --> 00:09:14.739
totally exhausted.

00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:19.438
I pressed on, focusing
on one push at a time.

00:09:20.386 --> 00:09:22.283
By 9:30pm,

00:09:22.307 --> 00:09:26.379
I made that final right-hand turn
onto Ali'i Drive.

00:09:26.403 --> 00:09:30.051
I heard the crowd's roar,
and I was overcome with emotion.

00:09:30.075 --> 00:09:33.187
I crossed that finish line.

00:09:33.211 --> 00:09:40.211
(Applause)

00:09:43.037 --> 00:09:44.252
(Applause ends)

00:09:44.276 --> 00:09:49.117
And my final time
was 14 hours and 39 minutes.

00:09:49.823 --> 00:09:53.149
For the first time in the 35-year history,

00:09:53.173 --> 00:09:55.134
a female wheelchair athlete

00:09:55.158 --> 00:09:57.722
completed the Ironman World Championship.

00:09:57.746 --> 00:10:04.639
(Applause)

00:10:05.879 --> 00:10:07.029
(Applause ends)

00:10:07.053 --> 00:10:09.512
And it wasn't just any female athlete.

00:10:09.536 --> 00:10:10.687
It was me.

00:10:10.711 --> 00:10:12.044
(Laughter)

00:10:12.068 --> 00:10:15.416
A paralyzed orphan from India.

00:10:17.297 --> 00:10:20.991
Against all odds, I achieved my dream,

00:10:21.015 --> 00:10:24.372
and through this very personal
commitment to myself,

00:10:24.396 --> 00:10:27.714
I slowly realized
that completing the Ironman

00:10:27.738 --> 00:10:30.117
was about more than conquering Kona.

00:10:30.588 --> 00:10:32.641
It was about conquering polio

00:10:32.665 --> 00:10:36.596
and other disabling
but preventable diseases,

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.157
not only for myself,

00:10:38.181 --> 00:10:39.761
but for the millions of children

00:10:39.785 --> 00:10:45.054
who have been and still will be
afflicted by vaccine-preventable diseases.

00:10:45.539 --> 00:10:50.286
Today, we are closer than ever
to eliminating one of those diseases

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:51.677
everywhere in the world.

00:10:52.286 --> 00:10:58.991
In the mid-1980s, polio once paralyzed
more than 350,000 children a year

00:10:59.015 --> 00:11:01.664
in more than 125 countries.

00:11:01.688 --> 00:11:05.546
That amounted to a staggering
40 cases an hour.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.837
By contrast, so far this year,

00:11:07.861 --> 00:11:12.035
the last endemic countries
have reported a total of only 12 cases.

00:11:12.997 --> 00:11:19.006
Since 1988, more than 2.5 billion children
have been immunized against polio,

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:21.386
and an estimated 16 million children,

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:24.066
who otherwise would have been
paralyzed like me,

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:25.355
are walking.

00:11:25.875 --> 00:11:27.976
Despite this incredible progress,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.452
we know that until it's eradicated,

00:11:30.476 --> 00:11:33.020
polio remains a very real threat,

00:11:33.044 --> 00:11:36.883
especially to children
in the poorest communities of the world.

00:11:36.907 --> 00:11:40.884
It can reemerge in some of the most remote
and dangerous places,

00:11:40.908 --> 00:11:43.138
and from there, it can spread.

00:11:43.987 --> 00:11:47.424
And so this is my new Ironman:

00:11:47.448 --> 00:11:49.281
to end polio.

00:11:50.005 --> 00:11:52.298
And I am reminded every day,

00:11:52.322 --> 00:11:56.069
when I look at my
two-and-a-half-year-old daughter Maya.

00:11:56.093 --> 00:11:58.601
She is able to climb a ladder in the park,

00:11:58.625 --> 00:12:01.752
push her scooter
or kick a ball across the grass.

00:12:01.776 --> 00:12:05.072
Almost everything
that I see her do at her age

00:12:05.096 --> 00:12:08.618
reminds me of what I could not
do at that age.

00:12:08.642 --> 00:12:10.754
And when she was two months old,

00:12:10.778 --> 00:12:14.967
I took her to get her first polio vaccine.

00:12:15.791 --> 00:12:19.315
And when the doctor came
in the room to prepare the shot,

00:12:19.339 --> 00:12:23.666
I asked him if I could take a picture
to document the moment.

00:12:24.879 --> 00:12:26.342
When we left the room,

00:12:26.366 --> 00:12:29.575
I could feel my eyes
welling up with tears.

00:12:29.599 --> 00:12:32.815
I cried the entire way home.

00:12:33.774 --> 00:12:36.298
It was in that moment that I realized

00:12:36.322 --> 00:12:39.393
that my daughter's life
would be very different from mine.

00:12:39.417 --> 00:12:42.481
She will never be faced
with the crippling disability of polio,

00:12:42.505 --> 00:12:47.110
because a vaccine was available,
and I chose to get her immunized.

00:12:47.134 --> 00:12:49.951
She can do anything she wants,

00:12:51.066 --> 00:12:53.373
as can each of you.

00:12:53.397 --> 00:12:54.471
(Laughter)

00:12:54.495 --> 00:12:57.105
Now I'd like to leave you all
with one question:

00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:00.592
what is your Ironman?

00:13:01.874 --> 00:13:03.025
Thank you.

00:13:03.049 --> 00:13:10.049
(Applause)
