00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
Got a case study for you - let me tell you
about Marie.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.410
She was a healthy woman in her late 30s. She’d
always been an active person, but at some

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.900
point her energy level just seemed limitless.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.419
She was walking the dog four times a day.
Up at five in the morning emailing her co-workers,

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:15.820
and at midnight, she was still awake, like
dusting the ceiling fans.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.340
At first she felt great -- she was super productive!

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.849
But soon she started having trouble sleeping.
She felt anxious all the time. She lost a

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.269
lot of weight and noticed that she felt
hot and sweaty when no one around her

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.009
did. She started experiencing heart palpitations.

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.380
Then one day her vision seemed blurry and
when she looked in the mirror, she was kind

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.120
of surprised to find that her eyes were actually
bulging out of their sockets.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.730
So yeah, she finally called a doctor, because,
you know bulging eyeballs.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.160
Marie’s doctor referred her to an endocrinologist,
who, after running some tests, determined

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.940
that the root of her problems was in her thyroid
gland.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.329
The thyroid is one of the stars of your endocrine
system -- it’s the little butterfly-shaped

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.250
structure located anterior to your trachea
and inferior to the larynx, or voicebox.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.180
It may look cute and unassuming, but don’t
be fooled -- the powerful hormones that it

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.180
produces influence some of your most important
physiological processes.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.600
These hormones, and many others, help maintain
your chemical homeostasis -- the balance in

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.910
concentrations of substances like calcium,
sodium, even water, within very narrow ranges,

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.190
so that your body can provide a consistent
internal environment for your cells.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.070
Your cells and the proteins in them need that
stable environment to function, so if your

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.170
body loses its homeostasis too dramatically,
cellular function will stop, and -- as we

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.870
say here on Crash Course Anatomy &amp; Physiology
-- you will stop being alive.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.130
So your thyroid helps you avoid such a fate,
by secreting hormones that regulate many aspects

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.130
of your body’s homeostasis -- like body
temperature, skin moisture, and your blood’s

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.320
levels of oxygen, calcium, and cholesterol.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.440
It should come as no surprise that, if the
thyroid malfunctions, and produces too much

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.960
or too little of a hormone, it can lead to all
sorts of weird and serious symptoms. And yet,

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.020
thyroid disorders -- and the hormonal imbalances
that accompany them -- are pretty common.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.700
It’s pretty likely that you know at least one person,
most likely a woman, who has experienced

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.850
an issue with a dysfunctional thyroid, and
many more of us are walking around with thyroid

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.850
disorders and haven’t even been diagnosed
yet.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.700
In Marie’s case, it turns out that she had
Graves’ disease -- an immune system disorder

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.700
that results in the overproduction of thyroid
hormones, or hyperthyroidism.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.580
Although it’s just one type of hormone disorder,
looking at her symptoms can help us understand

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.230
just how important, influential, and interconnected
hormones are, and why they need to be properly

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.680
balanced to maintain healthy homeostasis.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.980
And I cannot say this enough -- homeostasis
is life.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.020
Last time, we talked about hormone cascades,
and how a lot of the hormone activity that’s

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.850
bubbling along inside of you is the result
of one kind of hormone bossing around the

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.070
cells that produce another kind of hormone.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.090
These pathways typically start with an internal
stimulus -- often coming from the hypothalamus

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.650
or pituitary gland -- and end in the target
glands that release hormones into the blood,

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.180
to get the real work of living done.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.710
We’ve seen how this kind of cascade controls
your body’s stress response, through the

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:06.260
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, or HPA
axis: Basically, your brain tells your hypothalamus

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.160
to tell your pituitary to light a fire in
your adrenal cortex, and in no time they’ve

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.780
shut down digestion, released a bunch of energy,
increased your blood pressure, and everything

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.370
else you need to either fight or flee.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.420
And that’s great! Your HPA axis is super-useful
when you’re under stress and need to take action.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.980
But you do not need your adrenal cortex spouting
off all the time.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.540
The truth is, much of the more basic, and
more fundamental, business of everyday life

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.850
is carried about by a different kind of cascade.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:37.040
It’s the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid
axis, or HPT axis. And it’s what sets the

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.040
thyroid gland into motion, so it can regulate
just about everything related to your homeostasis.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.480
For example, let’s say you’re caught outside
on a cool day and you’re under-dressed.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.770
So let’s say you were on a bus, busily texting
your bestie, and you got off at a stop

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.650
while searching for the emoji that most accurately
depicted your reaction to the new Avengers

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.980
movie when you realized that you left your
jacket on the seat.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.980
There’s nothing you can do to get your jacket back, but
your hormones can do something about your coldness.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.520
Now, your nervous system of course has its
own ways of detecting and signaling a change

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.290
in temperature, but your endocrine system
gets involved as soon as it senses that the

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.270
temperature of your blood has changed.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.900
Your cooler-than-normal blood flows into your
brain’s hypothalamus, where it bumps up

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.470
against temperature-sensitive sensory neurons,
which act like a kind of thermostat.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.230
Once they detect that the temperature is
below target levels, those neurons secrete

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.740
thyrotropin-releasinghormone, or TRH into the bloodstream.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.400
TRH is a tropic hormone, which means that
it gets the hormone cascade started by triggering

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.990
the release of other hormones.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.470
The cascade starts off with just a trickle,
as TRH goes just a few millimeters to the

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.850
anterior pituitary, where it hits receptors
on cells there, causing it to release thyroid-stimulating

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.190
hormone, or TSH, into the bloodstream.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.680
That then travels down to the thyroid, finds
its receptors, and slaps the gland to attention

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.970
so it releases its own special thyroid hormone
into the blood, where it can affect virtually

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.590
every cell in your body.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.000
Like steroids, thyroid hormone is lipid-soluble,
so it crosses the membrane of its target cell

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.430
to bind inside the nucleus. There, it can
make the cell either increase, decrease, or

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.000
maintain its primary function.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.960
In this case, since you’re feeling chilly,
your body needs to stoke the fire a bit. And

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.760
it does that by burning glucose.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.740
In your cells, “burning” glucose really
means breaking it down so its component parts

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.310
can be used to produce ATP.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.770
Thyroid hormone comes into play when it binds
to receptors inside the nuclei of your muscle

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.280
cells, triggering the transcription of DNA that
makes the enzymes to break down that glucose.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.040
With more of these enzymes flowing around,
more glucose is being broken up, and more

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.190
ATP is being produced -- which is all a long way
of describing the process that we call metabolism.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.199
But since the thyroid has increased the amount
of chemical reactions going on, it also increased

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:44.339
the amount of waste heat that’s being generated.
So this process has a calorigenic, or heat

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.500
producing, effect that helps warm you up.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.639
Now, whether or not you’ve happened to forget
your jacket on the bus and found yourself

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:53.800
shivering on the way to work, your thyroid
hormone produces all kinds of other effects

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.120
as well -- like maintaining your blood pressure,
promoting the growth of tissues, and triggering

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.240
the secretion of digestive juices to keep food moving
through your digestive tract, just to name a few.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.500
So, thyroid hormone for the win, right? What’s
not to love?

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.300
Well, what’s important about the whole HTP
axis is not just how it works -- but also

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.449
how it knows to turn off.

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:16.000
Your glands need negative feedback in order
to know when their job is done, so they can

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.860
stop secreting certain hormones.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.270
That’s where your pituitary and hypothalamus
come in. Remember: They’re always monitoring

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.210
hormone levels in your blood. If there’s
too much thyroid hormone, they both decrease

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:31.030
their own hormone production, to stop stimulating
the thyroid. That in turn reduces thyroid

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.650
hormone levels in the blood, and slows down
your metabolism again, before you get over-heated.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.960
At least, that’s what happens if everything’s
working the way it should.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:41.389
But there are millions of Maries out there,
plenty of people -- maybe even including you

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:47.360
-- who know full well that hormonal imbalances
-- thyroid-related or otherwise -- happen all the time.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.000
Why? Well, thyroid disorders can be caused by
lots of things, but in the case of our Marie,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.560
it’s autoimmune dysfunction.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.300
Normally, when you get sick with a virus or
bacteria or whathaveyou, your immune system

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.100
responds by sending out antibodies that target
those invaders.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.729
Now, we don’t fully understand why yet,
but if you have something like Graves’ disease,

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:08.699
your body produces abnormal antibodies that
target the cells of your thyroid gland itself.

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:12.210
And instead of marking those cells for destruction
like antibodies normally do, they do something

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:17.180
even more bizarre -- they mimic the hormones
that the pituitary gland sends out, which

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.919
bind to the thyroid’s receptors.

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:22.930
So, even though the pituitary dials down its
hormone production, in an effort to get the

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:28.260
thyroid to stop, the thyroid does not get the message,
because the receptors are still being activated.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.740
Basically, the gland never receives any negative
feedback, so it just won’t quit.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.850
And if your thyroid doesn’t stop, it’s
hard for you to stop.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:39.729
So, that’s why Marie was always hot and
sweaty. Her hypothalamus was screaming that

00:07:39.729 --> 00:07:44.150
she was warm enough, but those antibodies
were hijacking the hormone cascade. And she

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.650
was losing weight even though she was eating
all the time, because the thyroid hormone

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.810
was no longer regulating her metabolism properly.

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.990
But what about those big bulging eyes? Remember
those? That was weird.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:56.150
Well, because they’re part of the immune
response, those disruptive antibodies often

00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:00.789
cause inflammation, particularly in the tissues
around the eyes. In some cases the swelling

00:08:00.789 --> 00:08:04.509
can be so severe that the eyes are no longer
able close.

00:08:04.509 --> 00:08:08.220
Treatment for Graves’ disease involves either
inhibiting the production of thyroid hormones

00:08:08.229 --> 00:08:12.149
or blocking their effects -- basically getting
your body chemistry back in order.

00:08:12.149 --> 00:08:16.549
The moral of this story is that hormones mean
business. And by “business” I mean “living.”

00:08:16.549 --> 00:08:21.600
And by “living,” what I really mean is
- and everybody say it together now - homeostasis.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:26.240
In addition to learning to respect your hormones
and thanking them for helping you live, hopefully

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.270
today you learned something today about chemical
homeostasis, and took away a greater understanding

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:36.320
of hormone cascades. Specifically, we looked at the
hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis, or HPT axis,

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.999
and all the ways your body can suffer when that
system, or your hormones in general, get out of whack.
