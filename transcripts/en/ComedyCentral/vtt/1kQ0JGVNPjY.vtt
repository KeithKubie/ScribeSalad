00:00:05.318 --> 00:00:07.727
- [Narrator] Previously on Bro Dependent.

00:00:07.727 --> 00:00:09.547
- Since I'm over at your
place all the time anyway,

00:00:09.547 --> 00:00:11.627
maybe I could, like,
bring some stuff over.

00:00:11.627 --> 00:00:14.411
- Or you could just put an
overnight bag in your car.

00:00:14.411 --> 00:00:16.253
- Oh yeah, yeah, that's a great idea too.

00:00:16.253 --> 00:00:17.384
- What is this?

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:18.217
- My resume.

00:00:18.217 --> 00:00:19.686
- It's five words and a dick.

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:20.702
- Yeah, I drew that.

00:00:20.702 --> 00:00:21.773
- I got my eyesight back

00:00:21.773 --> 00:00:23.657
and I can see things clearer than ever.

00:00:23.657 --> 00:00:25.248
The end, can I go now?

00:00:25.248 --> 00:00:26.723
- That was quite good, Zac.

00:00:26.723 --> 00:00:28.723
- Oh fuck, did I get it?

00:00:31.032 --> 00:00:33.873
(upbeat techno music)

00:00:33.873 --> 00:00:36.668
- Oh, fucking sexy, that's very good.

00:00:36.668 --> 00:00:39.343
Yes, keep going, keep going.

00:00:39.343 --> 00:00:41.510
Oh yes, yes, that's yummy.

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:45.118
We are in the yum zone.

00:00:45.118 --> 00:00:46.232
I love this.

00:00:46.232 --> 00:00:49.040
Oh my God, you guys are too
good at this, you're too good.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.604
Dane, two seconds,
let's have you step out.

00:00:51.604 --> 00:00:53.029
Let's with a couple with Zac and Lexi.

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:54.838
- God bless, great work
everybody, great work.

00:00:54.838 --> 00:00:56.422
- Are you fucking for real, dude?

00:00:56.422 --> 00:00:58.515
We've been doing this for like 15 minutes.

00:00:58.515 --> 00:01:00.132
- Okay, you got somewhere
else you wanna be.

00:01:00.132 --> 00:01:01.682
- Yeah, anywhere.

00:01:01.682 --> 00:01:03.054
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:01:03.054 --> 00:01:04.821
- God, you looked hot out there.

00:01:04.821 --> 00:01:05.654
- Oh.

00:01:05.654 --> 00:01:07.417
- Okay, let's do some couple photos.

00:01:07.417 --> 00:01:09.124
Let's have a little affection in this one.

00:01:09.124 --> 00:01:10.629
Let's do some arms around the shoulders.

00:01:10.629 --> 00:01:12.249
- Oh no, no, no, no dude.

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:14.028
I can't do that, sorry.

00:01:14.028 --> 00:01:14.861
- Why?

00:01:14.861 --> 00:01:19.090
- Because, dude, I'm in a
committed ass relationship.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.034
She's right there.

00:01:21.034 --> 00:01:22.157
Hey Carolyn.

00:01:22.157 --> 00:01:22.990
- Yeah.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.110
- I love you.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.369
- Aww.

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.106
- See no can do, dude.
- Zac, Zac, Zac.

00:01:27.106 --> 00:01:28.051
- You can't be in here.

00:01:28.051 --> 00:01:30.452
No, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, Martin.

00:01:30.452 --> 00:01:31.410
He just burst in,

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.444
there was nothing I could do.
- Jesus, we get it,

00:01:32.444 --> 00:01:34.944
you can do an Austin Powers impression.

00:01:34.944 --> 00:01:38.042
Zac, listen, something huge happened.

00:01:38.042 --> 00:01:39.858
- Cool story.

00:01:39.858 --> 00:01:41.693
- [Anderson] No, I haven't
told the story yet.

00:01:41.693 --> 00:01:43.138
- Marissa, get them off of my set.

00:01:43.138 --> 00:01:43.971
- I'm sorry.

00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:44.804
You have to leave.
- Do you hear it?

00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:45.711
- You're disrupting the shoot.

00:01:45.711 --> 00:01:47.377
- Oh yeah, she does
sound like Austin Powers.

00:01:47.377 --> 00:01:49.744
- (laughs) Yeah, baby.
- I'm from England.

00:01:49.744 --> 00:01:51.796
- Do I make you horny, baby?

00:01:51.796 --> 00:01:53.628
- Swing. (laughs)

00:01:53.628 --> 00:01:56.801
- One million dollars. (laughs)

00:01:56.801 --> 00:01:58.551
- I, Foxxy Cleopatra.

00:01:59.424 --> 00:02:01.728
Seriously, that was like
much when my first erection,

00:02:01.728 --> 00:02:03.750
was like young Beyonce,
as Foxxy Cleopatra.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.583
- [Zac] I get it.

00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:05.912
- I was like, oh, I'm a man now,

00:02:05.912 --> 00:02:07.778
(Zac laughs)
thank you.

00:02:07.778 --> 00:02:09.004
Can we like, talk, dude?

00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:10.681
- (sighs) Fine.

00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:11.722
Let's just go over there.

00:02:11.722 --> 00:02:13.382
This chick is like obsessed with me.

00:02:13.382 --> 00:02:14.382
- Oh, weird.

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.642
Dude, I had this kinda,
like, big interview

00:02:17.642 --> 00:02:20.135
with Lids the other day
and I kinda blew it, dude.

00:02:20.135 --> 00:02:22.904
- Dude, that'd be perfect
for you, you love hats.

00:02:22.904 --> 00:02:24.867
- I know, dude, I was so bummed.

00:02:24.867 --> 00:02:26.819
I, like, went home and just treated myself

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.706
to a consolation bong.

00:02:28.706 --> 00:02:30.670
But even that, like,
didn't work out for me.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:31.936
Like I got all panicky
and I was just like,

00:02:31.936 --> 00:02:34.474
Anderson it's not your day,

00:02:34.474 --> 00:02:36.526
just switch over to OxyContin.

00:02:36.526 --> 00:02:37.359
- Smart.
- Yeah, dude,

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:39.422
and it was great cause like
I couldn't feel anything,

00:02:39.422 --> 00:02:42.707
but the thing about Oxy is that
it makes me feel so sluggish

00:02:42.707 --> 00:02:43.862
so I like slammed through
those energy drinks.

00:02:43.862 --> 00:02:45.193
Have you tried Quatro Crazy?

00:02:45.193 --> 00:02:46.567
- Oh my God, dude, I love those.

00:02:46.567 --> 00:02:48.169
- [Anderson] Oh yeah, it's the shit, dude.

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:49.493
- [Zac] Yeah, dude, banana bonanza.

00:02:49.493 --> 00:02:51.897
- You have an excellent body.

00:02:51.897 --> 00:02:53.116
- Oh, bless you.

00:02:53.116 --> 00:02:54.324
Get your hands on it, feel it.

00:02:54.324 --> 00:02:55.157
- Oh, I'd love to.

00:02:55.157 --> 00:02:55.990
- [Zac] So good.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.081
- So anyway, it was working out,

00:02:57.081 --> 00:02:59.343
cause I was, like, perfectly numb

00:02:59.343 --> 00:03:01.532
but also jacked as fuck--
- Yeah.

00:03:01.532 --> 00:03:04.808
- And then my brain was just
like, fucking sell this.

00:03:04.808 --> 00:03:08.943
And then, dude, just like
my hands without my brain,

00:03:08.943 --> 00:03:13.110
fucking drew this, Quatro
Cotton. (mimics explosions)

00:03:15.347 --> 00:03:16.590
(laughs)

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.203
- Holy shit, dude.

00:03:18.203 --> 00:03:19.687
- I know, dude.

00:03:19.687 --> 00:03:22.757
- Zac, seriously, let's
get this over with.

00:03:22.757 --> 00:03:23.713
- Oh yeah, you're right.

00:03:23.713 --> 00:03:25.691
All right no more photos everybody.

00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:27.724
Thank you so much everyone.
- Good day, guys.

00:03:27.724 --> 00:03:29.762
Really good work.
- No no, you're not done.

00:03:29.762 --> 00:03:31.856
- Ex-fucking-scuse me.

00:03:31.856 --> 00:03:34.316
- This is your job, you can't just leave.

00:03:34.316 --> 00:03:35.658
- Hey Zac, who am I?

00:03:35.658 --> 00:03:38.229
Blah blah blah blah blah,
I have a camera. (laughs)

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:41.511
Blah blah blah blah blah,

00:03:41.511 --> 00:03:43.087
- You're that dude.
- I'm that guy. (laughs)

00:03:43.087 --> 00:03:44.851
- Hey, is your dick a tiny camera?

00:03:44.851 --> 00:03:46.273
(Anderson laughs)
- What?

00:03:46.273 --> 00:03:49.517
- What, what, what?
- What, what, what?

00:03:49.517 --> 00:03:50.350
- A what?

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.392
- What?

00:03:51.392 --> 00:03:53.853
- [Anderson] A what?

00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:04.031
That was funny as fuck, dude.

00:04:04.031 --> 00:04:05.615
- Yeah, dude, thanks.

00:04:05.615 --> 00:04:07.768

00:04:13.933 --> 00:04:15.739
- Hey, do you like sex?

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:16.596

00:04:16.596 --> 00:04:18.115
- Let's go have some.
- Okay.

00:04:18.115 --> 00:04:18.948
- So what do you say man,

00:04:18.948 --> 00:04:23.009
you wanna get into bed with
Quatro Cotton? (laughs)

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:25.574
- No, dude, I mean, I'd rather
just be business partners.

00:04:25.574 --> 00:04:27.789
- Oh yeah, no, that's
even better. (both laugh)

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:28.663

00:04:28.663 --> 00:04:29.585

00:04:29.585 --> 00:04:32.001
- All right, Carolyn.

00:04:32.001 --> 00:04:33.546
Hey Carolyn?

00:04:33.546 --> 00:04:35.245
- That's weird.

00:04:35.245 --> 00:04:38.106
It's fine, dude, we can just take my...

00:04:38.106 --> 00:04:40.087
I don't know how I got here.

00:04:40.087 --> 00:04:41.512
This stuff really works, man.

00:04:41.512 --> 00:04:45.653
Like, I have no idea how
I got here. (both laugh)

00:04:45.653 --> 00:04:48.820
