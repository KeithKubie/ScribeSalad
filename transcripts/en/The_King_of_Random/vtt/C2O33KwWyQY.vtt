&gt;&gt; Guys. Summer is here,

00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:02.020
and we've got 10 cool life hacks

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:02.850
and we've got 10 cool life hacks

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.260
to help you have fun in the sun.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.560
If you use loose ice
to keep all of your food cool,

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.220
you're gonna end up
with a puddle of water,

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.770
and all of your food
floating in it.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:18.770
Instead of that,

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.400
use some frozen water bottles
to keep your food cool.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.400
The ice will stay contained in the bottles,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.300
and once it melts,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.400
you can just drink the water

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.040
For a fun twist on a summer treat,

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.570
you can actually carbonate
many types of fruit using dry ice.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.350
Some of my favorites are
strawberries, grapes or sliced pineapple.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.440
Put your fruit in a cold safe container

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.000
on top of the dry ice,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.680
separated by a piece of cardboard

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.170
to prevent excessive freezing.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.170
Cover the box with a sheet of foil.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.750
You don't want to use any sort of lid
that will allow the pressure

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.200
from the dry ice to build up.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.120
After about half an hour,
the fruit will have absorbed

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.400
a lot of carbon dioxide out
of the dry ice.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.500
It's pretty hard to see on video
the difference in the fruit.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.270
But as you eat it,
it fizzes just like a soda.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:04.670
Maybe more.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.920
Using a watermelon,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.020
a couple of plastic plumbing parts

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.400
and a few simple tools,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.270
you can make a fun drink
dispenser that's sure to delight.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.450
Tiki torches are a great
outdoor decoration,

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.450
but the standard lamp oil that they use

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:23.850
only burns in one color.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.850
Try using methanol as a fuel.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.850
Add boric acid for a green tint.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.470
Or the lithium from
a lithium battery for magenta

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.750
Always wear gloves
when you're handling the lithium

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:33.920
Don't let it get wet.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.750
And if you're going to be
burning the fuel

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.550
Make sure you're doing it
somewhere outside

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.250
where you won't be
breathing in the fumes.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.720
Yogurt is a delicious summertime treat

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.120
But there can be a couple
frustrating things about it.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.120
The first is its tendency to squirt out
some yogurt as you peel back the foil

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.650
By lifting up the foil
with the edge of the spoon

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.500
All of the escaping yogurt
will be caught right where you need it

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.570
Occasionally, you may find
after finishing a cup of yogurt

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.850
that your spoon is too heavy
and you can't get it to stay up.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.760
To avoid getting yogurt on your table,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.120
and keep your cup from tipping,

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.500
simply turn your spoon upside down.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.270
The redistribution of weight
should make it stay up.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.970
If you're a big fan of Wendy's frosties,

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.970
but don't live anywhere
near one of the restaurants.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.770
Here's a simple recipe
you can follow to make your own.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.720
Start with 2 cups of chocolate milk

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.470
3 tablespoons of sweetened
condensed milk

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.870
and if you want to add
just a little bit extra

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.970
that's not going to hurt.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.970
Add 1 tablespoon of malted milk powder

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.970
Finally, add one cup of Cool Whip.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.970
Mix together until it's all smooth.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.120
If you own an ice cream making machine

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.920
you can easily pour
the whole concoction into that

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.320
and let it sit for
about 15 to 20 minutes.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.900
If not, you can pour
all this into a Ziploc bag

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.820
surround that bag
with ice and salt in a larger bag

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.870
and mix it up until it's
the consistency you want.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.400
If you're ever on a road trip,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.400
and wondering how long
it is til you arrive.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.300
Just look for signs that say
how many miles it is to the next city.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.900
When you see a sign
that says distance to your city,

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.420
take the number of miles times 60,

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.800
then divide it by
your speed in miles per hour

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.100
to get the time remaining.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.500
For example,
if it's 35 miles to the next city,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.900
multiply that times 60,

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.570
and you'll get 2100.

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.080
Divide 2100 by 80 miles per hour,

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.370
and you get 26.25

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.500
which is the number of minutes.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.150
Just over 26 minutes until
you arrive at your destination.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.470
Of course, most people
these days have GPS

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.470
but it's a cool trick to know
just in case you don't.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.120
Ice does a great job
of keeping drinks cold

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.070
But if you're really in a hurry
to cool down a can or a bottle,

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.400
it works a lot better
to use ice, salt and water.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.700
The ice by itself
measures a temperature

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.820
of about 32... 
maybe 33 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.050
Whereas the ice with
the water and the salt on it

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.400
is measuring a chilly
21 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.920
You can see that after
only about two minutes,

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.800
the can in the salty ice water
is almost 10 degrees colder

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.270
than the can in the ice alone.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.300
We don't just have to rely
on the thermometer,

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.350
let's give it a taste test.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.220
Noticeably cooler,

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.520
doesn't really seem like
it just came out of the fridge though.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.070
Ice and salt water.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.470
Noticeably colder and it only
took about two minutes.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.100
You've used plenty
of lighter fluid

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.920
but your barbecue charcoal
is still taking too long to light

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.020
Shorten your prep time

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.020
by using the blower function
on a shopvac,

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.170
a hair dryer

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.920
or if you don't have electricity

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:22.320
a simple balloon pump.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.170
These balloon pumps are great
because they work as a bellows

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.870
that push air out on both 
the pull and the push.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.320
If you're looking for a way to keep your
drinks cold without watering them down.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.320
Try freezing a few different
types of soda

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.420
Fruit-flavored ice cubes work pretty well
in all the fruit flavored sodas.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.700
And I find that cream soda works well
in all the other flavors

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.120
Creamy.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.920
Hey guys
