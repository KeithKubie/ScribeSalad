00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:32.179
While some common gestures, such as the high
five, have pretty well known and surprisingly

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:37.379
modern origins, it turns out one of the most
popular of all has been around for well over

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:44.530
two thousand years, including having various
similar connotations as it has today.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.589
Unsurprisingly once you stop and think about
versions of the expression’s meaning, extending

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:55.030
the middle finger simply represents the phallus,
with it perhaps natural enough that our forebears

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.760
chose their longest finger to symbolically
represent man’s favorite digit.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.270
(Although, there are some cultures that instead
chose the thumb, seemingly preferring to have

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.920
their girth, rather than length, represented
here…)

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.700
It’s also been speculated that perhaps people
noticed that the curled fingers (or balled

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:21.470
fist in the case of the thumb) made for a
good representation of the testicles.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:31.250
Either way, given the symbolism here, it’s
no surprise that the expression has more or

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.770
less always seemed to have meant something
akin to “F&amp;*k You” in some form or other,

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.770
sometimes literally.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.550
For example, in Ancient Greece, beyond being
a general insult, in some cases there seems

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.690
to be a specific implication from the insult
that the person the gesture was directed at

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.319
liked to take it up the bum.

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:54.170
In the case of men, despite male on male lovin’
being widely accepted in the culture at the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.330
time, there were still potentially negative
connotations with regards to one’s manliness

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.410
when functioning as the bottom in such a rendezvous,
particularly the bottom for someone with lower

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:33.890
social standing.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.360
Moving on to an early specific example we
have Aristphanes’ 423 BC The Clouds.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.140
In it, a character known as Strepsiades, tired
of Socrates’ pontificating, decides to flip

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.480
off the famed philosopher.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.819
SOCRATES: Well, to begin with,
they’ll make you elegant in company—

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.170
and you’ll recognize the different rhythms,
the enoplian and the dactylic,

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.740
which is like a digit.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.580
STREPSIADES: Like a digit!

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.430
By god, that’s something I do know!

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.290
SOCRATES: Then tell me.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.209
STREPSIADES: When I was a lad a digit meant
this!

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.250
[Strepsiades sticks his middle finger straight
up under Socrates’ nose]

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.470
For whatever it’s worth, in the third century
AD Lives of the Eminent Philosophers, we also

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.010
have this reference of a supposed incidence
that occurred in the 4th century BC, concerning

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.739
famed orator Demosthenes and philosopher Diogenes.

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.650
[Diogenes] once found Demosthenes the orator
lunching at an inn, and, when he retired within,

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.989
Diogenes said, “All the more you will be
inside the tavern.”

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.780
When some strangers expressed a wish to see
Demosthenes, [Diogenes] stretched out his

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.920
middle finger and said, “There goes the
demagogue of Athens.”

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.940
(No doubt water was needed to put out the
fire created by that wicked burn.)

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.540
Moving on to the first century AD, Caligula
seems to have enjoyed making powerful people

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.690
kiss his ring while he extended his middle
finger at them.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.790
On a no doubt completely unrelated note, the
chief organizer of his assassination, and

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.410
first to stab him, was one Cassius Chaerea
who Caligula liked to do this very thing with,

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:10.849
as noted by Suetonius:

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.930
Gaius used to taunt him, a man already well
on in years, with voluptuousness and effeminacy

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.019
by every form of insult.

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.500
When he asked for the watchword Gaius would
give him “Priapus” or “Venus,” and

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.270
when Chaerea had occasion to thank him for
anything, he would hold out his hand to kiss,

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.009
forming and moving it in an obscene fashion.

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:33.720
Speaking of the implications of this insulting
gesture, it seems to have fallen out of favor

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.430
during the Middle Ages with the rise of Christianity,
or at least records of it diminish.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.819
This may mean people actually stopped popularly
flipping the bird or may just mean its uncouth

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:46.919
nature saw it something not generally written
about.

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:52.479
That said, we do know thanks to the Etymologiae
of Isidore of Seville that at least as late

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:58.139
as the 6th century people were still extending
the finger as an insult, in this reference

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:03.479
particularly directed at someone who had done
something considered “shameful”.

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.539
Moving on to more modern times, the gesture
was popularly resurrected in documented history

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:12.270
starting around the early 19th century, with
early photographic evidence later popping

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.099
up in the latter half of the 1800s.

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:20.110
Most famously, we have a photograph of the
gesture flashed by present day Twitter sensation

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:26.050
and former 19th century baseball iron man
Charley “Old Hoss” Radbourn.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.360
Radbourn was a pitcher for the Boston Beaneaters
in 1886 when the team, along with the New

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.949
York Giants, posed for a group photo.

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:36.249
In the photo, Old Hoss can be seen giving
the bird to the cameraman.

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:41.449
(We’ll have more on Charley “Hoss” and
his possible connection to a different expression

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:42.879
in a bit.)

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:47.440
At this point you might be wondering why we
call extending the middle finger today- “flipping

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.509
the bird” or “giving the bird”.

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:54.360
The connection is speculated to derive from
the centuries old practice of more or less

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.659
making bird sounds, particularly owl and geese
calls, as an equivalent to booing when an

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:01.840
audience is dissatisfied by something.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.509
This, in turn, gave rise to the popular 19th
century expression to “goose” someone

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:12.129
and then a little later led to the expression
“give the big bird”, as noted in William

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:18.819
Earnest Henley’s late 19th century work,
Slang and Its Analogues Past and Present:

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:22.399
Big Bird: To get or give the big bird- To
be hissed on the stage….

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:26.499
When an actor or actress gets the big bird,
it may be from two causes; either it is a

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:30.779
compliment for successful portrayal of villainy,
in which case the Gods simply express their

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:35.779
abhorrence of the character and not of the
actor; or, the hissing may be directed against

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:38.999
the actor, personally for some reason or other.

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:41.099
The Big Bird is the goose.

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:44.869
By the mid-20th century, this seems to have
extended to “giving the bird” not just

00:06:44.869 --> 00:06:50.889
referring to insulting sounds, but to describe
extending the middle finger as well.

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:55.339
One of the earliest examples of this can be
found in the 1942 animated film A Tale of

00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:56.520
Two Kitties.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.919
In it, the pair of cats attempt to capture
Tweety bird.

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:02.659
At a certain point, one of the cats implores
the other “Give me the bird!”

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:23.659
The other cat then turns to the viewers and
exclaims “If the Hays Office would only

00:07:23.659 --> 00:08:14.009
let me, I’d give him the bird alright.”

00:08:14.009 --> 00:08:24.669
Going

00:08:24.669 --> 00:08:39.339
back 
to

00:08:39.339 --> 00:08:46.279
Charley “Hoss” Roadbourn, he is widely
speculated to be the inspiration for the expression

00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:51.050
“Charley Horse”, indicating a random muscle
cramp in the leg.

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:55.540
The expression popped up in baseball shortly
after his historic 1884 season in which he

00:08:55.540 --> 00:09:03.360
posted a 1.38 ERA with 441 strikeouts in 678
and 2/3 innings, winning 59 games by modern

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:10.250
rules (or 60 by the scorers of the day) despite
the fact that his team only played 112 games

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:11.910
that year.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:18.410
If you’re wondering how he managed to pitch
in so many games, this was as a result of

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:23.010
a fight between he and the team’s other
best pitcher, Charlie Sweeney, that saw Sweeney

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:26.840
leave and Old Hoss offer to start every game
for the remainder of the season.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:32.270
He nearly did this, starting 40 of the remaining
43 games that year and winning 36 of them.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:36.970
However, at a certain point he reportedly
became so sore he couldn’t even raise his

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:41.610
arm above his head without significant warmup
that required starting by soft tossing from

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:45.060
just a few feet and slowly working back as
his arm loosened up.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.080
It is speculated that his prolific pitching
around this time, and presumably frequent

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.960
cramps from over use of his muscles, may have
inspired the expression.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:57.330
For whatever it’s worth, a 1907 issue of
the Washington Post indicates that Old Hoss

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:03.850
actually once had a severe leg cramp in a
game, which directly gave rise to the expression.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:07.310
Whatever the case, one of the earliest known
instances of the expression “Charley Horse”

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:13.490
occurred in an 1887 edition of The Fort Wayne
Gazette where it notes, “Whatever ails a

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:18.580
player this year they call it a ‘Charley
horse’…”

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:23.350
American seamen captured by the North Koreans
in the famous “Pueblo crisis” once used

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:27.210
the North Korean’s ignorance of the meaning
of extending the middle finger to good use

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:30.160
in propaganda photos taken by their captors.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.760
When asked, the captured men simply stated
that it was a good luck gesture, so were allowed

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:38.300
to continue using it in the photographs…
at first.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:44.600
When the North Koreans discovered what it
actually meant, the seamen were beaten.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:49.330
As we alluded to in the body of this piece,
there are several places on Earth where a

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.350
thumbs up has a similar meaning to extending
the middle finger.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.880
Why we bring this up specifically is that
when American troops first started being stationed

00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:01.720
in Iraq, some reported being greeted by civilians
offering a thumbs up, with the soldiers (and

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:06.550
many in the media) interpreting it as most
Westerners would- all the while not realizing

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:26.630
the people were more or less flipping them
off.
