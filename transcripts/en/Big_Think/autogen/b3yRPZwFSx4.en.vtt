think the press likes to highlight

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910
think the press likes to highlight
 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.490
think the press likes to highlight
conflict more than they'd like to talk

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500
conflict more than they'd like to talk
 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.490
conflict more than they'd like to talk
about the good things that are going on

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500
about the good things that are going on
 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.170
about the good things that are going on
in this country and so I think in the

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180
in this country and so I think in the
 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.190
in this country and so I think in the
presidential race the idea and the

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.200
presidential race the idea and the
 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.749
presidential race the idea and the
significance of race has been over blown

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:30.759
significance of race has been over blown
 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.299
significance of race has been over blown
it's been blown out of proportion

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309
it's been blown out of proportion
 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:40.000
it's been blown out of proportion
and I think because of that it's made it

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010
and I think because of that it's made it
 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.729
and I think because of that it's made it
more significant than it needs to be but

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739
more significant than it needs to be but
 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.090
more significant than it needs to be but
race still matters and no matter where I

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100
race still matters and no matter where I
 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.560
race still matters and no matter where I
go I'm always going to believe be a

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570
go I'm always going to believe be a
 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.479
go I'm always going to believe be a
black man and I'll be seen as that and

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489
black man and I'll be seen as that and
 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.450
black man and I'll be seen as that and
it'll carry with it whatever stereotypes

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460
it'll carry with it whatever stereotypes
 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.160
it'll carry with it whatever stereotypes
or whatever beliefs that people have

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170
or whatever beliefs that people have
 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.020
or whatever beliefs that people have
about it and I know that when I go into

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030
about it and I know that when I go into
 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.540
about it and I know that when I go into
a situation but I don't let it become a

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550
a situation but I don't let it become a
 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.849
a situation but I don't let it become a
hindrance it just is what it is and I

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:02.859
hindrance it just is what it is and I
 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:05.140
hindrance it just is what it is and I
think it's always going to mean

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150
think it's always going to mean
 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.280
think it's always going to mean
something it's always going to matter

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290
something it's always going to matter
 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.210
something it's always going to matter
but what we should be able to do is have

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220
but what we should be able to do is have
 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.480
but what we should be able to do is have
the moral capacity as individuals and

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490
the moral capacity as individuals and
 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.899
the moral capacity as individuals and
human beings to respect each other and

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909
human beings to respect each other and
 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.020
human beings to respect each other and
to expect the best out of anyone and and

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030
to expect the best out of anyone and and
 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.300
to expect the best out of anyone and and
to not judge them by the color of their

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310
to not judge them by the color of their
 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.760
to not judge them by the color of their
skin or where they came from but to

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770
skin or where they came from but to
 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.649
skin or where they came from but to
truly judge them on their on the content

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659
truly judge them on their on the content
 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.920
truly judge them on their on the content
of their character and I think

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930
of their character and I think
 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.080
of their character and I think
fundamentally the world will be a better

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090
fundamentally the world will be a better
 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.969
fundamentally the world will be a better
place if we if we're able to do that

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979
place if we if we're able to do that
 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.800
place if we if we're able to do that
we're not there yet

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810
we're not there yet
 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.560
we're not there yet
but I think we have a chance of being

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570
but I think we have a chance of being
 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.300
but I think we have a chance of being
there in the future and I think we were

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310
there in the future and I think we were
 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.360
there in the future and I think we were
moving in that direction
