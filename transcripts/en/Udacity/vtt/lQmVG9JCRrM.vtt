00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
For this problem, imagine that we have a grandfather clock here

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and this grandfather clock keeps time with the pendulum.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This pendulum has a length, which we're going to call le and a mass of m.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Suppose we want to take our grandfather clock on a trip to the moon.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Now we know that the period of the oscillations for this pendulum depends on the value of g,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and g is different on the moon--in fact, it's 1.6 m/s² as suppose to 9.8 m/s².

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
In order for our grandfather clock to work just as well on the moon as it does on earth,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
we're going to have to change the length of the pendulum.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Can you tell me how long should this pendulum be on the moon

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
in terms of how long it is on the earth?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Put your answer here and give it in terms of the length of the pendulum on earth.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
If you think the pendulum on the moon should be twice as long if we put 2 here,

00:00:42.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and if you think it should be, say, a third as long, you should put 0.33 here, something like that.
