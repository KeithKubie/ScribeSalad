00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.020
So one last thing to do before we go on

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.470
to the next lesson is to add the tests for

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.890
the functionality that we added in this lesson. The end

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.600
of the profile lesson you added the test for profile.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.280
So now you need to add the test for conference.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.121
That'll be the conference test class, and you can find

00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:20.794
that in the lesson four folder. And also go back

00:00:20.794 --> 00:00:25.579
into your conference API class and, uncomment the tests, that should

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.660
work now that you've added conferences. So, let's have

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.180
a quick look at conference test. Now we set

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.890
up the values that you're going to need to

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.200
test on. Create the service test helper which is

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.510
needed, the setup method which just gets everything ready

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.660
for the tests, the tear down method cleans up.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.670
And then there's just a bunch of different functions

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.780
to test the different things that we've added. So test

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.790
creating of conference without an A, that's not allowed.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.942
Test creating of conference, anyway, so on. You can

00:00:56.942 --> 00:00:59.294
read through the test files and see what all

00:00:59.294 --> 00:01:02.900
the things are tested. Feel free to add tests,

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.910
and then when you run your project with Maven,

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.080
it will automatically include the test, or run the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.032
test. And it actually won't let you run your

00:01:12.032 --> 00:01:15.879
project, untill the tests are successful. If you really get

00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:18.127
stuck with the tests, and you do want to deploy

00:01:18.127 --> 00:01:21.172
without running the tests. You can choose run as and

00:01:21.172 --> 00:01:25.637
then run configurations and then you can create a configuration

00:01:25.637 --> 00:01:30.260
and actually enable the skip tests. I don't recommend this.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.742
It's a good idea to always test what your doing,

00:01:32.742 --> 00:01:34.619
but it is good to know that if you, you

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.759
know, that you can do that if you need to.

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.763
Anyway, go ahead and add the test, to your application.

00:01:40.763 --> 00:01:42.390
And then it's time for the next lesson.
