00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.819
diversity inclusion is something that

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829
diversity inclusion is something that
 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.130
diversity inclusion is something that
has been around and companies for

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140
has been around and companies for
 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.309
has been around and companies for
decades now and generally people think

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319
decades now and generally people think
 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.540
decades now and generally people think
of it as diversity and inclusion but I

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550
of it as diversity and inclusion but I
 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.640
of it as diversity and inclusion but I
would actually challenge that given that

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650
would actually challenge that given that
 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.890
would actually challenge that given that
I think that historically we've seen

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900
I think that historically we've seen
 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.080
I think that historically we've seen
diversity or inclusion rather than

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090
diversity or inclusion rather than
 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.689
diversity or inclusion rather than
diversity and inclusion and what I mean

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699
diversity and inclusion and what I mean
 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.880
diversity and inclusion and what I mean
by that is that companies really want

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890
by that is that companies really want
 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.390
by that is that companies really want
inclusion but they often predicate that

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400
inclusion but they often predicate that
 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.189
inclusion but they often predicate that
inclusion on the surrender of various

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199
inclusion on the surrender of various
 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.720
inclusion on the surrender of various
forms of diversity that people bring to

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730
forms of diversity that people bring to
 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.089
forms of diversity that people bring to
the table so the idea is that if you

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099
the table so the idea is that if you
 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.139
the table so the idea is that if you
modulate your outsider identity to adopt

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149
modulate your outsider identity to adopt
 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.970
modulate your outsider identity to adopt
mainstream behaviors and you'll be

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980
mainstream behaviors and you'll be
 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.160
mainstream behaviors and you'll be
included and so it puts people to this

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170
included and so it puts people to this
 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.470
included and so it puts people to this
tragic choice between their identity and

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480
tragic choice between their identity and
 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.720
tragic choice between their identity and
inclusion and that's where I think that

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730
inclusion and that's where I think that
 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.970
inclusion and that's where I think that
companies have missed the mark or need

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980
companies have missed the mark or need
 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.880
companies have missed the mark or need
to update their practices so I look at

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890
to update their practices so I look at
 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.979
to update their practices so I look at
the notion of authenticity through

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989
the notion of authenticity through
 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.500
the notion of authenticity through
Erving Goffman's term covering so Erving

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510
Erving Goffman's term covering so Erving
 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.180

Goffman was the sociologist who wrote

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190
Goffman was the sociologist who wrote
 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.580
Goffman was the sociologist who wrote
back in the 1960s and his notion of

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590
back in the 1960s and his notion of
 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.670
back in the 1960s and his notion of
covering was the way in which we all

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680
covering was the way in which we all
 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.560
covering was the way in which we all
modulate our identities in order to be

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570
modulate our identities in order to be
 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.410
modulate our identities in order to be
accepted by the mainstream so when I

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420
accepted by the mainstream so when I
 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.510
accepted by the mainstream so when I
first came across this term my immediate

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520
first came across this term my immediate
 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.130
first came across this term my immediate
response was how does covering differ

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140
response was how does covering differ
 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.440
response was how does covering differ
from passing and one of the great things

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450
from passing and one of the great things
 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.090
from passing and one of the great things
about Goffman is that he's such a good

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100
about Goffman is that he's such a good
 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.100
about Goffman is that he's such a good
writer that when you're reading him you

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110
writer that when you're reading him you
 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.390
writer that when you're reading him you
almost feel like you're talking to him

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400
almost feel like you're talking to him
 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.399
almost feel like you're talking to him
so the next paragraph was you know the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409
so the next paragraph was you know the

astute reader may be asking himself how

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540
astute reader may be asking himself how
 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.420
astute reader may be asking himself how
covering differs from passing and he

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430
covering differs from passing and he
 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.609
covering differs from passing and he

behind a table before his cabinet
 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.890
behind a table before his cabinet
entered so he wasn't passing because

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900
entered so he wasn't passing because
 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.929
entered so he wasn't passing because
everybody knew that he had a motor

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939

which we found that 61% of individuals
 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.420
which we found that 61% of individuals
reported covering I kind of thought well

I don't care about this unless people

I don't care about this unless people
 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.349
I don't care about this unless people
report that it's harmful to them if

report that it's harmful to them if

depending on the particular axis of
 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:37.220
depending on the particular axis of
covering that we looked at said that

covering that we looked at said that
 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.539
covering that we looked at said that
this is somewhat too extremely

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549
this is somewhat too extremely
 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.459
this is somewhat too extremely
detrimental to their sense of self so

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:40.469
detrimental to their sense of self so
 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:41.629
detrimental to their sense of self so
that's something that we really need to

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:41.639
that's something that we really need to
 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.849
that's something that we really need to
be attentive to if we want people to

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:43.859
be attentive to if we want people to
 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:46.309

they inhabit the prevalence of covering

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530
they inhabit the prevalence of covering
 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.319
they inhabit the prevalence of covering
is something that we often get asked

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329
is something that we often get asked
 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.539
is something that we often get asked
about and the distribution of which

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549
about and the distribution of which
 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.039
about and the distribution of which
groups cover more which groups cover

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049
groups cover more which groups cover
 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.459
groups cover more which groups cover
less and I have both the intuitive and a

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:58.469
less and I have both the intuitive and a
 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:00.379
less and I have both the intuitive and a
counterintuitive answer to that so the

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389
counterintuitive answer to that so the
 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:03.050
counterintuitive answer to that so the
intuitive answer is you know groups that

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060
intuitive answer is you know groups that
 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.500
intuitive answer is you know groups that
are seen as struggling to make it into

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510
are seen as struggling to make it into
 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.449
are seen as struggling to make it into
the mainstream have a much higher

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459
the mainstream have a much higher
 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.770
the mainstream have a much higher
reported incidence of covering so 83% of

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780

intuitive but on the other hand we also
found that 45% of straight white men

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:36.379
found that 45% of straight white men
 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:39.710
found that 45% of straight white men
reported covering on at least one of the

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720
reported covering on at least one of the
 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.780
reported covering on at least one of the
dimensions that we articulate in our

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790
dimensions that we articulate in our
 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.569
dimensions that we articulate in our
paper and that was obviously a really

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579
paper and that was obviously a really
 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.699
paper and that was obviously a really
interesting statistic to us and so we

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709
interesting statistic to us and so we
 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.949
interesting statistic to us and so we
dug in more deeply to think about well

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959
dug in more deeply to think about well
 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.390
dug in more deeply to think about well
what are the ways in which straight

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400
what are the ways in which straight
 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.240
what are the ways in which straight
white men who are traditionally seen as

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250
white men who are traditionally seen as
 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.339
white men who are traditionally seen as
outside of the inclusion paradigm what

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349
outside of the inclusion paradigm what
 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.619
outside of the inclusion paradigm what
are the ways in which they cover and we

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629
are the ways in which they cover and we
 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:59.390
are the ways in which they cover and we
discovered everything from I have to

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400
discovered everything from I have to
 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.369
discovered everything from I have to
cover my religion to I have to cover my

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379
cover my religion to I have to cover my
 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.409
cover my religion to I have to cover my
political affiliation I have to cover my

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419
political affiliation I have to cover my
 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:06.890
political affiliation I have to cover my
veteran status or my working-class

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900
veteran status or my working-class
 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.050
veteran status or my working-class
background or I have to cover the fact

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060
background or I have to cover the fact
 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.259
background or I have to cover the fact
that I have a mental or physical illness

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269
that I have a mental or physical illness
 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.569
that I have a mental or physical illness
so we really ran the gamut and the

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579
so we really ran the gamut and the
 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:15.979
so we really ran the gamut and the
reason that that statistic was so

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989
reason that that statistic was so
 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.319
reason that that statistic was so
important to us is that straight white

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329
important to us is that straight white
 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.089
important to us is that straight white
men are often either lionized or

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099
men are often either lionized or
 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:21.860
men are often either lionized or
demonized in these conversations they're

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870
demonized in these conversations they're
 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.600
demonized in these conversations they're
either lofted up as a people who were

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610
either lofted up as a people who were
 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:24.980
either lofted up as a people who were
supposed to come riding and to fix

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990
supposed to come riding and to fix
 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.320
supposed to come riding and to fix
everything or at worst

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330
everything or at worst
 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.540
everything or at worst
people who are you know supposed to

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550
people who are you know supposed to
 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.490
people who are you know supposed to
clean up their own mess and people who

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500
clean up their own mess and people who
 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.379
clean up their own mess and people who
cause a problem they're demonized the

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389
cause a problem they're demonized the
 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.279
cause a problem they're demonized the
notion is that straight white men cover

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289
notion is that straight white men cover
 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.649
notion is that straight white men cover
and that this is a really really

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:39.659
and that this is a really really
 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:42.499
and that this is a really really
important finding because it puts them

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509
important finding because it puts them
 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.649
important finding because it puts them
inside of the inclusion paradigm so when

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:45.659
inside of the inclusion paradigm so when
 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:47.869
inside of the inclusion paradigm so when
I presented these results to CEOs to

00:04:47.869 --> 00:04:47.879
I presented these results to CEOs to
 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:49.670
I presented these results to CEOs to
executive committees to chief diversity

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680
executive committees to chief diversity
 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.980
executive committees to chief diversity
officers this is a statistic that

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990
officers this is a statistic that
 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.709
officers this is a statistic that
everybody gloms on to because the

00:04:54.709 --> 00:04:54.719
everybody gloms on to because the
 

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:56.719
everybody gloms on to because the
straight white men in the room as one of

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729
straight white men in the room as one of
 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.700
straight white men in the room as one of
them put it to me this is finally a

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710
them put it to me this is finally a
 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.770
them put it to me this is finally a
paradigm of inclusion in which I can see

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780
paradigm of inclusion in which I can see
 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.110
paradigm of inclusion in which I can see
myself so I'm not outside looking in I'm

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120
myself so I'm not outside looking in I'm
 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.080
myself so I'm not outside looking in I'm
actually in this right another way to

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090
actually in this right another way to
 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.089
actually in this right another way to
put that would be to say that oftentimes

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:08.099
put that would be to say that oftentimes
 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:10.249
put that would be to say that oftentimes
when I gave early iterations of this

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259
when I gave early iterations of this
 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:12.200
when I gave early iterations of this
research on covering one response that I

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210
research on covering one response that I
 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.360
research on covering one response that I
often got was I understand why people

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370
often got was I understand why people
 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.260
often got was I understand why people
should not have to be discriminated

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270
should not have to be discriminated
 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.640
should not have to be discriminated
against and based on things that they

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650
against and based on things that they
 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.260
against and based on things that they
can't change about themselves like say

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270
can't change about themselves like say
 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.600
can't change about themselves like say
their skin color or their chromosomes or

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610
their skin color or their chromosomes or
 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.550
their skin color or their chromosomes or
if it is immutable their sexual

if it is immutable their sexual
 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.129
if it is immutable their sexual
orientation but why shouldn't you have

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139
orientation but why shouldn't you have
 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:30.290

to cover because I have to cover all the

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300
to cover because I have to cover all the
 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.909
to cover because I have to cover all the
time I call this the angry straight

time I call this the angry straight
 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:33.379
time I call this the angry straight
white guy question because the angry

white guy question because the angry
 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:34.969
white guy question because the angry
straight white man used to always ask it

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979
straight white man used to always ask it
 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:37.999
straight white man used to always ask it
of me and one of them really sort of hit
