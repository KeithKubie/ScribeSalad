Welcome back!

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:08.541
Now, it's Oscar season
in Hollywood,

00:00:08.574 --> 00:00:09.942
and many of this year's
great films

00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:11.878
featured black actors
and directors.

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:13.479
Now, the Academy Award
nominations come out

00:00:13.512 --> 00:00:15.615
tomorrow morning, so it's time
for our annual tradition,

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:18.184
A Preview of
the Upcoming Black Oscar Snubs.

00:00:18.217 --> 00:00:20.153
♪ ♪

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:23.790
(humming)

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:25.992
All right, here to take us
through this year's list

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:27.660
is our own Robin Thede.

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:30.329 line:0%

-Ah. Thank you, Larry.

00:00:30.362 --> 00:00:32.331 line:0%
Hey, Robin, how you doing?

00:00:32.364 --> 00:00:33.599 line:0%
Thank you.

00:00:33.632 --> 00:00:35.268 line:0%
Now, I hold in my hand

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:37.737 line:0%
the names of the black
film stars and directors

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.007 line:0%
who are going to be screwed out
of nominations this year.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.177
Because the only black people
in Hollywood getting any love

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.180
are the ones
Sandra Bullock keeps adopting.

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:49.048
Oh, man.

00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:50.583
All right, here we go!

00:00:50.616 --> 00:00:53.853
The nominees
to be snubbed are...

00:00:53.886 --> 00:00:56.389
Will Smith in<i> Concussion!</i>

00:00:56.422 --> 00:00:58.391
Wow!

00:00:58.424 --> 00:01:00.326
Oh, my God, really?

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.928
That's a surprise, Robin.

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:03.863
I thought white people
love Will Smith.

00:01:03.896 --> 00:01:07.733
-They adore Will Smith, but
nobody saw that movie. -Yeah.

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:10.236
-Hmm. -Only white actors
can win Oscars

00:01:10.269 --> 00:01:12.505
for a movie that nobody saw.

00:01:12.538 --> 00:01:14.107
Wait, really?

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.109
Larry, you don't need to be
Stephen Hawking

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:17.777
to understand that science.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.712
Got it.

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:23.216
All right.
On to our next black Oscar snub.

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:25.751
-Who we got? Who we got?
Who we got? -It goes to...

00:01:25.784 --> 00:01:28.087
F. Gary Gray, the black director

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.422
from<i> Straight Outta Compton!</i>

00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:32.959
Wow. Man! Oh, my God!

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:35.294
Wait, Robin!
That was a good movie.

00:01:35.327 --> 00:01:36.963
Why isn't he gonna get
nominated?

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:38.631
Uh, he's black

00:01:38.664 --> 00:01:40.833
and also a director.

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:42.001
But mainly 'cause he's black.

00:01:42.034 --> 00:01:44.170
Aw. Man, are you sure
about that?

00:01:44.203 --> 00:01:47.673
Hello? We get called angry
and loud for brushing our teeth.

00:01:47.706 --> 00:01:49.675
You think you're gonna give
a black person an award

00:01:49.708 --> 00:01:51.944
for screaming "Action!"
at Paul Giamatti?

00:01:51.977 --> 00:01:53.446
Oh. Yeah. You know,

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.615
that actually does make sense
when you put it like that.

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:57.550
All right,
so who else won't be nominated?

00:01:57.583 --> 00:02:02.021
-Okay. Our next non-white
non-nominee is... -Mm-hmm.

00:02:02.054 --> 00:02:05.024
<i> Creed</i> star Michael B. Jordan!
Yes!

00:02:05.057 --> 00:02:07.026
No!

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:09.028
Yes.

00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:11.631
Wait, Robin,
why are you so excited?

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:13.499
He's not going to be nominated.

00:02:13.532 --> 00:02:15.501
I know,
but it's still the Oscars.

00:02:15.534 --> 00:02:17.036
Oh.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.038
All right. So-so what's the deal
with him?

00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:20.907
I mean,
he was great in that movie.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.577
He's a black man
who punches people.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.113
Does that sound like acting
to you, Larry?

00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:28.714
Well...

00:02:28.747 --> 00:02:31.584
I mean, most Academy voters
think<i> Creed</i> is a documentary.

00:02:31.617 --> 00:02:34.053
Oh, come on, Robin.
Robin, that's unfair.

00:02:34.086 --> 00:02:36.189
Look, Christian Bale won
an Oscar for<i> The Fighter.</i>

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:38.724
Exactly. As a good white boxer.

00:02:38.757 --> 00:02:41.727
Now, that's what I call
a transformation.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.329
All right, let's wrap up.

00:02:43.362 --> 00:02:45.198
Who gets the last snub
of the night?

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:47.366
Oh, last?
Well, I have, like, 57 more,

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:48.901
-but, um... -Well, just go...
just go with one.

00:02:48.934 --> 00:02:52.305
-Okay, if I have to pick one,
it is... -Okay.

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:54.807
-Oh, these are always so tough.
-I know. It's exciting.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.643
...Kitana Kiki Rodriguez
in<i> Tangerine!</i>

00:02:57.676 --> 00:02:59.312
What?

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:01.047
Oh, my God.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.382
-That's a surprise.
-Now...

00:03:03.415 --> 00:03:07.186
Rodriguez's haunting portrayal
of a trans woman was brave,

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:11.257
but it wasn't "Jennifer Lawrence
invents a mop" brave.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.259
Well, but...

00:03:13.292 --> 00:03:14.927
Robin, this is disappointing.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.996
Rodriguez is transgender.
They've had a great year.

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:19.599
Why wouldn't Hollywood, like,
want to celebrate her?

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:21.601
For the same reason
the bear from<i> The Revenant</i>

00:03:21.634 --> 00:03:23.269
is gonna get snubbed.

00:03:23.302 --> 00:03:26.272
Wait, the bear? What?

00:03:26.305 --> 00:03:28.941
Yeah, Larry.
She's brown, and she's a woman.

00:03:28.974 --> 00:03:30.610
Two strikes!

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:33.279
Robin Thede, ladies and
gentlemen! We'll be right back!

00:03:33.312 --> 00:03:35.248
-Should I be happy?
-(cheering and applause)
