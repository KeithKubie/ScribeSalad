00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:02.879
&gt;&gt;Jen Clark: Hello everyone.

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:03.879
Welcome.

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:04.879
Thanks for
coming.

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:05.900
I'm really happy about today.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:06.900
My name is Jen
Clark.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.490
I'm from the benefits team.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.260
I work on the OYL
program.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.960
This is part of the health@speaker series
which

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.529
is aimed at providing information to Googlers
about health

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:18.529
and wellness topics.

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.829
I've got a slide up there that tells you a
little bit more.

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:24.949
We welcome your feedback on any these topics.

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.929
So if you have
some, please feel free to goto/health@survey.

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.550
For more
information on OYL, please check out and goto/OYL.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.190
And
if you're interested in planning and being

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.309
involved in these types of talks,
please check out goto/wellnesschampions.

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.910
And I'm particularly excited because Brandon
was a school

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.179
classmate of mine at the Stanford Graduate
School of

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:50.780
Business about four, five years ago.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.249
And he's now taking
his experience as a physician and as someone

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:02.399
with business
training in exploring ways to use business

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.670
and health
together.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.400
So I'm really excited to have him here.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.900
A
little bit background on Brandon.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.060
Doctor Brandon Colby
is a world leader in the field of predictive

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.050
medicine, a
groundbreaking medical specialty that combines

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.799
comprehensive genetic testing with personalized
prevention based upon your genes.

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.210
Dr. Colby has been
involved in the genetics field for his entire

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.549
life, first
as a patient then as a researcher and now

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.360
as a practicing
physician.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.930
He has conducted extensive research in the
field of advanced clinical genetic analysis,

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.020
inventing numerous
patent-pending technologies that make comprehensive

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.380
genetic screening
understandable, useful, and empowering to

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.400
both the
physician and the patient.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.020
Dr. Colby is also the only
practicing physician in the world to have

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.470
designed a
first of its kind DNA chip which I believe

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.770
you all will
see later.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.420
In addition to serving as the medical
director of the Existence Health, a predictive

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.969
medicine private practice based
in Los Angeles, Dr. Colby is also the founder

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:03.210
and CEO of
his Existence Genetics, a company that provides

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.789
highly
advanced predictive medicine services to the

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:07.250
health
industry.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.120
He holds a degree in genetics from the
University of Michigan honors program, an

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.360
M.D. from the
Mount Sinai school of medicine and an MBA

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.150
from the Stanford
Graduate School of Business.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.330
Please join me in welcoming
Dr. Colby.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.850
[Applause]

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.860
&gt;&gt;Dr. Colby: Thank you, Jen.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.110
Today is an incredibly
important day for our civilization.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.100
And it's important
because we stand right at the point of transition

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.430
between
the age of information and the age of personalization.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.930
We're moving from this information age where
we now have

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.620
an unprecedented amount of access to information.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.520
Basically, our world's accumulated information
as

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.180
knowledge accessible to anyone and any time
from anywhere

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.980
for practically no cost.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.770
And we're moving from access to
this information from this generic information

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.590
to now
personalizing it and making it about a unique

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.650
person --
about each of us in unique ways.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.450
And the fundamental
underpinning of how information is made to

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.960
be
personalized on how each of us is unique is

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.260
our genes.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.250
And that's what I'm going to talk about today
-- gaining

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.260
access to our genes through genetic testing,
understanding what that means, and then using

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.170
that
information to personalize products and services.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.830
Since
I'm a doctor, I'm going to talk about how

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.100
we can use that
information to personalize health care.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.810
This is
applicable to really any product and service

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.390
that we
could think of.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.990
And in the future, we're going to start
to see a genetically-tailored world that all

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.150
products and
services are going to start to be tailored

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.150
to our genes.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.060
They're going to be personalized.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.760
So to begin, I'm going
to walk you through an example that we're

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.160
all going to
participate in.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.470
For some of you, it may help to close
your eyes.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.460
For others, let's just imagine that we're
standing in a darkroom.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.510
And the room is so dark, we
can't even see our hand in front of our face.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.410
All of a
sudden, we feel something come up and kick

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.220
us in the back
of the leg.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.330
We turn around, we try to defend ourselves,
but we can't, because we don't know what's

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.439
attacking us,
we don't know when it's going to come again

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:31.850
and we feel
something go and punch us in the stomach.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.550
We try to
defend ourselves again and we can't and again

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.969
we get hit
in the head.

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:41.919
Now, I know this seems like an awkward
situation, but this is actually the current

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.580
state of
health care that we're in practically the

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.220
dark ages.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.840
We
don't know what diseases may lay ahead.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.099
We don't know what
we may be faced with and we don't know when

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:56.330
they may come
and attack us.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.889
Now, imagine that we're back in that room
again, it's very dark, we can't see, and somebody

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.039
places something into our hands, a tool.

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:07.370
But we don't
know whether that tool is going to help us,

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.669
whether we'll be
able to use that tool to defend ourselves

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.550
or potentially that tool is going to harm
us.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.050
And that's the
current state of many of the treatments that

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.840
we receive, a lot of the medications that
are prescribed to us.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.990
We don't know if
they're going to be effective.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.919
We don't know if they're
potentially going to harm us.

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:30.419
And the person who hands
you that tool in that room is your doctor,

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:31.940
your
physician.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.479
And their eyesight--.

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:36.879
Our eyesight is not
much better than yours.

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:40.009
That we can't really make out
what's ahead.

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:46.280
We use family history to try to guess at
what diseases you may be predisposed to.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.840
We ask you
questions like, "have you ever had a an allergic

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:49.969
reaction
before?"

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:54.729
To try to guess at medications that we don't
want to give you.

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:57.440
But other than that, our eyesight is
really not much better.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.449
We can make out shadows, but we
don't really know what is there.

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:03.139
We don't know what
diseases lay ahead for you.

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:07.599
And because of that, we
can't really prevent anything from coming

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:09.520
and attacking
you.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:15.439
Now, we talked about this model, so health
care in terms of

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:18.070
being in the dark ages.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.529
What predictive medicine does,
which is combining genetic testing with the

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:25.629
personalized
prevention of disease is, it turns the light

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:26.629
on.

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:30.400
It
allows us, through genetic testing, to examine

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.610
an
individual's genes to see what diseases they

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.139
may be
predisposed to.

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:40.009
And then to add preventions before those
diseases ever manifest.

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:44.900
So it's turning the light on in
the room, allowing us to see what's lurking

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.460
in those
shadows, allows us to best take preemptive

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.340
measures, to
either prevent that disease from ever attacking

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:54.340
us.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.810
Or if
we see it coming towards us because that light

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:01.449
now is on
in the room, we could take steps to make sure

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:07.460
that it has
the smallest amount of impact upon us as possible.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.680
And
also genetic testing allows us to know whether

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.740
medications, whether certain treatments, even
lifestyle

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.930
modifications as we'll discuss, whether those
will help

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.430
slow down or prevent disease.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:26.439
So, we're moving now from
standing in this very dark room to turning

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:27.439
on the light.

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:30.370
To be able to turn on the light through genetic
testing

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.569
and predictive medicine.

00:07:32.569 --> 00:07:34.759
So let's move on to the next example and actually
walk

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:38.080
through a person's life and see how this could
impact

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.189
somebody today.

00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:44.800
Because everything we're going to
discuss in this entire talk is possible today.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.249
So let's
say today a baby is born.

00:07:47.249 --> 00:07:49.069
Baby Emily.

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:52.620
She's born
completely healthy, lives a normal childhood,

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.259
teenage years,
no problem.

00:07:55.259 --> 00:07:56.840
She gets through her 20s.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.840
She's fine.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.840
She
turns 30.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:05.600
She begins to start a family and all of a
sudden she goes and has a massive heart attack.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.300
She's in
the intensive care unit for about two weeks

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.490
and then
unfortunately she dies.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:17.030
Now, her parent -- I'm sorry --
her physicians did absolutely nothing wrong.

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:20.669
So the
physicians practice medicine as they're taught.

00:08:20.669 --> 00:08:27.210
That
they treated her like a generic patient.

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:30.460
Throughout her
teenage years, throughout her 20s, hardly

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.761
ever does a
doctor closely examine somebody's heart, because

00:08:33.761 --> 00:08:37.600
most
people that age -- their hearts are fine.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.090
But Emily is
unique as most of us are.

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:41.430
She was unique.

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:43.960
She contained
genes that were predisposing her to early

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.450
onset heart
attack and her doctors just had no idea.

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:50.130
They were
standing in that dark room.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:53.260
And that's why a heart
attack was able to go and manifest.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.950
Her cholesterol built up.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:58.890
It was never detected and she had that heart
attack.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:00.620
So
now we have tremendous heartache.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.290
Her family has lost a
loved one.

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:09.410
We have doctors who were powerless to protect
their patient's life.

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:13.380
And we also have society that now
has spent a tremendous amount of money on

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:18.210
this ICU care
in the intensive care unit and lost a productive

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:22.370
member
of their community at the end.

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:25.180
So let's say slightly
different scenario.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.750
Emily is in the intensive care unit.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.870
She's able to be saved and her doctors go
and prescribe a

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:31.880
medication.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:36.680
A medication that they give to a lot of
people in this situation.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.830
And they treat Emily again
like a generic patient.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.019
They start her at 5 milligrams.

00:09:42.019 --> 00:09:45.760
Everybody who receives this blood thinner
receives it at

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.200
5 milligrams.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.780
And most of us are used to that.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.820
When our
doctor prescribes us medications, it's at

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.880
the same dose
that you know they've given to the last person

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.080
and
they'll give to the next person.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:01.750
But, for Emily, she's
extremely sensitive to this medication.

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.470
Her doctors
had no idea.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:08.080
They didn't want to cause any harm, but
they thinned her blood so much with that 5

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.040
milligrams
that she ended up bleeding into her brain

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.760
and she died
again.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.200
So again, we have the loss of life, we have
the

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.200
heartache and we have the loss to society
in terms of

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.080
spending a tremendous amount of money and
now actually

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:27.650
causing more harm than good.

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:31.170
So now, the model of
predictive medicine -- of using genetic testing

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:33.160
-- to
predict disease.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:38.070
We could go all the way to when Emily
is born.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:40.280
Genetic testing is so simple now, doesn't
even

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.150
require any blood.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:45.720
So her parents choose to have genetic
testing for Emily.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:49.500
They collect some of her saliva with
her pediatrician.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:54.940
They send that for testing and analysis, which
we'll talk about later.

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:59.320
And the doctor gets back the
report and sees that Emily contains genes

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.830
that predispose
her to early onset heart attack.

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:05.720
And again, this is
possible now.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.410
So the doctor makes note of that.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:10.880
There's
not much to be done right at that age when

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.230
she's a baby,
but when she enters her teenage years, her

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:17.500
doctors do
something differently.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:21.170
They start to pay attention to
her heart, because that light has been turned

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:22.810
on in the
room.

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:26.580
They know heart disease is lurking in the
shadows.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.870
So they start doing blood tests, they start
monitoring

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.500
her cholesterol levels.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.070
Different biomarkers.

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:37.180
And when she gets
to about 18 or 19, they see that her cholesterol

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.540
levels
start to go up.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:45.170
So the doctors go and work with her --
go over her genetic report in terms of lifestyle

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:47.130
modifications.

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:49.310
Let's not start medications right now,
they say.

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:51.980
Let's focus on lifestyle modifications.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:55.720
They're able to go tailor her cardiovascular
exercise to

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.820
her genes.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:02.550
So that she's able to optimize what are going
to be the most effective exercises for her.

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:05.730
They're also
able to go and start to tailor some of her

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:06.730
nutrition.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:08.260
So
they talk about some of the generic things

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:13.340
we're told in terms of
low fat diet, staying away from refined sugars.

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:16.460
But they
also tell her based upon her genetic profile,

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:20.780
eating a
specific type of vegetable, cruciferous vegetables,

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:24.020
are
likely to be beneficial to her in cutting

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:25.980
down her heart
attack risk.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:30.440
And they also see from her genetic report
that she's likely not to like the taste of

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.190
these
vegetables.

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:37.710
Based upon taste bud genes, those vegetables
are likely to taste really bitter to her.

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:42.850
So they tell her
different methods to still eat those vegetables

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:45.330
but avoid
that bitter taste such as mixing them with

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:46.970
other foods.

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:49.840
So as you see they're completely tailoring
these

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.730
lifestyle recommendations to her genes to
make them as

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:55.510
effective as possible.

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:59.810
So now Emily is able to go and
integrate this into her lifestyle.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:04.260
She slows down the
progression of disease significantly.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:09.950
But then in her
mid 30s, her doctors are still conscientiously

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:11.500
monitoring
her blood.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:15.620
They see her cholesterol levels increasing
again.

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.640
So at that time, her doctors say, "all right,
we

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.690
have to go and start integrating some medications."

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:26.990
The
genes were -- we were able to slow down the

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:29.530
process but
now we need medications.

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:31.610
We need something stronger.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:34.440
So
you look at the genetic profile that was taken

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.280
when Emily
was just a child.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:41.580
And they see that she's very sensitive
to a medication they're about to prescribe.

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:47.130
So instead
of giving 5 milligrams, they give 0.5 milligrams.

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:48.930
Emily
is able to avoid a heart attack.

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:54.300
She's able to raise a
family, have grandchildren, and live a full

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.380
life.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:58.870
Now
the doctors are able to focus in on what's

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:02.340
important for
Emily and also provide the most effective

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.070
preventions and
treatments.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:06.190
So they've been a success, too.

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:09.620
And now our
society has gained a productive member of

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.760
the community
throughout her entire life.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:15.630
And they focus all their
health care spending on that which matters

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:19.670
most and that which is going to be most
effective.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:21.810
So that is what genetic testing now allows
--

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:25.240
it allows us to go turn on that light for
health care.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:29.050
It
allows us to move from our current model of

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:34.290
health care,
which is really more like sick care.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.130
Most of us just
wait until we get sick and then we see a doctor.

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:40.510
We wait
for a disease to occur and then we go and

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:44.540
we diagnose and
doctors hope that they could treat.

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:48.500
But what this new
model -- this genetic testing, this personalization

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:54.650
of healthcare -- allows us to do is actually
go and move to a different paradigm where

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:58.960
we focus on the
proactive personalized prevention of disease

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:03.800
throughout a
person's life.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:10.930
Now, we've been talking about genetic
testing.

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:13.280
It's a bit nebulous to people in terms of
what

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.390
exactly genetic testing is.

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:20.000
And genetic testing is
really a generic term people use to refer

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.230
to three things
or three components of genetic technology.

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:27.810
The first is
testing, so that's the acquisition of raw

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:28.810
data.

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:32.680
The
second is analysis, or clinical analysis,

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.910
that's
transitioning that data, translating it from

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:40.610
this raw
data to an actionable information state.

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:41.900
And the third
is reporting.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.550
It's actually delivering that to the end
user.

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:47.300
We'll talk about each one of those now.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:16:00.820
So the
first component -- just get to the slide -- [pause]

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:16.380
okay great, thank
you.

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.740
So the first component is testing.

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:22.870
And testing is
acquiring all the raw data -- all the letters

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:24.840
of our
genetic code.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.670
And this involves a lot of hardware.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:31.810
So
it involves laboratory function.

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:35.010
And I'm going to talk
about two other types of technology that allows

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:38.590
us to
undergo this genetic testing.

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:41.010
Let's take a step back and
think about where genetic testing was about

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:42.620
ten years ago.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.750
So
ten years ago to look at one single gene may

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:50.810
have cost 5,
10, even 20,000 dollars and it would have

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:53.520
taken months
for that to be turned around.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:58.250
And almost always, you had
to go and give blood; so it was invasive.

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:01.590
Now with this
new technology that we'll discuss first, -- called

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:06.360
a DNA chip
or microarray -- that's a generic term.

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.919
Now with this new
technology, we don't have to look at just

00:17:09.919 --> 00:17:10.919
one gene.

00:17:10.919 --> 00:17:12.999
We
can look at thousands of genes all at the

00:17:12.999 --> 00:17:16.720
same time for
just a few hundred dollars.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:21.769
So it's been a major
inflection point in terms of how much we're

00:17:21.769 --> 00:17:27.319
able to do
for much more cost effective price point.

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:31.100
And also all
we have to do right now is really use saliva.

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.779
We do not
need to use blood anymore.

00:17:33.779 --> 00:17:36.509
So it's become non-invasive.

00:17:36.509 --> 00:17:43.029
And this is a picture of one type of gene
chip, of a DNA

00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:44.029
chip.

00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:52.409
This is the one that I spent about six years
creating called the Nexus DNA chip.

00:17:52.409 --> 00:17:55.570
This is the actual
chip itself.

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:59.279
So one of these is used to process 12
different samples.

00:17:59.279 --> 00:18:02.440
And you could come up and take a look
at this after, but this is just so that you

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:12.000
guys have an
idea of the scale that it's quite small.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.679
And what this
does is, it allows us to look at thousands

00:18:14.679 --> 00:18:17.370
of genes all at
the same time.

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:21.019
And it skips over all of the irrelevant
information.

00:18:21.019 --> 00:18:23.299
So this is one gene.

00:18:23.299 --> 00:18:26.690
And you could think
of all the letters -- so all those are different

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:29.279
GPS
coordinates.

00:18:29.279 --> 00:18:34.429
And only those that are in red are known to
be associated with some clinical state.

00:18:34.429 --> 00:18:35.940
They have some
relevancy.

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:38.770
All the other data is just extraneous.

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:40.950
Even
if we had it, we wouldn't do anything with

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:41.950
it.

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:45.929
So what a
DNA chip allows us to do is hone in -- zero

00:18:45.929 --> 00:18:50.269
in -- on
those that are red and test those in the individual.

00:18:50.269 --> 00:18:54.330
So we're
testing several different letters in one gene.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:56.370
Then we
move on to the next gene and the next and

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:57.370
the next.

00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:00.169
So
we're skipping over all that is superfluous.

00:19:00.169 --> 00:19:02.779
We're
focusing in on that which is most important.

00:19:02.779 --> 00:19:06.960
Now, the Nexus DNA chip is
important for predictive medicine purposes.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.200
There are
different chips out there.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.919
This one is specific for
really protecting a person's health, for preventing

00:19:13.919 --> 00:19:15.970
disease risk and then finding out what's really
going to

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:19.590
be the most effective preventions.

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:24.289
And this has really
unlocked this new era -- this genetic revolution.

00:19:24.289 --> 00:19:28.080
Our
ability to move towards personalization because

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:32.360
of this
technology which is just a few hundred dollars.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:35.840
Now,
there's a new technology that's currently

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:36.840
in development.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:40.020
It's moving along quite rapidly called whole
genome

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:42.720
sequencing.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.710
Many of us are probably familiar with the
human genome project.

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:47.440
That took about ten years.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:51.070
It was
completed in 2003.

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:54.049
And it cost about 3 billion dollars
to accomplish.

00:19:54.049 --> 00:19:56.990
Required an international team of
scientists.

00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:59.799
So 2003, 3 billion dollars.

00:19:59.799 --> 00:20:02.990
And that
was all to sequence a single person.

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:06.629
And whole genome
sequencing mean you're getting 6 billion letters

00:20:06.629 --> 00:20:08.650
per
person.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:12.190
So the DNA chip may acquire tens of thousands
to

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:13.980
millions of letters.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.670
This new technology requires every
single letter.

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:19.539
So it acquires both the black and the
red.

00:20:19.539 --> 00:20:20.730
It doesn't distinguish.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:22.539
It just gets the entire
sequence.

00:20:22.539 --> 00:20:26.059
And that's 6 billion letters per person.

00:20:26.059 --> 00:20:29.379
So
what costs 3 billion dollars and took ten

00:20:29.379 --> 00:20:35.490
years and ended
in 2003 today could be done for 4,000 dollars

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:38.419
and takes
about a month.

00:20:38.419 --> 00:20:43.720
That's projected to come down quite
rapidly all the way to 500, 100 dollar mark

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:48.059
and soon
under a day, maybe even an hour where we're

00:20:48.059 --> 00:20:52.019
able to go
accumulate all this data.

00:20:52.019 --> 00:20:56.700
As we see from the DNA chip
where it's getting tens of thousands to millions

00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:01.669
of relevant data points
to whole genome sequencing that getting 6

00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:03.830
billion, it's
an avalanche of data.

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:08.990
So tremendous amount of raw data
we have to deal with right now.

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:13.519
And that's where the
next component comes in that's clinical analysis.

00:21:13.519 --> 00:21:17.440
So
that's why moving from testing to analysis

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.440
is really
important.

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.380
And we'll talk about that in a moment.

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:24.550
But
first, how relevant is whole genome sequencing

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:27.000
to us?

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.159
And this chart shows the decreasing cost.

00:21:29.159 --> 00:21:32.730
So the lines
that are in red and black and green are different

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:36.119
costs
of this technology of whole genome sequencing.

00:21:36.119 --> 00:21:39.039
The line
that's in blue is a number of people who have

00:21:39.039 --> 00:21:41.419
had their
genome sequenced.

00:21:41.419 --> 00:21:44.320
Number of just individuals.

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:48.749
So by the
end of this year we'll be somewhere around

00:21:48.749 --> 00:21:53.399
50,000; it's
projected to be around that.

00:21:53.399 --> 00:21:59.789
And we think to about 2014
or so we're looking at closer to 10 to 100

00:21:59.789 --> 00:22:00.789
million.

00:22:00.789 --> 00:22:03.129
We
look at 2020, we're looking at close to a

00:22:03.129 --> 00:22:05.140
billion
genomes.

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:10.230
A billion people having their entire sequence
deduced.

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:13.950
So a billion people and 6 billion letters
per

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:15.380
person.

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:19.610
So it's just a tremendous avalanche of data.

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:22.059
And now, the question arises, "What do we
do with all

00:22:22.059 --> 00:22:23.059
that data?

00:22:23.059 --> 00:22:25.450
How do we make sense of that?"

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:28.690
And that's
really what my team and I specialize in.

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:32.639
It's clinical
analysis and reporting of this tremendous

00:22:32.639 --> 00:22:37.669
amount of raw
data that's now able to be accumulated using

00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:39.740
this new
technology.

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:45.759
And what clinical analysis does is, it
translates the data from just raw data into

00:22:45.759 --> 00:22:48.710
actionable
meaningful information.

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:52.730
It allows value to be attributed
to them.

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:56.130
Because without analysis, all those letters
of

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:58.620
a person's genome are really nothing more
than a

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:00.460
high-tech paper weight.

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:04.760
That's -- it's not even a paper
weight because you can fit that on a small

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:05.760
thumb drive.

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.559
So
it's quite light.

00:23:07.559 --> 00:23:13.409
None of that is important to a
person's health unless that data is translated

00:23:13.409 --> 00:23:15.039
into
information.

00:23:15.039 --> 00:23:20.060
I'm going to go through one example of a
clinical analysis technology just so that

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:23.269
you have some
idea of what I'm talking about when I refer

00:23:23.269 --> 00:23:27.220
to analysis.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:30.620
Let's think back to the baby Emily example
that she has

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:34.019
genetic testing, she's found to be at increased
risk of a

00:23:34.019 --> 00:23:42.929
heart attack, then I also mention that different
medications are analyzed.

00:23:42.929 --> 00:23:47.249
So that means that different
genes are looked at after a heart attack risk

00:23:47.249 --> 00:23:48.860
is
detected.

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:54.379
Different genes are analyzed in relation to
different preventions and treatments associated

00:23:54.379 --> 00:23:56.480
with
heart attack.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:00.090
Different lifestyle modifications -- like
the cruciferous vegetables and whether that

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:04.159
taste that
Emily is going to enjoy the taste or not,

00:24:04.159 --> 00:24:06.409
those genes are
analyzed.

00:24:06.409 --> 00:24:11.480
So it's a whole another set, all different
sets of genes are then analyzed after that

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:16.749
initial center
node, that center disease.

00:24:16.749 --> 00:24:21.649
And we could see a flowchart
here that goes first rounds, a risk of heart

00:24:21.649 --> 00:24:23.210
attack is
deduced.

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:26.139
Then the reflex analysis comes in.

00:24:26.139 --> 00:24:29.350
This is all
software based, so we move from the testing

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:32.490
which is
hardware to now the clinical analysis which

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:34.389
is software.

00:24:34.389 --> 00:24:40.530
So the software is doing this and it's programmed
specifically to be able to do this analysis.

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:43.289
It moves
from this first round to this second round

00:24:43.289 --> 00:24:45.429
which looks at
different medications whether they're going

00:24:45.429 --> 00:24:48.070
to be
effective, whether somebody is going to be

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:49.870
sensitive to
them.

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:52.940
It also looks at lifestyle modifications.

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:55.720
We
could even now start to provide someone information

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:59.249
whether surgery -- like a coronary artery
bypass graft-- is

00:24:59.249 --> 00:25:01.049
going to be effective or not.

00:25:01.049 --> 00:25:05.100
That's still in the
preliminary stages while these other information

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:09.519
now is
in the much more advanced stage.

00:25:09.519 --> 00:25:12.350
And then the third
round of analysis we could go even deeper.

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:14.539
So we could
start to look at specific dosing for some

00:25:14.539 --> 00:25:15.539
of the
medications.

00:25:15.539 --> 00:25:21.009
That where we look at whether the person is
going to like the taste of vegetables.

00:25:21.009 --> 00:25:23.960
Look at things that
are associated with exercise.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:28.299
Reflex analysis really
goes as deep as needed in order to get all

00:25:28.299 --> 00:25:30.330
of these
reflexes -- all of these different sets of

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:32.299
genes
analyzed.

00:25:32.299 --> 00:25:40.389
And the whole purpose is to make that analysis
now integrated, which makes it much more actionable.

00:25:40.389 --> 00:25:42.580
And
we'll see that as it's presented in the genetic

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:44.980
report in
a few minutes.

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:48.600
And this allows us to analyze a
tremendous amount of data all at once, so

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.249
all together.

00:25:50.249 --> 00:25:52.711
Instead of thinking about it in a 2-dimensional
way, this

00:25:52.711 --> 00:25:56.870
allows us to analyze things 3-dimensionally.

00:25:56.870 --> 00:26:00.999
And this is
computer software that we created to enable

00:26:00.999 --> 00:26:02.919
this reflex
analysis.

00:26:02.919 --> 00:26:06.440
So that enables us to go and set up these
types of

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:09.679
reflexes, underlying each of the nodes that
you see is a

00:26:09.679 --> 00:26:14.659
whole set of diseases, whole sets of algorithms
for

00:26:14.659 --> 00:26:16.820
traits or medications or conditions.

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:21.259
But this allows us
our IT system to know to analyze one then

00:26:21.259 --> 00:26:24.350
to reflex to
another one and then potentially another one

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:27.519
and another
one.

00:26:27.519 --> 00:26:30.539
So we've talked about testing.

00:26:30.539 --> 00:26:33.809
So the acquiring
the raw data.

00:26:33.809 --> 00:26:40.489
And we talked about analysis -- moving
that data into useful, understandable information.

00:26:40.489 --> 00:26:43.610
And
the third part is really key.

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:49.570
Because without proper
reporting, that testing which may be extremely

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:52.760
accurate
and the analysis which may be beautiful, without

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.960
proper
reporting, then it's all useless.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.460
It's all wasted.

00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:00.909
The
end-user can't easily understand what that

00:27:00.909 --> 00:27:04.580
data means and
can't integrate that beneficially into their

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.450
lives, then
all that usefulness is lost.

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:10.669
The third step is
reporting.

00:27:10.669 --> 00:27:14.429
And there are many different types of report
formats out there.

00:27:14.429 --> 00:27:16.600
One is not better than the other.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:20.090
It's just really dependent upon what you,
the end-user,

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:22.309
wants to get out of genetic testing.

00:27:22.309 --> 00:27:25.559
So I'm going to go
over one of the types of reports.

00:27:25.559 --> 00:27:28.779
This is the report
that my team and I have come up with over

00:27:28.779 --> 00:27:30.929
the past five
years.

00:27:30.929 --> 00:27:32.701
But it's just as important to note that there
are

00:27:32.701 --> 00:27:37.269
many different types of report formats that
are out there now.

00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:43.019
So this is a report format for heart attack
risk.

00:27:43.019 --> 00:27:47.860
This
is the actual report that's printed.

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:51.230
So this is
delivered -- it would be delivered let's say

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:53.269
to Emily's
pediatrician.

00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:56.659
And this is a report page that talks about
heart attack.

00:27:56.659 --> 00:28:01.019
It's actually two pages because there's so
many medications now associated with heart

00:28:01.019 --> 00:28:04.389
disease that
we could provide information about when we

00:28:04.389 --> 00:28:05.710
do genetic
testing.

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:10.940
So right at the top, we see three gauges.

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:13.869
The
gauge right in the center is risk.

00:28:13.869 --> 00:28:16.590
So this person is at
high risk.

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:19.769
And it says specifically about 67 percent
risk.

00:28:19.769 --> 00:28:22.840
We like to focus more on the qualitative on
these

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:23.840
zones.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:27.590
So they're in the zone of high risk.

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:30.649
And that is
based upon analysis many different genes.

00:28:30.649 --> 00:28:34.299
And it's also
compared right below it to what's called generic

00:28:34.299 --> 00:28:35.830
population risk.

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:41.070
That's the everyday risk for a person
if they have no idea what their genes contain.

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:44.279
It's just
taken off of mass population studies and say

00:28:44.279 --> 00:28:48.239
how many
people around this age with this ethnicity

00:28:48.239 --> 00:28:52.610
with this
gender are likely to have this disease?

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:56.529
And for heart
attacks, for a Caucasian male, it's around

00:28:56.529 --> 00:28:58.620
47%
lifetime risk.

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:03.100
For this person based upon their genes,
it's closer to 70 percent risk.

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:05.129
So they're at high risk.

00:29:05.129 --> 00:29:06.580
Now there are two other gauges.

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:11.690
A gauge on the left is
the clinical significance gauge.

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:15.250
And that's there so
that a person understands, "is this information

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:17.570
even
relevant to their health?"

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:21.200
Because there's some diseases
or conditions that they may be really at high

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.159
risk for
but it's not going to impact them significantly,

00:29:24.159 --> 00:29:26.249
it's not
going to cause them a lot of harm, it's not

00:29:26.249 --> 00:29:30.259
going to be something
they have to focus on or worry about.

00:29:30.259 --> 00:29:34.200
So if in the report,
there are some things that are very high clinical

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.740
significance high risk.

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:40.700
And there are other things that
are very low clinical significance but high

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:41.700
risk.

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:44.210
They
know to focus on the ones that are more significant.

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:48.759
They know -- they're able to differentiate
and their

00:29:48.759 --> 00:29:51.259
health care provider is able to differentiate
also and

00:29:51.259 --> 00:29:52.259
say, "okay.

00:29:52.259 --> 00:29:53.259
This one is much more important.

00:29:53.259 --> 00:29:56.609
Let's
focus on this."

00:29:56.609 --> 00:29:59.400
And for heart attack, it's very
significant to somebody's health.

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:02.429
If somebody has a
heart attack, they could die, which is why

00:30:02.429 --> 00:30:04.900
it has high
clinical significance.

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:10.169
Now, the last gauge and one on the
right is actionability.

00:30:10.169 --> 00:30:14.559
So even if somebody comes back
at high risk for something and it's very clinically

00:30:14.559 --> 00:30:17.929
significant and there's low actionability,
there's

00:30:17.929 --> 00:30:20.549
nothing that could be done about it, then
again what's the

00:30:20.549 --> 00:30:21.690
point?

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:29.049
So we really focus on the conditions, diseases
that have either moderate or high actionability.

00:30:29.049 --> 00:30:31.390
So
actionability means that we can implement

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:36.289
preventions
such as lifestyle modifications, medications,

00:30:36.289 --> 00:30:40.549
complementary medicine therapies and even
different

00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:41.999
screening exams.

00:30:41.999 --> 00:30:46.840
We could implement these and either
prevent the disease outright or slow it down

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:50.500
significantly so that it manifests much later.

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.239
And that
physicians now know to be on the lookout for

00:30:53.239 --> 00:30:56.450
these so
that it's detected at its earliest stages

00:30:56.450 --> 00:31:00.320
and able to be
treated much more effectively.

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:03.739
So that's the
actionability gauge.

00:31:03.739 --> 00:31:10.789
Now, about 60 percent of this heart
attack page is devoted to actionability to

00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:14.450
actually
describing, "what can be done with this information?"

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:17.049
So
that gauge says actionability is high.

00:31:17.049 --> 00:31:22.419
Now what do we do
with that in order to make it actionable?

00:31:22.419 --> 00:31:24.529
And that's a
section that we call genetically tailored

00:31:24.529 --> 00:31:25.820
prevention.

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:28.919
So
this is prevention where many of the recommendations

00:31:28.919 --> 00:31:32.619
here
are based on a person's genes.

00:31:32.619 --> 00:31:36.210
And we see in the
lifestyle modifications one -- the second

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:39.169
from the last
bullet point -- is that cruciferous vegetable

00:31:39.169 --> 00:31:42.100
example that we
talked about with Emily.

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:46.299
And there are other
recommendations within this genetically tailored

00:31:46.299 --> 00:31:49.350
prevention section that is on the screen now
that are

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:54.880
based upon an analysis of a person's genes
using reflex analysis.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.999
So we
see now through the testing-acquired data,

00:31:57.999 --> 00:32:01.410
the analysis
analyzed it in this integrated way and the

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:05.279
reporting is
able to present it in a very integrated way

00:32:05.279 --> 00:32:11.429
that makes
for a rapid understanding and very easy for

00:32:11.429 --> 00:32:13.809
a person to
go and integrate this into their life and

00:32:13.809 --> 00:32:17.019
to benefit from
this information as well as their health care

00:32:17.019 --> 00:32:20.210
provider to
use this information to change their clinical

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:23.710
management
and really provide much more personalized

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:24.710
services.

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:31.789
So
what we've seen now that genetic technology

00:32:31.789 --> 00:32:32.909
-- there's
three components.

00:32:32.909 --> 00:32:40.080
The testing, the analysis, and the
reporting.

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:42.309
Now where can you get genetic testing?

00:32:42.309 --> 00:32:44.499
Let's
say you're interested in genetic testing.

00:32:44.499 --> 00:32:47.889
Where can you
go to actually access your genes and to learn

00:32:47.889 --> 00:32:50.679
what can
you do to protect your health?

00:32:50.679 --> 00:32:52.919
And there are many
different places.

00:32:52.919 --> 00:32:54.929
So the first is the Internet.

00:32:54.929 --> 00:32:58.110
You can
go and have Direct to Consumer genetic testing.

00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:00.730
Which
means you don't need a professional involved.

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:02.700
You can go to a website.

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:06.590
You could pay for a service
that they will send you the collection kit

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:08.330
just for
saliva.

00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:09.979
You send them back some of your saliva and
in

00:33:09.979 --> 00:33:13.950
about three or four weeks you get your results
online.

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:17.249
Now, the other way to get it is through a
health care

00:33:17.249 --> 00:33:19.610
professional or health and wellness organization.

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:21.889
And
there's no right way or wrong way.

00:33:21.889 --> 00:33:24.929
It's really based
upon your personal preference, what you feel

00:33:24.929 --> 00:33:28.830
is best for
yourself and what you hope to get out of this

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:30.970
testing
process.

00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:36.220
So you could also go through your doctor who
could go and perform this testing, collect

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:39.490
the saliva,
receive the report and then work with you

00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:43.260
to integrate
that information into your clinical care so

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:46.190
that it
changes the way they're providing their care

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:49.700
and also
they're able to counsel you on that information

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:52.609
so that
you know what's best to integrate into your

00:33:52.609 --> 00:33:56.400
lifestyle and
into your daily habits.

00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:01.440
Now, part of that also is health
and wellness organizations.

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:05.450
So beyond just health care
providers, health and wellness organizations,

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:08.179
like
nutritionists, weight loss centers and even

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:12.440
fitness
centers are starting to use genetic testing.

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:16.599
I'm going
to walk you through a process so you can understand

00:34:16.599 --> 00:34:19.010
from
beginning to end what's involved when I say

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:21.399
genetic
testing.

00:34:21.399 --> 00:34:26.510
So let's say you want genetic testing and
you're interested in having it through a health

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:29.169
and
wellness organization.

00:34:29.169 --> 00:34:33.190
You can actually have genetic
testing now through Equinox Fitness.

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:36.639
Many of us are
familiar with equinox from Palo Alto on El

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:38.700
Camino Real.

00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:42.740
So they are providing genetic testing services
for their trainers

00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:46.049
and the genetic testing is meant to optimize
fitness and

00:34:46.049 --> 00:34:50.300
also work to prevent some exercise-related
diseases and

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:51.980
conditions.

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:53.859
So your interested in genetic testing.

00:34:53.859 --> 00:34:54.859
You go
to equinox.

00:34:54.859 --> 00:34:59.920
You meet with one of their fitness coaches.
and you say you're interested in genetic testing.

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.330
You
talk about it with them.

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:06.670
And they provide you with the
saliva collection kit.

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:09.440
This is an actual saliva
collection kit.

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:16.310
So basically you just spit into this kit
and this thing goes to a laboratory where

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:20.799
it gets
processed on a DNA chip.

00:35:20.799 --> 00:35:25.450
Then a report is generated.

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:28.839
This is one of the sample Equinox reports.

00:35:28.839 --> 00:35:31.520
So the
report's generated and it contains information

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:34.940
that's
specific for the person who's ordering it.

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:37.460
So for a
fitness trainer, this really only contains

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:41.140
information
that's specific for them as a fitness trainer

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:46.250
that will
help them optimize your fitness and athletic

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:49.730
performance.

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:53.160
So they get this report back, they review
the report, and

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:55.480
they meet with you and they discuss ways that
they're

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:58.550
going to integrate into your fitness.

00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:01.859
One of the ways is
that they see that you're predisposed to endurance-based

00:36:01.859 --> 00:36:03.260
activities.

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:05.710
So while you may have been doing
power-based.

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:10.920
Power is high intensity for low durations
of time.

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.480
While you may have been doing that in the
past

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.950
and seeing limited gains, now you could focus
more on

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:17.710
what your genes are predisposing you for.

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:21.400
So you could
focus on low endurance which is less intensity

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:23.119
but longer
periods of time.

00:36:23.119 --> 00:36:26.290
Instead of 10, 15 minutes intervals you're
working out,

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:32.160
doing cardiovascular exercise for 30,
45, 60 minute intervals.

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:37.940
So they're able now to tailor
and personalize their services to your genes.

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:41.440
But beyond
that, they also learn that you're predisposed

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:43.080
to
osteoporosis.

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:48.730
That's another page that's in here that
provides osteoporosis risk.

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:54.380
So while a lot of women go
and osteoporosis manifests around the time

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:55.380
of menopause.

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:57.100
So around 50s or late 50s.

00:36:57.100 --> 00:37:01.900
The bone loss -- the thinning
of the bone that leads to osteoporosis -- it

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:07.130
starts in
their late 20s and early 30s.

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:11.990
So by learning about
osteoporosis risk, a trainer is able to identify

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:16.320
a person
who would benefit from resistance training.

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:19.700
So that's
doing more weight-bearing exercises and a

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:22.339
lot of women
who are in their teenage years and 20s and

00:37:22.339 --> 00:37:25.140
30s, they
don't do any resistance training, or they

00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:26.369
do it
sporadically.

00:37:26.369 --> 00:37:30.170
Because they just want to focus on
cardiovascular exercise.

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:34.520
So now the trainer knows how
important it is for this specific person to

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:36.590
do weight
training.

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:42.100
And they counsel that person on the importance
of integrating weight training into their

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:43.109
exercise
regimen.

00:37:43.109 --> 00:37:46.270
They integrate it into the training themselves.

00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:48.680
And now, this person is able to go and fortify
their

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:51.150
bones, so strengthen their bones, especially
the ones in

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:54.820
the lower back, the hips, the wrists, the
upper arm.

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:57.750
Through specific exercises that they're now
doing with

00:37:57.750 --> 00:38:01.619
their trainer throughout their 20s and 30s,
40s.

00:38:01.619 --> 00:38:03.830
By the
time they get to their 50s, those bones are

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:04.830
fortified.

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:06.069
They're stronger.

00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:11.060
And now osteoporosis won't occur for
decades.

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:17.180
So the trainer has actually helped that person
go and avoid osteoporosis by integrating in

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:20.549
exercises
that previously that person may have been

00:38:20.549 --> 00:38:21.849
hesitant to do.

00:38:21.849 --> 00:38:23.750
And that trainer may have said, "okay, I don't
want to

00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:26.990
push this person because they seem to be more
focused on

00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:30.089
cardiovascular exercise so I'll just go with
that."

00:38:30.089 --> 00:38:31.730
So
it provides guidance.

00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:36.740
Now, it also allows us to go and
take away certain exercises.

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:41.579
On the next page after
osteoporosis, it provides an analysis of arthritis

00:38:41.579 --> 00:38:42.579
risk.

00:38:42.579 --> 00:38:47.950
Arthritis, separately, it's analyzed in the
hips, knees, and the

00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:49.349
wrists as well.

00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:55.360
So, the genetic report comes back and
the fitness trainer sees that the person is

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.270
predisposed
to knee arthritis.

00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:59.780
Very high risk of knee arthritis.

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:03.410
So
he starts to pull that person away from activities

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:05.360
that
have impact upon the knee.

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:08.840
Instead of telling that
person to jog, instead of saying it's all

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:13.270
right to go run
on that treadmill after we're done with our

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:15.690
session,
they're saying, "okay.

00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:17.089
Now you have to avoid jogging.

00:39:17.089 --> 00:39:20.410
You have to cut down the treadmill or exclude
that

00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:21.410
totally.

00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:23.720
Instead focus your cardiovascular exercise
on

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:28.109
elliptical, on biking or on swimming."

00:39:28.109 --> 00:39:32.050
So osteoporosis
they're integrating in specific exercises.

00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:35.049
Now they're
pulling away and they're changing around modifying

00:39:35.049 --> 00:39:38.160
their
plan so that they're avoiding causing more

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:40.710
harm to this
individual.

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:45.660
So instead of that person growing up and by
the time they're 50, their knees are completely

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:48.670
gone and
by the time they're 55 or 60 they need a knee

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:52.210
replacement
surgery, now we're preserving that knee function.

00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:55.250
We're
allowing that person to age healthy.

00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:58.589
So that when they
get to their 50s, when they get to their 60s,

00:39:58.589 --> 00:40:01.520
their knees
are in much better shape.

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:06.049
So that's how this information
is being used today by a health and wellness

00:40:06.049 --> 00:40:11.560
organization, by Equinox So we've identified
a major

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.940
problem with our health care system that we're
in the

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:14.940
Dark Ages.

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:19.210
That we don't really know how to personalize
our services to the individual.

00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:22.740
We're just treating
people as generic object.

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:26.730
But we also have a solution
which is genetic testing.

00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:30.970
And through that solution
we're able to go and personalize the field

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:33.380
of health
care.

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:36.180
And the last question that arises is, "why
is this

00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:37.520
important now?"

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:40.569
Why do you need this now?

00:40:40.569 --> 00:40:42.710
And it's a
3-part answer.

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:46.539
The first is that we need to integrate
genetic testing and predictive medicine into

00:40:46.539 --> 00:40:50.390
our health
care system now because our health care system

00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:54.069
-- our
sick care system -- which is true of the entire

00:40:54.069 --> 00:40:56.430
world, is
unsustainable.

00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:59.599
It's no different than our reliance on
fossil fuels.

00:40:59.599 --> 00:41:06.130
That we need to move to a new renewable,
sustainable model of fuel and we need to do

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:07.880
the same
thing with health care.

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:11.160
We need to find a new renewable,
sustainable model.

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:16.510
One that focuses not on the defensive
aspect of just treating disease once it occurs

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:19.950
but
instead on the proactive prevention of disease.

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:22.210
And
that's what genetic testing now allows.

00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:24.480
So we can't wait
20 years.

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:25.890
We can't wait ten years.

00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:30.460
Too much of the
world GDP of every single country is devoted

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:32.010
towards
health care costs.

00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:37.390
It doesn't matter if the model is
American one or the Canadian or the one in

00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:38.390
Europe.

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:39.660
It
doesn't matter what health care cost it is,

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:44.170
it's still a
tremendous portion of the GDP and it's only

00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:45.930
skyrocketing.

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:47.650
So it's unsustainable.

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:50.710
And we need the new model and we
need to start enacting that now.

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:55.630
Because it's going to
take time for it to spread throughout medicine

00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:58.329
for other
specialties to go and to adopt it.

00:41:58.329 --> 00:42:02.549
That's why we have to
start now to save our entire health care system.

00:42:02.549 --> 00:42:06.530
Now,
the second reason why we need this now is

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:09.109
to save
ourselves.

00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:14.589
Now, prevention is most effective when it's
started early.

00:42:14.589 --> 00:42:16.930
And we have extremely good tools now.

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:18.329
We
have excellent testing.

00:42:18.329 --> 00:42:23.850
We have great analysis and we
have really amazing reporting.

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:27.770
So we have the tools now
to identify risk, to start preventions.

00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:31.869
And the earlier
preventions are started, the more effective

00:42:31.869 --> 00:42:35.710
they are in
preventing a disease.

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:42.180
As an example, a tragic example,
there was a high school basketball player

00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:46.099
-- his name was
Wes Leonard -- earlier this year, he was playing

00:42:46.099 --> 00:42:47.619
basketball.

00:42:47.619 --> 00:42:49.359
He went out for the game-winning shot.

00:42:49.359 --> 00:42:50.990
He
made the shot.

00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:52.359
He won the game for his team.

00:42:52.359 --> 00:42:53.430
He went in
the locker room.

00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:54.430
He was celebrating.

00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:57.039
This is a high
school basketball player.

00:42:57.039 --> 00:43:01.900
Celebrating and all of a
sudden he collapses and he dies.

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:05.510
Upon autopsy, the
doctors find that he had a condition called

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:08.569
dilated
cardiomyopathy.

00:43:08.569 --> 00:43:10.500
Now the doctors didn't do anything
wrong.

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:13.730
They didn't go and miss this.

00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:15.280
It's just they
weren't looking for it.

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:19.730
They didn't know that in this
teenager, they had to go and assess his heart.

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:22.059
Because
the majority of teenagers, their hearts are

00:43:22.059 --> 00:43:23.059
fine.

00:43:23.059 --> 00:43:25.260
Doctors
don't worry about the heart until late 30s

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:29.549
or 40s even
50s.

00:43:29.549 --> 00:43:33.559
But for Wes Leonard, he had a gene, he possibly
had

00:43:33.559 --> 00:43:36.039
a gene -- they haven't done genetic testing
on him -- but

00:43:36.039 --> 00:43:41.119
very likely this condition was caused by genetic
abnormality.

00:43:41.119 --> 00:43:47.690
So he had this underlying condition,
dilated cardiomyopathy, that went undiagnosed.

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:49.510
And
that's what led to his death.

00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:53.599
Now, I frequently test
patients for this condition and a large number

00:43:53.599 --> 00:43:56.460
of other
preventable sudden cardiac death.

00:43:56.460 --> 00:44:01.630
So I test them on a
genetic level using this Nexus DNA chip, using

00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:03.190
just
saliva.

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:05.859
At the same time we're looking at all the
risks

00:44:05.859 --> 00:44:08.160
for different types of cancers, heart disease.

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:10.950
We're
also looking at preventable causes of sudden

00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:11.950
death.

00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:15.279
Now
I've detected dilated cardiomyopathy in patients.

00:44:15.279 --> 00:44:17.839
I've
detected other sudden death diseases that

00:44:17.839 --> 00:44:18.839
are
preventable.

00:44:18.839 --> 00:44:24.990
They all have complicated names like long
QT syndrome and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:27.190
and
arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia.

00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:30.970
So I've detected these in people.

00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:33.329
They go and they see a cardiologist and prevention.

00:44:33.329 --> 00:44:35.320
It's
very simple preventions.

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:36.910
Usually just medications.

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:39.520
Low
cost medications are enacted.

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:42.020
And sudden death is
avoided.

00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:47.690
So in Wes Leonard's case one thing that could
have saved him was if he had genetic testing.

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:51.730
As you see, It's not like he could have waited
for that.

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:52.970
One year, five years.

00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:56.849
He needed it last year.

00:44:56.849 --> 00:45:00.880
So this is not only applicable
to preventable sudden cardiac at the time,

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.460
it's also
applicable to all different types of cancer

00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:08.930
from breast
cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, skin

00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:10.620
cancer, such
as melanoma.

00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:12.910
Applicable to heart disease.

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:16.240
It's even
applicable to Alzheimer's disease where we

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:20.359
have different
interventions we can enact throughout life

00:45:20.359 --> 00:45:23.589
which has been
shown to decrease either the risk of that

00:45:23.589 --> 00:45:27.910
disease or
greatly delay its onset.

00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:30.260
So we have that ability today.

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:33.910
Now, the third reason why this is so important
-- why we

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:39.880
need this now -- is to save our future generations.

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:42.339
So
genetic testing now allows us to identify

00:45:42.339 --> 00:45:45.829
what diseases
we carry in our genes.

00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:49.039
And by "carry," I mean we may not
have that disease.

00:45:49.039 --> 00:45:51.059
We most likely don't have that
disease.

00:45:51.059 --> 00:45:53.329
We have no way of knowing that we carry it.

00:45:53.329 --> 00:45:55.200
These are rare diseases.

00:45:55.200 --> 00:46:01.160
Rare recessive diseases like
cystic fibrosis, Tay-Sach's disease, sickle

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:03.000
cell anemia.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.020
So we have no idea that we may carry these
diseases, but

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:09.380
if we have a child with somebody who also
carries the

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:12.960
same disease, then there's a high likelihood
that the

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:15.660
child will have that disease.

00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:21.950
That's why we see often
people will have a child and that child will

00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:24.551
have a
disease and the parents will say, "I had no

00:46:24.551 --> 00:46:27.730
idea that I
carried this.

00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:30.599
It's never manifested in my family before.

00:46:30.599 --> 00:46:32.040
This is the first time."

00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:36.890
But through genetic testing, we
can now identify what diseases we carry.

00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:40.020
And geneticists
postulate that each person probably carries

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:42.590
three or four
diseases.

00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:46.550
Each of us in this room right now are carrying
three to four rare diseases.

00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:47.839
Do you know which ones they
are?

00:46:47.839 --> 00:46:50.500
Do you know your spouse -- that person you're
going

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:55.310
to have a child with -- also carries those
diseases.

00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:59.549
Using
gene chip technology --so this Nexus DNA chip--

00:46:59.549 --> 00:47:01.700
, at first we
could screen for a handful.

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:03.740
Now we could screen for
hundreds.

00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:06.960
Just recently we enabled this to gene for
over

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:07.960
1,000 rare diseases.

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:11.290
Over 1,000 rare diseases all at the
same time.

00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:15.089
So we could start to identify who's carrying
what disease.

00:47:15.089 --> 00:47:17.140
Doesn't mean that anything's wrong with
the person.

00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:22.880
It just means that now they could take
proactive steps to protect their future generations.

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:25.440
And
there are clear things they could do to protect

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:28.400
their
future generations from inheriting a deadly

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.440
disease if
both they carry it and a spouse or whoever

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:36.160
they're going to have a
child with also carries that disease.

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:41.109
So it allows us to
save our health care system, save ourselves,

00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:43.859
and to save
future generations all today.

00:47:43.859 --> 00:47:48.000
And this is all possible
because we have this inflection point with

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.760
the technology.

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:52.410
So the testing now has come down tremendously
in price.

00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:56.319
It's unlocked a way to access all of our genes.

00:47:56.319 --> 00:47:59.191
We have
ways to analyze and understand this, because

00:47:59.191 --> 00:48:01.250
we have 30
years of research.

00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:05.349
30 years of genetic research, of
looking at what genes are associated with

00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:06.920
what disease.

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:09.339
But
up until this technology that research has

00:48:09.339 --> 00:48:11.309
only been
relegated to the library.

00:48:11.309 --> 00:48:16.589
It's been published then it
goes into the library and it's not in use.

00:48:16.589 --> 00:48:19.040
But with this
technology now, we can move it out of the

00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:24.870
library and we
can make it all about one single person -- and

00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:26.940
that's
you.

00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:30.569
Thank you.

00:48:30.569 --> 00:48:35.430
Now, for some questions now?

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:36.460
Okay,
great

00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:40.529
&gt;&gt;Male #1: I'm curious about the rate among
the

00:48:40.529 --> 00:48:44.589
general population for which you think that
genetic

00:48:44.589 --> 00:48:48.470
testing can uncover, I guess, traits where
there's

00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:51.180
actionable advice for how to avoid disease.

00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:55.519
Like in
the case of cardiovascular disease, it's my

00:48:55.519 --> 00:48:58.890
understanding that there are some very rare
genetic

00:48:58.890 --> 00:49:01.210
conditions that obviously it would be good
to test

00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:04.880
for, but more commonly it seems to be lifestyle
factors that are responsible.

00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:05.880
&gt;&gt;Dr. Colby: Right.

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:10.440
So there are two parts to that
question.

00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:17.440
The question was asking about how many
really common diseases that we could do something

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:19.309
about can we test for now?

00:49:19.309 --> 00:49:24.330
Is it only really just
rare diseases, possibly rare cardiovascular

00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:26.069
diseases can we test for.

00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:30.380
Are there really the common ones that we
could learn something about and have that

00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:32.220
be
actionable?

00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:36.079
And the answer is, there are actually a
large number right now that we can test for

00:49:36.079 --> 00:49:39.099
that are
common that is actionable.

00:49:39.099 --> 00:49:42.190
So we mentioned a lot of
different types of cancer from breast cancer,

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:45.440
colon
cancer, skin cancer, prostate cancer -- those

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:47.260
are
the big four.

00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:52.609
Except for lung cancer, which we know
is mainly attributed to smoking, that has

00:49:52.609 --> 00:49:56.130
much less
of a genetic effect.

00:49:56.130 --> 00:49:58.119
So those are all highly
actionable.

00:49:58.119 --> 00:50:02.250
If we even learn that a baby is at
risk, we can add preventions throughout life.

00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:04.339
For
cardiovascular disease, we've seen this example

00:50:04.339 --> 00:50:05.960
with heart attack.

00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:07.970
That heart attack analysis where we saw that
person

00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:09.510
was close to 70 percent.

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:12.060
That was based on a large
number of genes.

00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:15.490
So we're not just looking at one
gene that has a small degree of risk.

00:50:15.490 --> 00:50:18.680
We're looking
at a lot of different genes, all of them have

00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:19.900
small risks.

00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:25.380
But together, when a person has a lot of different
small risks, that adds up and starts to build

00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:27.089
upon
itself.

00:50:27.089 --> 00:50:32.569
So that does enable us to see very high
risks in people even if they don't have those

00:50:32.569 --> 00:50:34.180
rare
conditions.

00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:38.920
So even if they have just more common
forms of cholesterol build up and heart attack

00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:40.109
risk.

00:50:40.109 --> 00:50:41.900
And the same thing with Alzheimer's disease.

00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:44.430
So
Alzheimer's disease has stolen the minds of

00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:46.680
an
entire generation.

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:49.790
And many of us fear that that
will be our fate.

00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:57.119
We can now predict risk of
Alzheimer's disease and we could do that quite

00:50:57.119 --> 00:50:58.339
well.

00:50:58.339 --> 00:50:59.809
And we can enact preventions.

00:50:59.809 --> 00:51:04.309
So there's no way to
stop Alzheimer's disease, but there's ways,

00:51:04.309 --> 00:51:08.440
clear ways to
slow it down tremendously from ever occurring

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:10.760
so
that if we just push it back ten years instead

00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:13.390
of
affecting a person when they're 75 years,

00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:14.930
it starts at 85.

00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:18.849
That's a large number of golden years they
have to

00:51:18.849 --> 00:51:21.440
live that are healthy instead of sick.

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:27.450
And also with a large amount of money putting
towards research towards pharmaceuticals that

00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:31.690
are
working to actually cure diseases like Alzheimer's,

00:51:31.690 --> 00:51:34.850
those ten years may be all that a person needs
to

00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:37.589
stay healthy until a new medication comes
out.

00:51:37.589 --> 00:51:40.640
So
it's buying time for a large number of people.

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:42.940
So
there are a large number of common diseases.

00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:46.730
It
also falls into a spectrum of autoimmune diseases,

00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:53.700
blood clotting disorders, a lot of useful
information that unfortunately a lot of people

00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:57.260
think
that it's just cystic fibrosis or it's just

00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:00.240
Tay-Sach's
disease or it's just the dilated cardiomyopathy

00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:01.240
that
I mentioned.

00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:04.859
But just recently, it really has
expanded out to include a large number of

00:52:04.859 --> 00:52:06.450
actionable
common diseases.

00:52:06.450 --> 00:52:07.450
Yes?

00:52:07.450 --> 00:52:13.079
&gt;&gt;Female #1: I'm curious to know how static
is a

00:52:13.079 --> 00:52:15.190
person's genetic profile as they grow, as
they

00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:18.720
age -- does it change or once you've taken
the

00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:21.110
profile of a person when they're a baby, does
that

00:52:21.110 --> 00:52:23.380
still hold when they're older?

00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:28.000
&gt;&gt;Dr. Colby: So the question is, "Does the
genetic

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.069
makeup of a person -- the genetic profile
-- does

00:52:30.069 --> 00:52:32.319
that change with age?"

00:52:32.319 --> 00:52:34.950
So we mentioned the example
of baby Emily.

00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:36.990
She had that genetic testing when
she was a baby.

00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:41.970
If she had genetic testing again
when she was 50 years old, would that information

00:52:41.970 --> 00:52:42.970
change?

00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:44.210
Would that raw data change?

00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:48.069
And the raw
data -- so the letters themselves -- do not

00:52:48.069 --> 00:52:49.069
change.

00:52:49.069 --> 00:52:50.560
At the moment of conception on the moment
of

00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:54.970
death -- those raw data, those letters -- of
the genetic code

00:52:54.970 --> 00:52:56.010
are the same.

00:52:56.010 --> 00:53:02.390
Those things around our genes that
turn our genes on and off -- those change.

00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:03.940
It's
called the epigenome.

00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:07.500
The epigenetics but the raw
data -- what we're able to acquire now with

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:10.760
the DNA
chip with whole genome sequencing -- that

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:12.890
does not
change.

00:53:12.890 --> 00:53:17.309
So with whole genome sequencing, if we
sequence a newborn, we get those 6 billion

00:53:17.309 --> 00:53:20.609
letters,
they really never need to have a similar type

00:53:20.609 --> 00:53:23.150
of
genetic test again.

00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:24.700
We have all that data.

00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:25.700
It's
all there.

00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:28.809
Now it all comes down to analysis and
reporting of that information.

00:53:28.809 --> 00:53:33.279
Female #1: The other question is will their
propensity to certain diseases change because

00:53:33.279 --> 00:53:38.300
certain markers come on and off based on certain
environmental factors they're dealing with?

00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:42.160
&gt;&gt;Dr. Colby: So so the propensity for disease
based

00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:46.140
upon just the raw data will not change.

00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:49.579
But their
propensity will change because almost all

00:53:49.579 --> 00:53:53.230
of these
common diseases -- heart disease, the cancers,

00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:57.170
Alzheimer's -- it's not either only genes
or only

00:53:57.170 --> 00:53:59.390
environment, it's a combination.

00:53:59.390 --> 00:54:03.359
So by learning
about our genetic risks, we're able to modify

00:54:03.359 --> 00:54:07.180
our
non-genetic risk factors -- lifestyle, medications,

00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:10.369
foods we eat, exercises we do.

00:54:10.369 --> 00:54:14.109
So that will change
the total risk.

00:54:14.109 --> 00:54:19.579
Now, people though -- let's say a
person goes and smokes -- that will turn on

00:54:19.579 --> 00:54:23.880
and off
certain genes that are protecting or increasing

00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:25.529
a
person's risk of cancer.

00:54:25.529 --> 00:54:29.619
So they can modify if
genes turn on and off, but not the raw data

00:54:29.619 --> 00:54:31.410
-- not
those letters themselves.

00:54:31.410 --> 00:54:33.220
That is going to stay
the same.

00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:37.099
Male #2: My question is around the accuracy
of

00:54:37.099 --> 00:54:40.619
genetic testing and actually identifying whether
something that somebody

00:54:40.619 --> 00:54:45.940
is predisposed to is going to manifest
itself versus somebody who's not predisposed

00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:47.130
to it
genetic testing will come out.

00:54:47.130 --> 00:54:51.309
So if you took ten people identified
through tests testing that might have something,

00:54:51.309 --> 00:54:53.769
what's the likelihood that they actually end
up showing it

00:54:53.769 --> 00:54:54.900
versus ten random people?

00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:55.900
&gt;&gt;Dr. Colby: Right.

00:54:55.900 --> 00:55:00.329
So the question is about the
accuracy of genetic testing data.

00:55:00.329 --> 00:55:02.779
Are these
predictions that are being made -- those risk

00:55:02.779 --> 00:55:05.440
predictions -- how accurate are they?

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:09.200
And the
accuracy is really disease dependent -- disease

00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:10.829
or
trait dependent.

00:55:10.829 --> 00:55:15.849
It differs depending on the amount
of research that's been conducted about those

00:55:15.849 --> 00:55:18.980
genes
that are associated with that disease.

00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:22.130
So for
diseases like heart attack or diseases like

00:55:22.130 --> 00:55:25.049
Alzheimer's, for many types of cancer or even
many

00:55:25.049 --> 00:55:27.960
types of autoimmune diseases, the accuracy
is very

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:29.670
high right now.

00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:34.550
For other diseases like brain cancer,
pancreatic cancer -- different types of the

00:55:34.550 --> 00:55:37.980
rarer
cancers -- the accuracy is quite low.

00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:41.190
That we only
have a few markers and is they're not very

00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:42.190
predictive.

00:55:42.190 --> 00:55:46.359
Now, it's true that over time these
predictions are going to only improve.

00:55:46.359 --> 00:55:48.549
That we're
going to learn that there are more genes.

00:55:48.549 --> 00:55:51.160
We're
going to integrate that into the analysis.

00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:53.339
So the
analysis is going to change.

00:55:53.339 --> 00:55:58.230
But that's true of all of
medicine, that there's no component on medicine

00:55:58.230 --> 00:56:01.589
that
is locked, that is concrete.

00:56:01.589 --> 00:56:02.609
Medicine is always
changing.

00:56:02.609 --> 00:56:03.609
It's always evolving.

00:56:03.609 --> 00:56:06.599
And genetics and predictive
medicine is no different.

00:56:06.599 --> 00:56:13.070
And as an example, CPR
was practiced one way for about 100 years.

00:56:13.070 --> 00:56:15.590
And just
recently it came out that that was not the

00:56:15.590 --> 00:56:16.590
correct
way.

00:56:16.590 --> 00:56:18.140
That it could be done better.

00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:21.539
So CPR
guidelines were completely modified.

00:56:21.539 --> 00:56:23.960
And now, that
old way is no more.

00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:26.609
And we have a new method for
CPR.

00:56:26.609 --> 00:56:28.710
So that doesn't mean that CPR -- all the people
who

00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:31.980
were performing CPR in the 60s and 70s and
80s

00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:34.180
should have never been doing it.

00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:37.410
It just means that,
as part of medicine, things are going to improve

00:56:37.410 --> 00:56:40.021
and
they're going to get better as new research

00:56:40.021 --> 00:56:41.021
comes
out.

00:56:41.021 --> 00:56:45.819
That will certainly happen with genetic
testing as well.

00:56:45.819 --> 00:56:50.770
&gt;&gt;Female #2: I have a question.

00:56:50.770 --> 00:56:53.670
Well, the first
question I wondered is for some of these rare

00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:56.280
diseases now that you're able to test people
who

00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:58.549
don't suspect they would have a rare disease,
are

00:56:58.549 --> 00:57:00.730
you finding that they're more common?

00:57:00.730 --> 00:57:03.440
Or is it kind
of upholding the original estimates?

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:07.400
&gt;&gt;Dr. Colby: So we're finding that a lot of
times it is more

00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:11.329
common in terms of people who carry those
diseases.

00:57:11.329 --> 00:57:14.980
Just because we never before had the ability
to

00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:16.890
actually screen for those.

00:57:16.890 --> 00:57:21.450
So we're finding that
people do carry some of the more common rare

00:57:21.450 --> 00:57:24.349
diseases, like Tay-Sach's or cystic fibrosis.

00:57:24.349 --> 00:57:27.509
We're
identifying them then saying, "well, my family

00:57:27.509 --> 00:57:29.019
has
never had a case of that.

00:57:29.019 --> 00:57:32.859
I had no idea that was in
my genes."

00:57:32.859 --> 00:57:38.000
And according to statistics, because all
this was really was just based on statistical

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:42.099
computations in the past in terms of saying,
"well,

00:57:42.099 --> 00:57:44.980
this many people have it, so therefore we
could

00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:48.300
suspect that this many people probably carry
it,"

00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:50.410
but we're finding out that those rates are
a bit

00:57:50.410 --> 00:57:51.410
higher now.

00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:52.410
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Okay?

00:57:52.410 --> 00:57:54.490
&gt;&gt;Dr. Colby: But we're also right at the beginning
of

00:57:54.490 --> 00:57:55.490
this.

00:57:55.490 --> 00:57:59.730
So we're just unlocking that door on the
number of people with rare diseases.

00:57:59.730 --> 00:58:02.119
And
identifying them and counseling them on ways

00:58:02.119 --> 00:58:06.119
to
avoid harming future generations.

00:58:06.119 --> 00:58:07.670
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Okay.

00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:08.710
Thank you.

00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:12.230
I guess the last
question then is you've probably sold a bunch

00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:14.610
of us
on getting our whole genome mapped.

00:58:14.610 --> 00:58:15.800
But what do we
do?

00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:17.210
I've talked to my geneticist.

00:58:17.210 --> 00:58:19.970
He says, "it's
going to probably cost you a couple thousand

00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:20.970
dollars.

00:58:20.970 --> 00:58:21.970
Insurance probably won't cover it.

00:58:21.970 --> 00:58:22.970
Do you
have any advice for us?"

00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:25.829
&gt;&gt;Dr. Colby: So there are two components.

00:58:25.829 --> 00:58:29.259
The question
was that you're interested in genetic testing.

00:58:29.259 --> 00:58:31.559
You
want to potentially get your whole genome

00:58:31.559 --> 00:58:33.400
sequenced.

00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:34.779
Where can you go for this?

00:58:34.779 --> 00:58:38.890
What's the advice
surrounding having this be actionable now.

00:58:38.890 --> 00:58:42.730
So in
terms of genome sequencing, that is still

00:58:42.730 --> 00:58:43.730
in the
thousands.

00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:46.809
So that's getting all 6 billion letters.

00:58:46.809 --> 00:58:49.130
Some individuals are doing that now.

00:58:49.130 --> 00:58:52.340
But it's still
really very much in the research realm.

00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:55.170
That
they're using it in research participants.

00:58:55.170 --> 00:58:57.630
For
people who are true techies that have the

00:58:57.630 --> 00:59:00.550
money,
yes they're able to get their whole genome

00:59:00.550 --> 00:59:01.550
now.

00:59:01.550 --> 00:59:04.279
The
issue is being able to analyze and use that

00:59:04.279 --> 00:59:07.240
information rather than just have it be cool
that

00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:09.140
you have your whole genome.

00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:13.170
So if you are
interested in that, then a lot of geneticists,

00:59:13.170 --> 00:59:19.519
doctors, they could go through a company like
Illumina down in San Diego which is an excellent

00:59:19.519 --> 00:59:23.750
company that provides sequencing and has done
it before

00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:27.069
for clinicians and actually detected some
rare

00:59:27.069 --> 00:59:29.359
diseases in children and saved their lives
with

00:59:29.359 --> 00:59:30.359
this technology.

00:59:30.359 --> 00:59:33.740
There are other companies, too, that
have gone public recently.

00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:38.030
Complete Genomics and
Biosciences have also provide that service.

00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:41.020
There's
Life Technologies also in San Diego -- provides

00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:43.250
Ion
Torrent service.

00:59:43.250 --> 00:59:44.990
So there are a lot of services out
there.

00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:49.310
Even GE is working on a technology and IBM
as well.

00:59:49.310 --> 00:59:54.160
So you Googlers need to get on the
sequencing, too.

00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:57.230
So the sequencing is a bit away
off.

00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:59.880
I see it as being two years off from when
it's

00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:04.859
really cost effective and useful on a clinical
level.

01:00:04.859 --> 01:00:08.079
But the DNA chip now is accessible to all
of

01:00:08.079 --> 01:00:09.079
you.

01:00:09.079 --> 01:00:13.570
So whether it's the Nexus DNA chip which we
make only available through a professional,

01:00:13.570 --> 01:00:17.230
whether
it's a fitness trainer or your doctor, or

01:00:17.230 --> 01:00:18.640
your
geneticist.

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:24.349
Any doctor around the world can could
you go and order this testing through us.

01:00:24.349 --> 01:00:26.890
Or it
could also be -- let's say you prefer to not

01:00:26.890 --> 01:00:29.019
go
through a professional -- you could go online

01:00:29.019 --> 01:00:31.650
to company
like a company called 23 and Me and you

01:00:31.650 --> 01:00:34.269
could order genetic testing as well.

01:00:34.269 --> 01:00:37.080
The difference
is you look at the reports, most of these

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:39.319
companies
have sample reports.

01:00:39.319 --> 01:00:43.809
You look at the types of
information, at the different types of diseases,

01:00:43.809 --> 01:00:46.190
because they don't test all for the same ones.

01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:48.789
And
you see what is most important to you.

01:00:48.789 --> 01:00:50.609
What you
want to get out of it.

01:00:50.609 --> 01:00:52.309
And then, you could decide
what is the best service?

01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:54.440
Do you really want a
professional involved?

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:58.789
If so, then that kind of narrows
it down to certain companies that provide

01:00:58.789 --> 01:01:00.109
that
service.

01:01:00.109 --> 01:01:03.809
Or do you only want to go over the
Internet and just get it personally?

01:01:03.809 --> 01:01:06.369
And that also
narrows it down to companies.

01:01:06.369 --> 01:01:07.599
Sure.

01:01:07.599 --> 01:01:11.390
&gt;&gt;Female #3: Thank you very much.

01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:12.390
&gt;&gt;Dr. Colby: Thank you.

01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:12.391
[Applause]
