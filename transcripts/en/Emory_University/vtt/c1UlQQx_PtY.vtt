they look a lot more like
the healthy controls.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.986 line:71%
A lot more activation in
the frontal part of the brain,

00:08:40.086 --> 00:08:42.855 line:71%

Because, you know, they put

00:09:11.617 --> 00:09:13.686 line:71%
they don't even realize what

00:13:41.353 --> 00:13:43.055 line:57%

responsible

00:13:43.155 --> 00:13:45.925 line:57%

be addicted to it,</i>

00:13:56.168 --> 00:13:58.404 line:71%
<i>versus using alcohol

00:13:58.504 --> 00:14:01.841 line:68%
<i> (Jaye)
 So, gaming is as addictive
 as other addictions?</i>

00:14:01.941 --> 00:14:03.742 line:71%
It can be.

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:05.244 line:64%
<i> (Jaye)
 As with other addictions,</i>

00:14:05.344 --> 00:14:08.013 line:64%
<i> Dr. Welsh says gamers
 develop a tolerance.</i>

00:14:08.113 --> 00:14:10.216 line:64%
<i> Meaning they need
 to play longer</i>

00:14:10.316 --> 00:14:12.551 line:64%
<i> to get the same
 dopamine reward.</i>

00:14:12.651 --> 00:14:15.120 line:71%
And we also sometimes see
a withdrawal syndrome,

00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:19.058 line:71%
where someone can become
anxious or irritable

00:14:19.158 --> 00:14:20.426 line:71%
when limits are set,

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:22.494 line:71%
or the games are
actually taken away.

00:14:22.595 --> 00:14:25.931 line:71%
And some of those symptoms
really closely mimic

00:14:26.031 --> 00:14:28.500 line:71%

substance use disorders.

00:14:28.601 --> 00:14:30.569 line:71%

00:15:18.784 --> 00:15:21.120 line:68%
<i> (Jaye)
 Is his frustration
 because he's addicted?</i>

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:25.057 line:71%

00:16:49.408 --> 00:16:50.943 line:64%

can be a symptom of
an underlying condition,

00:17:02.388 --> 00:17:04.456 line:71%
like depression,
or ADHD.

00:17:04.556 --> 00:17:05.858 line:71%
And that just
because a kid

00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:07.893 line:71%
spends hours
playing video games

00:17:07.993 --> 00:17:09.995 line:71%
doesn't mean
they're an addict.

00:17:10.095 --> 00:17:13.165 line:71%
That's why Gaming Disorder
can only be diagnosed

00:17:13.265 --> 00:17:15.267 line:71%

professional.

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:20.973 line:71%

00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:25.611 line:71%
<i> Well, research
 is showing us</i>

<i> that the reward centers

00:17:30.215 --> 00:17:31.683 line:71%

00:17:33.385 --> 00:17:34.653 line:71%

 underwent brain scans</i>

00:17:42.828 --> 00:17:45.264 line:71%
<i> while they were shown
 photos of various snacks.</i>

00:17:45.364 --> 00:17:46.832 line:71%

 choose the ones</i>

<i> that had both carbs
 and fat in them.</i>

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:51.804 line:71%
So what does it mean?

00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:55.407 line:71%
Well, it is giving us
insight into why we overeat,

00:17:55.507 --> 00:17:58.477 line:71%
and how our craving
for carbs and fat

00:17:58.577 --> 00:18:00.546 line:71%
are making us
overweight.

00:18:02.181 --> 00:18:04.917 line:71%
Our final story is
about expectations.

00:18:05.017 --> 00:18:08.587 line:68%
How they're lowered

devastating diagnosis,

00:18:08.687 --> 00:18:11.990 line:71%

completely different

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.063 line:68%
<i>(Dr. Weinberg)
Music and language

similar parts of the brain.</i>

that is done through

the-the lower parts

is it helps me forget
