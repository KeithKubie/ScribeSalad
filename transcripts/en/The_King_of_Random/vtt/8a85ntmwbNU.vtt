00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.250
For this project I’m going to show you how
to build a custom rocket launching blast pad.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.680
You’ll find these don’t cost much to make,
but they’re still impressively durable,

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.560
portable, and will launch a rocket, any angle
you point it.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.100
Let’s start this project with some common
sprinkler parts. These are 3/4” PVC fittings,

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.610
and you should be able to find them all, at
your nearest hardware store. We’ll also

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.500
need a 1/4 inch x 1-1/2 inch Fender Washer,
and some 1/4” x 1-1/2” hex head lag screws.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.880
In reality, you’ll only need one, but it’s
good to have a couple spares on hand, just

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.259
in case you want them.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.769
Now the body of our launch pad is made with
3/4” PVC tubing, and you’ll need 4 pieces,

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:41.230
that are 12” long. These other 15 pieces
are exactly 2 inches each, and I cut mine

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.170
from the leftover tubing, so they didn’t
cost anything extra.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.039
2” tubes work really well for prototyping
because, as you can see, they’ll join any

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.589
3/4” fittings together in an instant.

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:54.800
Ok, let’s go ahead and dry-fit all the pieces
together just to double check we have all

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.920
the pieces we need, at all the right measurements.
When everything’s assembled, the body of

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.559
your launchpad should look something like
this.

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.379
Gluing any pieces together is completely optional,
and in all honestly you don’t really need

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.280
too. But just because we can, I’m going
to use a little PVC glue to make a few parts

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.520
on mine, a little more permanent.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.520
I chose to glue the launchpad together in
5 separate segments, like you see here, because

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.540
this way it’ll easily come apart so we can
store it later, when it’s not being used.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.570
Now before we apply any glue, it’s really
important to make sure all the components

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.370
are flat and aligned properly, and the easiest
way to do that is by pressing them down on the table.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.120
When you’re confident you can keep them
straight, go ahead and glue the components

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.260
together in the usual way, by following the
directions on your can of PVC glue. And it’s

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.960
a really good idea to have some kind of paper,
or drop cloth covering your table, because

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.900
this chemical glue is nasty stuff and can
eat the finish right off your work surface within seconds.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.350
Give the connections about 5 minutes to cure,
then go ahead and fit the 5 segments back

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.970
together to see how they look. Hopefully you
got it right on the first try, because at

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.940
this point there’s no going back.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.050
Now check out what we can do at the top. Push
the head forward, then pull it all the way

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.590
back, and swivel it around 360 degrees. If
it does that, then congratulations, your swivel-head

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.860
is working, and you’re ready for a blast
pad.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.750
I went to a local thrift store and picked
up a variety of different pot lids and serving

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.680
plates for around $0.50 each, so I’m confident
you can find something similar for around a dollar, or less.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.819
Pot lids are an awesome choice, because when
the handle’s removed, you can see there’s

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.980
already a hole drilled exactly in the center.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.790
But for mine, I’m going with this serving
tray instead, because I like the contour and

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.010
look of it better. Especially when it’s
flipped upside down.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.110
Now the blast pad needs a hole drilled in
the center of the plate, so eyeball it as

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.200
best you can, then drill a hole 3/16” wide.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.290
We need to drill the same kind of hole through
the top of the PVC cross as well, right in

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.480
the center, because this is where were the
blast-pad is going to get connected.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.530
And before going any further, let’s just
make sure this plate is actually going to

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.440
work, by setting the blast-pad in position
and securing it to the PVC assembly with one

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.990
of the lag screws.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.650
The threads of the screw should bite tightly
into the PVC, sucking the plate down against

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.380
the plastic cross, snugly enough that it won’t
move.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.550
But, if for some reason you end up stripping
the screw holes, or you just want it even

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.220
more secure, you can still add another screw
on either side, by securing them into

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.270
the cross beam below.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.990
Now that we know the lid fits, it’s a really
good idea to add a 1-1/2 inch Fender Washer

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.270
to the center of the blast-pad, because it’s
made of steel, and will help dissipate the

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.120
heat. Most pot lids are made of aluminum,
and there’s a chance the blast from a rocket

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.459
motor will burn a hole right through it. But
a fender washer on the top will block the

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.069
heat, and solve the problem before it starts.

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.069
With the screw and washer in place, mark a
dot 1-1/2” from the center, and in line

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.370
with one of the arms of the PVC cross underneath.
This hole will be for the launch rod, and

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.300
before you drill it, take a good look at it
from the side, to make sure everything’s in-line and centered.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.630
You’ll need to go all the way through the
top, and just a tiny bit into the bottom.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.900
But be very careful you don’t go all the
way through.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.800
If you did it right, you’ll be able to push
a stick, or a rod through the hole, and position

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.250
it into the groove at the bottom, effectively
locking it in place.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.860
The rod I’m using is a 3/16” x 4’ steel
rod, found in the hardware isle, of the hardware store as well.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.520
Alright the time has come to customize our
launchpad with a paint job, and for that I’m

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.629
using black and yellow paint, to match the
Randomizer Rocket that I’ll show you how

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:01.520
to build in another project video.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.150
3 coats of paint, and 24 hours later, the
launchpad is looking pretty awesome. And at

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.790
this point our blast pad is completely finished,
and ready for use.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.590
Setting up is as simple as inserting the guide
rod, and dropping a rocket into position.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.790
Here you can see the nozzle of the rocket
lines up perfectly with the fender washer,

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.240
and if that ever gets damaged for some reason,
it’s super cheap and easy to replace.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.940
Aright to test it out, I took my system to
a launch site, and dropped one of my Randomizer

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.660
Rockets into position. You can see with this
design, the rocket easily cycles through a

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.220
multitude of different angles, and can rotate
a full 360 degrees as well. That’s awesome.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.889
The rail, will even drop down to a flight
angle of 0 degrees. And I’m not sure why

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.919
you’d ever need to use that feature. But
I’m just saying you could.

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.630
I loaded my Rocket, with an Estes E9-6 black
powder rocket motor, which you can see screws

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.100
in at the bottom. And even blasting off with
that much power, you’ll notice the launchpad didn’t even flinch.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.940
Your new launch-pad should be durable enough
to last indefinitely, and withstand a lifetime

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.160
of rocket launches. And when you’re not
out launching rockets, it’ll come apart

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.460
in seconds, for easy storage, or transportation.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.090
Well now you know how to transform thrift
shop pot lids, and PVC sprinkler parts, into

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.970
a custom rocket launching blast pad. That
doesn’t cost much to build, but will still

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.690
just as durable and effective as anything
you’d buy at twice the price.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.070
By the way, it’ll also be a nice compliment
your homemade Randomizer Rocket. So if you

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.020
want to make one of those, look for the project
video on how I built mine.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.040
Well that’s it for now. If you like this
project perhaps you’ll like some 
of my others.
