00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.430
Kim Vandiver: “So, how do you take a picture
of a bullet going through an apple.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:12.500
All high speed single shot pictures, have
one key ingredient, that has to happen and

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.500
that is the triggering.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.190
How do you know when to set off the flash.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.289
That's the trick in every high speed photograph.

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.740
The bullet is traveling along, it’s faster
than speed of sound, it has a shock wave that

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.170
goes like a V behind it.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.250
Down here out of the picture, is a microphone.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.300
When the shockwave hits the microphone, the
microphone trips the flash and you catch the

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:45.049
bullet at that position.

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:46.049
“

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:49.920
These photographs were taken by Harold Edgerton,
an inventor and electrical engineering professor

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.109
at MIT.

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:56.539
Doc, as he was known on campus, was looking
for a way to study the subtle dynamics of

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:57.539
air, fluids and engines.

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.649
Kim Vandiver: “Edgerton was studying large
electric motors. he used primitive strobe

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:08.020
devices to study the rotation...and he didn't
like what he had for equipment.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.130
So, he started inventing his own.”

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.130
“It takes less than a second to smash an
electric lightbulb with a hammer.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.490
The Edgerton camera shows what really happened
in less than a second.”

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:24.270
Kim Vandiver: “A synchronized stroboscope,
is something that repeats, and it repeats

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.310
at the same rate as the event that you're
watching.”

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.250
Edgerton demonstrated how his strobe works
in a short documentary film titled, Quick'n

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.250
a Wink.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.170
Kim Vandiver: “If you can imagine a fan
blade rotating around.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.170
If a flash goes off at exactly the same position
each time, to you it looks like it's stopped.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.890
And, if you slightly change the flash rate,
the propellor will look like it's very slowly

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.890
moving.”

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.500
Jim Bales: “Edgerton could control the flashes
in a way his predecessors couldn't.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.090
He could get brighter flashes that were lit
for a shorter period of time with more precise

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.500
timing on exactly when the strobe would go
off.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.530
That technical capability coupled with his
extraordinary photographer's eye allowed him

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.979
to take the photos that became the icons for
the world.”

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.799
Kim Vandiver: “Doc's pictures, many of them,
just had this startle factor to it, because

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:10.959
they just had never been possible before.”

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.850
Jim Bales: “When you look at that beautiful
crown, that splash of the drop of milk, it

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.650
turns out it's telling us fluid dynamics that
to this day we still don't understand.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.450
What seems to be happening is when the drop
hits, jets of liquid come squirting out in

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.939
the sides, but there's air resistance and
somehow that turns it up into the sheet.

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:34.060
And at that point you've exhausted my understanding
of fluid dynamics.”

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.709
With an electric current passing through a
tube filled with gas, Doc found new ways to

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.430
produce high intensity, short bursts of light
that could freeze time, and turn it into a

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.790
moment we could all witness.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.010
Kim Vandiver: “He set about to make flash
photography so popular, that the demand would

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.159
force an industry response to start making
it, and he obviously succeeded.

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:02.129
The way he did it was to equip the sports
photographer's with flash equipment.

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:09.760
He took a picture of boxer Joe Louis knocking
out his opponent, just at the instant of impact,

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.540
and nobody had ever seen it a picture like
that before.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.750
So, that's help put high speed photography,
and Doc Edgerton on the map.”

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.680
During World War II, Edgerton's techniques
caught the attention of the U.S. military,

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.659
who asked him to develop a giant strobe for
aerial reconnaissance missions.

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:32.069
After the War ended, the Atomic Energy Commission
wanted to leverage his techniques for another

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.249
special project: photographing nuclear weapon
tests.

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:42.939
Kim Vandiver: “What it takes to make a electronic
flash, turns out to require very much the

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:49.989
same kind of circuitry, as it takes to set
off a bomb.

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.769
Nuclear blasts put out a lot of radiation,
a lot of x-rays, and x-rays fog film.

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:01.090
So, that made it particularly difficult to
take a picture of a atomic bomb blast.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.319
They invented a magneto optic shutter.

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:10.750
It was basically a piece of quartz, with a
magnetic field, and a magnetic field on quartz

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.290
changes, what's called a polarization.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.190
So, you could change it very fast, so you
let the light through to take the picture,

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.510
and turn it back off again and stop the light
from coming in.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:28.160
And, each one of these still cameras had one
of those, and each one opened it at a slightly

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:35.100
different time, so with 200 cameras you could
get a movie of 200 pictures, and it was called

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.280
the Rapatronic camera.”

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.510
The magnetic field shutter was so fast that
it could capture critical details of how a

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.410
bomb's fireball evolved over time.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.940
It also revealed the mottling of the fireball,
which are those spots you see here inside

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.670
the explosion.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:56.440
The camera became a valuable diagnostic tool
scientists could use to understand exactly

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.440
what happens during an atomic bomb detonation.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.600
Edgerton helped scientists and engineers uncover
dynamics at the millisecond level, revealing

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.600
subtleties about the mechanics of nature &amp; physics
that were just hiding in plain sight.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:16.490
Jim Bales: “Edgerton to the best of my knowledge
always considered himself an engineer.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.830
Not an artist, not a photographer.”

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.050
Kim Vandiver: “He was a person who had a
good sense of humor.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.390
He liked people.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.710
He was very encouraging, so if you walked
in and said, I've always wanted to try building

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:35.460
this kind of a circuit, he'd say, well, there's
a soldering iron and a work bench, what are

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.460
you waiting for.”

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.520
Edgerton is considered the father of modern
high speed photography, and his legacy lives

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:47.220
on in everything from slow-motion videos we
see on YouTube to the advanced imaging techniques

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.610
we see in labs trying to capture details at
the cellular level.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.720
Jim Bales: “If you look at the high speed
world today, the technology is fundamentally

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.681
different from what Edgerton did.

00:05:57.681 --> 00:06:01.640
He worked with high speed film cameras where
the film would be coming behind the lens and

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.560
you'd use a strobe light to freeze the motion,
or other techniques with film.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:14.030
Today they have a high speed video camera
designed to capture megapixel images at thousands

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.110
or tens of thousands of frames a second.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:21.080
While that technology is new, beyond that
the techniques are really the same.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:28.401
There are strange and wonderful things happening
on time scales our eyes can't capture, and

00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:32.500
that it's possible to capture them and take
it apart and dissect the motion and learn

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.570
something new, helping people see things that
they hadn't seen before.”
