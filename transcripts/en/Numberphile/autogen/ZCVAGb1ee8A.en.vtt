I want to tell you about a

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589
I want to tell you about a
 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.740
I want to tell you about a
generalization of a problem that was

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750
generalization of a problem that was
 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.349
generalization of a problem that was
first popularized by Al Cohen of York

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359
first popularized by Al Cohen of York
 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.250
first popularized by Al Cohen of York
who was an anglo-saxon really smart dude

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260
who was an anglo-saxon really smart dude
 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.440
who was an anglo-saxon really smart dude
the problem is you have a farmer who

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450
the problem is you have a farmer who
 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.089
the problem is you have a farmer who
comes to your river and with him he has

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099
comes to your river and with him he has
 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.519
comes to your river and with him he has
a wolf a bundle of cabbages and a goat

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529
a wolf a bundle of cabbages and a goat
 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.099
a wolf a bundle of cabbages and a goat
and there's a boat that's there and it

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109
and there's a boat that's there and it
 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.950
and there's a boat that's there and it
carry it can carry him and one of his

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960
carry it can carry him and one of his
 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.349
carry it can carry him and one of his
charges obviously the farmer has to be

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359
charges obviously the farmer has to be
 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.599
charges obviously the farmer has to be
there because he has to be rowing and he

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609
there because he has to be rowing and he
 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.009
there because he has to be rowing and he
wants to bring everything to the other

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019
wants to bring everything to the other
 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.630
wants to bring everything to the other
shore safely so that means that he

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640
shore safely so that means that he
 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.420
shore safely so that means that he
cannot leave the cabbage with the goat

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430
cannot leave the cabbage with the goat
 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.280
cannot leave the cabbage with the goat
because the go to be eating the cabbage

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290
because the go to be eating the cabbage
 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.470
because the go to be eating the cabbage
and he cannot leave the wolf with the

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480
and he cannot leave the wolf with the
 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.630
and he cannot leave the wolf with the
goat because then the wolf would eat the

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640
goat because then the wolf would eat the
 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.610
goat because then the wolf would eat the
goat so how can he do it and so of

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620
goat so how can he do it and so of
 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.690
goat so how can he do it and so of
course we're assuming that the wolf

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700
course we're assuming that the wolf
 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.670
course we're assuming that the wolf
cannot ask for him which is a question I

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680
cannot ask for him which is a question I
 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.260
cannot ask for him which is a question I
get all the time when I'm speaking to

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270
get all the time when I'm speaking to
 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.690
get all the time when I'm speaking to
kids so the wolf cannot swim neither can

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700
kids so the wolf cannot swim neither can
 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.670
kids so the wolf cannot swim neither can
a goat or the cabbage so the only thing

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680
a goat or the cabbage so the only thing
 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.240
a goat or the cabbage so the only thing
you can do it first is to bring the goat

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250
you can do it first is to bring the goat
 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.880
you can do it first is to bring the goat
okay so then okay the firmer goes back

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890
okay so then okay the firmer goes back
 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.410
okay so then okay the firmer goes back
and he takes let's say the wolf but now

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420
and he takes let's say the wolf but now
 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.450
and he takes let's say the wolf but now
he cannot leave the wolf with the cat

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460
he cannot leave the wolf with the cat
 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.950
he cannot leave the wolf with the cat
that with the goat otherwise the wolf

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960
that with the goat otherwise the wolf
 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.920
that with the goat otherwise the wolf
would eat the goat back so what if he

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930
would eat the goat back so what if he
 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.200
would eat the goat back so what if he
brown the cabbage instead well same

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210
brown the cabbage instead well same
 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.230
brown the cabbage instead well same
thing if he brings the cabbage now the

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240
thing if he brings the cabbage now the
 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.300
thing if he brings the cabbage now the
goat would eat the cabbage so the only

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310
goat would eat the cabbage so the only
 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.340
goat would eat the cabbage so the only
way to scan be done yes you have to have

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350
way to scan be done yes you have to have
 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.520
way to scan be done yes you have to have
this clever moment of saying oh I can

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530
this clever moment of saying oh I can
 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.340
this clever moment of saying oh I can
bring back the goat so okay he brown the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350
bring back the goat so okay he brown the
 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.620
bring back the goat so okay he brown the
cabbage over and now he brings back the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630
cabbage over and now he brings back the
 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.020
cabbage over and now he brings back the
goat and now takes the wolf brings it to

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030
goat and now takes the wolf brings it to
 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.819
goat and now takes the wolf brings it to
the other side as well and now he goes

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829
the other side as well and now he goes
 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.510
the other side as well and now he goes
back just to get his goat so then you

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520
back just to get his goat so then you
 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.160
back just to get his goat so then you
can generalize you can say well let's

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170
can generalize you can say well let's
 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.260
can generalize you can say well let's
say that this farmer had more things

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270
say that this farmer had more things
 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.700
say that this farmer had more things
that he wanted to carry across the river

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710
that he wanted to carry across the river
 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.870
that he wanted to carry across the river
so let's say that I added a rabbit so

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880
so let's say that I added a rabbit so
 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.850
so let's say that I added a rabbit so
what can I do first what does a rabbit

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860
what can I do first what does a rabbit
 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.300
what can I do first what does a rabbit
day with what oh yeah good question

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310
day with what oh yeah good question
 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.730
day with what oh yeah good question
right so the wolf would eat the rabbit

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740
right so the wolf would eat the rabbit
 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.190
right so the wolf would eat the rabbit
and well the rabbit would eat the

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200
and well the rabbit would eat the
 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.100
and well the rabbit would eat the
cabbage we assume that the rabbit and a

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110
cabbage we assume that the rabbit and a
 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.289
cabbage we assume that the rabbit and a
goat together or fine there won't be too

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299
goat together or fine there won't be too
 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.999
goat together or fine there won't be too
much violence there the boat can hold

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009
much violence there the boat can hold
 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.459
much violence there the boat can hold
the farmer and one of these guys that's

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469
the farmer and one of these guys that's
 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.929
the farmer and one of these guys that's
it the farmer still has to be there

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939
it the farmer still has to be there
 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.370
it the farmer still has to be there
we're still assuming also that the revit

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380
we're still assuming also that the revit
 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.819
we're still assuming also that the revit
cannot swim so what can I bring first

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829
cannot swim so what can I bring first
 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.580
cannot swim so what can I bring first
can I bring the wolf well no obviously

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590
can I bring the wolf well no obviously
 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.440
can I bring the wolf well no obviously
the rabbit and a go to the eat the

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450
the rabbit and a go to the eat the
 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.760
the rabbit and a go to the eat the
cabbage

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770
cabbage
 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.820
cabbage
can I bring the rabbit wellnot again to

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830
can I bring the rabbit wellnot again to
 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.620
can I bring the rabbit wellnot again to
go to the eating the cabbage if the wolf

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630
go to the eating the cabbage if the wolf
 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.010
go to the eating the cabbage if the wolf
doesn't catch the gold first okay can I

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020
doesn't catch the gold first okay can I
 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.740
doesn't catch the gold first okay can I
bring the goat well no the rabbit will

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750
bring the goat well no the rabbit will
 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.060
bring the goat well no the rabbit will
eat the cabbage again if the wolf

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070
eat the cabbage again if the wolf
 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.000
eat the cabbage again if the wolf
doesn't catch the rabbit first and can I

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010
doesn't catch the rabbit first and can I
 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.910
doesn't catch the rabbit first and can I
bring the cabbage no because the wolf

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920
bring the cabbage no because the wolf
 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.970
bring the cabbage no because the wolf
would eat the rabbit in the goat carnage

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980
would eat the rabbit in the goat carnage
 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.470
would eat the rabbit in the goat carnage
carnage yes blood everywhere no matter

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480
carnage yes blood everywhere no matter
 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.200
carnage yes blood everywhere no matter
what we do or shreds of cabbage one or

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210
what we do or shreds of cabbage one or
 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.660
what we do or shreds of cabbage one or
the other so the question becomes okay

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670
the other so the question becomes okay
 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.970
the other so the question becomes okay
how big of a boat do I need so if I'm

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980
how big of a boat do I need so if I'm
 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.680
how big of a boat do I need so if I'm
given different things and I know

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690
given different things and I know
 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.870
given different things and I know
there's certain conflicts how big does

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880
there's certain conflicts how big does
 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.300
there's certain conflicts how big does
my boat have to be so here if I have

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310
my boat have to be so here if I have
 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.490
my boat have to be so here if I have
space for my farmer plus two other

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500
space for my farmer plus two other
 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.990
space for my farmer plus two other
things I'll be fine

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000
things I'll be fine
 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.580
things I'll be fine
I could just say fine I'll bring the

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590
I could just say fine I'll bring the
 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.410
I could just say fine I'll bring the
wolf and cabbage first I'll leave them

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420
wolf and cabbage first I'll leave them
 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.420
wolf and cabbage first I'll leave them
on the other side come back and get my

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430
on the other side come back and get my
 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.810
on the other side come back and get my
rabbit and goat super easy so the

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820
rabbit and goat super easy so the
 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.280
rabbit and goat super easy so the
question is how big does it have to be

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290
question is how big does it have to be
 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.840
question is how big does it have to be
well now we kind of want to start doing

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850
well now we kind of want to start doing
 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.660
well now we kind of want to start doing
math right so how do we bring math in

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670
math right so how do we bring math in
 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.150
math right so how do we bring math in
there so we want to think about the

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160
there so we want to think about the
 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.260
there so we want to think about the
conflicts as making a graph so I have my

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270
conflicts as making a graph so I have my
 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.380
conflicts as making a graph so I have my
wolf and I have my goat and so I cannot

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390
wolf and I have my goat and so I cannot
 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.870
wolf and I have my goat and so I cannot
leave my wolf with my goat so I'll put

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880
leave my wolf with my goat so I'll put
 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.960
leave my wolf with my goat so I'll put
an ad the line between these two points

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970
an ad the line between these two points
 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.670
an ad the line between these two points
which are really normally called

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680
which are really normally called
 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.560
which are really normally called
vertices yeah conflict that these two

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570
vertices yeah conflict that these two
 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.830
vertices yeah conflict that these two
things cannot be left alone unsupervised

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840
things cannot be left alone unsupervised
 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.070
things cannot be left alone unsupervised
the wolf can also not be left with the

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080
the wolf can also not be left with the
 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.620
the wolf can also not be left with the
rabbit the goat cannot be left with the

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630
rabbit the goat cannot be left with the
 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.310
rabbit the goat cannot be left with the
cabbage and the rabbit cannot be left

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320
cabbage and the rabbit cannot be left
 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.590
cabbage and the rabbit cannot be left
with the cabbage either but the wolf can

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600
with the cabbage either but the wolf can
 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.910
with the cabbage either but the wolf can
be left with a cabbage so I don't draw

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920
be left with a cabbage so I don't draw
 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.340
be left with a cabbage so I don't draw
an edge there and I don't draw an edge

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350
an edge there and I don't draw an edge
 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.830
an edge there and I don't draw an edge
between my goat in my rabbit because it

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840
between my goat in my rabbit because it
 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.650
between my goat in my rabbit because it
can be left together okay the point that

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660
can be left together okay the point that
 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.960
can be left together okay the point that
we see is that let's say that I first

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970
we see is that let's say that I first
 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.990
we see is that let's say that I first
took my rabbit well there's still some

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000
took my rabbit well there's still some
 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.449
took my rabbit well there's still some
lines remaining right I am left with a

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459
lines remaining right I am left with a
 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.550
lines remaining right I am left with a
graph with the wolf goat and cabbage and

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560
graph with the wolf goat and cabbage and
 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.420
graph with the wolf goat and cabbage and
there's still some lines that are

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430
there's still some lines that are
 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.130
there's still some lines that are
remaining and that's tree firing remove

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140
remaining and that's tree firing remove
 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.490
remaining and that's tree firing remove
any of the corners so what I want to do

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500
any of the corners so what I want to do
 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.330
any of the corners so what I want to do
is take a set of my things that will

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340
is take a set of my things that will
 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.310
is take a set of my things that will
remove all of the lines and that's

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320
remove all of the lines and that's
 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.960
remove all of the lines and that's
actually a really important math concept

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970
actually a really important math concept
 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.229
actually a really important math concept
it's called a vertex cover so maybe

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239
it's called a vertex cover so maybe
 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.060
it's called a vertex cover so maybe
let's write down what is the vertex

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070
let's write down what is the vertex
 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.170
let's write down what is the vertex
cover a vertex cover and a graph

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180
cover a vertex cover and a graph
 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.189
cover a vertex cover and a graph
is a set of vertices such that any edge

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199
is a set of vertices such that any edge
 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:36.980
is a set of vertices such that any edge
is adjacent to at least one of these

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990
is adjacent to at least one of these
 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.270
is adjacent to at least one of these
services okay

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280
services okay
 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.189
services okay
so what does that mean that means that

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199
so what does that mean that means that
 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:43.279
so what does that mean that means that
if I want to take a set of points where

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289
if I want to take a set of points where
 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.290
if I want to take a set of points where
every line is touching at least one of

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300
every line is touching at least one of
 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.850
every line is touching at least one of
these points my goal is that by taking

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860
these points my goal is that by taking
 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.129
these points my goal is that by taking
the vertex cover I'm removing all the

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139
the vertex cover I'm removing all the
 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.710
the vertex cover I'm removing all the
lines so maybe we can just draw a simple

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720
lines so maybe we can just draw a simple
 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.279
lines so maybe we can just draw a simple
example so let's say that I have this

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289
example so let's say that I have this
 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.020
example so let's say that I have this
graph so this is a graph so a graph is

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030
graph so this is a graph so a graph is
 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.060
graph so this is a graph so a graph is
really just a set of points and set of

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070
really just a set of points and set of
 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.490
really just a set of points and set of
lines called vertices and edges and so I

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500
lines called vertices and edges and so I
 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.409
lines called vertices and edges and so I
might ask myself what is a vertex cover

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419
might ask myself what is a vertex cover
 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.570
might ask myself what is a vertex cover
so I could start building one so I could

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580
so I could start building one so I could
 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.529
so I could start building one so I could
say okay I'll take this vertex within my

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539
say okay I'll take this vertex within my
 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:11.689
say okay I'll take this vertex within my
vertex cover but that's not enough right

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699
vertex cover but that's not enough right
 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.330
vertex cover but that's not enough right
so these five edges now are covered by

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340
so these five edges now are covered by
 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.710
so these five edges now are covered by
this vertex right they're touching this

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720
this vertex right they're touching this
 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.980
this vertex right they're touching this
vertex but the other ones aren't yet now

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990
vertex but the other ones aren't yet now
 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.260
vertex but the other ones aren't yet now
so I could ask I could add this vertex

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270
so I could ask I could add this vertex
 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.450
so I could ask I could add this vertex
to my vertex cover and so I'm getting

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460
to my vertex cover and so I'm getting
 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.490
to my vertex cover and so I'm getting
closer but I still have this line that

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500
closer but I still have this line that
 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.830
closer but I still have this line that
is not covered yet so I could add this

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840
is not covered yet so I could add this
 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.529
is not covered yet so I could add this
one now and so these three vertices from

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539
one now and so these three vertices from
 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:35.689
one now and so these three vertices from
a vertex cover every single line is

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699
a vertex cover every single line is
 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:38.270
a vertex cover every single line is
adjacent to one of these vertices it's

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280
adjacent to one of these vertices it's
 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.070
adjacent to one of these vertices it's
almost like how many hands did you need

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080
almost like how many hands did you need
 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.469
almost like how many hands did you need
to cover the right number of spots yeah

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479
to cover the right number of spots yeah
 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:45.290
to cover the right number of spots yeah
exactly exactly so here in a vertex

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300
exactly exactly so here in a vertex
 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.860
exactly exactly so here in a vertex
cover what was it well yeah one is not

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870
cover what was it well yeah one is not
 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.339
cover what was it well yeah one is not
sufficient right a single vertex is not

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:52.349
sufficient right a single vertex is not
 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:54.500
sufficient right a single vertex is not
a vertex cover if I cover the rabbit and

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510
a vertex cover if I cover the rabbit and
 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.110
a vertex cover if I cover the rabbit and
the goat then they're covering all of

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120
the goat then they're covering all of
 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.379
the goat then they're covering all of
the edges there's no edges remaining so

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:00.389
the edges there's no edges remaining so
 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:02.360
the edges there's no edges remaining so
this forms a vertex cover so that's why

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370
this forms a vertex cover so that's why
 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.909
this forms a vertex cover so that's why
I need to have at least two seats

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919
I need to have at least two seats
 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:06.589
I need to have at least two seats
because the minimum size of a vertex

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599
because the minimum size of a vertex
 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:09.350
because the minimum size of a vertex
cover in there is 2 so there's no way

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360
cover in there is 2 so there's no way
 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.210
cover in there is 2 so there's no way
that I can do it if I don't have at

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220
that I can do it if I don't have at
 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.310
that I can do it if I don't have at
least two extra places besides the place

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320
least two extra places besides the place
 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.390
least two extra places besides the place
for the form

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400
for the form
 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.749
for the form
so in general I know that my boat has to

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759
so in general I know that my boat has to
 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:20.149
so in general I know that my boat has to
have at least the minimum size of a

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:20.159
have at least the minimum size of a
 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:23.060
have at least the minimum size of a
vertex cover right otherwise I won't be

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070
vertex cover right otherwise I won't be
 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.680
vertex cover right otherwise I won't be
able to make my first trip because there

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690
able to make my first trip because there
 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.270
able to make my first trip because there
will be some lines remaining in my graph

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280
will be some lines remaining in my graph
 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.120
will be some lines remaining in my graph
and lines represent conflict I imagine

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.130
and lines represent conflict I imagine
 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.860
and lines represent conflict I imagine
you could do overkill though there must

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870
you could do overkill though there must
 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.810
you could do overkill though there must
be as these things get more complicated

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820
be as these things get more complicated
 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.019
be as these things get more complicated
there must be vertex covers that cover

00:06:36.019 --> 00:06:36.029
there must be vertex covers that cover
 

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:38.209
there must be vertex covers that cover
too many vertices oh yeah that's a

00:06:38.209 --> 00:06:38.219
too many vertices oh yeah that's a
 

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:39.920
too many vertices oh yeah that's a
really good point right so in this graph

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930
really good point right so in this graph
 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.110
really good point right so in this graph
for example

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120
for example
 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.650
for example
so if I add this vertex this is still a

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660
so if I add this vertex this is still a
 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.350
so if I add this vertex this is still a
vertex cover right so I really want the

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360
vertex cover right so I really want the
 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.670
vertex cover right so I really want the
minimum one so I want to say that the

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680
minimum one so I want to say that the
 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.450
minimum one so I want to say that the
number of extra places needed in my boat

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:56.460
number of extra places needed in my boat
 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:02.300
number of extra places needed in my boat
is at least the size of the minimum

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:02.310
is at least the size of the minimum
 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.850
is at least the size of the minimum
vertex cover so in this graph here that

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860
vertex cover so in this graph here that
 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.950
vertex cover so in this graph here that
was three I needed to have at least

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960
was three I needed to have at least
 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.700
was three I needed to have at least
three because that small yeah you don't

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:10.710
three because that small yeah you don't
 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:12.860
three because that small yeah you don't
want to overkill as you said so that's

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:12.870
want to overkill as you said so that's
 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.560
want to overkill as you said so that's
nice but now you might ask yourself will

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:15.570
nice but now you might ask yourself will
 

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.810
nice but now you might ask yourself will
that always be enough right

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:17.820
that always be enough right
 

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.180
that always be enough right
like sure you can do the first trip

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:20.190
like sure you can do the first trip
 

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.340
like sure you can do the first trip
across the river but will you be able to

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:22.350
across the river but will you be able to
 

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.800
across the river but will you be able to
do all of them and so now you could

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:24.810
do all of them and so now you could
 

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.380
do all of them and so now you could
check with some examples so I mean we

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:27.390
check with some examples so I mean we
 

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:29.420
check with some examples so I mean we
could try with a big example and see if

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:29.430
could try with a big example and see if
 

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.840
could try with a big example and see if
it works out and then try with some

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:32.850
it works out and then try with some
 

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:34.790
it works out and then try with some
other examples does that sound good okay

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:34.800
other examples does that sound good okay
 

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.890
other examples does that sound good okay
so maybe we need another piece of paper

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:36.900
so maybe we need another piece of paper
 

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.140
so maybe we need another piece of paper
okay so now we have way more things and

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:39.150
okay so now we have way more things and
 

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.600
okay so now we have way more things and
so now we need to think for a second

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:41.610
so now we need to think for a second
 

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.660
so now we need to think for a second
what is actually going to eat what and

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:44.670
what is actually going to eat what and
 

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:47.180
what is actually going to eat what and
we might disagree on some of these I am

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:47.190
we might disagree on some of these I am
 

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.300
we might disagree on some of these I am
NOT a farm girl so I would go with what

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:50.310
NOT a farm girl so I would go with what
 

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:53.380
NOT a farm girl so I would go with what
I think the wolf would eat the goose

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:53.390
I think the wolf would eat the goose
 

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.370
I think the wolf would eat the goose
potentially the mouse if it's really

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:55.380
potentially the mouse if it's really
 

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.400
potentially the mouse if it's really
hungry told eat grass it's one ain't a

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:58.410
hungry told eat grass it's one ain't a
 

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.560
hungry told eat grass it's one ain't a
cat either I don't think so carrot or

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:00.570
cat either I don't think so carrot or
 

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:02.000
cat either I don't think so carrot or
cabbage it's not a vegetarian it's a

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:02.010
cabbage it's not a vegetarian it's a
 

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:05.690
cabbage it's not a vegetarian it's a
carnivore so set a goat and the rabbit

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:05.700
carnivore so set a goat and the rabbit
 

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:10.010
carnivore so set a goat and the rabbit
and the goose will eat the grass I see

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:10.020
and the goose will eat the grass I see
 

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.920
and the goose will eat the grass I see
geese eating grass all the time I don't

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:12.930
geese eating grass all the time I don't
 

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.740
geese eating grass all the time I don't
think it's gonna eat carrot or cabbage

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:15.750
think it's gonna eat carrot or cabbage
 

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.840
think it's gonna eat carrot or cabbage
because it doesn't really have does it

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:17.850
because it doesn't really have does it
 

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.720
because it doesn't really have does it
have teeth does I don't think I mean

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:20.730
have teeth does I don't think I mean
 

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.460
have teeth does I don't think I mean
certainly if it's not cut up you know

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:22.470
certainly if it's not cut up you know
 

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:23.780
certainly if it's not cut up you know
like it will have trouble it doesn't

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:23.790
like it will have trouble it doesn't
 

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.480
like it will have trouble it doesn't
have hands - maybe this does not the

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:26.490
have hands - maybe this does not the
 

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:28.040
have hands - maybe this does not the
taste of cabbage fine

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:28.050
taste of cabbage fine
 

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:32.620
taste of cabbage fine
I think the mouse will eat carrot and

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:32.630
I think the mouse will eat carrot and
 

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:37.070
I think the mouse will eat carrot and
cabbage and the cat will eat the mouse

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:37.080
cabbage and the cat will eat the mouse
 

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.770
cabbage and the cat will eat the mouse
certainly the grass will probably be

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:39.780
certainly the grass will probably be
 

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.870
certainly the grass will probably be
eaten by the goat I know that you can

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:41.880
eaten by the goat I know that you can
 

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.660
eaten by the goat I know that you can
use them as long Moore's the rabbit

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:44.670
use them as long Moore's the rabbit
 

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.930
use them as long Moore's the rabbit
might eat some grass

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:46.940
might eat some grass
 

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.310
might eat some grass
cat I think it will just eat the mouse

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:49.320
cat I think it will just eat the mouse
 

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.110
cat I think it will just eat the mouse
and nothing else will eat it the rabbits

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.120
and nothing else will eat it the rabbits
 

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:51.790
and nothing else will eat it the rabbits
gonna

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:51.800
gonna
 

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.729
gonna
yes so the cabbage yeah that's true so

00:08:54.729 --> 00:08:54.739
yes so the cabbage yeah that's true so
 

00:08:54.739 --> 00:08:56.619
yes so the cabbage yeah that's true so
the rabbit will eat the carrot and the

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:56.629
the rabbit will eat the carrot and the
 

00:08:56.629 --> 00:08:58.119
the rabbit will eat the carrot and the
goat will probably eat the carrot too

00:08:58.119 --> 00:08:58.129
goat will probably eat the carrot too
 

00:08:58.129 --> 00:09:02.439
goat will probably eat the carrot too
and the rabbit will also eat the cabbage

00:09:02.439 --> 00:09:02.449
and the rabbit will also eat the cabbage
 

00:09:02.449 --> 00:09:06.519
and the rabbit will also eat the cabbage
and so will the goat and then the goat

00:09:06.519 --> 00:09:06.529
and so will the goat and then the goat
 

00:09:06.529 --> 00:09:07.840
and so will the goat and then the goat
and a rabbit are fine I think that's

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:07.850
and a rabbit are fine I think that's
 

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:11.590
and a rabbit are fine I think that's
that looks reasonable to me do you agree

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600
that looks reasonable to me do you agree
 

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.220
that looks reasonable to me do you agree
okay so let's say that I have a river

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:14.230
okay so let's say that I have a river
 

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:17.049
okay so let's say that I have a river
how big it boat we need and will the

00:09:17.049 --> 00:09:17.059
how big it boat we need and will the
 

00:09:17.059 --> 00:09:18.850
how big it boat we need and will the
minimum vertex cover be enough the first

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:18.860
minimum vertex cover be enough the first
 

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:19.900
minimum vertex cover be enough the first
point I really want to make is that

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:19.910
point I really want to make is that
 

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:21.970
point I really want to make is that
finding the minimum vertex cover is not

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:21.980
finding the minimum vertex cover is not
 

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:26.019
finding the minimum vertex cover is not
easy right so here we only have nine

00:09:26.019 --> 00:09:26.029
easy right so here we only have nine
 

00:09:26.029 --> 00:09:28.600
easy right so here we only have nine
things right it's not that much and to

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:28.610
things right it's not that much and to
 

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:31.689
things right it's not that much and to
figure out what it is well since this

00:09:31.689 --> 00:09:31.699
figure out what it is well since this
 

00:09:31.699 --> 00:09:33.249
figure out what it is well since this
graph has some meaning I'm going to use

00:09:33.249 --> 00:09:33.259
graph has some meaning I'm going to use
 

00:09:33.259 --> 00:09:35.470
graph has some meaning I'm going to use
the meaning to help me so I basically

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:35.480
the meaning to help me so I basically
 

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.199
the meaning to help me so I basically
have like my carnivores my herbivores

00:09:38.199 --> 00:09:38.209
have like my carnivores my herbivores
 

00:09:38.209 --> 00:09:40.929
have like my carnivores my herbivores
and then I have the poor vegetables and

00:09:40.929 --> 00:09:40.939
and then I have the poor vegetables and
 

00:09:40.939 --> 00:09:44.379
and then I have the poor vegetables and
herbs and so these three categories kind

00:09:44.379 --> 00:09:44.389
herbs and so these three categories kind
 

00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:47.489
herbs and so these three categories kind
of help me determine that oh maybe the

00:09:47.489 --> 00:09:47.499
of help me determine that oh maybe the
 

00:09:47.499 --> 00:09:53.259
of help me determine that oh maybe the
goat rabbit goose and mouse so my

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:53.269
goat rabbit goose and mouse so my
 

00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:55.660
goat rabbit goose and mouse so my
herbivores might form a vertex cover and

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:55.670
herbivores might form a vertex cover and
 

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:59.439
herbivores might form a vertex cover and
I think if I look at it carefully like

00:09:59.439 --> 00:09:59.449
I think if I look at it carefully like
 

00:09:59.449 --> 00:10:01.499
I think if I look at it carefully like
if I were to really look at every single

00:10:01.499 --> 00:10:01.509
if I were to really look at every single
 

00:10:01.509 --> 00:10:05.139
if I were to really look at every single
line so actually yes the mouse the goose

00:10:05.139 --> 00:10:05.149
line so actually yes the mouse the goose
 

00:10:05.149 --> 00:10:06.759
line so actually yes the mouse the goose
the rabbit and a goat do form a vertex

00:10:06.759 --> 00:10:06.769
the rabbit and a goat do form a vertex
 

00:10:06.769 --> 00:10:08.980
the rabbit and a goat do form a vertex
cover it's unclear if that is actually

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:08.990
cover it's unclear if that is actually
 

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.769
cover it's unclear if that is actually
the smallest I claim it is it's not an

00:10:11.769 --> 00:10:11.779
the smallest I claim it is it's not an
 

00:10:11.779 --> 00:10:13.840
the smallest I claim it is it's not an
actually such an easy thing to check so

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:13.850
actually such an easy thing to check so
 

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:17.410
actually such an easy thing to check so
let's just assume that I'm right so what

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:17.420
let's just assume that I'm right so what
 

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.210
let's just assume that I'm right so what
I'll do is I'll say okay for my first

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:19.220
I'll do is I'll say okay for my first
 

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:22.410
I'll do is I'll say okay for my first
trip I will take my minimum vertex cover

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:22.420
trip I will take my minimum vertex cover
 

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:26.499
trip I will take my minimum vertex cover
right so if I remove my goat rabbit

00:10:26.499 --> 00:10:26.509
right so if I remove my goat rabbit
 

00:10:26.509 --> 00:10:29.559
right so if I remove my goat rabbit
boots and mouse and bring them to the

00:10:29.559 --> 00:10:29.569
boots and mouse and bring them to the
 

00:10:29.569 --> 00:10:32.410
boots and mouse and bring them to the
other side I am left I removed all of

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:32.420
other side I am left I removed all of
 

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:35.970
other side I am left I removed all of
the lines here and so okay that's fine

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:35.980
the lines here and so okay that's fine
 

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.710
the lines here and so okay that's fine
so then my farmer will come back we can

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:38.720
so then my farmer will come back we can
 

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.210
so then my farmer will come back we can
only take four things it will leave a

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:40.220
only take four things it will leave a
 

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.859
only take four things it will leave a
thing behind us say it leaves the cat

00:10:41.859 --> 00:10:41.869
thing behind us say it leaves the cat
 

00:10:41.869 --> 00:10:46.900
thing behind us say it leaves the cat
behind and so he brings these guys but

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:46.910
behind and so he brings these guys but
 

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.479
behind and so he brings these guys but
certainly the wolf will attack these

00:10:49.479 --> 00:10:49.489
certainly the wolf will attack these
 

00:10:49.489 --> 00:10:51.879
certainly the wolf will attack these
guys and these guys will eat all of the

00:10:51.879 --> 00:10:51.889
guys and these guys will eat all of the
 

00:10:51.889 --> 00:10:55.299
guys and these guys will eat all of the
vegetables and grass so I'll bring them

00:10:55.299 --> 00:10:55.309
vegetables and grass so I'll bring them
 

00:10:55.309 --> 00:10:56.769
vegetables and grass so I'll bring them
back so it's the same trick as we've

00:10:56.769 --> 00:10:56.779
back so it's the same trick as we've
 

00:10:56.779 --> 00:10:59.499
back so it's the same trick as we've
seen before I'll carry my cat over so

00:10:59.499 --> 00:10:59.509
seen before I'll carry my cat over so
 

00:10:59.509 --> 00:11:01.449
seen before I'll carry my cat over so
that it doesn't eat my mouse just itself

00:11:01.449 --> 00:11:01.459
that it doesn't eat my mouse just itself
 

00:11:01.459 --> 00:11:03.489
that it doesn't eat my mouse just itself
right it's just four places but you can

00:11:03.489 --> 00:11:03.499
right it's just four places but you can
 

00:11:03.499 --> 00:11:05.139
right it's just four places but you can
just bring one thing that's completely

00:11:05.139 --> 00:11:05.149
just bring one thing that's completely
 

00:11:05.149 --> 00:11:05.870
just bring one thing that's completely
fine

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:05.880
fine
 

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.990
fine
and then I will finally go back so

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.000
and then I will finally go back so
 

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.370
and then I will finally go back so
there's no conflict here all right this

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:10.380
there's no conflict here all right this
 

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.800
there's no conflict here all right this
was the original things that I had left

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:12.810
was the original things that I had left
 

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:14.629
was the original things that I had left
at first so no problem there and then

00:11:14.629 --> 00:11:14.639
at first so no problem there and then
 

00:11:14.639 --> 00:11:19.100
at first so no problem there and then
I'll bring my four leftover herbivores

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:19.110
I'll bring my four leftover herbivores
 

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:21.079
I'll bring my four leftover herbivores
and leave them there when I'm done

00:11:21.079 --> 00:11:21.089
and leave them there when I'm done
 

00:11:21.089 --> 00:11:23.960
and leave them there when I'm done
so I succeeded in this case right but

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:23.970
so I succeeded in this case right but
 

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:26.269
so I succeeded in this case right but
that's not a proof right maybe maybe I

00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:26.279
that's not a proof right maybe maybe I
 

00:11:26.279 --> 00:11:28.040
that's not a proof right maybe maybe I
wouldn't need more and certainly we've

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:28.050
wouldn't need more and certainly we've
 

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:29.930
wouldn't need more and certainly we've
just seen okay finding your minimum

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:29.940
just seen okay finding your minimum
 

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.889
just seen okay finding your minimum
vertex cover is not necessarily so easy

00:11:32.889 --> 00:11:32.899
vertex cover is not necessarily so easy
 

00:11:32.899 --> 00:11:36.620
vertex cover is not necessarily so easy
so maybe let's do one other example so

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:36.630
so maybe let's do one other example so
 

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:44.499
so maybe let's do one other example so
let's say that I had just my wolf and my

00:11:44.499 --> 00:11:44.509
let's say that I had just my wolf and my
 

00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:48.290
let's say that I had just my wolf and my
four herbivores that would get eaten by

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:48.300
four herbivores that would get eaten by
 

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.269
four herbivores that would get eaten by
my wolf if he has a chance

00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:50.279
my wolf if he has a chance
 

00:11:50.279 --> 00:11:53.259
my wolf if he has a chance
so my wolf would eat all of these and

00:11:53.259 --> 00:11:53.269
so my wolf would eat all of these and
 

00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:55.400
so my wolf would eat all of these and
none of these would attack each other

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:55.410
none of these would attack each other
 

00:11:55.410 --> 00:12:00.650
none of these would attack each other
right so I have my river so I know that

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:00.660
right so I have my river so I know that
 

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.050
right so I have my river so I know that
I need to have at least the number of

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:03.060
I need to have at least the number of
 

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.699
I need to have at least the number of
extra places should be at least the size

00:12:04.699 --> 00:12:04.709
extra places should be at least the size
 

00:12:04.709 --> 00:12:07.100
extra places should be at least the size
of my minimum vertex cover which here is

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:07.110
of my minimum vertex cover which here is
 

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:09.259
of my minimum vertex cover which here is
easy to calculate what is it Brady do

00:12:09.259 --> 00:12:09.269
easy to calculate what is it Brady do
 

00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:12.800
easy to calculate what is it Brady do
you know it's one it's one I'm very

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:12.810
you know it's one it's one I'm very
 

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:13.280
you know it's one it's one I'm very
impressed

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:13.290
impressed
 

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:16.429
impressed
okay so my wolf is my minimum vertex

00:12:16.429 --> 00:12:16.439
okay so my wolf is my minimum vertex
 

00:12:16.439 --> 00:12:18.379
okay so my wolf is my minimum vertex
cover so I need to bring my well first

00:12:18.379 --> 00:12:18.389
cover so I need to bring my well first
 

00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:20.120
cover so I need to bring my well first
right that's the only thing I can do if

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:20.130
right that's the only thing I can do if
 

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.679
right that's the only thing I can do if
I bring anything else I'll be left with

00:12:21.679 --> 00:12:21.689
I bring anything else I'll be left with
 

00:12:21.689 --> 00:12:24.069
I bring anything else I'll be left with
some conflict so I bring my wolf over I

00:12:24.069 --> 00:12:24.079
some conflict so I bring my wolf over I
 

00:12:24.079 --> 00:12:27.069
some conflict so I bring my wolf over I
come back as I can only take one thing

00:12:27.069 --> 00:12:27.079
come back as I can only take one thing
 

00:12:27.079 --> 00:12:30.170
come back as I can only take one thing
so let's say that I take the mouse but

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:30.180
so let's say that I take the mouse but
 

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.639
so let's say that I take the mouse but
they all really look the same like the

00:12:31.639 --> 00:12:31.649
they all really look the same like the
 

00:12:31.649 --> 00:12:33.470
they all really look the same like the
graph all looks the same for all of them

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:33.480
graph all looks the same for all of them
 

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.059
graph all looks the same for all of them
and these are cold different things but

00:12:35.059 --> 00:12:35.069
and these are cold different things but
 

00:12:35.069 --> 00:12:36.889
and these are cold different things but
it could have been called you know go

00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:36.899
it could have been called you know go
 

00:12:36.899 --> 00:12:40.040
it could have been called you know go
two one go two go three go for really so

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:40.050
two one go two go three go for really so
 

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:43.939
two one go two go three go for really so
I bring my mouse over so now I have no

00:12:43.939 --> 00:12:43.949
I bring my mouse over so now I have no
 

00:12:43.949 --> 00:12:45.350
I bring my mouse over so now I have no
choice but to bring the wolf pack

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360
choice but to bring the wolf pack
 

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.850
choice but to bring the wolf pack
right otherwise my wolf would eat my

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:46.860
right otherwise my wolf would eat my
 

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:52.220
right otherwise my wolf would eat my
mouse so I bring the wolf pack and then

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:52.230
mouse so I bring the wolf pack and then
 

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:55.550
mouse so I bring the wolf pack and then
well I'm kind of stuck right so either I

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:55.560
well I'm kind of stuck right so either I
 

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.910
well I'm kind of stuck right so either I
bring one of these guys but then my wolf

00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:58.920
bring one of these guys but then my wolf
 

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.389
bring one of these guys but then my wolf
would eat the two remaining guys or I

00:13:01.389 --> 00:13:01.399
would eat the two remaining guys or I
 

00:13:01.399 --> 00:13:03.889
would eat the two remaining guys or I
bring the wolf again and I keep going

00:13:03.889 --> 00:13:03.899
bring the wolf again and I keep going
 

00:13:03.899 --> 00:13:08.720
bring the wolf again and I keep going
like this and I'm stuck it doesn't work

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:08.730
like this and I'm stuck it doesn't work
 

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:11.090
like this and I'm stuck it doesn't work
it doesn't work so how much do you need

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:11.100
it doesn't work so how much do you need
 

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:12.939
it doesn't work so how much do you need
how much bigger does it have to be and

00:13:12.939 --> 00:13:12.949
how much bigger does it have to be and
 

00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:15.710
how much bigger does it have to be and
the amazing thing is you just need one

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:15.720
the amazing thing is you just need one
 

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:19.220
the amazing thing is you just need one
more at whatever the graph

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:19.230
more at whatever the graph
 

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:22.340
more at whatever the graph
of conflicts is you will only need at

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:22.350
of conflicts is you will only need at
 

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:24.380
of conflicts is you will only need at
most one more than your minimum vertex

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:24.390
most one more than your minimum vertex
 

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:26.720
most one more than your minimum vertex
cover and so the way to do it is very

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:26.730
cover and so the way to do it is very
 

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:30.320
cover and so the way to do it is very
simple you have these conflictual things

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:30.330
simple you have these conflictual things
 

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.720
simple you have these conflictual things
that you know like like your wolf here

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:32.730
that you know like like your wolf here
 

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:34.700
that you know like like your wolf here
so you just put all these conflictual

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:34.710
so you just put all these conflictual
 

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:36.800
so you just put all these conflictual
individual individuals in the boat with

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:36.810
individual individuals in the boat with
 

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:38.450
individual individuals in the boat with
you at all times so you can watch them

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:38.460
you at all times so you can watch them
 

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.940
you at all times so you can watch them
and then one by one you carry everything

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:40.950
and then one by one you carry everything
 

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:45.620
and then one by one you carry everything
else so here okay

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:45.630
 
 

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:47.720
 
yeah the wolf is with you the whole time

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:47.730
yeah the wolf is with you the whole time
 

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:50.330
yeah the wolf is with you the whole time
it does every trip back and forth so now

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:50.340
it does every trip back and forth so now
 

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.620
it does every trip back and forth so now
let's say that I have the minimum vertex

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:51.630
let's say that I have the minimum vertex
 

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:54.440
let's say that I have the minimum vertex
cover plus 1 seats extra so I have 2

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:54.450
cover plus 1 seats extra so I have 2
 

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:57.200
cover plus 1 seats extra so I have 2
seats plus a farmer's seat so I'll take

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:57.210
seats plus a farmer's seat so I'll take
 

00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:59.270
seats plus a farmer's seat so I'll take
my wolf in my mouth first

00:13:59.270 --> 00:13:59.280
my wolf in my mouth first
 

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.030
my wolf in my mouth first
I'll leave the mouse there bring back my

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.040
I'll leave the mouse there bring back my
 

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.640
I'll leave the mouse there bring back my
wolf take now my goose with my wall

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:04.650
wolf take now my goose with my wall
 

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:07.910
wolf take now my goose with my wall
leave my goose come back with in my wolf

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920
leave my goose come back with in my wolf
 

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.330
leave my goose come back with in my wolf
take my goat in my wolf but my go there

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:11.340
take my goat in my wolf but my go there
 

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.970
take my goat in my wolf but my go there
come back with my wolf and then carry

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:13.980
come back with my wolf and then carry
 

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:16.790
come back with my wolf and then carry
finally the last 8 and this will work no

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:16.800
finally the last 8 and this will work no
 

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.620
finally the last 8 and this will work no
matter how big your vertex cover is

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:18.630
matter how big your vertex cover is
 

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:21.110
matter how big your vertex cover is
right so no matter how big it is you

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120
right so no matter how big it is you
 

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.150
right so no matter how big it is you
just keep it with you in your boat and

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:23.160
just keep it with you in your boat and
 

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.470
just keep it with you in your boat and
then one by one you carry everything

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480
then one by one you carry everything
 

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.720
then one by one you carry everything
else that's pretty amazing so you know

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:26.730
else that's pretty amazing so you know
 

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:28.280
else that's pretty amazing so you know
that you need at least a minimum vertex

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:28.290
that you need at least a minimum vertex
 

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:31.610
that you need at least a minimum vertex
cover and you need at most the minimum

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:31.620
cover and you need at most the minimum
 

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.440
cover and you need at most the minimum
vertex cover plus one to be able to do

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:33.450
vertex cover plus one to be able to do
 

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:35.690
vertex cover plus one to be able to do
it and the amazing thing is that

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:35.700
it and the amazing thing is that
 

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.840
it and the amazing thing is that
distinguishing between both knowing one

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:38.850
distinguishing between both knowing one
 

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:40.190
distinguishing between both knowing one
you need one and not the other is

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:40.200
you need one and not the other is
 

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.480
you need one and not the other is
actually really hard

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:41.490
actually really hard
 

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:44.420
actually really hard
it's np-hard so this is a recent result

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:44.430
it's np-hard so this is a recent result
 

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:48.920
it's np-hard so this is a recent result

Hannah Harkins and yes it's an amazing

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560
Hannah Harkins and yes it's an amazing
 

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.460
Hannah Harkins and yes it's an amazing
thing this small difference of one is

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:54.470
thing this small difference of one is
 

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.150
thing this small difference of one is
hard to determine

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160
hard to determine
 

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.610
hard to determine
so sometimes minimum vertex cover will

00:14:58.610 --> 00:14:58.620
so sometimes minimum vertex cover will
 

00:14:58.620 --> 00:14:59.150
so sometimes minimum vertex cover will
do the trick

00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.160
do the trick
 

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.680
do the trick
yeah just like in the previous example

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:00.690
yeah just like in the previous example
 

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:02.840
yeah just like in the previous example
yeah sometimes you need to go plus one

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:02.850
yeah sometimes you need to go plus one
 

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:04.340
yeah sometimes you need to go plus one
and to know which is which

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:04.350
and to know which is which
 

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:07.820
and to know which is which
just by looking into graph is hard so

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:07.830
just by looking into graph is hard so
 

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:10.130
just by looking into graph is hard so
for certain classes of graphs we do know

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:10.140
for certain classes of graphs we do know
 

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.320
for certain classes of graphs we do know
it but for a general graph we don't and
