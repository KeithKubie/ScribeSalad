Speaker 1:          00:00          What will happen. The Joe Rogan experience. It's funny cause inevitable let, like you do a lot of, I noticed that the whole MMA stand up making everyone laugh and then you hide. No, you were, you haunted as well. You know what it is, man. I don't have anybody telling me what to do, so because I don't have anybody telling me what to do, I gravitate towards things that I'm really interested, which is why you're here. Right. You know what I'm saying? Like I found out about your story. I was like, that guy seems cool and I saw youtube videos. I go, oh, he's cool. All right, let's do this. Yeah, I mean that's like, to have that kind of freedom in your life is a beautiful thing and I feel incredibly fortunate that I have that kind of freedom. So I indulge it. I indulge it like a little baby, like a child.

Speaker 1:          00:38          Like I just gravitate towards things that I like to do and you know, people could say it's stereotypically toxic masculinity or what it was. Okay. Yeah, I like it. It's like, I'm nice, I'm a nice person, but I gravitate towards manly shit. I like watching fights. I liked doing martial arts, fighting while I buy. It's like buying a cars. I like cars. I like these things. I mean I'm one of my got to pretend that I don't like them to make other people feel happy. Some people feel intimidated by that. Like, oh, it's too Mami. Oh that's the problem is you don't want to look like an asshole. Which I've experienced. You know, I look like an asshole. I'll tell you this. I'll just look at me just like I look like an asshole to me. I'm sure I look like an asshole. The other be true.

Speaker 1:          01:14          I don't think preciate that I started to go, wow, this guy looks like a, like a decent guy coming out of that fancy Tesla. Actually, I would think you're an environmentalist and I probably douche bags probably like Super Vegan. He looking at it and annoying, right? Yeah. Doesn't want your kids to get vaccinated doing the shit you want to do that. That that's, that's definitely a big deal, man. So I, I definitely respect that about you. I feel that more people should do that. And I think one of the things that we have a problem with people doing what they want to do is cause we don't get to do what we want to do, right. So when we see other people, they're like, yeah, that's bullshit. We get mad. Or we like, he doesn't even really like that stuff for he's, you know, Oh yeah, you're, you're, you're just falling into the typical stereotypical masculine behavior. Maybe explore your sensitivity. The

Speaker 2:          02:00          man will say that because the coaches telling you how to do shit. I hate that. It's usually men that are bitches. Yeah. There's a lot of those. Funny how that works. Yeah. Got Any names for me now. I'll write them down. I'll write them down. So speaking of that, so interesting story for you. So, um, yeah, I was, I was kind of talking back to tier guy back and forth about being on the show. And the craziest thing happened where, you know, I was out here attracts you work on a Tufts related project. Oh. Uh, and um, to top secrets going to come out in a couple of months, but basically, uh, is that my job? Right. And then I was like, hey, listen, um, I got to take a week off to go out to California to work on this project. And then I was talking to your guy and they're like, hey listen, you're going to be out here.

Speaker 2:          02:42          Come back the next week as well. You know, if you could say, hey listen, you have two weeks out here. They told my boss and he's like, listen man, like two weeks is kind of a long time. You don't have any coverage. Like, you know, I know you can be on Joe Rogan. It's really cool, but I'm not sure I can let you do that or not. So made a decision following in your light. I said, you know what? Then I'll leave my job then. Oh Shit. Yeah. I left my job, man. Damn. I left my job, which is why I'm here. I need a job. Joe, just fucking with you. Did you really leave your job? I did, yeah. It was a big thing because I had this whole meme thing going on my youtube channel. Uh, and I used to say, oh, I have a full time job.

Speaker 2:          03:19          I can't work on these bills. I can't do this. I can't do that. I was getting in the way and you have no idea. I finally left, and this is kind of the, I was reading, um, your story awhile back about how you got started in the whole comedy thing, how you went out, you flooded in Boston, went to La, and it just felt so liberating because literally, you know, when you're doing something you're not passionate about, that's literally eight to 10 hours of your day doing something that you just, you just don't really want to do. It's most of your day. It's, yeah, because most of your day, so, so it's insane. So I thought to myself, you know what? Everyone's in the rat race, everyone's rushing to get somewhere. Every year you're in your, you know, the ball Boston, like you're rushing to get on the train, you're rushing to get somewhere that you don't really want to be. You're rushing there to work for eight hours for someone else doing something that you don't want to do and it just gets taxing, man. It was, it was, it was just taxing. So,

Speaker 1:          04:12          and you're not going to do your best with the things you do afterwards. If you've been doing this thing for eight hours, four hours that you have before, you really have to go to bed. When you get home at night, you're not going to have the same kind of energy that you had at noon or 10:00 AM or whatever it was when you woke up or when you got to work your, what you, what you're dealing with is this past, this crossroads, right? You, you've, you've hit this path where you can decide to either not take a chance and just, you just slowly take like little incremental steps towards what you really want to do or take a risk, right? And when you take a risk, yeah, you don't have health insurance, dental, you don't have to, right. That's what the risk is all about, right?

Speaker 1:          04:51          That's, that's the only way. And people like, yeah, but what if a fool? But you can't think like that because if you think like that, you're gonna fail set. And second of all, yeah, you might, but then you got to do it again. And if you continue to just fail and do it again one day you'll figure out why you're failing. If you're paying attention and if you're doing your work and then you'll find something that you can do that you're successful at. If somebody wants to hire you, if you're good at your job, if you go to a place and you're valuable to that employer, you could be valuable to yourself. You just got to figure out how to do it or what it is that you want to do that you could do without having a boss without, and something that feels natural, something that you are, you're, you gravitate towards when you get up in the morning and go, I'm fucking pumped.

Speaker 1:          05:34          I'm going to like, I work for myself. Yeah. And I'm gonna do my thing. Right. There's not a time where ever come here to do a podcast while I go, fuck, I can't believe I have to do this right out of time. I must feel good. Thank you. Yeah. Not Today. Not ever. Never. Never. I mean, there's times when I leave. I was like, what the fuck was that about? I could imagine there's a couple that's in a thousand, whatever podcasts I've done, there's only been like a small handful of those that have been like, what fuck was that? Right. If you can do that, man, if you can find that thing that you love to do, whether it's making furniture or fucking painting or whatever it is, if you can ask it so you can make a living doing that. God Damn, that's everything. It changes the world.

Speaker 1:          06:12          The world becomes a better place. Yeah. That's the goal, man. So, so we'll see. So again, I took some cues from, uh, from some inspiration from you when you left Boston and you're like, you know what? I'm going to do this comedy thing. I want to figure it out. So what, what was that like for you? So when did you make the determination to say, hey, you know what, I work at this Gig, uh, you know, this isn't the thing that I want to do. And you made the jump, like what does it, what was that like? The Boston thing was super lucky. Um, I was only 25 or less, 24 dash 24. And uh, I was doing standup and I was driving limos during the day and doing a bunch of different odd jobs and shit. And then, um, I got seen by a manager who is coming from New York to Boston to scout for new talent.

Speaker 1:          06:54          Okay. I just got dumb luck. I wasn't even supposed to be on the show and uh, he asked me to go to New York and do some spots in New York. I did some spots there and then, uh, next thing you know, I was living in New York. I signed a contract with them and I just upped packed up my shit. And my grandparents were still living in New Jersey. They live on north ninth street, which was like a, when the time when they first moved there, it was a pretty nice neighborhood, middle class. But then as New York has got kind of Funky, it's like skid row now. Yeah, well it's just, it was the next door neighbor, uh, while I was living with him, they broke down his house door cause he was selling crack. Oh, he had a dope Audi parked in his driveway and they smashed his door with a battering ram.

Speaker 1:          07:35          And as soon as it was a legit, that was an experience. Yeah. Sketchy neighborhood. Um, but that, so that's what I did. I just packed up my shit and moved. I mean, I didn't have any money. I didn't, I didn't know if it was going to work out at all, but I knew this was a chance. But I was young. When you're 24, you're like, whatever, health insurance, whatever. I didn't have health insurance for a long time. Do you have it now? Yeah. Okay, good. That's good. Yeah. You got it. Did you hate it when you quit this job? Do you have it? At one wife has it. Okay, well, there you go. So that was a scary, just like, Shit. Hey, listen, what does she say? She go for it. Ooh, I like it. Good. You've got a good one.
