00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.080
IMAGINE A WORLD WHERE YOU WAKE UP, GRAB YOUR
CUP OF COFFEE, AND HOP IN YOUR CAR TO DRIVE

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.080
TO WORK…

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.580
EXCEPT YOU’RE NOT DOING THE DRIVING.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.630
YOU HAVE MORE TIME TO SLEEP, READ A BOOK,
OR EVEN GET A PHYSICAL.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.859
THIS IS A WORLD WE ALL WANT TO LIVE IN. AND
ALTHOUGH WE’RE NOT QUITE THERE YET, PEOPLE

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.100
ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE WORKING ON DEVELOPING,
TESTING, AND PLANNING FOR A

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.280
FUTURE WITH AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES.

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.470
BECAUSE, WHO DOESN’T WANT THAT EXTRA HOUR
OF SLEEP?

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.780
SO, HOW CLOSE ARE WE TO A SELF-DRIVING WORLD?

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.460
YOU MAY HAVE SEEN SELF-DRIVING CARS ON THE
NEWS, SPLASHED ACROSS THE INTERNET, OR EVEN

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.440
TESTING AROUND YOUR CITY.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.920
BUT MOST OF THOSE CARS STILL HAVE A HUMAN
IN THE DRIVER’S SEAT.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.039
AND THAT MEANS IT’S PROBABLY A LEVEL 2 OR 3
CAR, WHICH DEFINITELY MORE INDEPENDENT THAN

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.480
THE CAR YOU MIGHT DRIVE, WHICH IS PROBABLY A LEVEL 0 OR 1,  BUT IT'S STILL A FAR CRY FROM

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.800
OUR DREAM RIDE, WHICH WOULD BE A LEVEL 5.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.580
OR 4.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.580
LET ME EXPLAIN.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.280
SAE INTERNATIONAL HAS DIVIDED AUTONOMY INTO
FIVE STAGES.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.821
LEVEL ONE IS “DRIVER ASSISTANCE,” AND
LEVEL TWO IS “PARTIAL AUTOMATION,”

00:01:13.821 --> 00:01:16.320
WHICH YOU CAN ALREADY FIND
 IN CARS  WE DRIVE TODAY.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.140
HERE, THE CAR CAN DO SOME OF THE STEERING,
BRAKING, AND ACCELERATING, BUT STILL NEEDS

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.220
A DRIVER WITH HANDS ON THE WHEEL, BECAUSE
LEVELS 1 AND 2 ARE STILL JUST “DRIVER SUPPORT.”

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.759
So lane keeping, collision warning, even active
interventions that will swerve the vehicle

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.640
if you're about to get into an accident.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.220
LEVEL THREE IS “CONDITIONAL AUTOMATION,”
WHICH MEANS THAT THE CAR IS PRETTY MUCH IN

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.480
CONTROL, BUT REQUIRES HUMAN INTERVENTION IN AN EMERGENCY,

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.250
OR WHEN PROMPTED BY THE SYSTEM.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.510
REMEMBER LEVEL THREE, BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE
IT CAN GET STICKY.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:55.600
BUT THE ULTIMATE SELF-DRIVING CAR WOULD BE
OPERATING AT LEVEL 4 OR 5, WHERE IT CAN STEER,

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.440
BRAKE, ACCELERATE, MONITOR THE ROAD, RESPOND
TO RANDOM EVENTS, CHOOSE TO CHANGE LANES,

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.119
TURN, AND OF COURSE…

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.140
USE ITS BLINKER LIKE ANY DECENT CITIZEN.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.100
THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD TOWARD SELF-DRIVING
TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN A WINDING ONE.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.500
DR. DEAN POMERLEAU HAS BEEN NAVIGATING IT FOR
A LONG TIME.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.920
YOU COULD CALL HIM THE GRANDFATHER, OR AT
LEAST THE COOL UNCLE,

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.810
OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.860
BACK IN 1995, DEAN AND HIS GRADUATE STUDENT
MADE A PILGRIMAGE ACROSS THE COUNTRY

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.180
"LOOK MA, NO HANDS”-STYLE, AFTER THEY TRICKED
OUT A STYLISH MINIVAN WITH CAMERAS

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.140
AND COMPUTER VISION ALGORITHMS.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:38.790
About 98.2% of the trip, as I recall, was
hands-off, feet-off, with the system controlling

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.569
the vehicle all on its own.

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.720
It was a proof of concept, basically, for
some of the technologies that we're seeing

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.440
finally being deployed today.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.200
IN THE YEARS THAT FOLLOWED, RESEARCH TEAMS
COMPETED

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.920
TO DEVELOP THAT TECHNOLOGY FURTHER.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.720
IT WASN’T UNTIL 2005, AFTER SOME…

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.800
CATASTROPHIC FAILURES, THAT DARPA’S GRAND
CHALLENGE TO BUILD A SELF-DRIVING CAR FINALLY

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.280
AWARDED FIRST PLACE TO A STANFORD TEAM, LED
BY SEBASTIAN THRUN.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.800
YEAH, YOU MIGHT’VE SEEN HIM AROUND.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.980
FAST FORWARD TO 2009, WHEN HE STARTS A LITTLE
PROJECT CALLED WAYMO.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:13.980
IN SECRET.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.420
IN 2016, WAYMO SPINS OFF FROM GOOGLE, AND
IN A FEW SHORT YEARS, THE INDUSTRY’S ERUPTED,

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.560
WITH ESTABLISHED TECH AND CAR COMPANIES JUST
AS EAGER AS STARTUPS TO GET IN ON THE ACTION.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.099
Waymo is probably the recognized leader.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:35.400
GM bought Cruise Automation; Argo AI here
in Pittsburgh is one leading player;

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.000
BMW Mercedes, are all working on their own projects
for self-driving cars.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.420
It remains to be seen whether it's a good
investment or not.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.380
FOR THAT INVESTMENT TO PAY OFF, DRIVERLESS
TECHNOLOGY MUST BE REFINED TO THE POINT

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.440
WHERE IT’S BOTH RELIABLE AND FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO HANDLE A COMPLEX JOURNEY.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.140
THAT MEANS SOPHISTICATED SENSORS, ROBUST COMPUTER HARDWARE,

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.640
AND INTELLIGENT DECISION-MAKING SOFTWARE.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.940
TO START WITH, AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES RELY ON SOMETHING NOT ALL HUMAN DRIVERS

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.660
ARE EQUIPPED WITH: A SENSE OF DIRECTION.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.930
The companies that are building these self-driving
cars build their own maps.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.440
Very much like Google has its street-view
cars that drive through neighborhoods and

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.190
collect map data, they have another fleet
with many additional sensors to drive through

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:31.250
a city and map it in great detail –static
obstacles, like telephone poles or the curbs

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.820
around the road, that it should be aware of
and avoid.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.150
BUT TO BE TRULY ADAPTIVE, THE CAR NEEDS TO
BE ABLE TO GATHER REAL-TIME INFORMATION ABOUT

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.680
A DYNAMIC, UNPREDICTABLE ENVIRONMENT.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.500
ELON MUSK THINKS WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS WITH
CAMERAS ALONE.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.949
BUT IF YOU’VE EVER TAKEN A SELFIE IN THE
CLUB, YOU KNOW THAT CAMERAS PROBABLY AREN’T

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:57.900
GOING TO CUT IT, BECAUSE THEY STILL STRUGGLE
WITH DARKNESS, DEPTH, AND REFLECTIONS.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.690
So self-driving-car companies are investigating
many different sensors, for example, millimeter

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:11.700
wave radars for long-range sensing, and short-range,
often ultrasound, sensors that see things

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.760
that are very close to the vehicle.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:20.220
LiDAR is probably the most common and most
impressive technology currently being used.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:26.190
LiDAR is a laser-based technology that shoots
a laser beam out into the environment, scans

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:32.240
it very quickly, and detects the range to
objects and other vehicles.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.700
LiDARs are both a great sensor but also a
weak link; they're very expensive and

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.919
break down fairly often.

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:43.820
AND THIS HAS BEEN A MAJOR ROADBLOCK TO FULLY
AUTONOMOUS ROADS.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:49.210
LIDAR HAS HUGE POTENTIAL, BUT IT’S JUST
TOO DELICATE AT THE MOMENT, BECAUSE IT’S

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.250
MADE UP OF FRAGILE, MOVING PARTS.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:57.029
BUT SOMETHING CALLED SOLID-STATE LIDAR, WHICH SCANS THE ENVIRONMENT USING NO MOVING PARTS

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:58.850
COULD CHANGE ALL THAT.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.950
AND THESE SENSORS, WHILE IN THEIR INFANCY,
ARE IN SUCH DEMAND THAT MANUFACTURERS LITERALLY

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.760
CAN’T MAKE THEM FAST ENOUGH TO SUPPLY THE
DEMANDS OF COMPANIES LIKE FORD AND BAIDU.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.419
It's much more reliable and also much cheaper
to manufacture, which is very important if

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.639
you're going to do this at scales on thousands
of vehicles.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.180
OKAY, SO SAY WE CAN BUILD A DRIVING ROBOT.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.620
THAT IS, AN ENTITY THAT CAN PERCEIVE ITS ENVIRONMENT, JUDGE, AND ACT ON THE ROAD

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.700
BASED ON A COMPLEX NETWORK OF REAL-TIME DATA ANALYSIS.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.080
IN A WAY, IT’S STILL ONLY PREPARED TO DRIVE
ON A MAP.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.630
TO BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE IN THE REAL WORLD,
AND SHARE THE ROAD, AND THE STEERING WHEEL,

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.780
WITH HUMAN DRIVERS, WE’LL NEED TO TAKE IT
TO DRIVER’S ED.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:47.420
Some of the biggest safety concerns are involved
with perception and behavior

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.200
of drivers or pedestrians or cyclists.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:57.130
Slushy roads covered with ice and snow are
very hard to cope with, and there's really

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:03.380
been very little effort or progress in self-driving
cars in these very challenging environments.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.960
TO MAKE THAT PROGRESS, WE HAVE TO STUDY HOW
HUMAN DRIVERS ACTUALLY RESPOND – BOTH TO

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.360
RISKY ROAD CONDITIONS, AND TO AUTONOMY ITSELF.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.699
SO TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE HUMAN IN THE
WHOLE EQUATION, WE HEADED TO STANFORD’S

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.120
AUTOMOTIVE INNOVATION LAB.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.819
We are working together to really get a detailed
understanding of the human as we move forward

00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:32.010
in designing active safety systems
and automated vehicles.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.479
So, we're gonna set up this NIRS cap on her right now.

00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:38.710
It will be shining a little bit of infrared
light onto her motor cortex.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:44.110
We'll be able to see as she's turning left,
turning right, using the gas pedal and the

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.770
brake pedal, all in our data streams back
there.

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:52.039
The majority of accidents that we do see do
come down to human error in either recognition,

00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:53.960
decision, or performance.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:59.610
So when we can get to the point where the
system does a better job at those three things

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:03.360
than humans, then I think it's clear that
our roads will be safer.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.690
This is X-1, our experimental test vehicle.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.820
The flexibility in steering allows us to set
up all sorts of experiments.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:14.380
We can emulate driving on 
an unexpected change of friction.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.410
Going from snow to ice, for example.

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:21.940
There are studies going on in the dynamic
design lab, measuring the inputs that professional

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:26.949
drivers make, so that we can try and understand
what they're doing differently to drive right

00:08:26.949 --> 00:08:32.441
at the limits of the vehicle. We can use that
to inform the way that the autonomous vehicle

00:08:32.441 --> 00:08:37.930
control algorithms are designed, so that hopefully,
your autonomous vehicle will drive as well

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:40.300
as the very best human driver.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:45.000
LENE’S MOST RECENT PROJECT INVESTIGATED
A SCENARIO THAT MIGHT POP UP IN SOMETHING

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.870
LIKE LEVEL 3 AUTONOMY, WHERE THE CAR’S BEEN
ROLLING SOLO WHEN SUDDENLY, IT ENCOUNTERS

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:56.040
SOME SCENARIO IT CAN’T MAKE SENSE OF, AND
THE HUMAN DRIVER IS ASKED TO INTERVENE.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:02.580
What our studies of brain and behavior tell
us is that it's important to consider a period

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:07.450
of time when people's driving behavior may
be significantly different if they've taken

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:11.510
control of a vehicle after a certain amount
of time out of the loop.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:17.390
We can see almost in real time the cognitive
resources being deployed. They may have more

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:21.920
limited cognitive resources to deal with an
emergency situation under those conditions.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:26.420
It's potentially a quite dangerous situation
if you're handing off control back and forth

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.000
with the system.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:33.500
THOUGH IT MAY SEEM EXTREME FOR CONSUMERS TO
MAKE THE JUMP FROM CRUISING AROUND

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.080
IN A LEVEL 1 CAR TO HOPPING IN A FULLY AUTONOMOUS ONE,

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.860
MANY RESEARCHERS AGREE
THAT PARTIAL AUTONOMY

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.540
SHOULD ONLY BE RESERVED FOR TESTING PURPOSES.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:46.190
AND UNFORTUNATELY, MOST OF THE
ACCIDENTS THAT HAVE ALREADY OCCURRED HAVE

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:47.480
PROVEN THEM RIGHT.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:53.310
I think the next five years or so of autonomous
vehicle design is actually going to focus

00:09:53.310 --> 00:10:00.260
more on the ways in which we can implement
full autonomy in a much smaller, more controlled

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:06.420
environment, and sort of do it that way rather
than necessarily going through this partial

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.740
autonomy stage to get there.

00:10:09.649 --> 00:10:13.920
People are easily distractible, and that's
the underlying problem that autonomous vehicles

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:15.320
are setting out to solve.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:19.829
So NACTO cities believe that it needs to be
really full automation to achieve the safety

00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:23.610
benefits that are the major promise behind
autonomous vehicles.

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:26.320
THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CITY TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.950
REPRESENTS 68 CITIES AND 11 TRANSIT

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.100
AGENCIES ACROSS NORTH AMERICA.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:34.920
NACTO RECENTLY CONVENED TO DISCUSS HOW THE
WORLD WILL PREPARE

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.459
FOR FULLY AUTONOMOUS CARS

00:10:36.459 --> 00:10:37.899
TO BECOME A REALITY.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:42.360
It's unrealistic to expect city governments
to redesign streets

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.180
to accommodate autonomous vehicles.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:49.220
THIS MEANS, WHEN SELF-DRIVING CARS DO HIT
THE ROAD, THEY’LL NEED TO TRAVEL AT LOW

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.730
SPEEDS, AND MAKE USE OF OUR EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:56.280
BECAUSE OVER THE PAST CENTURY, WE’VE MADE
COUNTLESS COMPROMISES

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.900
TO ACCOMMODATE THE SHINY NEW TECHNOLOGY OF THE TIME…

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.340
THE AUTOMOBILE.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:03.960
BUT URBAN PLANNERS THINK WE CAN DO BETTER
THIS TIME AROUND.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:11.520
We've seen neighborhoods cut off from opportunities,
we've seen congestion, greenhouse gas emissions,

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:15.690
pollution, decreases in public health… we
risk repeating a lot of those same mistakes

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:17.040
with autonomous vehicles.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.760
The Bblueprint for Autonomous Urbanism came
about because we were seeing too many visions

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.430
for driverless cars in a people-less city.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:28.010
The Blueprint is imagining how cities can
structure their streets to prioritize walking

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:32.130
and biking and transit and public space, to
really maximize those benefits of living and

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:35.760
being in a city, while using autonomous vehicles
to help achieve those goals.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.101
THE IMAGES YOU SEE HERE ARE JUST SKETCHES
AND SUGGESTIONS FOR THE FUTURE.

00:11:40.101 --> 00:11:44.380
THE REALITY IS, REGULATION FOR THESE KINDS
OF VEHICLES IS PRETTY NEW – AND

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:46.320
IT’S DIFFERENT IN EVERY STATE.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.860
BUT PLANNERS AND TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS
LARGELY AGREE ON THE NEED FOR EQUAL ACCESS,

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:53.000
SAFETY, AND SUSTAINABILITY.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.640
It requires really thoughtful and intentional
policies to make that vision and that promise

00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.089
a reality.

00:11:59.089 --> 00:12:01.889
SO, HUMANS ARE ADAPTABLE LEARNERS.

00:12:01.889 --> 00:12:04.339
AND WE’RE DESIGNING SYSTEMS THAT CAN WORK
THAT WAY TOO.

00:12:04.339 --> 00:12:10.220
BUT ON A GRANDER SCALE, WE AS A SOCIETY HAVE
TO BE WILLING TO ASSESS RISK, AND STEER IN

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:14.110
THE RIGHT DIRECTION BEFORE WE CHANGE LANES
AND CHARGE FULL SPEED AHEAD.

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:15.110
SO…

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:19.300
HOW CLOSE ARE WE TO A DRIVERLESS WORLD?

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:23.390
If you look at particular geographical locations,
it's already happening.

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:28.690
Over time, I believe that those islands will
grow in number and expand, and that's how

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:32.180
you will see the expansion of fully automated
vehicles on the road.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:39.250
I think in the next year or two we will see
companies like Waymo and GM Cruise deploying

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:43.630
maybe a few hundred of these vehicles for
the general public to ride in.

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:53.089
Probably by early 2020s, we'll see cars without
drivers giving rides and then driving empty

00:12:53.089 --> 00:12:54.930
to pick up the next passenger.

00:12:54.930 --> 00:13:00.779
It'll be probably at least a decade, I would
say, before you can walk into a showroom and

00:13:00.779 --> 00:13:06.891
buy a car at an affordable price that can
do, say, level four or five autonomy, which

00:13:06.891 --> 00:13:09.260
means you don't have to do anything.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.860
The fact that Waymo's CEO said we're still
quite a ways off makes me think

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.280
that that's probably true.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:18.181
But in the near term, I think there are some
applications, especially for transit, to use

00:13:18.181 --> 00:13:21.459
autonomous technology to achieve some of our goals.

00:13:21.459 --> 00:13:25.330
Access to affordable, convenient transportation
is really important.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:29.709
We all have a grandparent or a friend of our
grandparents who had to give up driving and

00:13:29.709 --> 00:13:31.140
lost a lot of their independence.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:38.459
I think it can change lives and save lives
across the board as long as we take into consideration

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:43.020
everyone across the spectrum as we as a society
move forward with automated vehicles.

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:46.980
SOUNDS LIKE AS LONG AS WE TAKE CARE OF SOME
POTHOLES FIRST…

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.070
WE’VE GOT A GREEN LIGHT.

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:52.230
