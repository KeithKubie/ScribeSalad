THOMAS WOOLLEY: OK, so today
we're going to be talking

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.710
about the number 3/4, or 0.75.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.850
Unusual, I know, because it's
not a whole number,

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:11.820
like 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.700
But this one is very important
in biology.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:25.220
So Max Kleiber in the 1930s
posited a graph of mass of

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.910
animal against metabolic rate.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.510
Down here we have the mouse,
he'll have his little legs

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.284
there and little ears.

00:00:36.284 --> 00:00:37.070
MALE SPEAKER: Is that a mouse?

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.650
THOMAS WOOLLEY: That's
a mouse.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:40.800
MALE SPEAKER: That's the worst
mouse I've ever seen.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.290
THOMAS WOOLLEY: Wait until
you see my elephant.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.790
So somewhere up here,
1,000 times heavier,

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.720
you'll have an elephant.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.180
So let's try this one.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.020
MALE SPEAKER: That's not bad.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.736
THOMAS WOOLLEY: That's
not bad.

00:00:50.736 --> 00:00:52.200
Well, you know, it's
kind of like a big

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.180
mouse, to be honest.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.940
And then all the way up here,
you have your blue whale.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.450
OK, so he plotted the mass
against the metabolic rate of

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.390
all the animals.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.340
So mouse, elephant, blue
whale, there was

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.030
also mayflies in there.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.990
And as you might expect, with
the bigger animals, they need

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.860
more energy to survive.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.570
And that's what metabolic rate
essentially measures.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.700
How much energy do you
need to survive?

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.660
So small animals need a small
amount of energy, bigger

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.200
animals need more energy.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.320
So one way it could happen is
that since the elephant is

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.157
1,000 times heavier than the
mouse, it would need 1,000

00:01:26.157 --> 00:01:27.750
times much more energy.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.000
And if you had that sort of
scaling, it would be linear.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.050
And so it would have just a
straight line between the

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.050
metabolic rate and the mass.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.055
So the whale, that's a million
heavier than the mouse, so it

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:39.370
would need a million
times more energy.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.180
Or it could be super linear.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.680
So the elephant is 1,000 times
heavier than the mouse, so it

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.660
needs, say, a million
times more.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.305
It actually needs more than
the line originally, the

00:01:49.305 --> 00:01:49.670
linear line.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.460
What Max Kleiber found was that
it's neither of those.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.020
The curve actually tapers
off, and so it's below

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.450
the straight line.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.030
What that means is that the
bigger you get, although you

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.280
need more energy, you can spend
it more efficiently.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.470
So down here, with your mayflies
and your spiders and

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.270
all your insects, they need very
little energy, but they

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.680
don't use it very efficiently.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.180
And this scale crosses all sizes
of animal, right down to

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.660
cells, all the way up
to the blue whale.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.710
It's amazing how this curve
describes all the animals.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.680
And how does this curve
link in the 3/4?

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.040
Well, what Max found was that
this curve, is that the

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.650
metabolic rate is proportional
to the mass to power 3/4.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.020
Now, statistically, it was
around 3/4, so it's something

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.760
like 0.74 or 0.76.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.430
But on average, that's what
biologists now take.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.850
So this is Kleiber's rule,
or the 3/4 rule.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.360
Well, when they found 3/4, one
thing we want to understand is

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.760
where does that number
come from?

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.640
Is it just a coincidence that
it's 3/4, or is this some

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.880
reasoning behind it that
we can get at?

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.410
So originally when they were
looking for this 3/4, they

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.780
were trying to link metabolic
rate and the mass.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.090
And so your metabolic rate is
how much you use energy.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.280
And you use energy, they
thought, mostly through

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.930
heating yourself.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.300
And so what affects the heat?

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.870
Well, your surface area.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.400
The bigger your surface area,
the more you lose heat.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.470
And the bigger you are in terms
of your mass, again, the

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.800
more heat you will have.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.450
So they looked at spherical
animals.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.990
So just for the sake of
mathematics, we're going to

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.520
treat these animals as spheres,
because your main

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.690
body is sort of spherical.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.000
And you can at least get an
approximation of what you'd

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.710
expect to get at the end.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:41.700
We draw our sphere, and we
give it a radius, r.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.940
So that's the body of
the animal, OK?

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.400
So even if you're a mayfly,
you'd be a tiny sphere.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.050
If you're a blue whale, you'd
be an enormous sphere.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.570
So the area, the surface area
of this sphere, that's

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.560
proportional to r squared.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.350
As you increase r, if you double
r, your surface area

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.301
increases by 4.

00:04:03.301 --> 00:04:08.570
And the volume of the sphere
is proportional to r cubed.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.570
So if you double the
radius, your volume

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:11.800
increases by eight.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.200
So using this idea that the
metabolic rate is proportional

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.180
to these two guys, you'd expect
it to be metabolic rate

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.020
is proportional to r 2/3.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.160
So you'd get a 2/3 power out.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.390
So although 2/3 is quite close
to 3/4, we wanted to

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.860
understand where that difference
is coming from,

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.630
because they're close.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.460
So it's a good first
approximation, but there has

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.010
to be some reason that we're
not getting 3/4.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.280
And so what mathematicians have
looked at is using the

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.870
fractal structure inside us
to deliver that energy.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.470
So the circulation system that
we have, the veins, the

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.160
arteries, and the
capillaries, is

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.860
self-similar all the way down.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.040
As you zoom into the
veins, they look

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.400
like the whole system.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.060
And that's what a fractal is.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.720
And using that fractal
structure, you can link the

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.640
mass to the elephant
to the blue whale.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.810
And that does spits out
the 3/4 power law

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:02.960
at the end of it.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.850
So as I said, yeah, the bigger
the animal, the more efficient

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.610
you're using your energy.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.680
But using this idea of the
circulation system being a

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.710
fractal, you can then start
using it to look at cities,

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.000
because what are cities?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.120
Well, they've got their own
circulation system, because

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.820
they have roads that deliver
cars to places.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.250
They have water pipes, they
have electricity cables.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.990
And you can plot those certain
things against population, and

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.060
you get very similar graphs that
follow this power rule.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.660
It may not be 3/4, but you'll
get that it's proportional to

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.990
the population, and it's
less than linear.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.310
And they usually are following
a quarter structure.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.480
So whatever this number may be
on top, you'll usually find a

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.730
4 on the bottom.
