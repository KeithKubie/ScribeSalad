ABJAD: Thanks
everyone for coming.

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:04.720
My name's Abjad.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.550
I lead one of the
product teams in ads.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.930
And some of you guys
I've worked with

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.080
and are probably
wondering why I'm up here.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.610
Mike and I actually grew up
together a long, long time ago.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.830
Before he became the
renowned explorer is,

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.400
we were doing timetables
and addition and basic math

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.222
together.

00:00:24.222 --> 00:00:26.680
And we've been talking over
the last year about a timeframe

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.680
for him to come in and share
some of his experiences

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.980
with folks at Google.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.330
And I'm really excited to
welcome him here today.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.980
And he's gonna spend about 45
minutes with us, walking us

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.590
through some of
his recent treks,

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.109
and then we've got some
time as well for Q&amp;A.

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:43.900
So without any delay,
I'd like to introduce

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.630
Mike Libecki to you.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.085
MIKE LIBECKI: Thanks, thanks.

00:00:47.085 --> 00:00:49.510
All right.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.640
You guys hear me OK?

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.780
All right, great.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.010
Well, thanks for hanging
out, and for those of you

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.510
in on your computers,
however you're

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.810
watching, and then those
of you in the audience,

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.440
thanks for being here.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.760
So I guess one of
the ways to put

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.099
it is I'm first and
foremost a father,

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:08.060
but I'm also an
obsessed/addicted

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.996
explorer-climber but
specializing in first ascent.

00:01:11.996 --> 00:01:13.620
So the expeditions
and climbs that I do

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.910
are to places that
no one's ever been

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.050
to before, that are
completely unknown, untouched,

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.150
and that, gosh, exploration
is still very much alive,

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.220
and there are a lot of places
where no one's been to or seen,

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.417
especially that have big
rock walls, and towers,

00:01:28.417 --> 00:01:29.000
and mountains.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.250
So I'm going to get more
into that during the show,

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.250
so let me just give you
a little preview of what

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.540
we're gonna see today.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.770
We're going to
place in Antarctica

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.930
that's incredibly remote.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.870
And the nearest major city
is about 2,300 miles away

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.430
from this area, so it's one
of the most remote, if not

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.010
the most remote,
big wall area you

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.493
can go climbing on the planet.

00:01:50.493 --> 00:01:52.576
And let me just give you
a little preview of that.

00:01:55.556 --> 00:03:12.248
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:12.248 --> 00:03:16.151
-This is like the SWAT team,
special weapons and tactics.

00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:17.150
It'll be spicy for sure.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.380
-It's a beautiful sunny day.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.970
Dead calm, no wind.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.290
Super dry.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.470
Shuttled a load across the
ice cap, maybe t-shirts,

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.200
bronze a little bit
before we go home

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.495
for the wives and girlfriends.

00:03:36.804 --> 00:03:37.304
Loving life.

00:04:11.524 --> 00:04:12.024
-Yeah!

00:04:12.024 --> 00:04:13.580
-Loving life!

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.606
-Antarctica bitches!

00:04:18.637 --> 00:04:19.470
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.310
So this is a very unique place
on the planet, but like I said,

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.600
also for Antarctica.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.230
And I've done about 65
expeditions around the world.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.490
I think technically
67, if I really

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.110
started counting them up.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.020
And Antarctica is very
unique, obviously,

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.390
because it's really cool.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.460
And I love places
that are really cold,

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.710
compared to the
extreme heat or jungle,

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.547
you don't have scorpions,
or snakes, or spiders.

00:04:41.547 --> 00:04:43.130
So it's really nice
to be really cold.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.042
Even if it's minus 30, minus
40, minus 50, you can get warm

00:04:47.042 --> 00:04:49.250
and you can actually function
in this type of weather

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.770
rather than extreme heat.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.240
So it's a very special place.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.520
To go on an expedition
like this in Antarctica,

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.980
especially a place that
no one has been to before,

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.345
you can't just charter a plane.

00:05:00.345 --> 00:05:02.220
And you can't just go
down there and do this.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.720
It takes a lot of experience
and a lot of research,

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.150
but also permission.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.410
There's an Antarctic
Treaty, and you

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.990
have to basically go by the
protocol of this treaty.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.920
So you have to get
permission from the NSF,

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.140
the EPA, the State Department.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.917
I think I submitted
52 pages of what

00:05:17.917 --> 00:05:20.000
we were gonna do there to
all of these departments

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.458
to get permission
to go down there.

00:05:21.458 --> 00:05:23.420
So it's not just a free for all.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.910
The Antarctic Treaty.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.020
It's really taking
care of Antarctica,

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.380
and making it our last
pristine continent,

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.560
and trying to keep it that way.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.090
So this was a
really special trip,

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.450
in the fact that it's
expensive as hell.

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.880
And so I proposed this trip
to National Geographic.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.830
So it's a big shout out
to National Geographic

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.130
for making the trip
possible, because it's really

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.840
incredibly expensive to go
down and do this kind of thing.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.680
I love Antarctica,
because on most maps

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.752
that you see it's
not even on the map.

00:05:53.752 --> 00:05:55.960
So it's just down at the
bottom of the Earth, kind of

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.180
forgotten in this world.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.770
But it's one of the most
beautiful places I've been to.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.810
I've been down
there seven times,

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.110
and some of the biggest rock
walls-- so these walls are not

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.332
ice, they're not snow.

00:06:06.332 --> 00:06:09.490
These are big huge granite walls
that come out of the ice cap.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.770
It's pretty spectacular,
and not many people

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.370
have seen these places.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.010
This was really
unique in the fact

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.210
that the team going down
there, I got to choose the team

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.750
and figure out who's gonna go.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.590
And so on the very right
hand side is Keith Ladzinski.

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.160
And if you check
him out online, he's

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.870
one of the best
videographers on the planet,

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.060
capturing just
extraordinary-- the way

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.400
he does things with
time lapse and video

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.824
is incredibly cutting edge.

00:06:34.824 --> 00:06:36.740
It'll blow you guys away
if you check him out.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.660
And that's Keith Ladzinski.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.300
Next to him in the red
jacket is Corey Richards,

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.280
one of the best photographers on
the planet, National Geographic

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.760
photographer.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.250
So Keith and Corey are coming
down to capture the trip,

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.440
and get everything behind the
scenes, in front of the scenes,

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.980
so we can share with people
like yourselves today.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.750
And then in the blue jacket
is Freddie Wilkinson,

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:57.515
friend of mine.

00:06:57.515 --> 00:06:59.630
And he's also my
climbing partner.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.090
And he wrote an article for
National Geographic magazine

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:03.900
about this trip.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.640
So it was really based
on going on this trip

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.410
to do something
really incredible,

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.200
but bringing back
the story to be

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.829
able to share on a global stage
with anyone who's interested.

00:07:14.829 --> 00:07:16.370
And then I'm, of
course, on the left,

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.380
and I'm the
expedition leader who

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.680
proposed this trip,
who did the research,

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.700
and had been basically planning
this trip for eight years

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.650
until it finally
came to fruition.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:30.790
So this was a really big
trip, long time in the making.

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.320
If you look in my eye there,
you can see these rock towers

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.565
reflecting out of my eye.

00:07:34.565 --> 00:07:38.920
And I had been to this area by
myself eight years previous.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.880
And so eight years ago,
before going on this trip,

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.506
I was down there by myself, and
made friends with some Russians

00:07:45.506 --> 00:07:47.338
that you're gonna meet
here in a little bit.

00:07:47.338 --> 00:07:49.590
And they flew me around
all these remote places

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:51.920
in their plane, and
I found these towers

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.600
that I've been trying
to get back to.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.030
So we finally got down there.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:57.880
In order to go to
this area Antarctica,

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.720
we're going with
a Russian company

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.499
out of Cape Town, South Africa.

00:08:01.499 --> 00:08:03.040
And I thought this
was really unique.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.500
If you see right
here, you can see

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.080
Antarctica on the flight board.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.860
That's not very common
to be having a beer,

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.530
hanging out with
your friends, oh hey.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.020
There's are flight to
Antarctica on the flight board.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:13.970
Let's go.

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:15.240
Let's get on the plane.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.710
And that was pretty unique.

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:18.810
That's the first year
that they put Antarctica

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:21.230
on the flight board in
Capetown, South Africa.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:22.735
It was pretty funny.

00:08:22.735 --> 00:08:23.235
I'm sorry?

00:08:23.235 --> 00:08:24.780
AUDIENCE: They
commercially fly there?

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.030
MIKE LIBECKI: It's
actually a charter flight,

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:28.412
but you have to go through
normal security now

00:08:28.412 --> 00:08:29.286
to get on the flight.

00:08:29.286 --> 00:08:30.994
So that was the first
year they did that.

00:08:30.994 --> 00:08:33.929
The first time I'd been
down here was 2002,

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:36.720
and this is actually 2012,
when this trip happened.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:40.254
So lots happening down there.

00:08:40.254 --> 00:08:42.039
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:45.140
NARRATOR: Their first stop,
a Russian research station,

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:49.300
Novolazarevskaya, or
Novo in Antarctica,

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.400
where they'll catch a short
flight to the Wohlthat

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:51.900
Mountains.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.030
-So we fly into this old Russian
research station in Antarctica.

00:09:04.368 --> 00:09:06.790
-Loving life!

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:09.390
-And then all of a
sudden, we're really here.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.120
We're at the bottom
of the world,

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.105
and it's this
totally alien place.

00:09:14.105 --> 00:09:16.100
And it's like we've
landed on the ice planet.

00:09:18.841 --> 00:09:20.465
I can't wait to get
into the mountains.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.000
But it looks like
we've got a problem.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:26.890
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:30.430
So that problem is
called katabatic winds.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.860
Does anyone know what
katabatic winds are in here?

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.440
Anyway, there are
crazy, crazy winds

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.470
that come from the South
Pole, and are pushed up

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:38.640
towards the coast.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.450
These can be 80, 90, 100,
120 mile an hour winds.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:45.630
So we took this
giant Aleutian 76

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:48.100
from Capetown down
to the Russian base

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.910
called Novolazarevskaza.

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:52.380
I mean, kind of like a
modern day Millennium Falcon

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.930
sort of aircraft.

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.180
And it's pretty cool when
you're flying over the ocean

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.710
to get to Antarctica, you can
go to the front of the plane

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:02.160
and just look out the windows,
and it's just magnificent.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.310
But we were in Capetown
waiting for our flight.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:06.060
We were supposed to
be there for two days.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:09.030
We ended up being
delayed about two weeks,

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:12.320
because the katabatic winds
were just scouring the base,

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.680
and we couldn't go
down and land safely.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.520
And they land this monster
aircraft right on the ice.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.420
That's the tarmac.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.190
It's just solid blue ice.

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:24.230
I mean, it's pretty incredible.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:26.600
But we did get to
the Russian base,

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.210
and about two hours later,
the winds kicked up again,

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:32.230
and we've got these 60,
70, 80 mile an hour winds.

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.130
And this is just around
Novolazarevskaya.

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:37.200
There's a lot of Russians
hanging around, just

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.600
keeping the base going.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:42.240
The reason this base exists is
because on this big Aleutian 76

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.060
flight, you've got Germans,
Norwegians, Japanese.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.100
A lot of different
government organizations

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.080
come down to this Russian base,
and then small feeder flights

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.140
take them out to other
their government bases.

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:56.010
So it's basically a
government run operation,

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:58.770
and we're just these
climbers hitchhiking on board

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:00.450
to go down there.

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:03.090
And for a while, the
weather was pretty crazy.

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:05.050
We helped out
shovelling and just

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:07.360
living down here at the base.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.850
And then we do need
to take these smaller

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:12.200
flights from the Russian
base out to the mountains

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.150
at this point.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.200
And this is really
unique, because they

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.640
bring these planes.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.130
Basically they're
Basler 67s, and they're

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:20.920
converted into DC3s.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.810
They're flown all the
way down from Canada,

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:24.630
through South America,
into Antarctica,

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:26.830
and over to the
Russian base to meet

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:29.094
us and the other
government organizations

00:11:29.094 --> 00:11:30.260
to fly out to the mountains.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.690
It's a huge operation
going down here.

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:34.990
But we're at the Russian
base, and I'm thinking,

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:37.030
OK, I've proposed this
to National Geographic.

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:39.010
This is one of the
biggest expeditions

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:42.152
for myself and the team, but
also for today's modern day

00:11:42.152 --> 00:11:43.110
and age of exploration.

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:45.360
I mean, it just doesn't
get more remote,

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.290
and the logistics
don't get more intense

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:48.940
than it does for
this kind of trip,

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:52.840
especially for first ascents
and vertical exploration.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.880
So finally, this is a
really cool pivotal part

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.644
of the story and
one of the things

00:11:57.644 --> 00:11:59.435
I love about expeditions,
just the mystery.

00:11:59.435 --> 00:12:02.120
You never know what's
gonna happen next.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.095
The pilots are from
Canada, and there

00:12:04.095 --> 00:12:06.340
was this guy named Louis there.

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:10.100
And technically, they're not
allowed to fly these planes out

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:13.300
if the winds are more than
20, 30 miles an hour tops.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.810
So we've got 40, 50,
60 mile an hour winds.

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:19.250
We're stuck at the Russian
base, and we're thinking, gosh,

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:20.580
our trip's over expeditions.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:20.820
The expedition's over.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.870
One of the biggest trips of our
lives, and we can't even move.

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:27.550
We're almost delayed 15,
16 days at this point.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.470
Well, Louis, he
said, hey, you guys.

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:31.590
Let's get all the
gear in the plane.

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:35.030
And if we get a little weather
window, I'll try to take off.

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:36.839
We'll get you out
to these mountains.

00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:38.130
We didn't get a weather window.

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:41.330
We had all these crazy winds,
and he said, you know what?

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:42.590
I'm gonna get paid anyway.

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:44.460
I could just be sitting
here and do nothing,

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:46.590
but I'm gonna get you
guys out to the mountains.

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:48.850
So I think it was about
40 mile an hour winds,

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:50.480
and Louis's like,
we're going for it.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.152
So we took off.

00:12:51.152 --> 00:12:52.360
We were kind of freaking out.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.162
The plane's sliding
all over the ice.

00:12:54.162 --> 00:12:56.620
And we got up in the air, and
we were out to the mountains.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:00.130
So thanks to the Canadian
Louis, this amazing pilot

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:02.150
risking his life and,
of course, our lives

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:05.020
as well, to get out
to the mountains,

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:07.672
we were all in at this point.

00:13:07.672 --> 00:13:09.510
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:11.130
So the time is now.

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:14.220
We go for this.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.145
-Here we go.

00:13:15.145 --> 00:13:15.645
Throttle up.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.340
-We decided to go
for it and took off.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.980
It's a really alien landscape.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.650
We could be looking out
of the window at Mars,

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:33.292
for better or worse.

00:13:33.292 --> 00:13:35.000
Hundreds of mountains
that are unclimbed.

00:13:40.743 --> 00:13:42.284
-We could go over
there, but it seems

00:13:42.284 --> 00:13:44.325
like we've got some stuff
we could get done here.

00:13:48.915 --> 00:13:50.790
Oh, look at that beautiful
summit over there.

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:51.290
Woohoo!

00:13:54.583 --> 00:13:55.083
Woohoo!

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.450
-The feeling of isolation
kicked in immediately.

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:06.800
You were watching the last
piece of comfort and warmth

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.200
just take off into the sky.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.050
And then all of a sudden,
it got dead silent.

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:32.560
We built six foot high
walls 360 degrees.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:41.610
We could not have flown in
a smaller weather window.

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:44.590
-And we knew life
was about to be very

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:46.020
different for the next 45 days.

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:00.380
-We asked for adventure,
and that's what we got.

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.445
And so it's only begun, man.

00:15:08.137 --> 00:15:08.970
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:11.580
MIKE LIBECKI: So if you
noticed in these photos here,

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.240
there's a lot of blue ice.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.540
And that basically is evidence
of the katabatic winds.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.831
And so all the other places
I've been to in Antarctica,

00:15:17.831 --> 00:15:20.440
there's always snow,
a lot of white snow.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.590
So you notice it's just
blue, hard, clear ice.

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:26.670
And this is technically
one of the windiest places

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.880
on the planet, where
these katabatic winds just

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:29.949
scour the ice cap.

00:15:29.949 --> 00:15:31.490
And so we've got
some big challenges.

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:33.190
It's one thing to
go out and survive.

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:34.370
That's no problem.

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:36.990
But to go out and try to
climb these vertical towers

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:40.290
is a whole new equation in front
of us, not just on its own,

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:43.010
but with the katabatic winds.

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:45.640
They're basically the biggest
enemy aside from rock fall

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:46.890
to go out and climb like this.

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:47.902
Cold is one thing.

00:15:47.902 --> 00:15:48.860
You can deal with that.

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:52.040
But the winds kick up, you can
be frozen a matter of hours

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.569
if you're not prepared.

00:15:53.569 --> 00:15:55.110
And of course with
that wind, though,

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:57.510
comes beauty and
art of the planet.

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:59.076
I mean, these winds
sculpted areas

00:15:59.076 --> 00:16:00.992
that we just walked
around and were in awe of.

00:16:00.992 --> 00:16:02.820
It was incredible.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:05.670
And so imagine living
for almost two months

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:08.440
in temperatures colder
than your freezer at home.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.880
So you have to adapt to that.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.130
I have a lot of
experience in the cold,

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:14.170
and I think for a
couple of these guys,

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:16.559
it was a big wake up call.

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:18.350
Yeah, it takes a little
while to acclimate.

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:20.370
And so you can see
Corey, he broke his fork

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:21.790
because it was frozen.

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.270
He also broke his tooth.

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:26.170
And if Corey was
here, he would say

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.700
he always heard a banjo
playing in the background

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.170
with that broken tooth.

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:34.110
But he took a bite of a frozen
candy bar and broke his tooth.

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:38.190
You gotta be careful
when you're in the cold.

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:39.780
So basically what
we're gonna do is,

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.050
we're gonna go down here
to this mountain area,

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:45.010
and we're gonna circumnavigate
one of the small sections

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:46.034
of the mountain range.

00:16:46.034 --> 00:16:47.700
And the reason we're
doing that is we're

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:51.560
coming down to find the
most remote, the biggest

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.060
vertical unclimbed
formations on the planet.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:58.457
But to do that, to climb
one of these towers, yeah,

00:16:58.457 --> 00:17:00.040
there's this huge
rock towers, but you

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.380
have to have cracks
and features to climb.

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.164
So we're scouting out an
area to actually find a route

00:17:05.164 --> 00:17:08.020
that we can actually climb.

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.930
And there's a really cool
way to travel in Antarctica.

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:13.990
Usually, you'll take your skis,
and you'll take your kites,

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:16.819
and you'll use the winds
just to cruise around.

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:19.075
And we can just harness the
wind's energy and cruise

00:17:19.075 --> 00:17:20.200
around this mountain range.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:23.130
I've done this
easily for thousands

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:25.220
of miles just in my
lifetime, kite-skiing,

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.349
enjoying, having a good time.

00:17:27.349 --> 00:17:30.040
But with these katabatic
winds that I mentioned,

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.940
we went out to set up our kites,
and we had the appropriate size

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:33.830
kite for the wind.

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.990
It was about 20,
25 miles an hour.

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:37.580
By the time we got
our kites set up,

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.690
we're hitting 40,
50 mile an hour

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:42.780
gusts, which weren't right
for these size of kites.

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.680
So basically when
you're kite-skiing,

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.362
you have different sizes of
kites for the amount of wind

00:17:47.362 --> 00:17:48.320
that you have that day.

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.772
So if it's heavy winds,
these really small kites.

00:17:50.772 --> 00:17:52.230
Really low five
mile an hour winds,

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:55.280
you have these big huge
kites to harness the energy.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:58.050
And so we just went for
it anyway with the kites

00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:02.030
we had out, and it
got real really fast.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:03.220
It was pretty intense.

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:08.280
So this is either working way
too well or not working at all.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.810
We went for it, and
it was pretty intense.

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:14.630
Next thing we knew, basically
there was a mechanism.

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:15.552
You have a bar.

00:18:15.552 --> 00:18:17.510
You can cut the bar, and
the kite will go down.

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:18.710
It's a safety call.

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:19.960
You can get out the situation.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.852
Well, the winds were so crazy
I had to cut my kite down.

00:18:22.852 --> 00:18:24.560
I was still being
dragged across the ice,

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.210
and had to cut loose completely.

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:27.960
And here I am trying
to capture my kite,

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.470
so we don't litter
Antarctica, we're

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:32.730
within the protocol of
the Antarctic Treaty.

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:36.780
But I did capture my kite as
it was blowing off in the wind.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.176
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:18:38.176 --> 00:18:39.675
-Just holding it,
and then just bam.

00:18:39.675 --> 00:18:40.879
It'll go down.

00:18:40.879 --> 00:18:41.379
-OK.

00:18:49.255 --> 00:18:51.226
-In watching Mike
take off, as soon

00:18:51.226 --> 00:18:54.160
as the wind picked up his
canopy and he shot out of there

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:57.295
like a slingshot,
immediately we realized

00:18:57.295 --> 00:19:00.721
this was a terrible idea.

00:19:00.721 --> 00:19:03.220
So we strapped our skins back
on, and just started trekking.

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:15.150
As the sun was setting, this
really heavy storm kicked in.

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:17.250
Immediately, we had to
start working together

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:21.435
as a team, digging
in hard and fast.

00:19:21.435 --> 00:19:23.810
The only thing we could find
was this really tiny boulder

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:25.226
that we could take
shelter behind.

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:37.830
-We've got about
three foot drift

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:40.755
in our vestibule, the
front door of our tent,

00:19:40.755 --> 00:19:42.909
that I had to dig out.

00:19:42.909 --> 00:19:44.700
The winds super high,
and we're just trying

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:50.530
to deal head down, sufferfest.

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:53.950
Just trying to survive for
than anything else right now.

00:20:02.617 --> 00:20:03.450
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:05.470
MIKE LIBECKI: The nice thing
about doing this ski tour

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:07.053
around this small
part of the mountain

00:20:07.053 --> 00:20:09.910
range, this circumnavigation,
if you will,

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:11.410
was it took us about seven days.

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:13.670
It was about 100 miles.

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:17.220
And we've been able to acclimate
and get used to the wind.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.890
And I know a couple of
the team members are like,

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:20.800
this is impossible.

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.610
There's no way we can climb
in this kind of temperature

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:25.020
and in this kind of wind.

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.249
I agreed with them.

00:20:26.249 --> 00:20:28.790
It is impossible to climb when
you're in these kind of winds,

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:30.551
because you cannot
stay warm enough.

00:20:30.551 --> 00:20:32.550
You have to be in a
sleeping bag or in a shelter

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:35.150
to actually stay warm enough.

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:36.734
But then there's
this whole thing

00:20:36.734 --> 00:20:37.900
that happens on expeditions.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:41.710
And it's like, when life
looks like Easy Street,

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:43.129
there's danger at your door.

00:20:43.129 --> 00:20:44.170
There's a lot of mystery.

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:46.240
Without mystery,
there's no adventure.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.170
And we planned to ski
around this mountain range,

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:51.590
but we couldn't even do that,
because it all just ended up

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:52.650
being that blue ice.

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:55.330
Even with full skins on
the bottom of your skis

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:58.047
for traction, for backcountry
use, even on the flats,

00:20:58.047 --> 00:20:58.880
we couldn't do that.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.660
So we ended up just having to
walk about 90+% of the way with

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:05.030
our crampons, which are
the spikes on the bottom

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:06.772
of your boots.

00:21:06.772 --> 00:21:09.252
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:21:09.252 --> 00:21:13.255
-Day three of our ski tour,
just getting ready to go

00:21:13.255 --> 00:21:16.460
see what's around the corner
on this huge, massive blue ice

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:17.810
plateau.

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:21.360
It's like being on the
coast of a frozen ocean.

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:29.210
We were all shocked to stumble
upon this Indian capsule

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:31.080
out in the middle of nowhere.

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.950
-You can see this
survival shelter

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:35.760
and this living unit
was just bowled over

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.141
by 150 mile an hours winds.

00:21:37.141 --> 00:21:37.640
Who knows?

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.000
Maybe stronger.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.440
Definitely makes you feel
a little bit vulnerable,

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.060
a fragile human out here.

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.790
We could just be
taken out at any time.

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:45.720
No doubt about it.

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:51.854
-The weather here, it's
raw, and it's brutal,

00:21:51.854 --> 00:21:53.437
and it just beats
the shit out of you.

00:22:03.916 --> 00:22:04.810
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:06.684
MIKE LIBECKI: You know,
on these expeditions,

00:22:06.684 --> 00:22:08.810
sometimes you just
gotta go for it.

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:11.970
And Keith Ladzinski, who's
doing all the videography here,

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:15.070
he had never been
on skis in his life.

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:17.630
So he'd never put on ski
boots, and it was the situation

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:19.100
where it's like, just go.

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:20.010
It'll be fine.

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:20.930
You'll work it out.

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:23.390
And of course, as some of
you know from ski boots,

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:27.435
you can get blisters really
quick if you're not used to it.

00:22:27.435 --> 00:22:29.810
So especially where we're at
now, we're out in the field,

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:32.930
this is absolutely 100%,
about self-reliance.

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:34.340
So we're on our own here.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.220
If we need a rescue,
it's not gonna

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:37.730
happen unless the
weather's perfect.

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:40.160
I mean, maybe within a week
if we need a major rescue,

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.346
we can get someone out
there, but we're on our own.

00:22:42.346 --> 00:22:43.470
This is full self-reliance.

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:46.674
Fortunately, this blister is
pretty much the worst injury

00:22:46.674 --> 00:22:47.840
that we had the entire time.

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.544
Besides some frostbite
here and there,

00:22:50.544 --> 00:22:51.960
we didn't have any
major injuries.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.830
So we left on the ski tour.

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:57.060
We were gone for a week,
just about 100 miles

00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.610
of cruising around
and looking for these,

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:01.600
basically, routes on
these towers, which we did

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:02.808
find, and I'll show you soon.

00:23:02.808 --> 00:23:06.090
But those katabatic winds,
I've made these wind walls

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:07.590
on a lot of
expeditions, and they've

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:09.150
worked every single time.

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:12.210
Well, we left our camp set up
a little bit inside the walls.

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:14.030
I'm like hey, guys,
don't worry about it.

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:16.260
Everything will be fine.

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:19.100
But these winds
proved to basically,

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.500
when life looks
like Easy Street,

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:21.450
there's danger at your door.

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:22.200
Member that again.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.580
That's gonna come
up a few times.

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:26.380
Well, here's before, and
here's what those winds

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:27.435
can do to your camp.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:32.670
Well, you'd better like
digging, because we're gonna

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:34.850
be doing a lot of digging.

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:36.510
I mentioned self-reliance.

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:39.680
We've got extra tents,
extra stoves, extra gear.

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.794
We've got it all
flagged out, where

00:23:41.794 --> 00:23:44.210
if we did get buried like this,
we were prepared for this.

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:46.290
We thought about
these things ahead.

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:49.870
Again, that 100% self-reliance
is very real out here.

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:52.684
So it was pretty interesting.

00:23:52.684 --> 00:23:53.600
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.456
-The crazy thing
is it hasn't snowed

00:23:55.456 --> 00:23:57.040
an inch since we've been here.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:01.380
That's all wind-driven snow.

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.025
-Savage dude.

00:24:02.025 --> 00:24:02.650
-Pretty savage.

00:24:06.649 --> 00:24:07.190
Look at this.

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:12.660
-Real deal, man.

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:13.500
Antarctica.

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:14.670
It's Thanksgiving.

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:17.530
We're so thankful for the
sweetness of life, man.

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:18.980
-This is Thanksgiving.

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:23.920
Instant mashed potatoes
with lots of butter.

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:24.420
-Woohoo!

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:35.300
-We dug out and we
picked up the pieces,

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:38.360
and realized we had
to find a safer base

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.620
camp, a place that
we could really

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:45.630
rely on in the worst weather
that Antarctica throws at us.

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:48.222
-Well, that one jusy has like
a perfect cooking zone with

00:24:48.222 --> 00:24:49.124
the protected--

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:55.190
-We had to move our camp
over near the tower,

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:57.790
in the rocks, where
it's much safer, where

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:01.680
we have a lot more protection
from the katabatic winds.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:06.080
-We found a great spot here
in the boulders, nestled,

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.925
living with the snow
petrels and the skuas.

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:16.000
Two beautiful spires
right above us.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.040
The hour is almost here
when we get to climb.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.460
-Happy birthday, Freddie.

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:25.626
-It's my birthday, and it's
the first pitch of the trip.

00:25:25.626 --> 00:25:27.210
-Have fun, be safe, love life.

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:27.940
-Yeah.

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:32.156
-We're up for one of the
biggest challenges of our lives,

00:25:32.156 --> 00:25:34.240
to just get up to the
top of this tower.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:38.030
It's gonna be an incredible
feat for us to all come together

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:40.281
and make it to the top.

00:25:40.281 --> 00:25:41.156
-Little rocks coming.

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:47.942
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:47.942 --> 00:25:49.900
MIKE LIBECKI: So we didn't
just start climbing.

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:52.000
Before that, we got
our camp moved over.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.330
We got hit by another several
days of wind and mayhem.

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:57.890
And it reminds me
that there's basically

00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:01.170
two different ways I see that
you experience an expedition.

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:03.810
And it correlates to
just everyday life.

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:07.960
And as an utter optimist, the
way I look at is, there's joy.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.440
We have a lot of joy in life
every day, the pursuit of joy.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.220
Well, you also have
what's called pre-joy.

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:16.040
And this is basically
when life is shitty,

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.960
and it's really f-ing cold.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.984
So I look at it as you either
have pre-joy, or you have joy.

00:26:21.984 --> 00:26:23.650
And so if you have
pre-joy, at least you

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:26.530
have the word joy in there,
and you know joy is coming.

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:29.746
But that's more
strange mentality

00:26:29.746 --> 00:26:31.870
things from being on too
many expeditions, I think.

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:33.910
If you don't have utter
optimism out there,

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:36.510
and you don't believe in what
you can do, you're gonna fail.

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:38.510
If you're not having fun
and you wanna be there,

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:39.970
you're not gonna make it.

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:43.820
So without that utter optimism
of pre-joy or joy, joy

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:45.680
it doesn't work for me.

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:47.350
But we finally did
get to our new camp.

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:49.710
As you can see, we're
starting to climb.

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:52.560
And we've just got endless
variables and constants

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:53.926
to this equation.

00:26:53.926 --> 00:26:55.300
You know, the most
important part

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:59.210
of this expedition or any
major expedition is packing.

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:01.210
So when you're back at
your garage or your home,

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:03.170
and you're putting all
this gear together,

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:05.690
if you forget that one
little tool, for example,

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:08.100
to fix your stove,
your expedition's

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:09.220
over, maybe your life.

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:11.960
So if you forget anything like
that, even the climbing gear,

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.620
here one little thing could
disrupt the entire equation

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:17.040
to that final
product of the summit

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.390
of the climb, the goal
of the expedition,

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:23.140
or just even coming home alive.

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:26.390
So we started shuttling all the
gear to the base of the wall.

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:29.290
Behind the scenes work,
days and days and days,

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:32.030
we're just carrying heavy
loads, getting up to the route.

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:36.210
And we did find a really
cool route, by the way.

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:39.552
You can see down here it's Keith
Ladzinski walking a little guy

00:27:39.552 --> 00:27:40.097
in.

00:27:40.097 --> 00:27:41.430
This is the tower that we chose.

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:43.620
This is the biggest
tower in the area.

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.640
And the beautiful thing about
this tower, as a climber,

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.470
you always want to find
these cracks on these walls.

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:50.940
OK, this is a beautiful tower.

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.480
There's hundreds
if not thousands

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.690
of these towers
around the world that

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:56.070
are just incredible like this.

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:57.770
But a lot of them
don't have cracks.

00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:00.310
Right up here there's
a crack system that

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:02.440
goes all the way up this tower.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:06.440
I mean, it's like God used to
be or is a climber in a way.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.950
I mean, a perfect crack system
that goes all the way up.

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:10.810
It was just incredible.

00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:14.530
And this is an example
of foreshortening.

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:18.290
And you can see the
top third of the tower,

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:20.720
and Freddie here is on the
first pitch of the climb

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:21.780
about halfway up.

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:25.000
So when you see things in
the Arctic or Antarctic,

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.500
like big towers
like this, you don't

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:29.450
have trees or houses or cars
or anything to compare it to.

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:31.402
Sometimes, these
walls look small.

00:28:31.402 --> 00:28:32.610
And then it looks really big.

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:35.300
Well, we realized we
have a really long way

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:37.340
to go up this tower.

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:40.730
And one of the key points here
for climbing in Antarctica,

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:42.680
especially in this area
of katabatic winds,

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.940
is good weather.

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:46.050
So we would climb
for a day or two,

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:47.940
and then we'd get three
or four days of wind

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:49.759
and be shut down
and in our tents.

00:28:49.759 --> 00:28:51.050
Well, this was a beautiful day.

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:51.580
No wind.

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:54.200
And of course we have
24 hour sunlight.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.540
This is the spring and
summer down in Antarctica.

00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:59.819
And so we'd climb for
25, 30 hours of the time,

00:28:59.819 --> 00:29:01.360
taking advantage of
the good weather,

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:04.140
because we knew that horrible
weather was coming back.

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.050
And we're fixing
our ropes anchor

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:08.940
to anchor at this point because
of the weather and the cold.

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:12.004
We don't have a choice.

00:29:12.004 --> 00:29:13.950
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:17.360
-This tower has an
amazing crack system

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.774
going from bottom to top.

00:29:20.774 --> 00:29:24.890
It's the biggest,
proudest, most formidable

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:25.985
aspect of the mountain.

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:33.850
-This is a kind of climbing that
I've never experienced before.

00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:37.790
It's a kind of rock quality
and featured face of rock

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:39.670
that I've never experienced.

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:42.330
So far it's just
been fascinating.

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:43.800
It's been really scary.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:44.300
-Heads up.

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:44.799
Rock, rock.

00:29:48.056 --> 00:29:48.555
-Whoa, dude.

00:29:48.555 --> 00:29:50.600
-What really
concerns both Libecki

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:56.750
and I is this huge
refrigerator sized deadblock

00:29:56.750 --> 00:30:00.920
about 15 feet above the belay.

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:05.670
-It really is making for a
unique, challenging climb

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:08.510
to negotiate this kind
of terrain safely.

00:30:11.604 --> 00:30:13.786
-See what a trippy
landscape this is?

00:30:13.786 --> 00:30:16.450
-Yes.

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:19.930
-It's like Doctor Seuss
rock-- sounds hollow,

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:21.530
sounds like it'll break.

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:24.590
If it does break, you're gonna
fall a long way, because it's

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:25.720
very hard to protect.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.280
There aren't a lot of cracks.

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:28.477
It's really spooky climbing.

00:30:28.477 --> 00:30:29.310
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:31.490
MIKE LIBECKI: So it was
really, really spooky,

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:32.310
to say the least.

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:35.361
It was actually incredibly
frightening to climb

00:30:35.361 --> 00:30:36.110
this kind of rock.

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:38.680
Now, I think a lot of you are
climbers, or have climbed,

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:39.940
or know about climbing.

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:42.880
If you fall on a rope, it's
really usually no big deal.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.270
I mean, this is holding 12,
13, 14,000 pounds of weight,

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:48.170
a lot of kilonewtons,
force, motion.

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:49.799
I mean, these ropes are strong.

00:30:49.799 --> 00:30:52.090
This kind of climbing was
different because of the rock

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:52.590
quality.

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:55.180
I was kind of like climbing
on big potato chips and corn

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:55.980
flakes.

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:58.880
And then of course, all the
little edges of this rock

00:30:58.880 --> 00:30:59.809
is really sharp.

00:30:59.809 --> 00:31:01.600
So you don't want to
fall and cut the rope.

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.740
And that was on the
back of our minds.

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:06.720
There weren't gonna to be
a lot of clean falls here.

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.380
The rock did get
really steep, and I'll

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:09.050
get into that in a minute.

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:10.620
And that made it a
little bit safer,

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:13.460
but the rock was so sharp
because the temperature

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:16.920
variance in Antarctica is so
intense, and the winds here.

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.950
So the surface of the rock
is just really, really crazy.

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:22.640
Again, it felt like being
on giant potato chips,

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.160
like on a giant corn flake.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.210
It was really sharp
on your fingers.

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:27.170
It was really wild.

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:30.430
Very raw, cold feeling of rock.

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:32.490
So this is Freddie
racking up here,

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:34.290
and taking a lot of weight.

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:36.420
You've got two or three
layers of clothing.

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:38.634
You've got jackets,
big jackets over it.

00:31:38.634 --> 00:31:40.242
And you've got 30,
40 pounds of gear.

00:31:40.242 --> 00:31:42.700
I mean, everything gets really
heavy really fast down here,

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:46.470
because you're
basically never warm.

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:48.410
You're just warm
enough to climb.

00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:51.335
So when we're out climbing
and out in the elements,

00:31:51.335 --> 00:31:53.210
we're just warm enough
to function and climb.

00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:55.510
The only time you're truly
warm is in your sleeping bag

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:58.020
or your tent back at base camp.

00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:00.730
But as I mentioned, the
rock got really steep.

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:02.250
So this wall was
incredibly steep,

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:05.330
and it was really beautiful,
because it got safer.

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:06.990
It was more intense,
and exposed,

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:08.910
and scary the steeper it gets.

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:11.271
But if you take a fall, it's
gonna fall out into space,

00:32:11.271 --> 00:32:13.270
and you're gonna stay
away from that rock, which

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:16.610
is pretty nice, actually.

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:19.420
And this is a shot
of me climbing here,

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:22.710
and Corey Richards is
above me, taking down

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:25.630
the shots from above to get for
the magazine and share the cool

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:27.076
ways that we do this.

00:32:27.076 --> 00:32:29.450
And at that point, it was
like, we can't do this anymore.

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:30.600
It's too dangerous.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.100
We've gotta focus on the climb.

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.240
We've gotta focus
on the objective.

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.970
And doing a lot of the rigging
and getting different camera

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:39.580
angles was just getting too
dangerous because of the wind,

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:41.100
because of the rock quality.

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:44.391
We had to focus on safety
and our goal ahead.

00:32:44.391 --> 00:32:49.170
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:50.740
-I think for every
day that we've

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:52.520
been able to
actually climb, we've

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:56.850
had two days of heavy,
strong, katabatic winds.

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:58.720
So it's been a
real challenge just

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:02.180
to continue to
progress up the wall.

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:05.630
But now we're at a point at
a really big natural ledge

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:07.190
up there.

00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:09.210
-And it's within striking
distance of the top.

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:13.060
We guess there's
maybe 800 feet to go.

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:16.880
-We're gonna move our camp up
to the high camp on the wall,

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:20.100
and try to get to the
summit from there.

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:21.940
-So life's about to change.

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:25.866
It's gonna get
pretty blue collar.

00:33:25.866 --> 00:33:27.882
Hauling our supplies
up to that ledge

00:33:27.882 --> 00:33:32.440
will take a lot of effort,
and then living up there,

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:35.912
it won't be as comfortable
as down here in the boulders.

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:41.210
-This tower is controlling us.

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:43.030
It's commanding us.

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:45.990
And it's demanding us to
bring all of our experience

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:49.680
that all of us have together,
and focus it on this route.

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:56.100
It's commanding everything that
we have to make this possible.

00:34:02.457 --> 00:34:03.957
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:34:03.957 --> 00:34:05.540
MIKE LIBECKI: So
what we've been doing

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:08.080
is we've been fixing
ropes anchor to anchor.

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:11.690
And we're about 1,600 feet, all
our ropes connected together.

00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:13.676
And this is called
capsule-style climbing.

00:34:13.676 --> 00:34:15.800
And we had to climb slow
like this, as I mentioned,

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.480
because we'd climb for a while.

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:19.590
The winds would come
in for a couple days.

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:21.909
And then we'd have to go
back down to base camp.

00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:23.679
So now we've hauled
all of our gear

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:25.124
up to the side of the wall.

00:34:25.124 --> 00:34:26.790
We're gonna live on
the side of the wall

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:28.330
until we can get to the summit.

00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:30.500
And we're living in this
port-a-ledge, this hanging

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.037
condo, so to speak.

00:34:32.037 --> 00:34:34.120
And one thing in the back
of my mind at this point

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:37.929
is, if those winds kick up
up here, that hanging condo,

00:34:37.929 --> 00:34:40.489
that port-a-ledge is gonna
turn into that ski-kite.

00:34:40.489 --> 00:34:42.139
And it's gonna be shredded.

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:45.230
So in that equation that I
talked about of an expedition,

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:47.070
sometimes you just
hope for luck,

00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:48.980
because there's nothing
else you can do.

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:50.340
So we're committed to the wall.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.048
All of our ropes are
pulled up, and we're

00:34:52.048 --> 00:34:53.889
gonna try to go to
the summit from here.

00:34:53.889 --> 00:34:56.210
Fortunately, we had
a big natural ledge.

00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:59.190
A lot of the times, you don't
get this big natural ledge

00:34:59.190 --> 00:34:59.860
to stand on.

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:02.230
And to be honest,
that made it really

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:04.977
nice for going to the bathroom.

00:35:04.977 --> 00:35:07.060
If you can imagine living
on the wall for a while,

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:09.210
you've gotta do everything
you do every day.

00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:15.400
And to be quite frank, taking
a dump up there is not easy.

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.004
But when you have
a natural ledge,

00:35:17.004 --> 00:35:18.420
it makes it way
easier than trying

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:20.740
to hang in your harness and--

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:22.260
Think about this.

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:24.640
Antarctic Treaty protocol.

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.970
We're capturing and
containing all of our feces

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:30.410
to take out with us when
we leave from Antarctica.

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:34.420
Four guys for almost two months,
that's of feces, a lot of stuff

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:35.229
to gather.

00:35:35.229 --> 00:35:37.520
And it's not easy when you're
up in the vertical world.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:42.230
But fortunately it freezes,
so it wasn't too bad.

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:44.900
So this was one of
the most intense parts

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:46.020
of the entire expedition.

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:49.300
I'm climbing up above
Freddie, and this is pushing

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:51.410
what's called A3 Plus, A4.

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:55.120
It's A Type of climbing,
because there's no cracks.

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:56.050
It's really cold.

00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:58.960
Every few feet, I'm stomping
and I'm shaking out my fingers

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.790
so I can actually feel them.

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:02.990
And I'm using hooks on the rock.

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:04.990
We can talk about this
later, after if you want.

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:08.490
But if I fall, these pieces of
gear are not gonna catch me.

00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:10.270
And I'm gonna to
go below Freddie,

00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:13.070
and smash onto the horn
that's he's sitting on.

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:16.300
So this was a really spicy
type of climbing up here.

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:19.200
And fortunately, I was
able to climb this pitch

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.040
without falling, but
it was pretty scary,

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:23.180
because if I did
fall, it could have

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:25.870
endangered the entire team,
including myself, et cetera.

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:28.640
But it was a pretty
intense time.

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:31.390
And this is what it looked like,
leaving our port-a-ledge camp.

00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:32.777
So it was really steep.

00:36:32.777 --> 00:36:34.485
And as soon as you
clipped into the rope,

00:36:34.485 --> 00:36:37.610
and you left the camp, you
swung out basically in space,

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:40.040
and you're looking a
couple thousand feet down.

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.420
You definitely did not need
coffee in the morning to wake

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:42.920
up.

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.800
You were just like,
I'm ready to go.

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.590
Because it was quite intense.

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:49.180
And you're thinking, well,
at least I was thinking,

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:51.040
OK, that rope is
coming from above.

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:54.090
If the winds kick that rope over
on a little sharp piece of rock

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:56.340
the night before,
and I'm going up

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:58.110
this rope to get
to the high point,

00:36:58.110 --> 00:36:59.620
that rope's gonna saw in half.

00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:02.630
So the way I see it,
what we are doing

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:05.440
is 100% mathematically safe.

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:07.200
You just can't make a mistake.

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:10.650
So that rope had to be placed
with directionals and rope

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:14.314
protectors, and put in an exact
place that could not move.

00:37:14.314 --> 00:37:16.105
And if we made that
mistake to not do that,

00:37:16.105 --> 00:37:18.010
that rope would have
been moved by the wind

00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:19.630
and sawed in half
as we're going up.

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:21.810
I mean, there's
endless things to think

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:25.540
about in this situation to make
it 100% mathematically safe,

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:29.514
which I have to believe
that it is, to be honest.

00:37:29.514 --> 00:37:31.900
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:39.670
-Snow, sun, snow, sun, that's
about what we're dealing with.

00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:44.180
-For how serious and savage
an environment it is,

00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:48.950
there is an equivalent
beauty just looking out

00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:55.270
on this landscape of hundreds
of mountains that are unclimbed.

00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:56.600
It never gets dark.

00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:01.620
The mountains are just
24 hour a day sundials,

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:05.980
and the sun's just
spinning around them.

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:09.010
And there are
these snow petrels,

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:12.040
about the only living
life down here, that

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:16.550
just come in and hover,
and float in on updrafts

00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:18.380
around the tower.

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:20.890
I think they're pretty
surprised to see us.

00:38:24.299 --> 00:38:26.069
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:38:26.069 --> 00:38:27.860
MIKE LIBECKI: It's
really wonderful to work

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:30.675
with people like Keith
Ladzinski or Corey Richards who

00:38:30.675 --> 00:38:33.520
are capturing this, and
having a team follow along

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:34.620
to document the journey.

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:36.747
I mean, those are some
of my favorite parts,

00:38:36.747 --> 00:38:37.830
seeing those snow petrels.

00:38:37.830 --> 00:38:39.780
I mean, they were so beautiful.

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:42.790
This is a good example of
what the rock was like.

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:43.410
You can see.

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:45.460
We're on smaller screens
here, but Freddie's

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:47.860
down here in the
green belaying me,

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:50.040
and I'm up here in
the red in this crack.

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.390
That's about 100 feet.

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:53.266
So that's about half a pitch.

00:38:53.266 --> 00:38:54.890
And if you look at
the size of Freddie,

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:55.890
you can barely see him.

00:38:55.890 --> 00:38:57.680
And look at the skyline here.

00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:01.020
You can see those potato chips
and this corn flakes of rock.

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:05.210
It really was just the wildest
rock I've ever been on.

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:07.840
And so this part
where we're at here,

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.840
we're just about halfway
up this tower right there

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:13.380
for some perspective.

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:16.090
Now, as we're getting
up closer to the summit,

00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:18.610
we're getting pretty excited,
because, OK, we might make it.

00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:21.111
The wind has been working
with us a little bit.

00:39:21.111 --> 00:39:22.610
We might just make
it to the summit.

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:24.690
If we get hit by a
crazy storm, we're

00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:26.080
probably gonna have to go down.

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:29.190
So we're thinking, OK, if we can
get up in the next day or two

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:30.810
without any wind, we're cool.

00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:34.020
But as we're getting up, the
angle of the rock kicks back.

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:37.060
And we're pulling
off 100 of flakes,

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:38.269
and it gets really dangerous.

00:39:38.269 --> 00:39:39.893
So if you pull off
those rocks, they're

00:39:39.893 --> 00:39:42.370
gonna go down on your partners
below, and kill them or cut

00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:43.260
ropes.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:45.260
So as we're getting
up, I'm like, OK, guys.

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:46.890
We can't continue on this route.

00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:50.420
Because so much rock is coming
off someone's gonna die.

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:52.580
And so we're either
going down, or we're

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:56.060
gonna cut off and traverse,
and then try to it another way.

00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:58.092
So fortunately, I
found some moves,

00:39:58.092 --> 00:39:59.550
and we cut off to
the right, and we

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:01.600
were able to get
to the right ridge,

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:04.042
and eventually
get to the summit.

00:40:04.042 --> 00:40:05.750
It's kind of hard to
see here, but here's

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:08.050
Corey, Freddie, and myself.

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:11.846
We cut off right, and then
made route to the right ridge.

00:40:11.846 --> 00:40:13.672
And that was really
fortunate for us,

00:40:13.672 --> 00:40:15.880
because I don't think we
could've continued on had we

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:18.728
not started traversing out.

00:40:18.728 --> 00:40:20.840
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:24.770
-Climbing the wall was an
extreme technical challenge.

00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:29.905
It required a lot of gear, a
lot of time, a lot of effort.

00:40:29.905 --> 00:40:31.280
-It was really
enjoyable climbing

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:36.210
on these big handholds, and
these big caves, and wacos,

00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:40.930
and climbing through this
jungle gym kind of rock.

00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:42.840
-You can easily give
it the standard ratings

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.465
throughout climbing
and mountaineering,

00:40:44.465 --> 00:40:46.810
but it goes above
and beyond that.

00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:50.480
It's mystery, because
it's a first ascent.

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:54.462
we climbed the steepest,
proudest line on the tower.

00:40:54.462 --> 00:40:55.295
No doubt in my mind.

00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:03.870
-Yeah.

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:05.360
-Sick.

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:07.900
-Hell yeah!

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:08.880
-Yo, yo, yo.

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:09.860
We're on the summit.

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:13.750
We're loving life,
and we're psyched.

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:15.952
We're in Antarctica,
and it kind of

00:41:15.952 --> 00:41:18.410
feels like standing upside down
on the bottom of the Earth.

00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:20.338
Awesome trip.

00:41:20.338 --> 00:41:21.292
Life is sweet.

00:41:21.292 --> 00:41:23.654
The time is now, and we're
hoping for a safe descent.

00:41:23.654 --> 00:41:24.154
Over.

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:29.630
-Getting to the top,
it was a relief,

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:33.930
because I didn't wanna see
that all that time and effort

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:39.510
that we had invested in the
line and not be successful.

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:40.507
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:41:40.507 --> 00:41:42.840
MIKE LIBECKI: So fortunately,
we did make it to the top.

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.590
It was really a
wonderful feeling

00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:46.140
to be up there
with your friends.

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:47.452
Now, Keith is not with us.

00:41:47.452 --> 00:41:48.910
Keith didn't go to
the top with us.

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:50.784
He stayed on the ground
to get all the ground

00:41:50.784 --> 00:41:52.660
shots, both photo and video.

00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:56.370
And so a big shout out to Keith
for staying down on the ground,

00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:58.120
because I know he
wanted to go up with us,

00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:00.280
but we all had a
different role there

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:02.739
that we were playing as
this expedition team,

00:42:02.739 --> 00:42:04.155
especially for
National Geographic

00:42:04.155 --> 00:42:07.060
to come back and bring this
story home in the best way

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:08.640
possible.

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:12.306
This is a little shout
out to Corey here.

00:42:12.306 --> 00:42:13.930
Basically, I went
down there with Cory,

00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:15.120
we had never met each other.

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:18.130
We met for the first time
in Capetown, South Africa.

00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:18.890
I'd known Keith.

00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:19.640
I'd known Freddie.

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:22.070
But when you go down on
expedition like this,

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:25.120
you don't know each other,
you can be chasing each other

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:28.210
with ice axes trying to kill
each other and be pissed off,

00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:30.970
or you can fall in love and
make new friends for a lifetime.

00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:32.820
Because going on
an expedition like

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:36.410
this really is like a short
term marriage, or even closer.

00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:39.400
The trust and the bonds
that you make out there

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:42.220
are so special it's
even hard to describe.

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:43.770
I mean, you take
them with the rest

00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:45.080
of your life with those bonds.

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:48.210
And basically because
Corey is like, here you go.

00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:49.530
Here's my life.

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:52.040
I'm trusting you with my
life on this entire trip.

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:54.400
And then vice versa, I'm
giving my life to him.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.400
He's giving his to
me, the whole team.

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:58.840
If I make a mistake,
that could cost his life.

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:00.970
And so it's pretty
intense out there.

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:03.350
And Corey's up there,
following us up the wall

00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:04.690
with this camera.

00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:07.830
And he's the last guy coming up
with all the rocks coming down.

00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:11.520
And so just at the
big shout out to him.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:15.846
There's three rules
of an expedition.

00:43:15.846 --> 00:43:17.720
And you go with friends,
you go with friends,

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:18.589
you go with friends.

00:43:18.589 --> 00:43:19.880
And it's always been like that.

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:22.700
So it was nice to step
out of those rules

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.772
and make a new friend,
and share those bonds

00:43:24.772 --> 00:43:25.980
with someone you didn't know.

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:29.820
It was another part
of the expedition.

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:32.320
This is up on the summit, and
of course, Corey's like, yeah,

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:32.790
we're up there.

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:33.310
Right on.

00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:36.454
And Freddie and I are
thinking, this is really cool.

00:43:36.454 --> 00:43:38.620
It's been about 20 minutes,
but we've gotta go down.

00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:41.387
And we're thinking about that
loose rock, the sharp rock.

00:43:41.387 --> 00:43:42.970
We're gonna rappel
down the same route

00:43:42.970 --> 00:43:44.910
that we climbed to get down.

00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:47.520
So it's pretty intense up there.

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:49.410
I, of course, always
have my mask with me.

00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:52.910
This was Year of the Dragon, so
the proper Chinese lunar year,

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:55.417
Chinese zodiac yeah, however
you wanna explain it,

00:43:55.417 --> 00:43:57.250
but I always bring that
year's mask with me,

00:43:57.250 --> 00:44:00.440
and it's just a fun way
to honestly just remind

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:04.090
myself and hopefully others that
don't take life too seriously.

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:05.670
And let's all not grow up.

00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:08.160
Let's all keep our childhood
in us, and have some fun,

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:09.610
and laugh.

00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:13.000
And really, just don't
take life too seriously,

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.700
and have some fun
with it, and enjoy it.

00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:16.590
I mean, that's really
one of the things we

00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:17.990
get to do on these expeditions.

00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:21.047
It's sort of be like a
professional kid or something.

00:44:21.047 --> 00:44:23.130
Really go out there and
live in the moment of now,

00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:24.400
and celebrate life.

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:28.200
It's quite fascinating, and I
just can't get enough of it.

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:31.521
This is a 360 degree view of
the summit that Corey took.

00:44:31.521 --> 00:44:33.020
It's just a beautiful
time up there.

00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:36.230
And I talked about that wind.

00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:37.290
We got lucky.

00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:40.079
We have good weather for
the last several days.

00:44:40.079 --> 00:44:41.495
And we haven't got
hit by a storm,

00:44:41.495 --> 00:44:43.619
so we're kind of like, OK,
let's not push our luck.

00:44:43.619 --> 00:44:44.300
Let's get down.

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:45.656
Let's get out of here.

00:44:45.656 --> 00:44:47.640
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:49.490
-You get to the top,
and you're so excited,

00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:50.915
but you know you're halfway.

00:44:50.915 --> 00:44:54.850
The summit's on the ground.

00:44:54.850 --> 00:44:57.280
-We're packing up the air pig.

00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:58.460
-The airpig.

00:44:58.460 --> 00:44:59.810
Explain the air pig.

00:44:59.810 --> 00:45:03.510
-Well, there are pigs
built for hauling

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:06.790
and pigs built for airing.

00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:13.580
This little piggy's gonna go
wee-wee-wee all the way down.

00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:17.620
-One, two, three!

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:31.080
-Dude, that was a
great toss, man.

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:33.785
Like, the bag had a
big rip in it already.

00:45:33.785 --> 00:45:37.128
-It was the perfect
soldier for it, huh?

00:45:37.128 --> 00:45:38.520
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:41.470
MIKE LIBECKI: So I work with
a lot of outdoor companies,

00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:42.890
and I have for a long time.

00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:45.340
And that's some pretty good
product testing right there

00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:46.270
in such a way.

00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:49.100
We just threw down some
of the trash and stuff

00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:51.305
that it didn't
matter if it broke.

00:45:51.305 --> 00:45:53.402
I mean, we took down all
of our climbing gear,

00:45:53.402 --> 00:45:55.610
and all of the stuff that
was valuable and breakable,

00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:57.790
we took it down with us.

00:45:57.790 --> 00:45:59.970
And so we got back
down on the ground,

00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:03.530
and just a few hours later,
we'd had that great weather

00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:04.450
without the wind.

00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:07.490
And as soon as we got down,
got back down to base camp,

00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:11.820
it was kind of cool, because
we got nailed by a crazy storm.

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:14.349
And we're getting comfortable,
thinking oh, we made it.

00:46:14.349 --> 00:46:15.140
We made the summit.

00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:16.681
We're gonna be able
to get picked up.

00:46:16.681 --> 00:46:18.024
The plane's gonna come out.

00:46:18.024 --> 00:46:19.690
And then these winds
started kicking up,

00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:21.710
and we're thinking,
gosh, if this goes on,

00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:23.251
who knows how long
it's gonna go for?

00:46:23.251 --> 00:46:25.571
Hopefully the planes can
come down and pick us up.

00:46:25.571 --> 00:46:32.165
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:46:32.165 --> 00:46:34.025
-Looks like it could
get real today.

00:46:34.025 --> 00:46:39.475
Snow, wind, and
katabatic mayhem.

00:46:39.475 --> 00:46:41.391
Trying to save the penguin pig.

00:46:41.391 --> 00:46:44.270
-Yeah, save the penguins.

00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:46.750
-What a ridiculous scene.

00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:48.750
-It's horrible.

00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:50.230
-It's cold.

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.913
It's windy.

00:46:50.913 --> 00:46:51.820
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:52.610
MIKE LIBECKI: A quick note.

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:55.234
If this wind would have hit us,
if this storm would have hit us

00:46:55.234 --> 00:46:57.840
on the wall, I'm
just gonna say, quite

00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:00.570
frankly, we would've
been fucked.

00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:01.880
And that's an appropriate word.

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:04.580
We would've been hating life.

00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:06.834
And again, that luck, that
part of the equation was--

00:47:06.834 --> 00:47:07.750
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:09.291
-It'll kill you in
a matter of hours.

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:14.533
-The wind has not stopped.

00:47:18.970 --> 00:47:19.845
-Katabatic winds, yo.

00:47:19.845 --> 00:47:20.969
It's getting real out here.

00:47:20.969 --> 00:47:22.370
Freddie's tent
just got shredded.

00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:23.984
He jumped into Corey's.

00:47:23.984 --> 00:47:25.150
Man, it's getting real deal.

00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:42.942
-We've been pretty
much tentbound

00:47:42.942 --> 00:47:46.625
for going on four days
because of the winds.

00:47:46.625 --> 00:47:48.946
-We hope we get picked
up for Christmas.

00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:54.670
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:58.300
MIKE LIBECKI: So this expedition
was an incredible experience,

00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:00.850
mainly because of the times that
we had out there as friends.

00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:03.715
And the second best
part of any expedition

00:48:03.715 --> 00:48:05.340
is being able to come
back and share it

00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:08.200
with your friends, your family,
with people like yourselves,

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:10.940
and just know that magic, and
power, and beauty out there

00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:13.680
that maybe not a lot of
people want to go experience,

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:15.160
or don't have the
opportunity to,

00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:17.210
but want to see
what's out there.

00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:20.700
And for me, it's an opportunity
to hopefully inspire people

00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:24.010
just to get outside, maybe
inspire people to care more

00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:26.810
about the planet, and start
thinking not only about caring

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:29.350
about the planet, but what are
the solutions for the planet

00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:31.960
and the people around the
world, especially speaking

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:34.210
with and through
National Geographic that

00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:36.640
made this trip possible.

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.840
It's been a very
selfish lifestyle of,

00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:40.570
if you're gonna be a
doctor, or a lawyer,

00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:43.390
or whatever, you immerse
yourself into that.

00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:45.140
You take your passion
very seriously,

00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:48.390
and you really immerse yourself
into what you're doing.

00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:50.972
And hopefully, we can
start sharing these stories

00:48:50.972 --> 00:48:52.930
on different levels and
get people more excited

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:55.740
about what's going on the
planet, on a local level,

00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:58.010
on a global level, not just
the environment but also

00:48:58.010 --> 00:49:02.090
the people around the world
that we can connect with.

00:49:02.090 --> 00:49:05.882
For me, this was the
biggest trip of my life,

00:49:05.882 --> 00:49:07.340
and one of the
biggest trips that I

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:10.610
could do in today's day and age
for exploration and climbing.

00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:15.160
Yet, by the end of this trip,
it was like another training

00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:16.794
session for the next one.

00:49:16.794 --> 00:49:19.210
And all of these expeditions
become training for the next,

00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:20.334
and the next, and the next.

00:49:20.334 --> 00:49:22.260
And it really is an
obsession and addiction

00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:25.242
to go out and explore
these areas and climb.

00:49:25.242 --> 00:49:26.700
And one of the
things I really want

00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:29.260
to note on, aside
from we're really

00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:31.930
trying to inspire people to
just care about the planet more,

00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:33.950
and to get out outside
more, and put down

00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:37.070
your screens and your
phones, and just get out

00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:38.452
in the moment of now and nature.

00:49:38.452 --> 00:49:40.660
Because that's what it does
for me, when I'm outside,

00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:42.410
and in nature, and
in remote places,

00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:44.610
it really is that moment of now.

00:49:44.610 --> 00:49:48.840
This tower here that we climbed,
this is the route that goes up.

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:50.840
And then we cut across,
and that was the summit.

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:52.820
This was a really special
expedition for me,

00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:55.050
because I made a
decision to leave

00:49:55.050 --> 00:49:58.320
college, my first year of
college, and climb full time.

00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:00.317
And it was a really
big deal for my family.

00:50:00.317 --> 00:50:02.150
What do you mean you're
gonna leave college?

00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:03.570
All I can think
about is climbing.

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:04.660
I just wanna climb.

00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:05.930
I moved into my truck.

00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:08.090
I was climbing 300 days a year.

00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:10.970
The one main supporter that
I had for this decision

00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:12.362
was my grandmother.

00:50:12.362 --> 00:50:14.570
And I went over, and I said,
all I wanna do is climb.

00:50:14.570 --> 00:50:16.470
I wanna move to
Yosemite National Park.

00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:19.700
I grew up in Fresno, Clovis,
with some friends here.

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:23.500
And so Yosemite, the center of
the universe, is right near us,

00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:24.910
and I started climbing.

00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:26.070
So I moved to Yosemite.

00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:26.780
I left college.

00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:28.160
I was living in my truck.

00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.340
But my grandmother,
she sat me down.

00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:32.240
She poured a couple
glasses of whisky.

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:34.260
She got really excited.

00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:36.660
And she said, god damn it,
Michael, you need to go climb.

00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:37.950
You need to live your life.

00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:39.410
And she didn't get
to go to school.

00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:41.450
She had nine
brothers and sisters,

00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:42.740
and she worked on a farm.

00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:44.948
And if they didn't work on
the farm, they didn't eat.

00:50:44.948 --> 00:50:47.550
So for a long time,
she was so supportive.

00:50:47.550 --> 00:50:50.620
And I kind of felt like I
was living some of her dreams

00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:51.390
through my life.

00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:54.720
And any time I got home
from an expedition,

00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:57.720
I went right to her house,
and she'd make BLTs.

00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:00.740
And I grew up with her, and
we had this strong connection.

00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:04.280
Well, just before leaving
on this trip to Antarctica,

00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:05.050
she passed away.

00:51:05.050 --> 00:51:08.105
And it was a big deal for me,
and our family, and everyone.

00:51:08.105 --> 00:51:09.430
And it was so close.

00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:11.700
And so in the
climbing world, you

00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:14.360
get to name the mountains you
climb if it's a first ascent.

00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:17.030
So we got to name this
tower Bertha's Tower

00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.970
after my grandmother.

00:51:17.970 --> 00:51:20.840
And it was just a very
special honor for her,

00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:23.610
that 20 years later,
her encouragement

00:51:23.610 --> 00:51:26.240
to go out and pursue
my passion and she'd

00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:30.820
passed away right before this,
and to honor her on this climb,

00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:32.740
on this expedition,
her life, and that's

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:34.010
one of the things I
wanted to share with you,

00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:35.910
just how powerful
these expeditions are.

00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:38.700
And I think with that,
thanks for watching.

00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:40.950
And I appreciate your
guys attention today.

00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:43.211
So

00:51:43.211 --> 00:51:45.596
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:46.842 --> 00:51:47.800
AUDIENCE: Thanks, Mike.

00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:48.700
Man, that was awesome.

00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:49.180
MIKE LIBECKI: Cool.

00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:49.550
Thanks, man.

00:51:49.550 --> 00:51:50.841
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

00:51:50.841 --> 00:51:53.494
That was just beyond what
I expected to come today.

00:51:53.494 --> 00:51:54.410
MIKE LIBECKI: Awesome.

00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:55.435
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
sharing about your grandmother.

00:51:55.435 --> 00:51:57.240
It was very touching.

00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:59.570
You mentioned the winds
when they kick up.

00:51:59.570 --> 00:52:01.430
And when you're
up on the mountain

00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:04.390
that you're in big
trouble, basically.

00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:09.140
So what's that process in your
mind, where you say, that's

00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:12.840
an uncontrolled variable, and
you just decide to go for it?

00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:17.030
Knowing that if it kicks up and
you have no control over that,

00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:19.070
what are you gonna do?

00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:20.720
I'm just interested
in your mindset.

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:23.152
How do you get past that?

00:52:23.152 --> 00:52:25.610
MIKE LIBECKI: This is a very
unique situation for the wind.

00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:27.568
I've been on a lot of
trips with a lot of wind,

00:52:27.568 --> 00:52:29.280
but this one was
completely unique.

00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:32.470
We knew that 60, 70,
80, 90, 100 mile an hour

00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:35.800
winds could come in and
freeze you pretty quick.

00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:38.094
And so it was like
I said, the luck.

00:52:38.094 --> 00:52:40.260
We were up on the wall, and
we're like, here we are.

00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:40.970
Let's go for it.

00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:43.815
Sometimes, you're just all
in, and you have to go for it.

00:52:43.815 --> 00:52:47.300
And honestly, that
mystery is the adventure.

00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:49.860
That not knowing and
not understanding

00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:51.970
what's gonna happen next
is part of the drive,

00:52:51.970 --> 00:52:54.530
part of the obsession
of doing this stuff.

00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:56.366
And so if it was a
controlled environment,

00:52:56.366 --> 00:52:57.990
and there was no
mystery, I don't think

00:52:57.990 --> 00:52:59.281
that I would have any interest.

00:52:59.281 --> 00:53:02.369
So every trip, every time,
going up on that wall,

00:53:02.369 --> 00:53:04.910
knowing these winds could come
in, that mystery is the drive.

00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:07.530
But it also connects to fear.

00:53:07.530 --> 00:53:10.471
And fear is a wonderful
emotion, feeling, powerful thing

00:53:10.471 --> 00:53:11.470
that you can experience.

00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:15.200
And it's a tool to keep us safe,
because if we're not scared up

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:17.200
they're thinking about
it, we're probably

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:19.050
gonna get in a situation.

00:53:19.050 --> 00:53:21.910
So having that fear also keeps
you safe in the same respect,

00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:23.135
that we're prepared.

00:53:23.135 --> 00:53:25.260
OK, you guys, what are we
gonna do if this happens?

00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:26.740
If the winds kick up,
here's what we're gonna do.

00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:28.514
Here's our Plan
A, Plan B, Plan C.

00:53:28.514 --> 00:53:29.930
We're thinking
about this, talking

00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:31.410
about it the whole time.

00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:33.430
And I guess
communication is really

00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:36.430
what saves us if that wind
comes up, that we're talking

00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:37.514
about what's gonna happen.

00:53:37.514 --> 00:53:39.721
What's gonna happen if this
happens and this happens?

00:53:39.721 --> 00:53:42.360
if I do fall and someone breaks
a leg, what are we gonna do?

00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:46.700
If the wind comes up,
here's what we're gonna do.

00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:48.760
I hope that answers
the question.

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:51.530
It's a great one, because
it's intense, and it's scary.

00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:53.260
But that wind
equals hypothermia.

00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:56.140
So if it comes in, we're
gonna freeze really quick.

00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:57.890
And sometimes you're
starting to get cold.

00:53:57.890 --> 00:54:00.820
You have to predict
hypothermia before it happens,

00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:02.700
because then you
can't move your hands

00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:04.680
and put yourself on
rappel and get down.

00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:05.720
So hey, guys.

00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:07.050
It's getting really cold.

00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:08.950
Let's get down now back
into our port-a-ledge

00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:13.020
and get safe, because I
can barely move my fingers.

00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:14.804
So without living
in the now, you

00:54:14.804 --> 00:54:17.220
have to think about what's
gonna happen next a little bit.

00:54:19.755 --> 00:54:21.380
AUDIENCE: Hi, I had
a couple questions.

00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:23.220
One is how did you get around?

00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:25.410
Are there good maps
of all these places?

00:54:25.410 --> 00:54:27.090
And do you have GPS?

00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:29.820
MIKE LIBECKI: There are some
good maps, Norwegian maps

00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:30.860
made of the area.

00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:34.535
Norway actually claims to
own this area in Antarctica,

00:54:34.535 --> 00:54:36.570
but no one really
does officially.

00:54:36.570 --> 00:54:38.740
So it's a world continent.

00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:40.890
But there are some
good Norwegian maps

00:54:40.890 --> 00:54:42.880
that helped incredibly well.

00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:46.990
AUDIENCE: Was just curious
it about belaying was.

00:54:46.990 --> 00:54:48.740
It's one thing to be
climbing and moving,

00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:52.949
but to be at the back
of the anchor belaying,

00:54:52.949 --> 00:54:53.740
I'm sure that was--

00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:55.030
MIKE LIBECKI: That's a
great question, so asking

00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:56.390
about how the belays were.

00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:58.762
And to be totally honest,
when we're climbing up there,

00:54:58.762 --> 00:55:00.220
and we're up in
the vertical world,

00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:03.240
we're outside of our tents,
outside of our port-a-ledge,

00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:04.967
the belayer is the
one who suffers.

00:55:04.967 --> 00:55:07.050
Because you're sitting
there, and you're freezing.

00:55:07.050 --> 00:55:09.260
And you're kicking your feet,
and you're moving your arms.

00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:11.782
I mean, you're literally kicking
your feet the whole time,

00:55:11.782 --> 00:55:13.490
and moving your arms,
and doing all this.

00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:16.464
And the other guy's bringing
up a thermos of hot chocolate

00:55:16.464 --> 00:55:17.880
so you can drink
it and stay warm.

00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:20.660
I mean, it's a constant
battle to not freeze.

00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:23.755
The climber, the leader, is
moving, and staying warm,

00:55:23.755 --> 00:55:24.380
and generating.

00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:26.490
That engine is running
and staying hot.

00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:28.590
And so that's a great question.

00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:31.510
The belayer is the one who
suffers because of the cold,

00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:34.130
and also because of the
loose rock coming down.

00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:36.279
And you're yelling,
rock, a lot of times,

00:55:36.279 --> 00:55:38.070
and there's rock coming
all over the place.

00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:39.990
And it's another luck factor.

00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:41.860
No one got by any
of the big rocks.

00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:43.110
None of the ropes got cut.

00:55:43.110 --> 00:55:46.140
And sometimes, you
just hope for the best.

00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:50.240
And I did mention, it's
100% mathematically safe.

00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:52.890
I believe that, because we
made the right decisions,

00:55:52.890 --> 00:55:56.320
and everything worked out.

00:55:56.320 --> 00:56:00.490
So you could get me talking
all day about this stuff.

00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:03.160
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
that you started your career

00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:05.530
from climbing.

00:56:05.530 --> 00:56:07.760
You left your college
and started to climb.

00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:10.970
But how did you
turn from climbing

00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:15.700
to traveling to exploring?

00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:18.140
MIKE LIBECKI: So I ended
up moving to Yosemite,

00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:19.260
and climbing there a lot.

00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:23.390
And I really immersed myself
in the passion of climbing.

00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:26.890
And living in Yosemite and
doing all different kinds

00:56:26.890 --> 00:56:30.030
of climbing, I started
thinking, oh, I

00:56:30.030 --> 00:56:32.780
wanna go to where
no one's climbed.

00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:36.070
I think in human nature, we're
all explorers in some degree.

00:56:36.070 --> 00:56:37.410
We all want to find the unknown.

00:56:37.410 --> 00:56:39.950
We all want to do something
different for ourselves.

00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:43.950
And I think the best way to
explain it is organic passion.

00:56:43.950 --> 00:56:46.970
I don't know how I got
excited about doing it,

00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:48.470
but I started doing
climbs that were

00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:51.390
more remote in the Sierras,
in the backcountry,

00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:54.065
and then finding out about
these walls and towers that

00:56:54.065 --> 00:56:55.880
were around the world.

00:56:55.880 --> 00:56:58.490
After my first trip to
Baffin Island, which

00:56:58.490 --> 00:57:00.160
is up in the northern
Canadian Arctic,

00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:02.472
and climbing these kinds of
walls for the first time,

00:57:02.472 --> 00:57:03.930
where no one's ever
been to before,

00:57:03.930 --> 00:57:06.806
it was like sticking
the needle in.

00:57:06.806 --> 00:57:08.680
It was just like, I
can't get enough of this.

00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:09.924
I was addicted to it.

00:57:09.924 --> 00:57:12.340
I just wanted to go on these
trips, and I wanted to climb.

00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:14.360
And it became this obsession.

00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:18.450
And then I think following
that true passion turned into,

00:57:18.450 --> 00:57:20.340
oh, I could write
stories about this,

00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:23.720
and I can sell photos
to outdoor companies,

00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:27.360
and there's a way to generate
a living around this passion.

00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:30.760
And that was 20 plus years ago.

00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:34.240
And so it really is a huge shout
out to the outdoor industry,

00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:36.640
and to all the people involved
in making the products,

00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:39.135
and the people that
enjoy recreation who

00:57:39.135 --> 00:57:40.450
are buying all these products.

00:57:40.450 --> 00:57:43.590
I mean, it's a big full
circle of the outdoor world

00:57:43.590 --> 00:57:46.010
that we're all connected in.

00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:49.090
And it's a great honor to be
able to do this for a living,

00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:50.070
but also for a passion.

00:57:50.070 --> 00:57:52.800
But it's because of the
countless people involved

00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:55.550
that really make it happen.

00:57:55.550 --> 00:57:57.300
AUDIENCE: I hope this
isn't too sensitive,

00:57:57.300 --> 00:58:01.010
but how much does an
expedition like this cost?

00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:03.910
MIKE LIBECKI: Well, I'll give
you a few details about this.

00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:06.510
So, for example, I won't
go into to all the details

00:58:06.510 --> 00:58:09.360
of what we spent,
but to get the plane

00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:11.110
ride down from
Capetown to Antarctica,

00:58:11.110 --> 00:58:14.340
that's $25,000 per person,
just for that flight.

00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:17.140
The charter flight
from the Russian base

00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:21.240
out to the mountains
was about $88,000.

00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:23.220
That's just the flights alone.

00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:24.860
That's not from
the US to Capetown.

00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:27.380
That's not any of
the freight charges.

00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:29.820
I mean, we had a
lot of equipment.

00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:30.510
It

00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:34.550
This is a very unique
trip in so many ways,

00:58:34.550 --> 00:58:36.280
including how much it costs.

00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:38.390
So I'm gonna come
back right and say it.

00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:40.375
Without the support
of the amazing people

00:58:40.375 --> 00:58:44.919
at National Geographic, this
kind of stuff doesn't happen.

00:58:44.919 --> 00:58:47.210
I mean, we're just honored
to be able to have done this

00:58:47.210 --> 00:58:48.840
and share this, but
it gets expensive.

00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:50.715
But not all the trips
are even close to that,

00:58:50.715 --> 00:58:52.452
but this one is
very, very unique.

00:58:52.452 --> 00:58:53.910
AUDIENCE: A question,
you mentioned

00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:56.860
at the start of your talk
about being a father.

00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:59.930
So when you were
out there, what's

00:58:59.930 --> 00:59:02.947
that like being away
from your daughter?

00:59:02.947 --> 00:59:04.530
MIKE LIBECKI: I'll
talk to my daughter

00:59:04.530 --> 00:59:06.280
about this, because
it's been interesting.

00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:08.610
She's grown up with a
dad who is adventuring

00:59:08.610 --> 00:59:09.970
and gone quite a lot.

00:59:09.970 --> 00:59:13.530
And I've talked to her that
anything worth doing is gonna

00:59:13.530 --> 00:59:15.320
have compromise and sacrifice.

00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:16.910
And part of that
for what I'm doing

00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:19.300
is I've gotta leave sometimes.

00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:23.550
But on a cool note on that,
she is also becoming a traveler

00:59:23.550 --> 00:59:26.610
and adventurer herself,
and it's pretty exciting.

00:59:26.610 --> 00:59:29.320
But her mother is
amazing, and she's

00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:30.470
been incredibly supportive.

00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:33.909
Without the support of family
and friends, none of this stuff

00:59:33.909 --> 00:59:34.450
could happen.

00:59:34.450 --> 00:59:37.140
So it's not just me or
us up on these trips.

00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:39.820
It's a whole, entire
group of people, hundreds

00:59:39.820 --> 00:59:41.260
of people, that make it happen.

00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:43.740
And I just wanna make that
clear how much I appreciate

00:59:43.740 --> 00:59:47.180
that it just doesn't happen
without all the help of tons

00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:48.470
of people.

00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:52.680
But it's been tough as a dad,
having to leave and come back.

00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:55.760
But one of the cool things that
I'll bring up, my daughter,

00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:57.760
she's 12 years old.

00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:59.760
She just went to her
seventh continent with me

00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:02.380
this last summer in Africa.

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:04.550
She's been to 15
countries, and now she

01:00:04.550 --> 01:00:07.910
wants to start doing these
expeditions as a humanitarian.

01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:10.280
And she's saying, I
wanna do these trips,

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:12.597
and I wanna come up with
solutions for things

01:00:12.597 --> 01:00:14.430
that we can better on
our planet and people.

01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:17.530
So it's really exciting to
see her grabbing onto what

01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:18.470
she's seen growing up.

01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:19.820
It's really cool.

01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:20.550
ABJAD: Great.

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:24.260
Thanks again, Mike, for coming
out and spending time with us.

01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:26.640
And we'll get you to come
back maybe every year

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:30.504
with some new tales and new
stories over here at Google.

01:00:30.504 --> 01:00:32.170
So thanks everyone
for joining us today.

01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:33.086
MIKE LIBECKI: Awesome.

01:00:33.086 --> 01:00:35.520
[APPLAUSE]
