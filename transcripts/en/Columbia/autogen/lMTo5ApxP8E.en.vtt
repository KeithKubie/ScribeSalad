do is this dude is to show how data

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039
do is this dude is to show how data
 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:57.670
do is this dude is to show how data
could be utilized and statistical

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680
could be utilized and statistical

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.640
variable Y relevant the politics are
irrelevant to anything that they might

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650
irrelevant to anything that they might
 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.530

so it's the motivational part and then

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610
so it's the motivational part and then
 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.280
so it's the motivational part and then
also a big part of this sort of

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290
also a big part of this sort of
 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.630
also a big part of this sort of

is is doable and as they start doing it

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240
is is doable and as they start doing it
 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.350
is is doable and as they start doing it
they kind of build confidence and the

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360
they kind of build confidence and the
 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.240
they kind of build confidence and the
proof it you know the proof of how well

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250
proof it you know the proof of how well
 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.740
proof it you know the proof of how well
I'm doing is to what extent the students

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750
I'm doing is to what extent the students

courses
 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.150
courses
often take both courses and then the big

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160
often take both courses and then the big
 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.209
often take both courses and then the big
question is will they do any more
