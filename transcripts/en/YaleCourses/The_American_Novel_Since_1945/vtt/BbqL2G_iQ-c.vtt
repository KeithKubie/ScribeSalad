1
00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.180
Now what's coming up?
Um,
as I mentioned last week,
on Wednesday,

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.100
I'm going to give my censorship lecture.
And in preparation for that,

3
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.170
I would like you to go to a local bookstore,
anyone,

4
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.720
and just observe how it's laid out,
what you see.

5
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.240
Uh,
what's you,
what your attention is called to,

6
00:00:23.241 --> 00:00:27.830
what your attention is not called to.
And here's a difficult question,

7
00:00:27.831 --> 00:00:32.750
what isn't there.
Think about that and,

8
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.470
and I'll talk a little bit about what isn't there on Wednesday.

9
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.620
Also,
in order to keep up,
please try to read at least two,

10
00:00:42.621 --> 00:00:45.170
page 202,
that's the next chapter,

11
00:00:45.171 --> 00:00:49.820
division in the human stain so that you're on track to finish it.

12
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.620
It's 361 pages for next Monday.
And so next Monday,

13
00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:58.490
a week from today,
I will give my second lecture on the human stain.

14
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.940
Now I will talk about the human stain a little bit on Wednesday because some of

15
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.590
what I have to say about censorship does pertain.
So that's what's coming up.

16
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.073
<v 1>Okay.</v>

17
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.920
<v 0>I hope you all thought about the identity plot as you read this novel.</v>

18
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.040
It's hard not to.
Um,
when I gave that lecture,

19
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.130
I suggested that when a genre gains a certain credence,

20
00:01:27.711 --> 00:01:30.830
a certain widespread use in the culture,

21
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.290
it requires more and more innovations on it to make a fresh story out of it.

22
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.670
Um,

23
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.670
it also gets us to the point where that set of conventions is available to

24
00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:50.300
writers in a new way to be transcended in a new way.

25
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.720
So one thing that I want to ask about this novel is does it transcend the genre?

26
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.500
Does it do more than provide the certain dramas and satisfactions that we come

27
00:02:02.871 --> 00:02:07.760
to expect from a novel about identity in this sense?

28
00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:12.410
Because it is so deeply embedded in those kinds of narratives.

29
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.410
Roth is taking a kind of risk here.

30
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.300
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

31
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.300
<v 0>He's playing it safe because he knows that this is a topic of interest,</v>

32
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.010
but he's taking a risk as an artist because he's working in very well trodden

33
00:02:28.011 --> 00:02:28.844
territory.

34
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.230
I suggested that also when a genre reaches a certain point of saturation,

35
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.690
writers tend to change the subject.

36
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.360
I didn't say this when we talked about blood meridian,

37
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.290
but I think in part blood meridian is that kind of change of subject,

38
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.800
so this returns to the genre and we want to ask what it's doing with the genre.

39
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.260
Before I go into my meditation on that question today,

40
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.740
I just want to call your to another element that does relate back to blood

41
00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:07.630
meridian and that's its status as a historical novel.

42
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.150
This novel places itself with certain kinds of historical markers at the very

43
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:20.311
opening was the summer of 1998 the summer of the Monica Lewinsky affair,

44
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.490
the summer when Viagra takes off in the marketplace.

45
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.340
Those are very contemporary historical markers.

46
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.360
Now think back to the way blood meridian opens with its historical markers.

47
00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:45.070
Do you remember this line?
It's the father talking about the sun,

48
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.120
the kids birth.
He says night of your birth,

49
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.080
33 God,
how the stars did fall.

50
00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:55.330
I think I've got that correct.

51
00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.110
What he's talking about is the Leonid meteor showers in 1833 that mark the night

52
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:06.991
of the kids' birth for all that McCarthy is interested in and mining the

53
00:04:09.701 --> 00:04:14.320
historical detail of the 1830s forties 50s

54
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.990
<v 1>okay.</v>

55
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.990
<v 0>That novel favors historical markers that seem like cosmic markers of time,</v>

56
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.730
so contrast the stars falling in.

57
00:04:29.731 --> 00:04:33.150
Yes.
A historically specific meteor shower,

58
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.450
but nevertheless in something that looks like a cosmic communication of meaning.

59
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.520
Contrast that with the relatively mundane debased historical markers that Roth

60
00:04:48.361 --> 00:04:52.020
chooses Viagra,
the Monica Lewinsky scandal.

61
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.680
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

62
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.100
<v 0>You want to ask yourself what kind of history is each writer in woking?</v>

63
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.240
I want to suggest to you that if you press on the markers that Roth chooses,

64
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.980
you will find something more than Trivia,

65
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.070
more than contemporary trivia that Roth has in his sights and equal universal

66
00:05:18.061 --> 00:05:23.061
trans historical kind of truth in this novel that's brought up by those little

67
00:05:24.751 --> 00:05:26.130
details of history

68
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.560
and that trans historical history is the history of desire.

69
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:33.680
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

70
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.250
<v 0>Of which both those things are indicative.</v>

71
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.270
I will say a lot more about desire and its relationship to the history of

72
00:05:43.341 --> 00:05:47.690
literature and to writing.
In this novel in my Monday lecture.

73
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.640
But as you go on,

74
00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:55.090
I would like you to think about how history functions as a set of context for

75
00:05:56.541 --> 00:05:58.340
the story Roth Chels here.

76
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.390
Now I want to talk about identities.

77
00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:07.391
So does this novel conform to the form of the identity plot?

78
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.030
There are certain ways I think it does and it does.

79
00:06:14.031 --> 00:06:16.250
So in a very explicit way.

80
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.060
Remember how I mentioned that tension in the identity plot is produced by the

81
00:06:24.561 --> 00:06:29.561
individual's relationship to the group and the way that's vexed,

82
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.120
it isn't a very exciting identity plot.

83
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.660
If the protagonist just discovers that he or she is whatever categorizable

84
00:06:44.151 --> 00:06:48.500
identity it does,
oh good,
I'll be that.
And then goes on.

85
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:54.430
The tension comes from feeling that either such an identification would be

86
00:06:54.531 --> 00:06:59.240
coercion or that it comes with all kinds of tended suffering.

87
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.720
There all kinds of tensions that are produced in making that I'm not an easy

88
00:07:05.241 --> 00:07:09.680
identification and you can see that very explicitly in this novel.

89
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.240
On page one oh eight,
uh,

90
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.710
one oh six one oh eight when Coleman

91
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:23.450
talks about being at Howard University.

92
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.270
And along with that,

93
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:30.980
the experience of being called a nigger for the first time,

94
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.740
this is on the top of one oh six

95
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.440
especially when he began to think that there was something of the nigger about

96
00:07:42.441 --> 00:07:43.070
him,

97
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:48.070
even to the kids in the dorm who had all sorts of new clothes and money in their

98
00:07:48.171 --> 00:07:52.100
pockets and in the summertime,
didn't hang around the hot streets at home,

99
00:07:52.101 --> 00:07:56.960
but went to camp and not voiced out scout camp out in the Jersey sticks,

100
00:07:56.961 --> 00:08:01.940
but fancy places where they rode horses and played tennis and acted in plays.

101
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:05.960
What the hell was a cotillion?
We're was Highland beach.

102
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.060
What were these kids talking about?

103
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.260
He was among the very lightest of the light skinned and his freshman class

104
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:16.810
lighter,
even then his tea colored roommate,
but he could have been the blackest,

105
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:21.230
most benighted field hand for all.
They knew that he didn't.

106
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:26.270
He hated Howard from the day he arrived.
Within a week he hated Washington.

107
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:30.590
And so in early October when his father dropped dead serving dinner on the

108
00:08:30.591 --> 00:08:34.310
Pennsylvania railroad dining car that was pulling out of 30th street station in

109
00:08:34.311 --> 00:08:38.300
Philadelphia for Wilmington and Coleman went home for the funeral.

110
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:43.510
He told his mother he was finished with that college right there in that

111
00:08:43.911 --> 00:08:44.601
sentence.

112
00:08:44.601 --> 00:08:48.920
In this little set of scenes about Howard and his experience in DC,

113
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:54.490
you see him at first being asked by his family to identify with a certain

114
00:08:56.671 --> 00:09:01.671
version of the black middle class and then finding he is revolted by his own

115
00:09:05.761 --> 00:09:08.070
difference from that middle class.

116
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:11.310
He feels like a black field hand,

117
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.920
the darkest of the dark field hand for all.

118
00:09:13.921 --> 00:09:18.921
They knew that he didn't and on one oh eight we get it in very abstract terms.

119
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:25.350
You finally leave home the earlier of we and you find another way,

120
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:29.550
another place that's just like that.
The substitute for that.

121
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:34.530
The problem of the identity plot is the problem of the eye in the wee.

122
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:40.790
Here's Coleman laying out exactly how he feels about that.

123
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.010
And so what he's going to favor their,
again,

124
00:09:44.011 --> 00:09:47.820
on one oh eight is the Ra I

125
00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:52.040
all the subtlety of being silky silk.

126
00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.870
So there you have encapsulated in a very short amount of pros,

127
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:04.060
a major form,
narrative form,

128
00:10:04.061 --> 00:10:07.960
narrative dynamic of the identity plot as a genre.

129
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:11.870
On one 44,

130
00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:16.370
you get another version of that slightly a

131
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.720
more personalized to his family.

132
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:26.540
This is another version of identity and what Coleman thinks about it.

133
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:30.140
This is after we get the history of Coleman's family,

134
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.700
his ancestors,

135
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:38.120
and were told that he is not the first to pass as white

136
00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:45.370
or to disappear from the black family into which he was born.

137
00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.073
Um,

138
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:52.820
lost himself to all his people was another way they,

139
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:57.800
the family put it ancestor worship.
That's how Coleman put it.

140
00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.020
Honoring the past was one thing,

141
00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:04.400
the idolatry that his ancestor worship was something else.

142
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:06.920
The hell would that imprisonment.

143
00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.210
So this version of identity on one 44,

144
00:11:11.211 --> 00:11:16.211
this vision of it is identity as ancestor worship and imprisonment in that

145
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.190
family imprisonment.

146
00:11:22.191 --> 00:11:26.000
In that way of thinking a radical unfreedom.

147
00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.850
So this is one version of identity,

148
00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.880
radically individual rising out of the difference that you feel from the various

149
00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:41.620
we groups you are asked to join,

150
00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:50.020
but there are other versions of identity that are imagined here and they track

151
00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:55.450
pretty clearly with scholarly ways of thinking about identity at the same time.

152
00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:02.640
So in one sense identity is this radical individual humanist version that I've

153
00:12:04.031 --> 00:12:05.800
been tracing in the last few minutes.

154
00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:11.490
Another is that identity is a constantly changing performance and we get that

155
00:12:14.891 --> 00:12:16.840
too in Coleman,

156
00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.020
you see it again,

157
00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:24.070
right in this section about Howard on one oh nine

158
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:29.260
and I want you to note the words that

159
00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:32.190
<v 1>yeah,</v>

160
00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:34.920
<v 0>Roth chooses here one or nine in the middle.</v>

161
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:40.130
He could play his skin however he wanted color himself just as he chose,

162
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.740
play his skin any way he wanted.

163
00:12:45.741 --> 00:12:50.540
Now remember that his father is a great devotee of Shakespeare and tries to

164
00:12:50.541 --> 00:12:55.541
communicate to his children not only through their Shakespeare in middle names,

165
00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.840
but through every verbal interaction he has with them,

166
00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.800
that the grandeur of the English language will somehow fill them and make them

167
00:13:06.441 --> 00:13:08.090
who they,
who they are.

168
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:12.680
That this is the source of their dignity and their power.

169
00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:19.930
He takes that lesson and transforms it.

170
00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:25.010
It's about playing on the model of drama,

171
00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:27.050
but it's about playing color.

172
00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:30.710
And this is an artist's vocation

173
00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:34.790
color himself,
just as he chose.

174
00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.760
He's like a painter in this sense.

175
00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:41.180
So this is identity as performance.

176
00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:45.620
There are many instances of this on page one 15,

177
00:13:45.621 --> 00:13:49.250
one 16.
There's just a little,
um,

178
00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:55.280
a little description of Steve.

179
00:13:55.281 --> 00:13:58.010
Anna's dance for Coleman.

180
00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:02.213
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

181
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.720
<v 0>we're going to just read a little bit of it.</v>

182
00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.133
<v 1>Okay.</v>

183
00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:10.250
<v 0>All at once with no prompting from him,</v>

184
00:14:10.251 --> 00:14:14.120
seemingly prompted only by Eldridges trumpet,
she began with Coleman,

185
00:14:14.121 --> 00:14:17.750
like to describe as the single most slithery dance ever performed by Fergus

186
00:14:17.751 --> 00:14:20.750
falls.
Girl after a little more than a year in New York City,

187
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:24.320
she could've raised Gershwin himself from the grave with that dance.

188
00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:29.030
And with the way she's saying the song prompted by a colored trumpet player

189
00:14:29.031 --> 00:14:33.980
playing at like a black torch song there to see plain as day was all the power

190
00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:37.460
of her whiteness,
that big white thing.

191
00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:41.540
Someday he'll come along the man I love and he'll be big and strong.

192
00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:42.860
The man I love,

193
00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:47.030
the language was ordinary enough to have been lifted from the most innocent

194
00:14:47.031 --> 00:14:50.030
first grade primer,
but when the record was over,

195
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.220
Stena put her up to hide her face,

196
00:14:52.221 --> 00:14:56.060
half meaning half pretending to cover her shame.

197
00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.673
<v 1>Okay.</v>

198
00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:03.040
<v 0>The history of jazz that's concentrated into that tiny little passage has been</v>

199
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.730
unpacked by a critic by the name of Jonathan Freedman.

200
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:16.010
He does a whole history,
which I can't produce here,
um,

201
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:21.400
of how Ardi Shaw and various players played Gershwin,

202
00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:23.540
um,

203
00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:28.540
and use black musicians in their ensembles and how this very dance when Stena

204
00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:36.190
here we're told in a way in habits most fully her whiteness.

205
00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:42.940
She does that by performing to a music that is radically hybrid black and

206
00:15:43.971 --> 00:15:44.804
Jewish.

207
00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:45.753
<v 1>Okay.</v>

208
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:52.030
<v 0>So Friedman argues that in this passage we get identity as a vision of absolute</v>

209
00:15:54.021 --> 00:15:54.854
fluidity,

210
00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:59.130
absolute performance and fluidity.

211
00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:01.040
<v 1>Okay.</v>

212
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:06.040
<v 0>And that the whole history of American jazz stands behind that imagined state.</v>

213
00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:15.750
It's the very difference between the hybrid music and the pure whiteness of

214
00:16:17.321 --> 00:16:22.321
Stena his body that creates what's so provocative to Coleman,

215
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:30.920
the spectacle of whiteness in the context of hybridity.

216
00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:36.133
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

217
00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:42.150
<v 0>The father's obsession with the English language though has taught Coleman to</v>

218
00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:49.450
categorize relentlessly.
Do you remember this little detail?

219
00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:53.800
Um,
this is on page 93

220
00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:00.840
when Coleman is describing or we're having described to us exactly how Kohlmans

221
00:17:05.051 --> 00:17:09.310
father taught them to speak.
This is on 93 growing up.

222
00:17:09.311 --> 00:17:13.510
They never said see the bow.
Wow.
They didn't even say see the doggy.

223
00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:17.680
They said,
see the Doberman,
see the Beagle,

224
00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:22.450
see the terrier.
They learned things,
had classifications.

225
00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:26.230
They learned the power of naming precisely

226
00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:30.580
the father for all that he is,

227
00:17:30.581 --> 00:17:35.581
imbuing them with the most elite version of a white literary tradition.

228
00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:39.603
Shakespeare.

229
00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:45.330
He is also teaching them relentlessly to see classification and categorizing

230
00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.720
in this comes to mean something quite different.

231
00:17:51.721 --> 00:17:56.721
And you see it in this funny little passing moment on one oh seven

232
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:06.103
<v 1>great.</v>

233
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:09.990
<v 0>It's very top of the page.</v>

234
00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:14.700
I'm just talking about his father's cherished volume of Shakespeare's plays,

235
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:19.940
the oversized book with the floppy leather binding that when Coleman was a small

236
00:18:20.251 --> 00:18:24.360
boy,
always reminded him of a cocker spaniel.

237
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.271
The Seinfeld,

238
00:18:27.271 --> 00:18:31.200
his father's majesty as never before the grand year of both his rise in his
fall.

239
00:18:31.201 --> 00:18:34.410
The grander that as a college freshman away from barely a month,
blah,
blah blah.

240
00:18:34.411 --> 00:18:39.390
And then it quotes from Shakespeare,
the Cocker Spaniel.

241
00:18:39.391 --> 00:18:40.020
Why,

242
00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:45.020
why choose that as what the little boy thinks of when he looks at that floppy

243
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.553
volume?

244
00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:52.460
It's a moment when being trained to classify and to categorize causes him to see

245
00:18:54.061 --> 00:18:57.300
the source of that linguistic precision.

246
00:18:57.301 --> 00:19:02.301
The book of Shakespeare in very demeaning terms or reductive terms or I'm not

247
00:19:05.431 --> 00:19:08.340
getting the quite the precise word I want,
um,

248
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.520
in deflating terms

249
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:18.500
so that instead of grandier the book of Shakespeare becomes the source for the

250
00:19:18.901 --> 00:19:20.160
names of dogs.

251
00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:27.410
And the way the child's imagination blends grandeur and the ordinary,

252
00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:36.140
I think gives us Coleman who can imagine the details of everyday life,

253
00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:44.100
the life he lives as a grand play.

254
00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:47.070
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

255
00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:52.070
<v 0>Doc owner furthers this transformation of the father's lesson in this very</v>

256
00:19:57.871 --> 00:20:01.050
crucial passage that I'm going to talk more about later.

257
00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:06.290
When Coleman passes as white or Jewish for the first time,

258
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:10.980
and that's when he's boxing for the pit coach.

259
00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:16.890
If nothing comes up up,
doc said this is the bottom of 98 you don't bring it up.

260
00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.880
You're neither one thing or the other.
You're silky silk.

261
00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:24.210
That's enough.
That's the deal.

262
00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:30.510
You're neither one thing or the other.
You're silky silk.

263
00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:35.820
This takes the question of categorization.
Are you colored?

264
00:20:35.821 --> 00:20:39.480
Are you not?
It negates it.

265
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:41.760
You're neither one thing nor another,

266
00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:45.990
but then reinstates it in a different mode.
You're silky silk.

267
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:50.920
Make up a new category for yourself.
So doctors,

268
00:20:50.921 --> 00:20:55.921
nurse takes that transgressing use of precision that we see in the Cocker

269
00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.970
Spaniel Metaphor in the child's imagination,

270
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:06.630
and he shows Coleman how to apply that to living race in America,

271
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:13.560
living his race in America.
You're silky.
Silk,
you're not a race,

272
00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:15.010
you're a proper name.

273
00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:19.810
The irreducible singularity of a person.

274
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:29.530
There's a third way of thinking about race,

275
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:32.500
and that of course is as biology.

276
00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:38.060
That two is present in this novel.
The body is relentlessly president.

277
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:41.380
I hope that you picked up on that.
It's not hard to pick up on it.

278
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:47.070
The very matter and specificity of the body is everywhere in this novel.

279
00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.090
And so I want to look back at 21 and 22.

280
00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:57.690
This is in that wonderful scene when Coleman dances with Nathan.

281
00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:00.063
Nathan.

282
00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:09.350
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

283
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:14.350
<v 0>So we get a whole description of coalmines body and what it is that Nathan</v>

284
00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:20.360
season it suddenly now that he's shirtless on this hot summer night.

285
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:22.550
And also,
uh,

286
00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:27.700
now that he is no longer talking about the spooks business.

287
00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:30.450
<v 1>Okay.</v>

288
00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:33.900
<v 0>This is 21 on display where the shoulders,
arms,</v>

289
00:22:33.901 --> 00:22:38.520
and chest of a smallish man still trim and attractive,

290
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.490
uh,
belly no longer flat to be sure,

291
00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:45.570
but nothing had gotten that had gotten seriously out of hand altogether.

292
00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:49.710
The physique of someone who had seem to have been a cunning and Wiley competitor

293
00:22:49.711 --> 00:22:54.711
at sports rather than an overpowering one and all this had previously been

294
00:22:55.021 --> 00:23:00.021
concealed from me because he was always shirted and also because of his being

295
00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:05.040
having been so drastically consumed by his rage.

296
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:10.920
What you see there is the revelation of certain things.

297
00:23:10.921 --> 00:23:14.190
We will find out to be true about Coleman,

298
00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:19.520
that he was a cunning and wildly competitor rather than an overpowering one,

299
00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:25.620
that he is still fit and virile,

300
00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:33.510
that he has himself in hand.
Nothing that had gotten totally,

301
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:36.870
that had gotten out of hand seriously out of hand.

302
00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.500
Coleman very much still has himself in hand.

303
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:43.650
He is still the maker of himself,

304
00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:49.370
the presenter himself to the world in in a deliberate way.

305
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.620
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

306
00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:56.620
<v 0>but then we go on and there are some things that we see that perhaps tell us</v>

307
00:23:57.891 --> 00:24:02.870
something different rather than the body revealing the truth about Coleman,

308
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:09.820
certain kinds of truth,
not a racial truth,
other kinds of truth.

309
00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:15.280
We see marks on his body that don't produce that knowledge.

310
00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:20.760
Also previously concealed was the small pop Irish Blue Tattoo situated at the

311
00:24:21.491 --> 00:24:26.491
top of his right arm just at the cha shoulder joining the words u s navy

312
00:24:27.191 --> 00:24:31.690
inscribed between the hook like arms of a shadowy little anchor and running

313
00:24:31.691 --> 00:24:34.180
along the hypotenuse of the deltoid muscle.

314
00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:39.720
A tiny symbol if one were needed of all the millions circumstances of the other

315
00:24:40.871 --> 00:24:45.871
fellows life of that blizzard of details that constitute the confusion of a

316
00:24:46.421 --> 00:24:47.500
human biography,

317
00:24:47.501 --> 00:24:52.501
a tiny symbol to remind me why our understanding of people must always be at

318
00:24:53.081 --> 00:24:55.030
best,
slightly wrong.

319
00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:56.853
<v 1>Okay.</v>

320
00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:02.430
<v 0>What's revealed when Coleman is shirtless is the very sign that he cannot be</v>

321
00:25:03.701 --> 00:25:06.730
known in any kind of complete way.

322
00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:12.490
It's the mark of a history on his body that he was in the navy.

323
00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:16.390
Uh,
history we'll learn a little bit about,
but not a lot,

324
00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:19.360
but for Nathan,

325
00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:25.030
it is the mark of an irreducible difference between persons that always there

326
00:25:27.761 --> 00:25:31.210
are details that are not accessible

327
00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:36.460
circumstances of the other fellows life

328
00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:41.420
in this moment.

329
00:25:41.421 --> 00:25:46.421
Nathan recognizes Coleman as a cipher assign that can be projected upon with

330
00:25:52.371 --> 00:25:53.510
meanings of his own.

331
00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:59.090
I would suggest to you that we don't see the full flowering of this until quite

332
00:25:59.091 --> 00:26:00.410
a bit later in the novel,

333
00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:05.620
but I think this is the first moment where in Coleman revealing his body,

334
00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:10.670
he suggests to Nathan the possibilities of that body as a sign.

335
00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:13.010
<v 1>Okay,</v>

336
00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:18.010
<v 0>so he is no longer in this moment entirely in hand anymore.</v>

337
00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.910
So if his physique hasn't gotten out of hand,

338
00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:29.020
his circulation as a sign certainly has in this case,

339
00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:33.800
he has now become a blank canvas for Nathan.

340
00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:40.320
Certainly up until this moment at the beginning of the novel,

341
00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:45.470
what's most on the surface of the plot is how he has become the victim of rumor.

342
00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:50.970
How his self presentation got completely out of hand,

343
00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:55.830
taken over by other people's erroneous readings of his words.

344
00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:02.540
So if the body seems to be in his control himself as a signifier is not here,

345
00:27:05.371 --> 00:27:07.260
Nathan is invited into it,

346
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:12.500
but in a very different way than the rumor mongers who surround him at Athena

347
00:27:13.381 --> 00:27:14.700
college and in the town.

348
00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:22.000
So the body is not going to be a place of revelation.

349
00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:27.210
Speech as I've noted is a problematic moment of revelation,

350
00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:29.380
but it can be that.

351
00:27:29.381 --> 00:27:34.381
And on 81 82 we see an example of that when his speech formally in the novel

352
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:43.230
touches off what will be some of the most important regulatory passages in the

353
00:27:44.441 --> 00:27:45.274
novel.

354
00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:52.740
And this was when Nelson primus having berated Coleman and advised him in his

355
00:27:56.861 --> 00:27:58.510
clever,
authoritative,

356
00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:03.690
arrogant way not to pursue anything against Leicester Farley or Delphine

357
00:28:05.581 --> 00:28:06.414
[inaudible]

358
00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:08.323
<v 1>yeah.</v>

359
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:13.630
<v 0>Has offended him and enraged him so much as to become the target of coalmines</v>

360
00:28:15.351 --> 00:28:17.870
rage come said,

361
00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:23.020
I never again want to hear that self admiring voice of yours or see your smug

362
00:28:23.991 --> 00:28:26.060
fucking lily white face.

363
00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:29.360
And the question becomes why.

364
00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:33.290
And we see Nelson ask it the next page.
Why White?

365
00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:38.890
Why does lily white become the insult that he hurls at Nelson

366
00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:46.400
and formally,
even though there's a little bit of a,
um,

367
00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:51.380
an interlude here about Athena college and Coleman's rage,

368
00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:57.470
this is the moment when we launch into the tail of coalmines childhood and we

369
00:28:57.471 --> 00:29:02.471
learned for the first time what kind of family he comes from and what the

370
00:29:03.201 --> 00:29:06.020
history of his passing has been,

371
00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:11.480
how he made that decision to abandon his family of birth.

372
00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:15.920
So speech can be revealing,

373
00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:21.220
but only in those moments when it is out of coalmines control here in this

374
00:29:23.871 --> 00:29:27.590
moment,
lily white is inspired by his rage.

375
00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:31.550
He's out of control in that sense.
And of course,

376
00:29:31.551 --> 00:29:36.551
lily white is the term his brother Walt applies to him in a similar moment of

377
00:29:38.181 --> 00:29:43.181
anger after Walt that he has told his mother that he is essentially estranging

378
00:29:46.391 --> 00:29:50.320
himself permanently from the family in order to marry Iris.

379
00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:56.590
Walt says,
don't ever show your lily white face,
uh,
here again.

380
00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:01.690
So he's reproducing Walt's language.

381
00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:04.390
And from that it indicates to Nelson,

382
00:30:04.391 --> 00:30:09.340
Primus and for us in the unfolding of the novel that there's a mystery here to

383
00:30:09.341 --> 00:30:14.140
be told.
And then we get the telling of that mystery.
So from that little word,

384
00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:16.000
all of this unfurls

385
00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:24.720
and I would know just in passing that this is quite a contrast to Delfin room

386
00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:30.280
on 38 and 39 you can look at it.

387
00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:36.610
Coleman is very surprised that she has made no effort to hide the identifying

388
00:30:36.611 --> 00:30:38.260
marks of her own handwriting.

389
00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:44.280
Delphine row though her name suggests the Delphic,

390
00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:48.700
the ARAC color,
the mysterious.
The secret

391
00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:55.200
Delphine is someone who cannot conceal herself the very material of her

392
00:30:57.371 --> 00:31:00.580
language,
of her writing of her letters,

393
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:04.990
puts her identity on the page to be red.

394
00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:09.730
And it seems as if she hasn't even tried to conceal it.

395
00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:15.250
So Delphine's lack of depth,

396
00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:18.400
her lack of complexity as a character.

397
00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:24.210
Her basic despicable illness is summed up in that inability to conceal herself,

398
00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:32.730
whereas Coleman only reveals himself in moments when he's unguarded or when he

399
00:31:36.281 --> 00:31:41.050
has become not a person in control of his own representation of himself,

400
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:46.470
but rather a sign at large among other representers,

401
00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:49.450
Nathan,
Delphine,
other people.

402
00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:57.830
Secrecy then is at the very heart of what identity means in this novel.

403
00:31:58.891 --> 00:32:03.060
And now I want to get to this crucial passage on page 100

404
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:08.550
for me.
This is where we learn really

405
00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:10.223
<v 1>what</v>

406
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:14.420
<v 0>identity means in this novel.</v>

407
00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:27.810
So he says he wants to be in this fight with,

408
00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:28.673
um,

409
00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:33.720
in front of the pit coach with Ray Robinson.

410
00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.273
<v 1>Okay.</v>

411
00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.840
<v 0>It wasn't just that this is on 99,</v>

412
00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:43.960
it just the Coleman Wade some seven pounds more than when he'd boxed on the

413
00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:46.040
Amateur Card at the knights of Pythius.

414
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:51.970
It was that something he could not even name made him want to be more damaging

415
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:57.640
than he'd ever dared before to do something more that day than merely when was

416
00:32:58.611 --> 00:33:02.000
it?
Because the pit coach didn't know he was colored.

417
00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:07.960
Could it be because who he really was was entirely his secret.

418
00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:10.453
<v 1>Okay.</v>

419
00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:12.870
<v 0>He did love secrets.</v>

420
00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:16.320
The secret of nobody's knowing what was going on in your head,

421
00:33:16.321 --> 00:33:18.060
thinking whatever you wanted to think,

422
00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:23.600
with no way of anybody's knowing all the other kids were always blabbing about

423
00:33:24.181 --> 00:33:28.500
themselves,
but that wasn't where the power was or the pleasure either.

424
00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:31.680
The power and the pleasure,
where to be found in the opposite,

425
00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:37.100
in being counter confessional in the same way you were a counter puncher and he

426
00:33:37.771 --> 00:33:42.570
knew that with nobody having to tell him and without his having to think about

427
00:33:42.571 --> 00:33:43.404
it.

428
00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:48.090
That's why he liked shadowboxing and hitting the heavy bag for the secrecy of
it.

429
00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.720
And I'm going to skip down a little bit.

430
00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:57.690
He talks about concentrating and how the secrecy,
um,

431
00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:02.840
is produced by the concentration or is related to the concentration on the one

432
00:34:03.211 --> 00:34:04.350
thing that you're doing.

433
00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:10.160
Whatever's to be mastered.
He becomes that thing.

434
00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:15.050
He could do that in biology and he could do it in the dash and he could do it in

435
00:34:15.051 --> 00:34:18.980
boxing and not only did nothing external make any difference,

436
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:21.260
neither did anything internal.

437
00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:27.650
That little example right there,

438
00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:31.370
he could do it in biology on a biology exam.

439
00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:34.370
He could focus exclusively on that thing,

440
00:34:34.371 --> 00:34:39.371
become that thing in the dash in boxing in the ring.

441
00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:46.490
But why choose that example?
Why not mathematics?

442
00:34:46.491 --> 00:34:50.330
Why Not Chemistry?
Well here again,

443
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:53.120
it's Roths craft coming through.

444
00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:59.500
Rauf chose that because what Coleman does is precisely to overcome biology.

445
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:07.130
It's the biology of who his parents are,

446
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:11.870
of who their parents are.
That biology,

447
00:35:11.871 --> 00:35:14.630
the biology of American race

448
00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:20.550
is what he takes hold of and transforms.

449
00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:22.860
It becomes his secret.

450
00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:27.720
Biology becomes his secret,
not as an academic subject,

451
00:35:27.721 --> 00:35:29.730
but as a lived experience.

452
00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:35.580
Boxing is the sport of concealment.
For him,

453
00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:40.980
thinking ahead,
observing his opponent,
watching how slow the punches,

454
00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:48.740
all the answers that you came up with in the ring you kept to yourself.

455
00:35:48.741 --> 00:35:50.840
And when you let that the secret out,

456
00:35:50.841 --> 00:35:55.841
you let it out through everything but your mouth for all Coleman's training in

457
00:35:57.111 --> 00:35:59.000
the English language from his father,

458
00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.540
his mode of revelation,

459
00:36:02.541 --> 00:36:05.630
his mode of communication is not verbal.

460
00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.193
<v 1>Okay?</v>

461
00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.800
<v 0>It is somehow physical as a physical performance,</v>

462
00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:15.850
as a damaging physical performance.

463
00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:25.940
That term counter confessional being the pleasure and the power we're in being

464
00:36:26.491 --> 00:36:31.491
counter confessional in the same way you were a counter puncher in not telling.

465
00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:38.060
This is quite a remarkable term for Roth to use the history of Roths,

466
00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:42.530
a writing from,
uh,

467
00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:47.430
the very first story collection.
Goodbye Columbus,

468
00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:51.240
uh,
published in 1960 through the many,

469
00:36:51.241 --> 00:36:55.140
many novels in the next five decades.

470
00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:59.550
That trajectory,
which I'm going to talk a little bit about on Wednesday,

471
00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:04.730
is defined by the confessional quality of many of these works.

472
00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:10.790
So Roth is widely known for drawing on his own life in his fiction and for

473
00:37:12.691 --> 00:37:17.691
making Nathan Zuckerman track his biography in significant ways.

474
00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:23.660
And in this novel it happens to be true that Philip Roth went through prostate

475
00:37:25.501 --> 00:37:29.220
cancer surgery and now lives up in the Berkshires

476
00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:35.250
and has been very secluded up there and very productive writing novels in the

477
00:37:35.251 --> 00:37:40.050
last 10 years.
So in this novel already,

478
00:37:40.051 --> 00:37:45.051
anybody who knows even those basic facts knows that Roth himself as a writer is

479
00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.990
confessional in some sense of the word.

480
00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:51.720
One question we might want to ask is,

481
00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:56.490
is he counter confessional the way that Coleman is,

482
00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:59.730
the way that you can be a counter puncher?

483
00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:04.770
And what would it mean to be that?
Why does it matter

484
00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:07.850
in fact,
does it matter?

485
00:38:07.851 --> 00:38:12.830
And then why does it matter if it does that his novels track his life?

486
00:38:12.831 --> 00:38:16.190
This is a longterm question for anyone who thinks about Roths writing,

487
00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:20.000
and I will get more to it,
uh,

488
00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.760
in my second lecture on the human stain next Monday.

489
00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:24.920
But it's something to think about.

490
00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:26.770
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

491
00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:31.180
<v 0>But let me pause again on that rhetorical question.</v>

492
00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:35.080
Was it because the pit coach didn't know he was colored?

493
00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:40.290
Could it be because who he really was was entirely his secret.

494
00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:45.880
There are two ways of reading that last question.
Who he really was,

495
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.460
was entirely his secret.
If we read that,

496
00:38:48.461 --> 00:38:53.461
who he really was as a colored guy from east orange.

497
00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:58.410
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

498
00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:01.890
<v 0>Then we'll see it as that being his secret.</v>

499
00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:06.510
But you can read it.
You can parse that grammar a different way.

500
00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:10.380
Who he really was was his secret.

501
00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:12.680
<v 1>Okay.</v>

502
00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:17.680
<v 0>Could it be because who he really was was his secret secrecy as the essence of</v>

503
00:39:19.941 --> 00:39:20.774
identity.

504
00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:26.740
Doesn't matter what's in that hidden box doesn't mean that we have to fill it

505
00:39:28.371 --> 00:39:30.770
in.
Doesn't mean even that it can be known.

506
00:39:30.771 --> 00:39:35.030
And you think back to the way the anchor on his arm,

507
00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:40.180
the Tattoo on his arm reminds Nathan of how little you can ever know about the

508
00:39:41.361 --> 00:39:42.200
other fellow.

509
00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:47.180
They're very fact of the person's otherness to you means that there is always

510
00:39:47.181 --> 00:39:52.181
something fundamentally hidden about them and that arises from the simple

511
00:39:52.221 --> 00:39:54.560
difference between one consciousness and another.

512
00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:57.200
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

513
00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:02.200
<v 0>This returns the meditation on identity to a universalist humanist version of</v>

514
00:40:07.521 --> 00:40:11.930
what identity would be.
It's simply private consciousness.

515
00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:15.470
Private consciousness is what defines us as persons

516
00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:21.800
and then reading radiating out from that all the things that one can do with a

517
00:40:21.801 --> 00:40:23.090
private consciousness,

518
00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:28.420
which then encompasses these other modes of identifying that the novel rehearses

519
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:34.990
and then critiques or sometimes endorses plays with jumbles,

520
00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:39.980
juggles
with a private consciousness.

521
00:40:39.981 --> 00:40:42.110
You can decide to decide.

522
00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:45.620
This is something that Coleman does on a number of occasions and it's a phrase

523
00:40:45.621 --> 00:40:50.621
that Roth repeats when he's deciding to decide to be done with the spooks

524
00:40:51.921 --> 00:40:55.940
business deciding to decide not to be worried about luster.
Farley.

525
00:40:58.330 --> 00:40:59.050
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

526
00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:03.100
<v 0>You have the power to form yourself presentation.</v>

527
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:08.440
You have the power to make your identity and artistic performance.

528
00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:12.340
That's what private consciousness does for you.

529
00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:16.063
<v 1>But</v>

530
00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:18.340
<v 0>it does a couple other things too,</v>

531
00:41:18.341 --> 00:41:22.510
and I want to track those or suggest them just briefly before I end today.

532
00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:24.370
Um,
in one sense,

533
00:41:24.371 --> 00:41:28.510
by following the theme of difference and in the other sense by following the

534
00:41:28.511 --> 00:41:30.610
word secrecy in the novel,

535
00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:35.420
first on the question of pure difference on 47

536
00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:38.113
and that

537
00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:42.710
wonderful scene of Fanya with the cows,

538
00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:53.350
this is Nathan reflecting on the desire that he sees enacted there.

539
00:41:53.351 --> 00:41:58.150
And again,
remember Coleman is not,
uh,
primarily a man of words,

540
00:41:58.151 --> 00:42:00.130
but a man of being,

541
00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:08.520
and he has just stood in silence with Nathan watching Fanya milk the cows.

542
00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:17.093
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

543
00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:23.140
<v 0>It was enough to be able to conduct themselves like two people who had nothing</v>

544
00:42:23.141 --> 00:42:24.490
whatsoever in common.

545
00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:29.650
All the while remembering how they could distill to an orgasmic essence,

546
00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:32.980
everything about them that was irreconcilable,

547
00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:37.060
the human discrepancies that produced all the power.

548
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:41.470
It was enough to feel the thrill of leading a double life.

549
00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:47.730
And what this passage pass the sentences above emphasize is that Fanya is a

550
00:42:50.081 --> 00:42:53.260
woman of 34,
a wordless illiterate.

551
00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:59.460
And that Coleman is a man replete with the vocabularies have to ancient tongues

552
00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:03.580
as well as his own native tongue.

553
00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:09.360
So the very difference between them this time limbed in terms of education and

554
00:43:10.841 --> 00:43:14.650
language,
vocabulary literacy here,

555
00:43:14.651 --> 00:43:19.651
it's that difference that is invoked as the engine of desire.

556
00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:25.950
So if desire is always that looking towards the other thing,

557
00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:30.520
the thing that you are not,
the thing that you do not have,

558
00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:36.580
the thing that is absent from you,
that's the definition of desire.

559
00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:41.580
You can't have desire if you already have the thing desires that that force

560
00:43:42.551 --> 00:43:45.850
that's always reaching towards something that is separate from you.

561
00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:52.770
Difference between human beings is just that in this scene,

562
00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:56.830
just the engine of desire.

563
00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:02.620
So here for all the meditations on race,

564
00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:06.670
the social construction of race,
racist performance,
racist essence,

565
00:44:06.730 --> 00:44:10.060
racist biology,
race has secret.

566
00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:15.180
It's secret that gets to that overarching concern with desire in the novel.

567
00:44:16.450 --> 00:44:21.400
And this is a moment where I think Roth is transcending the genre.

568
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000
He's taking the dramas of the identity plot and he's driving them to an extreme

569
00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:36.270
and pushing them over into another subject matter.

570
00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:39.750
So in this sense,

571
00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:45.530
identity as secrecy pushes us over into the subject matter of desire and

572
00:44:47.251 --> 00:44:51.660
mortality,
which is,
uh,

573
00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:56.400
at the heart of Ross writing from beginning to end.
Now,

574
00:44:56.401 --> 00:44:59.250
I will not say that identity is not also

575
00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:04.530
a subject matter he's working with from beginning to end of his career.

576
00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:09.210
That's definitely true and I'll say more about that on Wednesday when I talk

577
00:45:09.211 --> 00:45:11.070
about the shape of his career,

578
00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:15.990
but especially as Roth moves later in his career,

579
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:20.610
these questions of desire and mortality take the upper hand.

580
00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:27.170
Now the last thing I want to do just very quickly is 0.2,

581
00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:34.900
page 44 another use of that word secret,

582
00:45:36.850 --> 00:45:38.290
very top of the page.

583
00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:43.620
The secret to living in the rush of the world with a minimum of pain is to get

584
00:45:44.321 --> 00:45:47.140
as many people as possible to string along with your delusions.

585
00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:49.390
The trick of living alone up here,

586
00:45:49.391 --> 00:45:53.650
away from all agitating entanglements and Luhrmann's and expectations apart,

587
00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:56.260
especially from one zone intensity,

588
00:45:56.590 --> 00:46:01.510
is to organize the silence to think of it's mountain top plentitude as capitol

589
00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:02.890
silence,
as wealth,

590
00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:07.950
exponentially increasing the encircling silence as your chosen source of

591
00:46:08.501 --> 00:46:11.350
advantage and you're only intimate.

592
00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:16.150
The trick is to find sustenance.
This is quoting Hawthorne again,

593
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:19.540
the communications of a solitary mind with itself.

594
00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:24.690
The secret is to find sustenance in people like Hawthorne in the wisdom of the

595
00:46:25.601 --> 00:46:27.940
brilliant deceased.
Now,

596
00:46:27.941 --> 00:46:32.260
one question I myself as a reader have struggled with about this novel is

597
00:46:32.261 --> 00:46:34.030
weather.
Nathan,

598
00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:39.390
whether Roth imagines that Nathan state when he describes it that way,

599
00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:45.570
is a false one or a week one one to be rejected.

600
00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:48.790
Is it a withdrawal from life?

601
00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:53.190
I think that last sentence,

602
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:58.590
the secret is to find sustenance in people like Hawthorne

603
00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:05.430
gives us the answer that I'm content with and that is yes,

604
00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:07.910
it's a withdrawal from life.

605
00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:11.330
If you don't understand Hawthorne as a person,

606
00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:14.750
as someone with whom you can become entangled,

607
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:22.000
it's the very act of thinking of a literary forebear as a person rather than a

608
00:47:23.361 --> 00:47:27.710
text that allows this to be a productive state.

609
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:30.970
One that Nathan be drawn out of by Coleman,

610
00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:35.500
but yet one that the novel does not reject.

611
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:37.480
<v 1>Okay?</v>

612
00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:42.370
<v 0>It's when Coleman becomes for Nathan a character,</v>

613
00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:48.420
the person becomes this living representation that he is drawn out of his

614
00:47:52.811 --> 00:47:57.640
solitude.
So in a way,
it's not even Coleman,

615
00:47:57.641 --> 00:47:59.410
the person that draws him out,

616
00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:04.030
but his world when he encounters Coleman and his story,

617
00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:08.260
when he sees Coleman's body during that dance as a cipher,

618
00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:12.340
as the sign of all that you can't know about the other fellow,

619
00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:14.950
when he sees that about Coleman,

620
00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:20.070
that's when he comes out of one productive state of communing with the brilliant

621
00:48:21.671 --> 00:48:25.270
dead and comes into the

622
00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:30.820
world of Coleman,
who will be dead very,
very shortly.

623
00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:35.430
<v 1>Okay,</v>

624
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:40.430
<v 0>so on Monday next I will talk about that relationship between desire and the</v>

625
00:48:42.331 --> 00:48:45.960
literary between persons and characters,

626
00:48:45.961 --> 00:48:48.750
between life and novel.

627
00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:51.150
Think about those things as you read.
