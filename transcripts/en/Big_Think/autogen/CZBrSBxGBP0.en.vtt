00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399
was quite a feat I don't think that the
 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.430
was quite a feat I don't think that the
shows that were working without writers

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440
shows that were working without writers
 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.680

could have sustained themselves for much
 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.060

longer I think they simply would have

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070
longer I think they simply would have
 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.700

of an all-hands-on-deck kind of

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020
of an all-hands-on-deck kind of
 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.170

these shows I know in the case of a

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860
these shows I know in the case of a
 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.260
these shows I know in the case of a
couple I happen to know that and so I

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910
don't think they could have sustained
 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.610
don't think they could have sustained
their their quality for much longer

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620
their their quality for much longer
 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.560
