00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
Now it turns out that minimizing the time until all mail is delivered

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.500
is polynomial-time solvable because you have n vans and n vertices.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.000
You can simply assign each van to a vertex, have it go there,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
come back, and you're essentially done.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.500
The second one is actually still NP-complete, and the reason is,

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.500
if you want to minimize the sum of the individual times taken by the vans,

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.000
then you still have to essentially do the one-van shortest tour for each of those vans.

00:00:30.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And that ends up being NP-complete.
