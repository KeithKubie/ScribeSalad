00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.879
Alright guys, so space weather is awesome!

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.680
But it’s also terrible and we should really
keep our eye on it.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.030
How do we do that?

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.130
Hey everyone, Julia here for DNews.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.110
In recent space news, Space X has been attempting
to launch a rocket from Cape Canaveral.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.300
What’s cool about this launch, isn’t just
the rocket, but its cool cargo.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.800
The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is carrying the
Deep Space Climate Observatory, or because

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.840
astronomy loves acronyms, DSCOVR.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.130
Orbiting between the sun and the Earth, the
satellite will measure space weather, while

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.690
also keeping an eye on Earth.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.700
DSCOVR is actually an old idea.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.360
Al Gore first proposed it in 1998, but it
was called Triana back then.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.380
Its main goal has always been to keep watch
over Earth.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.510
It was originally going to take real time
images of Earth streamed right to the internet.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.149
Which was such a new and exciting thing back
then.

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.090
Gore hoped it would help raise global environmental
awareness, similar to the now famous Blue

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.600
Marble image.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.629
After being shelved for more than a decade,
the 100 million dollar satellite was dusted

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.210
off and given new life and a new name.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.020
Now dubbed DSCOVR it will orbit a million
miles from earth and 91, 960, 000 miles from

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.020
the sun.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.531
This position sits perfectly between the two
bodies at place called Lagrangian point 1.

00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:17.429
One of the five positions in our solar system
where a small object affected only by gravity

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:19.170
can maintain a stable orbit.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.030
Using the original technology when it was
known as Triana, it keeps one eye on the sun

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.219
and the other on Earth.

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:28.700
One of the instruments on board, EPIC, will
take full-Earth pictures about every two hours

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.779
and will able to process them faster than
other Earth observation satellites.

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:37.030
Apart from taking pretty pictures, DSCOVER
also looks at Earth’s energy output, things

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.389
like vegetation and ozone which improves on
current climate models.

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:45.499
Looking the other way, it serves as an early
warning system as it measures the intensity

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:50.110
of sun’s magnetic charges as well as the
direction and distribution of the solar wind

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.110
plasma.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.489
When the sun spontaneously acts up, sending
particles and magnetic charges toward Earth,

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:59.989
the satellite will let us know 15-60 minutes
before the charges reach us.

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:03.999
In case this sounds vaguely familiar, there
are two other satellites currently in the

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:06.549
Lagrangian point 1 measuring solar winds and
charges.

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.750
WIND, launched in 1994, still sends significant
data back to Earth.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.120
Over 3000 publications either directly or
indirectly have used Wind data.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.840
ACE or Advanced Composition Explorer, which
launched in 1997, studies solar winds and

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.500
particles from the interplanetary medium.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.340
Almost 20 years later, it’s still used to
predict solar storms. but both of these have

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.500
been going for a pretty long time, almost
20 years, their original mission length was

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.500
only 5 years.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.430
So they might not have a lot of time left.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.900
DSCOVR will replace ACE in terms of data used
by the Space Weather Prediction Center.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.790
It can measure the speed of solar wind ions
faster than the current two satellites.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.830
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, they’ll be getting real-time

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.579
space weather data about 100 times faster
than any other spacecraft in this orbit.

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.730
But what is space weather and why are we measuring
it?

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.720
Well just like earth weather, it’s pretty
unpredictable.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.640
If a solar wind shock wave or cloud of magnetic
field hits Earth, it disturbs the Earth’s

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.739
magnetic field, while it might look really
cool, I mean Aurora Borealis looks AWESOME.

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.269
Yet, rare intense solar activity can knock
out power and cause billions of dollars of

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.269
damage in electrical systems like satellites,
power grids, and navigational equipment.

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.390
So it’s good thing to keep an eye on it.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.010

If you wanna know more about how space weather

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.549
can really mess up our game here on earth,
Trace has a video about that right over here.

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.489
And to find out why rocket launches get scrubbed
all the time, check out our other video on

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:26.489
this side.

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:27.540
So what do you think?

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.019
Are you stoked for DSCOVR?
