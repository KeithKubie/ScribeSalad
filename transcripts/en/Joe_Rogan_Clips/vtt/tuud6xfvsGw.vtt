1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.240
CBD is fantastic.
Yeah.
No psychoactive effects too,
you know,
cause that's the,

2
00:00:05.241 --> 00:00:08.730
that's the,
that's the freaking stigma behind is like,
oh it's marijuana,

3
00:00:08.731 --> 00:00:12.330
it's weed and it,
and we were talking about marijuana before the podcast.

4
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.420
Like
do it,
I'm like,
I'm coming on Joe,
should I smoke?

5
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.800
No chips.
No,
we watch you watch you lucid here.

6
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.540
Don't want you to go into the hole.

7
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.170
The problem is like when people don't get high and then they get high in a

8
00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:32.710
pressure situation like this,
you're just like,
yeah,
go into that tonally like Gi.

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.980
Oh my God.
Yeah.
It's um,
I've,
I've tried,
I've smoked four times in my life.

10
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.700
Yeah.
How did that go?
Ah,
not good.
I mean the free,

11
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.950
the first time it was my 24th birthday,
24th birthday,

12
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.790
uh,
I smoke with,
uh,
who was it?

13
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.930
A couple of friends of mine at the Olympic Training Center and they didn't do

14
00:00:57.931 --> 00:01:00.450
anything cause I don't even know how to,
I don't know how to hit the blind.

15
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.200
I don't know.
I didn't,
yeah.
So I was like,
man,

16
00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:08.960
this stuff don't affect me dog.
I ain't going to do this so,
so,

17
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.300
so I didn't say screw that if you want to do it again.

18
00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:17.301
And then the next time was the year after with Jason Miller.

19
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.420
I may have Miller.
Oh,
may have knows how to hit that.
We,
yeah,
we were doing,

20
00:01:21.421 --> 00:01:24.180
it was doing the ultimate fighter.
We were doing that.
And um,

21
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.540
one thing we do at night is a lot of people expect like,
man,

22
00:01:27.541 --> 00:01:32.040
when he's not on,
is that man super cool guy.

23
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.650
He's a dude.
I mean there's always like kind of like being around Mike Tyson.

24
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.310
There's always like Aj.
Yeah,

25
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:41.010
there's always that edge to where you're in the room with them,

26
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:43.800
with the fricking lion.
Like,
yeah,
he's cool as lion ever.

27
00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:47.370
But you still know what to fucking,
you know,
and may hams like that.

28
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.980
You're in a room,
everything's cool,
but he still has his,

29
00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:51.510
he can snap at any moment.

30
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.430
So we're sitting on the balcony at night and we'll just talk and he would just

31
00:01:56.431 --> 00:02:00.090
talk about these in the weird thing about my is he always watched,

32
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.230
like he watched nothing but like smart shit.
Like the news,

33
00:02:04.231 --> 00:02:08.160
like the Kobe or report,
like things like that,
you know,
he wouldn't watch.

34
00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:10.700
I would think he'd watched like nine oh two one oh oh

35
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.500
or break and shows like that.
Like,
no man,
he,
you know,

36
00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:20.310
he was very intelligent guy who would just sit there and talk and I,

37
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.830
and um,
he gave me that nickname that night too.
And freaking,

38
00:02:25.831 --> 00:02:29.400
he's like,
Bro,
your first name starts with a k,

39
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.950

41
00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:40.080
The next day on set,

42
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.530
everyone calls me Kush till this day people call me Kush.

43
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.300

00:02:51.301 --> 00:02:53.460
the name wasn't there cause that he start fighting yet.

45
00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:57.720
But so I've had nicknames all through all throughout my life,

46
00:02:57.721 --> 00:03:00.540

Yeah.
He's like,
I'm going to call you Marty.

80
00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:11.050
So fucking outline now the whole team is calling me Marty.

81
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.180
And so
people are so fun,

82
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.810
man.
I love those names.
I love that coach.
Man.
He essentially change,

83
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.520
essentially changed my life.
It changed the course of my life.

84
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.500
It was such a funny thing though to do.
Yeah.

85
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.760
And call you Marty close starts on a totally different letter.

86
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.860
I know,
but it seemed to work.
They worked so well to where,
um,

87
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.270
this is the thing about nicknames.
If you fucking,

88
00:05:40.271 --> 00:05:43.930
if you're a guy like just a regular average guy,
you suck.

89
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.410
Your name dies with you,
you move on on cares,
you know?

90
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.440
But if you're doing something incredible,

91
00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:52.240
something spectacular that name lives on.

92
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.560
So now Marty went from just now everyone on the team call me Marty too,

93
00:05:56.561 --> 00:06:00.800
where people know about the wrestling around the wrestling start.
Can,
you know,

94
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:03.770
in high school called me Marty.
Oh,
that Marty guy that did kids good.

95
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.240
And then now college coaches are calling like,
oh,
I want to recruit this kid.

96
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.710
You know,
this Kamari and kid.
And he's like,
oh Marty.
So now they,

97
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.270
oh no,
me as Marty.
So now I go to college and the coach is calling me Marty,

98
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.330
and now the college team is calling me Marty.
Now,

99
00:06:20.331 --> 00:06:23.930
here's the situation where this whole Ben asks when thing is,

100
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.040
like I just mentioned,
if I was just a regular guy who sucked,
no one cares.

101
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:32.960
No one knows your name,
you die out.
Right?
But because I made waves,

102
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.090
like I was that Marty kid that wrestled at Nebraska,

103
00:06:36.091 --> 00:06:38.750
that's beaten the shit out of everyone.
Division One,
two,
three,

104
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.710
Nai Juko doesn't matter.
Ben knows of me.

105
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.300
So you know,
he's trying to cling on as something to bring it back.
Like,
oh,

106
00:06:47.301 --> 00:06:51.260
this is funny.
I'm trying to hide from it.
No,
I really was Marty from Nebraska,

107
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.790
but everyone's at [inaudible] from the BRASSICA.

108
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.470
I really was that guy.
