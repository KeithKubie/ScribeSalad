00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:15.639
So, did you wanna try to get this table over
here just to see how that would feel?

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.169
Maybe see if we have like…

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:19.230
Yeah.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.970
See if it cancels out anything?

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.980
This goes up, right?

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.320
So, we have this. This goes up, this here,
you have this full.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.230
You decide whether you want to connect it
and this becomes much more like a wall like

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.350
this one, right?

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:51.430
All of a sudden, I thought about old Matisse
doing the cutouts in his studio.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.430
Yeah.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.920
Yeah.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.420
It's always an inspiration, right?

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:55.420
Yeah.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.220
Alvaro, do you want to invite everybody for
Sunday?

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.880
Yeah.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.860
Please come.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.680
It's gonna be a great show I think.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.220
There's some really amazing art in the building.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.420
So, we see you Sunday, Alvaro.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.200
Definitely.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.800
Please.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.280
Thank you, Alvaro.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.180
The thing that I can't hear so far is the
ambient noise of the airport.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.700
That's mostly in the back surround but I've
been really…

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:21.719
Did you hear it?

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.840
Yeah, but you really have to put your ear
up to the speaker to hear it.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.280
So, maybe those can be, at least the gain, the gain levels...

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.450
The thing is also in Athens we could never
hear it anyway because of the AC.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.689
Now, we have a much smaller AC so there's
a chance and…

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.299
The AC is part of the...

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:39.299
Absolutely.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.299
Was that you…

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.659
That was the whole thing in Greece is that
there were record highs.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.820
So, our busy AC was a survival method.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.020
So basically to the edge of the tape, right?

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.240
So, standing here I can still see it.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.240
This is still…

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.740
Yeah.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.679
It's not as much but it's in the image.

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.639
So, we have to go what, all the way here?

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:02.639
Still. It's still in the image.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.640
Still?

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.580
If the speaker was in the original position

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.000
it's half in the image.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
It's still in the image over there.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.000
And, in your new position, it's not.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
But if I'm here, both are in the image.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.540
So,  we have to see...

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.200
I'd like to see where, how far ....because if we have to go all the way back here

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.480
then we have to come up with a different solution.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.420
Yeah. So, let's start here.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.540
"More Wrong Things" is the title of this work.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:53.660
Yeah.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.799
I'm very happy with the installation.

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.150
It's, oh unique.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.690
It's been in different configurations.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:59.690
Yeah.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:08.560
But, here it is opened up to accommodate this
relatively small rectangular space and...

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:17.900
I'm just so happy with the full-on improvisation that
your crew put together to assemble this.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.060
And this is how it should look.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.739
Like a web.

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.500
And you're really inside it.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.120
Yeah.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.680
We're really inside it.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.739
And it's a web of intimate horrors.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:32.560
Intimate horrors?

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.060
Yeah.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.960
Yeah.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.048
And of course, it came to me serendipitously
from many different sources

00:03:39.048 --> 00:03:41.280
and that in itself was rather mysterious

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.460
like why was that happening

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:49.340
because the whole work was based on the death

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.040
of a very special cat

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.519
a stray cat who was ecstatic about everything in life.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.610
Was that Vesper?

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.740
No, it's name was Treasure.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.240
Treasure.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.840
Treasure, yeah.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.520
It's so clear how you're thinking about painting
even when you're doing a performative work

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.010
like Meat Joy.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.010
Yeah.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.150
And, that's one of the things we're trying
to do in this show, right, is situate your

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:19.810
entire body of work, your whole career through
the lens of painting as a premise, as a strategy

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.220
as a way of being in the world.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.880
As a discipline and a training because I keep
saying everything, I know in terms of structure

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.560
and materiality has to do with painting.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.540
Becoming an artist through painting

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.780
without any support or approval.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.280
Yeah, and here's all this approval.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.240
And, from the very beginning, I mean, you
were making paintings that were pushing against

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.500
what painting was.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.720
So, you were making abstract paintings in
the 1950s, but you were doing things

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.430
like making them spin on the wall.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.660
Shall I give it a little spin, this work "Pin
Wheel" from 1957?

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.880
[Laughs]

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:03.889
Yeah.

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:10.530
But, that's also the clue to the sense of
the kinetic energy that I wanted to get into

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:19.780
the physical perception of the brushstroke
as an event, as a transformation, as a discipline

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.680
and what was on the other side of it.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.480
Good afternoon. Thank you all for coming.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.800
It's great to see so many people here today to celebrate Carolee.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.260
Umm, yeah. Let's do that again. Carolee.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.940
If you haven't already, please also see our shows of

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.540
Cathy Wilkes, Alvaro Barrington and Naeem Mohaiemen,

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.640
which open as well today.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.660
Oh, yes.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.460
We had a Muslim man staying with us before

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.900
like in 1938.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.260
He was leaving Germany.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.860
I don't drink, Frank.

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:11.920
I am a Muslim man.
