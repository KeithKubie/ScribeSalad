00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.400
So the answer is none, that we can't actually make

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.670
any words with just this rule. And the reason for that

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.700
is this is a circular definition, and it's a circular

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.840
definition because we, we can never stop. If you remember the

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.780
rules for BNF grammars, that we can start from a

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.680
starting on terminal, and we keep doing replacements. We can only

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.820
stop once we have all terminals. We are never going to get

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.300
there if this is our only rule. We can keep adding

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.000
more counters, but we can never replace the non-terminal

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.110
word. Because every time we end up with the non-terminal

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.560
word again, on the right side. So with just

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.990
this rule, we can't actually make any words. All we

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.850
can do is start from word. Now our only

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.190
choice is to replace word, with counter-word well, we only

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.270
have one rule, so our only choice is to replace

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.330
the word here with counter-word. So now we end up

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.755
with counter-counter-word, but since word is a a nonterminal, we're

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:57.660
never done. So we can never make any word this way.
