00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.720
MALE SPEAKER: Good
afternoon and welcome to

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.870
Talks at Google in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.500
Today it's my great pleasure
to introduce Juan Enriquez

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.590
and Steve Gullans.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.190
Juan and Steve are here today
to talk about their book,

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.890
"Evolving Ourselves:
How Unnatural Selection

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.560
and Nonrandom
Mutation are Changing

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.720
Life on Earth," in
which they state,

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.010
"we are the primary
drivers of change.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.820
We will directly and indirectly
determine what lives,

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.720
what dies, where, and when.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.770
We are in a different
phase of evolution.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.340
The future of life
is now in our hands."

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.130
I don't know about
you, I don't know

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.180
if I'm quite ready for
this, so I'm hoping the talk

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.620
and the book will
give us a way forward.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.620
Juan and Steve are co-founders
of Excel Venture Management,

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.230
which build start-ups in
synthetic biology, big data,

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.750
and new genetic technologies.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.020
Juan is a TED all-star.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.020
He chairs the Genetics Advisory
Council at Harvard Medical

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.660
School, and was the founding
director of Harvard Business

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.550
School's life science project.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.880
Steve was a professor at Harvard
Medical School for 18 years.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.280
He has published more
than 130 scientific papers

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.380
in leading journals.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.460
He was elected a fellow of
the American Association

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.050
for the Advancement
of Science in 1998.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.564
Please join me in welcoming
Juan Enriquez and Steve Gullans.

00:01:42.564 --> 00:01:48.480
[AUDIENCE APPLAUSE]

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.610
JUAN ENRIQUEZ: So what I
think Steve and I would

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.875
like to do today is give
you a short introduction

00:01:53.875 --> 00:01:56.940
to the theme, and then
Steve will say a few words,

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.250
and then we'll chat and
answer any questions you have.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.940
And I want to start
with a truth and a dare

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.509
around a very specific question,
which is life's evolution.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.520
So let's just review Bio 101
for two or three minutes.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.790
This nice character,
Charles Darwin, one

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.776
of the greatest scientists
and humanitarians ever born,

00:02:21.776 --> 00:02:23.150
came up with the
notion that life

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.040
evolves according to two rules.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.170
This is the first sheet of when
he discovers, or thinks of,

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.670
evolution.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.650
It's the first time
he writes "I think"

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.927
and then draws a tree of
life as to how things evolve.

00:02:37.927 --> 00:02:39.760
And this sheet was
actually shown in Britain

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.570
a few years ago.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.140
It was absolutely
marvelous to see it.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.330
So how does life evolve?

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.209
Well, life evolves according
to natural selection.

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.750
And what does natural
selection mean?

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.410
It means that very small
variations in how a bird eats,

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.390
what is a predator to a
bird, what the climate is,

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.090
what diseases are
attacking it, can

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.410
lead to big changes in a body.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.030
In this case the
Galapagos finches,

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.270
depending on whether there was
water or there wasn't water,

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.520
would develop different kinds
of beaks to have tougher seeds

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.400
or to have smaller seeds.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.070
In a place like
this what you get

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.090
is a whole lot of
natural selection.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.280
So you get these
little micro-niches

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.520
where all of these
creatures learn

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.790
how to survive,
evolve within here,

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.340
and basically compete
against one another.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.500
And one of the ways
in which they compete

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.380
is they have their
genes randomly mutate.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.060
So this is like a
gene casino, where

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.200
you throw the dice
and the gene comes up

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.940
with this letter or this letter
or this letter or this letter.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.950
A random mutation
is exactly that,

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.390
which is the reason why you
can get cats with 23 toes.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.890
All right.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.290
It's a random process.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.610
Things appear and disappear.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:54.890
They don't have an order.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.560
There isn't a rhyme
or a reason for it.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.620
And those changes
which are beneficial

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.270
means that that creature
has children, who have

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.160
children, who have children.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.750
This occurs in human
beings as well.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.180
And sometimes it isn't pretty.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.400
Random mutation means you
could have six digits or seven.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.470
And when you're thinking about
the consequences of this,

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.329
sometimes when you
have random mutation

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.070
it actually looks
like it makes sense.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.610
Maybe if you're a coder.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.990
Maybe if you're a coder you
would want to have six fingers.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.570
Or of course, maybe if
you're a baseball pitcher.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.570
So this is Antonio Alfonseca.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.920
His nickname was The Octopus.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.620
He was born with 12
fingers, 12 toes,

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.230
and he became the relief pitcher
of the year in the year 2000.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.260
So it turns out that having
six fingers in the right place

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.050
allows you to do
things as a pitcher

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.300
that other people can't do.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.169
Random mutation works sometimes,
and often it does not.

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:02.710
So what are the
drivers of evolution?

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.840
What leads to
changes in evolution?

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.210
What creates
evolutionary pressure?

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.880
Well, you can have predators.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.570
If you have a
change in predators.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.930
If you take yourself in or
out of different food chains,

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.070
that can lead to certain
kinds of development.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.570
Changing your food,
changing your microbes,

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.340
your environment,
your population.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.280
If you become
domesticated, if you

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.000
change your labor or exercise
regime you can have changes.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.207
And the key question here
is, how many of these factors

00:05:31.207 --> 00:05:33.040
do you suppose have
changed for human beings

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.670
in the last century or two?

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.920
Do you think we have
changed the predators?

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.810
Are we still subject to grizzly
bears and mountain lions?

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.150
Have we changed our food?

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.720
Have we change the kinds
of microbes that attack us,

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.370
as we take out
smallpox and polio?

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.240
Have we changed our
environment just a little bit?

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.545
Have we increased
our population?

00:05:55.545 --> 00:05:59.750
Have we become a different
type of domesticated species?

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.870
And the jobs we have, are they
mostly outdoors and hard work

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.830
or are they a
different kind of job?

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.360
So as you go through
these questions let's

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.500
try a mind experiment.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.030
Let's draw up Charles Darwin in
the middle of Trafalgar Square

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.340
yesterday.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.740
So after the initial
brutal disorientation,

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.460
after trying to figure out
what all these cars are,

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.202
he'd begin to look around
and this is what he'd see.

00:06:25.202 --> 00:06:27.882
And he'd recognize most
of these buildings.

00:06:27.882 --> 00:06:30.530
And then in his little careful
way he'd take out his notebook

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.230
and start taking notes
and what would he see?

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.840
Well, the first thing he'd
see is, boy, human beings

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.810
have gotten awfully big.

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.720
Because now there's about
1.46 billion overweight adults

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.440
wandering around.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.270
And of course all of you saw
this in your last cross country

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.910
trip when the middle seat
was occupied by somebody

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:52.390
who liked your seat as well.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:56.990
House cats, house
dogs have gotten fat.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:01.050
The leading cause of
insurance claims today on pets

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.990
is complications
related to obesity.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.890
The interesting thing
is, it's not just

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:08.790
domesticated pets and
humans that are getting fat.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:11.940
It turns out a lot of wild
animals are getting fat.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.599
So in fact, there's
at least 12 species

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:15.140
of animals that are
sitting out there

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.730
that are getting fat
which you wouldn't expect.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.940
Lab rats are getting
fat, and all of you

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.020
know that when you
run an experiment

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.890
you don't want to have
changes in the variables.

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.220
So it's very odd that
lab monkeys, lab rats

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.860
are getting fat.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.650
It's even stranger that
wild horses that eat grass

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.420
are getting fat.

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:39.970
So it's not just Twinkies, it's
not just soft drinks out there.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:43.000
There's something else happening
in this environment that

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.680
is leading to obesity.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.510
A couple of potential
causes of this.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:51.280
The subtherapeutic
use of antibiotics.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.790
We're using a lot of
antibiotics on farms.

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:55.240
We don't use them
to cure disease.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.770
We use them because
when you feed

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:01.640
small amounts of antibiotics
to animals, you get weigh gain.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.580
Perhaps because
you can break some

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.180
of the microbes in the
stomach and therefore you

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.800
absorb more nutrients.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.640
As we put more and
more antibiotics

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.350
into the environment, and a
whole lot more antibiotics

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:16.390
are being used for
food promotion,

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:21.780
spraying it on fruit trees,
putting it into chickens,

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.970
putting it into pigs,
then we're putting

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.627
a whole lot of antibiotics
into the environment.

00:08:26.627 --> 00:08:28.710
Second thing that's happening
which is interesting

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:32.710
is, there's a whole class of
chemicals called obesogens that

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:34.820
tend to promote weight gain.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.419
So some of the chemicals
in our everyday products

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:40.870
make it easier for fat
to accumulate in bodies.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.280
And we're seeing that
effect not just on humans,

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.380
we're seeing it across
a series of animals.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.940
Second thing that's
happening, or second thing

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:52.500
Darwin would note is, we've
become a whole lot weaker.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.200
So a couple centuries
ago, most people

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.640
worked hard labor someplace.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.140
They were working
on assembly lines,

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.840
they were working
on industrial lines,

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.970
they were working on farms, they
were doing pretty brutal work.

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:07.395
And today of course
we have become coders.

00:09:07.395 --> 00:09:09.540
We have become office people.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.960
And sometimes if
we work out enough,

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.640
you don't have the same
effect, but for most of us

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.970
we are quite weak compared
to folks 150 years ago.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:24.732
Third thing he'd notice-- boy,
has this population gotten old.

00:09:24.732 --> 00:09:25.690
Where are all the kids?

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:27.450
There are so many
old people walking

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.690
around Trafalgar Square.

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:32.060
And of course, if there
was a race coming by then

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.875
you'd notice that there
were 75-year-olds that

00:09:34.875 --> 00:09:37.170
were beating the
younger people as they

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:40.490
race by in a half marathon.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:43.700
If you tabulate these and many
other changes, what you find

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:48.830
is, in a very short period of
time, in less than 150 years,

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:50.920
you get really
substantial changes

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.180
in the morphology
of the human body.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.110
If you saw this in
any other animal

00:09:56.110 --> 00:10:00.620
you would ask the question,
is this a new species?

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.880
And of course when you
ask that of human beings

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.260
you begin to get some visions
that perhaps tell you,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.470
not only is it heading
in a different direction,

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:09.830
but it might also be mutating.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:15.790
That leads to an
interesting question.

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:18.200
Were this guy
writing today, if he

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.470
were walking through the
labs here in Cambridge,

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:23.202
if he knew what we now know
about molecular biology,

00:10:23.202 --> 00:10:24.660
would he be writing
the same books?

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.920
And the answer is, it's not just
the morphology that's changing,

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.580
so are the basic
drivers of evolution.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.180
Let me explain that.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.500
For four billion years,
nature ran the show.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.310
So nature was in charge, OK?

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:40.660
And how was nature in charge?

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.640
You had natural selection.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.024
So survival of the fittest,
and you'd have this cycle,

00:10:45.024 --> 00:10:47.440
and what would happen is you'd
get these random mutations,

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.356
and the random mutations
would allow something

00:10:49.356 --> 00:10:52.210
that was on the verge
of going extinct to have

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:53.932
one version that may
have adapted better

00:10:53.932 --> 00:10:55.390
in that environment
that would then

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:58.811
survive, have a lot of
kids, thrive in that niche.

00:10:58.811 --> 00:11:00.560
And it was this cycle
of natural selection

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.770
and random mutation
that determined

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:08.000
what lived and died on earth
for close to 4 billion years.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Over the last century
what's ended up

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.040
happening is humans
now run half the show.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.630
So humans determine what lives
and dies on at least half

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:18.680
of the surface of
the earth and half

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.970
of the oceans of the earth.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:23.010
And what that means is
that unnatural selection

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:24.850
and nonrandom
mutation are beginning

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:29.415
to determine what lives and
dies, begin to drive evolution.

00:11:29.415 --> 00:11:31.290
Let me explain this.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.230
So for at least half
of life on Earth,

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:36.541
unnatural selection looks
something like this.

00:11:36.541 --> 00:11:38.510
This is not what you
would find if nature

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:40.390
were running the show, OK?

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:45.490
You do not find cattle-- you
find buffalo, but not cattle

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:46.790
on these kinds of plains.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.730
You do not find these kinds
of plants on these plains.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:52.070
You do not find human
beings traditionally

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:54.010
on these kinds of
plains, and you certainly

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.260
didn't find horses on
the American plains,

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.530
being ridden by humans.

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:00.980
You want to be
even more extreme,

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.340
just walk into a cornfield.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.870
What lives and
dies in a cornfield

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:07.260
has nothing to do with
what nature would select.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.550
It has everything to
do with what we want.

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:11.640
We don't want birds
eating the seed,

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.190
we don't want weeds
eating over here,

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:15.420
we don't want any
plants that aren't corn.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.290
We want corn and we
want it for miles

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:19.520
and we want it in orderly rows.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.460
That is not natural selection,
that is human selection.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:26.460
And our rural landscape
absolutely reflects this.

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:29.610
So as you go out
and you look at,

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:31.730
not only what does the
landscape look like,

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:36.190
but what grows there, we have
so thoroughly changed nature

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:40.480
to our purposes that wild
mustard weed, something

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:46.360
that looks like this, sometimes
has its flowers suppressed.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:51.200
When you suppress the flowers of
mustard weed you get broccoli.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.270
Otherwise you
wouldn't get broccoli.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:56.170
When you have bigger leaves
in the mustard weed then

00:12:56.170 --> 00:13:00.620
you get kale, which you can
buy downstairs in your cafe.

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.710
When you sterilize
mustard flowers then

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:04.710
you get cauliflower.

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:07.020
So you can take
this weed and you

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:10.170
can change the genes or the
physical characteristics

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:12.750
or the way it
grows and evolve it

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:17.600
to suit your purposes, your
size, your color, your desire,

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.784
your productivity.

00:13:18.784 --> 00:13:20.825
But that has nothing to
do with random selection,

00:13:20.825 --> 00:13:23.940
and that has nothing
to do random mutation.

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:27.660
That has to do with our
breeding, hybridizing,

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:31.115
guiding what we want
these plants to do.

00:13:31.115 --> 00:13:33.240
And of course we've been
doing this with ourselves.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.990
We've gone from being
primarily a rural species

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:39.520
that traditionally, for over
90 percent of its history,

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.690
lived in groups of about
150, and separated every time

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:48.720
it got above 150 into these
large urban communities.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.700
And what's happened in
the last decade or two is,

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.630
we've gone from being a
majority rural species living

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:59.380
in small towns and villages, to
being a majority urban species.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:03.060
And some of these urban areas
are getting quite large.

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.940
To be able to live in
communities like this

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:09.300
you have to change the animal.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:12.970
If you take a wild animal and
you change the environment

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:15.320
it can have some rapid
evolutionary pressure,

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.550
and the same thing is
happening with human beings.

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:21.440
Let me give you a sense of
how fast this is happening.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:26.190
So China, in three years,
used 150 percent more cement

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:28.730
than the US did in a century.

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:30.280
China, in the next
couple of decades,

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.840
is going to build 30 cities that
are as large as some of the 30

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.520
largest cities on the planet.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.920
This is an enormous
process of urbanization,

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.390
and something similar is
going to happen in India.

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:45.770
To domesticate ourselves, to
domesticate our pets, what

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:48.810
we have to do is we have
to take species, animals,

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:53.580
that normally don't live
together, de-wild them, teach

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.850
them to live with those
that are traditionally not

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:59.650
their friends, and teach
them a series of rules.

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:01.990
Because if you're going to
live in a very tight-knit

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:05.120
environment maybe
you can tolerate

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:09.025
a couple of psychopaths
on the Mongolian plain

00:15:09.025 --> 00:15:11.525
if you're going out as Genghis
Khan to conquer the continent

00:15:11.525 --> 00:15:13.730
and you've got the whole
continent in front of you.

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:16.840
But if you have five psychopaths
in your 60 story building

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.955
in New York or Hong
Kong or London,

00:15:18.955 --> 00:15:21.970
that is a very bad thing to do.

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.200
So what you end up
doing is you end up

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.370
domesticating not just dogs,
not just cats, but also humans.

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:29.790
And this process
of domestication

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:33.100
has been going on
for a long time.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:37.100
Those places that did not have
a state, did not have dictators,

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.390
did not have kings, were
incredibly dangerous

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:42.120
places to live in.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:45.490
So if you look at non-state
societies on the top,

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:49.090
your chances of being violently
killed throughout your lifetime

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:52.680
were astronomical, even when
compared with ancient Mexico,

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.780
the first line on the bottom.

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:57.190
So you take the Mayas,
you take the Aztecs,

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:59.450
you take the Toltecs-- you
take all these people who

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:02.570
would sacrifice thousands
and made the pyramids,

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:06.960
they were still a whole
lot less violent--

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:11.410
because it was a
state-sanctioned violence--

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:13.890
than were societies
that were not organized

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.770
into states societies.

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:19.356
Then by the time you get
to France the 19th century,

00:16:19.356 --> 00:16:20.480
the violence has come down.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.710
By the time you get to Western
Europe, US, and the world

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:26.920
in 2007 at the very bottom.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.380
So the world,
despite what you're

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:34.330
reading, which is horrendous
in Congo, in Mexico, in ISIS

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:38.650
and a whole series of places, is
a whole lot more peaceful today

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:41.210
than it's ever been.

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:43.771
All you have to do
is go to any museum.

00:16:43.771 --> 00:16:46.270
So if you go down the street
here to the Museum of Fine Arts

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:49.910
and you look at the paintings
from the 1400s and the 1500s,

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:53.820
what you're going to see is that
the entertainment on Saturday

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.990
was to see if you could
take somebody and burn them

00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:00.220
to death while you were
torturing them, while you were

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.680
whipping them, while
you were stabbing them,

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.290
before you dismembered them.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:08.060
And that was kind of common
entertainment, right?

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.050
Please don't do this
because we will hurt you

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:12.470
and we will make it
last for a long time,

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:15.400
and we will make an
example out of you.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:19.200
As we decided that these types
of things were not things

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.390
we wanted to see and we
did not want our kids

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:24.119
to see it in the main
square on Saturdays, what

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:27.660
started happening is we
began domesticating violence.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:33.780
So if you were a European
New Englander in 1650

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:38.850
you were eight times more likely
to die in a violent incident

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.530
than you were by 1800.

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:43.840
This is not applicable
to African Americans,

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.680
it's not applicable
to Hispanics,

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.900
but if you were a white
New Englander this

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:53.310
was a really, really
dangerous place in 1650

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:57.840
and it was far
less-dangerous by 1800.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.260
For other groups it took longer.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:03.970
So we continued to treat groups
of the population in absolutely

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:08.490
barbaric ways through
Darwin's time.

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:10.110
If you were an
escaped slave, this

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:12.000
is part of what
would happen to you.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.060
And you'd be left to
hang so that everybody

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.710
could see you suffer for days.

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:21.990
We do not consider this
rational, reasonable behavior

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:24.570
here or anywhere.

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:26.690
So as we go out and we
domesticate ourselves,

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:28.398
part of what we're
seeing is we're seeing

00:18:28.398 --> 00:18:30.460
this collapse in violence.

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:33.990
And this collapse in violence
is happening almost everywhere.

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:37.450
If you look at the G5 or
if you look at Boston.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:40.020
When I was in college,
the old combat zone

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.660
was not a place where you wanted
to get off the Trombly bus.

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:46.290
Today it's the funky
theater district.

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:48.150
Near your offices
in New York, Chelsea

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:50.590
was not the nicest place to be.

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:53.000
42nd Street was a
very dangerous street.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.490
Today it looks like Disneyland.

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:58.014
So as we go through this
process of rapid domestication,

00:18:58.014 --> 00:18:59.430
the other thing
that's happened is

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:01.580
we've been able to create
wealth on an absolutely

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:03.660
unprecedented level.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.720
For most of human
history, we could not

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.060
generate enough calories
to keep everybody alive.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:12.860
We had huge starvation incidence
and we had a huge incidence

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.520
of malnutrition.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.220
Today in Mexico the
incidence of obesity

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:20.560
is greater than the
incidence of malnutrition.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.400
And that's certainly true
of many other countries.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.922
So what we're doing these
days through businesses

00:19:25.922 --> 00:19:28.130
that are high tech businesses,
through a whole series

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:30.570
of educational structures,
by educating women,

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:34.050
by educating our kids,
is we're able to generate

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:36.020
enormous output
per person, which

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:39.030
is generating an
enormous amount of GDP

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:41.182
for the world as a whole.

00:19:41.182 --> 00:19:42.640
And the other thing
that's happened

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.400
in this process of
domestication is

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.850
nature-- this big, tough,
survival of the fittest,

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:51.707
select the people who
are going to survive--

00:19:51.707 --> 00:19:54.040
has all of a sudden become
this funky little thing where

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.280
we go out on a weekend and we
put on our little Patagonia

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.480
jacket and we put on our
little fluorescent things

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.770
and we go for a hike in nature.

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:02.470
We did not used to do that, OK?

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:04.520
The edge of the forest
was a dangerous place.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.162
It's a place where you could
become a part of the food chain

00:20:07.162 --> 00:20:09.370
because there were bears,
because there were mountain

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:11.650
lions, because there were
robbers, because there was

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:14.680
disease, because there were
a whole series of reasons why

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:18.854
most people for most of their
lives stuck very close to home.

00:20:18.854 --> 00:20:20.770
Because nature was not
a place to go and play.

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:23.540
Nature was a place
to be afraid of.

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.687
And today nature has
become our playground.

00:20:25.687 --> 00:20:26.770
We got out on the weekend.

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:29.600
I'm going for a
hike in the forest.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.460
Nature has become a
plaything for most of us.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:38.330
That is true even of most
violent weather events.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:40.304
As we get better at
predicting these things

00:20:40.304 --> 00:20:41.720
one of the things
that happens is,

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:45.660
every single decade
the deaths per year

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:49.100
and the death rates per year
have gone through the floor.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:51.410
As we get better at
predicting hurricanes

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:54.380
what you say is, be careful,
there's a hurricane coming.

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:57.650
Evacuate, put your things
up, get your flashlights,

00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:01.330
get your water, bring
the kids indoors.

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:03.670
As you get tornadoes,
tornado warning systems

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:04.920
are getting better and better.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.130
Now, this is not
true for everything.

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:09.310
It is not true for
earthquakes yet,

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:14.020
which also can be important
for the high-tech industry.

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.250
But on the whole,
your chances of dying

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:20.420
due to an extreme weather
event are dropping and dropping

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:23.110
and dropping as we
domesticate this.

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:25.190
So that's what un-natural
selection looks like.

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:27.160
Now let's talk about
non-random mutation

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:31.020
because that is also a
big driver of evolution.

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:32.890
Berg, Boyer, and Cohen.

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:34.880
It sounds like a law firm.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.000
But what these
three characters did

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.840
is they figured out how
to do what all you do,

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.726
which is how to code.

00:21:41.726 --> 00:21:43.350
Except they weren't
using digital code,

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:45.480
they were using life code.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.590
So these three
characters figured out

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:49.930
you can insert genes,
you can move genes,

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:52.310
you can do biotechnology.

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:54.820
They built some huge companies
coming out of this database

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:57.860
and they built a huge industry
and they began to change life

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.350
based on this stuff.

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:03.650
What that means is,
nature goes from operating

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:06.820
on a strictly random
mutation basis

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:09.560
to a non-random mutation basis.

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:12.230
And if I were to choose
to be mildly provocative

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:16.930
I'd say we're even heading
towards intelligent design.

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:18.830
What does this mean?

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:22.405
It means, if you spend about
$40 billion-- $40 million,

00:22:22.405 --> 00:22:27.110
not billion-- and you go out
and work for four or five years,

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:29.820
you can take a picture
that looks like this.

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.970
And I know you're wildly
excited by this picture.

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:33.710
So was I.

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:35.115
So what is this picture?

00:22:35.115 --> 00:22:37.820
Well, this picture is
the first bacterial cell

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:41.160
controlled by a chemically
synthesized genome.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:46.720
Which means Craig Venter and Ham
Smith and John Glass and a team

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.820
was able to go out and code
from scratch the operating

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:52.890
system for a cell.

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:55.650
That means that cells become
programmable in the same way

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:58.760
as you can program an Intel
chip and say to the chip,

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.890
please give me a map,
please give me a direction,

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:03.910
please give me a
review of a restaurant,

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:07.420
please give me a accounting,
please research this,

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:08.936
please code that.

00:23:08.936 --> 00:23:10.310
As long as it's
in ones and zeros

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:13.032
it really doesn't matter what's
moving through that chip.

00:23:13.032 --> 00:23:14.960
Well, what this
little cell means is,

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:21.170
you can begin to code this chip
to execute various functions.

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:24.340
Out of this little discovery
we created a company

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.075
called Synthetic Genomics.

00:23:26.075 --> 00:23:28.470
And what Synthetic
Genomics does is

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:31.500
it tries to make fuels for
one of the largest fuel

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.100
companies in the world.

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.320
It makes chemicals for one
of the largest chemical

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:36.278
companies in the world.

00:23:36.278 --> 00:23:39.410
It makes food for one largest
food companies in the world.

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:45.040
It stores information on an
absolutely massive basis.

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:48.170
It humanizes pig
organs so they can

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:50.560
be transplanted into humans.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.270
And the kinds of
coders that you're

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:57.750
going to see in a room like
this in a decade, two decades,

00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:00.230
three decades, are
increasingly going

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:03.600
to be people who are moving
between digital code and life

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:09.660
code because life code is
a very powerful system.

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:11.920
One big difference between
what coders do today

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:15.070
and what coders do
tomorrow is, this software

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:17.699
builds its own hardware.

00:24:17.699 --> 00:24:19.240
No matter how you
program a computer,

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.930
you're not going to find 1,000
computers in the morning.

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:24.200
But if I were to ask you,
who is the most published

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:31.354
author across all time in all
additions in all languages,

00:24:31.354 --> 00:24:32.770
most of you probably
wouldn't tell

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:35.530
it's George Church, who was
a Harvard Medical School

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:39.150
professor, who figured out
that anything you can code

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:42.420
in ATCG-- the four
letters of DNA-- you

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:44.600
can code in ones and zeros.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:49.010
So you could say A equals
00, T equals 01, G equals 10,

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:51.120
C equals 11.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.910
And digital code becomes
interchangeable with life code.

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:56.290
It becomes bioinformatics.

00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:58.270
And anything you can
write in digital code

00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:02.100
you can now write in life
code, with the difference

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.100
that this software makes
its own hardware, which

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:09.660
means he put his book into
a bacteria that reproduced

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:14.340
a billion times, and his first
edition was a billion copies.

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:17.780
You can store almost the entire
world's information in database

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:21.430
in a glass of water if
you're storing it in DNA.

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:24.510
So as this stuff
moves forward, instead

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:26.840
of having random
mutation-- and this

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:30.690
is a slide by Drew Endy where
he describes this process.

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:32.900
Random mutation takes
the first line of code

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.430
that you see up there.

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:36.890
So a creature is born,
a creature has no eyes,

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:40.170
it develops one eye, has a
few generations of one eye,

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:42.540
it tries two eyes,
two eyes are better.

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:46.070
Then it goes back to one eye
because it's a random mutation.

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:48.880
Then some of the one-eyed
survive but the two-eyed

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.359
do even better.

00:25:50.359 --> 00:25:52.400
And then starts developing
other facial features.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.240
But this is a very
long time scale.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:57.620
You're looking at centuries
or millennia for these things

00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:59.860
to take place.

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:01.500
When we start
controlling and making

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:04.430
this stuff non-random,
what we do is we go out,

00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:06.410
we find a mutation
we like, we sequence

00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:09.630
it, we put it into ATCGs,
put it in digital code,

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:12.700
synthesize it and put
it in another organism.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:15.770
And then things have
two eyes from then on.

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:17.770
So it goes from being
a random process

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:20.060
into being a very
directed process,

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.866
and this shortens the
time scale brutally.

00:26:22.866 --> 00:26:24.870
It means evolution
takes place according

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:29.850
to our will, our design,
in a short period of time.

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:32.180
That's why you're having
debates over the past month

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.954
over a technological
called CRISPR.

00:26:34.954 --> 00:26:37.370
CRISPR is something that was
developed very close to here,

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:39.150
in Cambridge, Mass.

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:42.790
It was developed first out of
yogurt, actually, [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:46.650
But there's three centers that
are pushing CRISPR very hard.

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:49.700
And what that means is,
instead of coding individually,

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:52.505
line by line, you can
take huge blocks of code

00:26:52.505 --> 00:26:54.130
and take them from
here and insert them

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:55.420
over here, and
taken them from here

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:57.003
and insert them over
here, which means

00:26:57.003 --> 00:27:01.270
you can have a very, very
rapid evolution of creatures

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:06.050
and species and bacteria
and plants and animals

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:09.100
in a very directed basis.

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:13.490
And high school kids and college
kids can use this technology.

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:15.530
And that's leading
some scientists

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:17.830
to ask the question,
what happens

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:20.730
if we start editing humans?

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:22.270
So within the past
month you've seen

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:25.530
letters like this and
reactions like this

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:28.740
because, among other
things, sometime this year,

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.970
the first human being
born to three parents

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:35.910
will be born in Great
Britain, genetically.

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:37.480
Why is that happening?

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:41.670
Because some children are
born with a random mutation

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:43.290
that is sometimes deadly.

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:46.300
Sometimes it's inherited,
but the consequences

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:48.350
are horrendous.

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:51.690
Basically it's like having
cells without a battery,

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:55.320
and you get all kinds of just
horrible medical side effects

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.490
and death early
for these children.

00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:58.620
So what are they doing?

00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:02.730
They're taking the cells
from a third human being

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:06.270
and inserting it
into the original egg

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:08.884
and changing the
gene code of that.

00:28:08.884 --> 00:28:10.300
That has a couple
of implications.

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.360
Implication number
one, first human

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.600
being born to three
genetic parents.

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:20.220
Implication number two, that
child, if he or she has babies,

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:23.460
will pass on this mutation
to their children.

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:25.240
So you're not just
editing the individual,

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:29.450
you're editing the subsequent
copies of that individual.

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:32.800
And that's a different gig
from just editing individuals.

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:40.110
Some people say this
is moving too fast.

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:41.280
Well, it is moving fast.

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:46.150
In part because of this zip
code, because every year

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:49.200
MIT hosts the international
genetically engineered machine

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.220
competition.

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:52.149
And you have a
bunch of coders who

00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:54.190
come in here, not with
computers, but with living

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:57.020
things that they've been
coding over the last year.

00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:59.310
And they show each
other what they've made.

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:01.350
So some of these kids
are coding bacteria

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:06.240
so they have a 100 megapixel
resolution on photographs,

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:09.520
about 10 times a
high-end digital camera.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.920
Some kids are coding yogurt
so that it substitutes

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:15.060
for part of your kidney.

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:18.360
Some kids are trying to make
television plasma screens that

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.560
are alive.

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.240
And the Tokyo yeam-- the Tokyo
team came in and made four

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:24.989
very simple changes.

00:29:24.989 --> 00:29:26.530
That came in and
they said, OK, we're

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:29.050
going to take a
basic bacteria, we're

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:31.930
going to make sure it
doesn't burn with radiation,

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:34.350
we're going to make
sure it doesn't freeze,

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:37.611
we're going to make
sure that it oxidizes,

00:29:37.611 --> 00:29:40.110
and we're going to make sure
that the thing doesn't sunburn.

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:45.780
Technically that's
not that big a deal.

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:49.360
Those are just four mutations
inserted into a bacteria.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.995
But when you ask these kids,
why are you doing this stuff,

00:29:51.995 --> 00:29:53.245
the ambition was breathtaking.

00:29:53.245 --> 00:29:54.661
Because what they
wanted to do was

00:29:54.661 --> 00:29:58.560
to stick this stuff in
the nose cones of rockets,

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.870
shoot them at the
Martian ice caps,

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:04.770
have the bacteria
land, survive, oxidize,

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:09.490
create an atmosphere that
would terraform Mars.

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:13.020
So the implication of software
that builds its own hardware

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:14.269
can be significant.

00:30:14.269 --> 00:30:15.810
And in the same ways
you used to have

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:17.800
internet cafes and
the same way as you

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.340
used to have these
little hacker clubs,

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:23.760
today you've got
these biocurious clubs

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:27.270
where, for $150, you
have access to all

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:32.820
the machines necessary to
begin to play with gene code.

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:34.685
So here's the
truth in this talk.

00:30:34.685 --> 00:30:37.060
The truth is, it's not the
religious fundamentalists that

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:40.080
are slowly killing Darwin.

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.836
It's science.

00:30:42.836 --> 00:30:45.210
And they're slowly killing
Darwin not because he's wrong.

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:48.640
Darwin is absolutely right
and he got the rules right,

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:51.680
and that's the way life
operated for four billion years.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:53.200
But what we've got
now is we've got

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.140
a parallel evolutionary
system that's

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:57.310
operating on a different logic.

00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:59.870
And that different logic
of what lives and what dies

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:04.370
depends on what human beings
want to decide to live or die,

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:07.010
not what nature is deciding.

00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:09.290
Humans are directly and
deliberately taking--

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:11.990
beginning to take
control over evolution.

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:15.990
And as they do so
a part of evolution

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:18.270
is now being driven by
un-natural selection

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:20.760
and non-random mutation.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:25.020
And that has a whole series
of implications for life.

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:28.110
So here's the dare in this talk.

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:30.482
Dare we take control
of evolution and deal

00:31:30.482 --> 00:31:31.940
with its symptoms
and consequences?

00:31:34.414 --> 00:31:36.080
And if you take that
question seriously,

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:39.360
there isn't anything on
earth that doesn't change.

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.480
You're going to see
changes in diseases we get,

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.442
you're going to changes
in how long we live,

00:31:43.442 --> 00:31:45.650
you're going to see changes
in the types of companies

00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:49.350
we build, you're going to
say changes in what we grow,

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:53.660
in what lives and what dies,
in new species coming up,

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:57.356
perhaps an extinct
species being resurrected,

00:31:57.356 --> 00:32:00.826
and whole series of
species disappear.

00:32:00.826 --> 00:32:02.700
There are symptoms and
there are consequences

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:06.080
of this rapid evolution, and
we should be asking ourselves

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:10.730
if we are going to redesign
bacteria, plants, animals,

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:12.590
and ourselves.

00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:15.370
What do we want to ask
archaeologists-- or what

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:19.400
do we want archaeologists to
find in 1,000 years and 10,000

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:21.770
years and 100,000 years?

00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:25.100
Because we now have
the power-- we're

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:30.000
beginning to have the power--
to answer these questions.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.520
Let me close with one last
thought, because you're all

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:33.870
coders.

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:35.700
There are decades
where nothing happens,

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:38.636
and then there are weeks
where decades happen.

00:32:38.636 --> 00:32:42.010
And that just happened
over the last year.

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:46.120
So for four billion
years, as far as we know,

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:49.840
most life was coded in DNA.

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:52.740
Most life was coded in
these four bands of ATCG

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:55.490
that are inside DNA.

00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:58.410
So you know what the code
was, you knew how to write it.

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:04.180
But as of the last year, because
of this lab, we now have AT XY.

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:08.450
What does that mean?

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:12.120
That means that now you have
a system of heredity that

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:16.700
passes on life code that is
written in chemicals that

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:18.700
are different from what
life on this planet

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:23.390
has been written for for
the last four billion years.

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:25.360
In theory, what
this means is, you

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.380
could create a
set of plants that

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:34.930
would be immune to most or all
viruses, most or all bacteria.

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:37.300
A completely parallel
evolutionary tree

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:40.460
that wouldn't breed with
this evolutionary tree.

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:45.169
You'd watch evolution happen
in a completely different way.

00:33:45.169 --> 00:33:46.710
Long-term, it means
we're going to be

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:50.330
able to code for wholly
different chemical

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:52.130
environments.

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:54.730
So if we wanted, for
instance, to live in a place

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:57.160
that was very
different from Earth.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.870
This begins to give you a sense
that maybe you couldn't design

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:01.420
something that
looks like humans,

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:05.250
but maybe you could design
bacteria for that place.

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:08.429
Maybe you could even design
basic plants or something

00:34:08.429 --> 00:34:11.670
that looks like them.

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:15.000
And that is why we all
have to pay attention

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.730
to how we're evolving
ourselves and what

00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:19.850
we're going to do with
this new-found power.

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:22.931
And now I'll let Steve
make some comments.

00:34:22.931 --> 00:34:24.529
[AUDIENCE APPLAUSE]

00:34:24.529 --> 00:34:26.070
STEVE GULLANS: I'm
going to follow up

00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:29.170
with just a few minutes to try
to personalize a little bit,

00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:32.219
and in terms of what
does this mean to you.

00:34:32.219 --> 00:34:34.909
It sounds like a very
big idea, a lot of ideas,

00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:37.750
and how is it actually relevant
to getting up and walking out

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:40.980
and thinking about next week,
next month, next year for you.

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.900
About a year and a half
ago, while writing the book,

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:45.870
Juan and I were living
in this bizarre world

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:49.239
that you've just seen, trying
to pull pieces of it together.

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:50.810
My wife and I were
sitting there when

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:52.460
we got a Skype call
from my daughter

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:54.929
and my son-in-law announcing
that they were-- my daughter

00:34:54.929 --> 00:34:56.320
was pregnant.

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.580
And with that I panicked,
because I suddenly

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:01.120
knew too much about
evolution at a time

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:04.340
when I had no idea
where my DNA was headed

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:06.530
and I needed to come
to grips with this.

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:10.715
I spent furious weeks actually
creating a new chapter.

00:35:10.715 --> 00:35:13.680
And it's called A
Perfectly Modern Pregnancy,

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.030
as you'll see in the book.

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:17.000
And what's interesting
about this is,

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.210
you and I and the
people in this room

00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:22.220
live in a very different world
than people in Darwin's day.

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:26.620
We're educated, we have
a perfect indoor climate

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:29.500
every day, we have modern
medicine, we are smarter,

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:31.160
we have all of these
great attributes.

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.700
In fact, life is
pretty good for us.

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:35.780
So why would these scenarios
about evolution changing

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:38.470
have an impact on us
in any way, shape,

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:40.530
or form that we would
really care about?

00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:43.360
Well, this is when I bumped
into this world called

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:45.400
transgenerational
inheritance, or

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:48.380
transgenerational heritability.

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:53.250
It turns out that every mother
and father at the earliest

00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:56.460
ages, in fact in utero,
are going to become parents

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.910
someday, and their
sperm and eggs

00:35:58.910 --> 00:36:03.420
are carrying on the surface
little listening receptors,

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:05.860
listening to the world at large.

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:09.120
So that the next generation,
once you become pregnant,

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:13.020
is informed it's time to
famine, it's time to plenty.

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:15.780
There's a bacterial
infection out there,

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:17.550
there's violence going on.

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:19.920
And so in fact the
next generation

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:23.840
is being prepared without
it having even big conceived

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:26.720
or in utero, for what
it's about to come into.

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:30.360
And we've seen this over
the last about 100 years

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:31.260
of studies.

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:35.630
Very rarely in humans, at
times of war we find famine

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:37.390
and it's actually propagated.

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:39.810
Famine in parents or
parents to be is propagated.

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:43.230
It's metabolic, heart
disease, and schizophrenia

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:46.930
two generations later, even
though everybody in between,

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:49.960
including the original
grandparents, had enough food.

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.590
There's also good
scenarios, where

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:53.890
people have actually
good exposures

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:56.580
to life, that actually
have very good outcomes.

00:36:56.580 --> 00:37:00.410
So in fact there is a memory, a
memory of a life we're living,

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:02.220
the memory of the life
our parents lived,

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:05.190
and a memory of our
grandparents lives that resides

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:07.025
within us that lives every day.

00:37:07.025 --> 00:37:07.900
What's the good news?

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:09.950
We live great
lives by and large,

00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:11.960
compared to what
happened before.

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:16.430
But we also see-- in other words
we're seeing we're brighter,

00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:19.010
we have less disease
in general, we

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:21.120
have actually fewer headaches.

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:24.920
But were also saying rises in
a number of conditions, autism,

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.550
obesity, and everything else.

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:27.870
Nobody can find the genes.

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:29.340
We discussed this in the book.

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:32.320
You generally find genes
that account for about 5%.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.340
But meanwhile,
this nature nurture

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:37.320
is locked in synchrony
to figure out

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:39.625
how to take care of
the next generation

00:37:39.625 --> 00:37:41.290
in the world to come.

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:43.380
So as my daughter
was having the baby

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:45.820
I was going through
month-by-month looking

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:48.310
at what food she was eating,
what vitamins were going on,

00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:51.860
the recent peanut allergy
thing that came out.

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:54.262
I had her shipping
her peanuts every week

00:37:54.262 --> 00:37:55.470
to eat when she was pregnant.

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:56.730
And she was going,
what's this about?

00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:59.360
But I was seeing abstracts in
the literature about exposure

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.590
to antigens.

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:03.650
So as we live over
the next few years--

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:06.145
and my daughter came out
with a beautiful pregnancy.

00:38:06.145 --> 00:38:07.520
You actually saw
my granddaughter

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:09.540
in the pictures of
the mutated chicken.

00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:12.340
That was her Halloween
costume this last year.

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:16.930
Although we're still curious
about my son-in-law's DNA,

00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:17.890
to be honest.

00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:22.040
But frankly the world at
large for my granddaughter

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:24.440
is going to be beautiful,
but we have many things

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:25.820
to learn in the near term.

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:28.620
And in fact, just one
final note about-- what

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:30.890
is it that is coming?

00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:33.304
We all have DNA, we
all understand DNA.

00:38:33.304 --> 00:38:34.470
It's the be all and end all.

00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:36.790
It turns out, in a
computer context that's

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:38.570
like the operating system.

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:40.440
It virtually never changes.

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:43.610
It's the most boring
part of our biology.

00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:47.000
In fact, we have four genomes
that we're all born with.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.100
And one keeps us alive,
keeps us reproducing.

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:51.430
That's our DNA.

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:54.130
We're all 99.9%
identical, otherwise

00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:56.120
we wouldn't survive
as a species.

00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:00.070
The other two are your epigenome
which is switches on your DNA

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:01.340
that get flipped.

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:03.210
This is what happens
when the famine comes.

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:04.900
This is what happens when
the violence changes,

00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:06.450
when the weather
comes, when you're

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:09.790
deprived of love as a child, why
does it turn to heart disease

00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:10.852
when you're 80?

00:39:10.852 --> 00:39:12.560
These are these switches
getting flipped.

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.680
That's a very important genome.

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:17.730
And the epigenetic code
has not been uncovered.

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:20.807
And that's like having
programs like Word or Microsoft

00:39:20.807 --> 00:39:22.390
or, you know, any
of the applications.

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:24.420
The next one is your
microbes in your body.

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:25.950
We're now finding
microbes that are

00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:27.980
providing 30 percent
of the nutrients

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:29.550
and toxins in our body.

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:31.250
Every day we are
carrying these around.

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:34.040
They've changed completely
in the last 50 years because

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.090
of antibiotics, because
of the food we eat,

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:37.820
we are totally
engineering the microbes.

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:39.110
This is like little apps.

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:41.500
They're actually sitting
on top of our genome,

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:43.510
changing little
applications every day.

00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:45.930
And they will be engineered
into functional foods

00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:47.190
in the next decade.

00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:49.770
And finally there's
viruses that live in us.

00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:51.710
At the DNA level
they're 10-fold more

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:54.890
abundant than bacteria, which
are 10-fold more abundant

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:56.380
than our human cells.

00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:58.820
This is the dark matter
of humanity right now.

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:01.427
These viruses that live in
us, we do not understand.

00:40:01.427 --> 00:40:03.010
They're driving our
evolution, they're

00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:05.710
driving our nature every day,
and there's more to come.

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:08.440
But what I can say is, if you
have a healthy, happy life

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:10.000
and follow the
basic rules that you

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.772
hear every week
from your doctor,

00:40:11.772 --> 00:40:13.480
things are going to
work out pretty well.

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:16.075
And with that I'll say,
thank you very much.

00:40:16.075 --> 00:40:17.751
I hope you read our book.

00:40:17.751 --> 00:40:21.680
[AUDIENCE APPLAUSE]

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:23.830
JUAN ENRIQUEZ: Questions?

00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:24.330
Comments?

00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:25.470
Rebuttals?

00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:26.356
Please.

00:40:26.356 --> 00:40:29.272
AUDIENCE: Isn't this sort
of the logical [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:29.272 --> 00:40:31.702
of any self-replicating
system [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:31.702 --> 00:40:33.632
and therefore perfectly natural?

00:40:33.632 --> 00:40:34.132
I mean--

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:40.140
JUAN ENRIQUEZ:
There's a whole debate

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:42.220
as to what's actually natural.

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:46.740
So when you go to a organic
food market on a weekend

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:48.990
and you go shopping for
all these wonderful organic

00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:53.480
things-- all natural corn
used to be called teocintley

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:55.920
and it was smaller
than your thumbnail

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.060
and it had multi-colored
grains and they

00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:00.070
didn't fall off easily.

00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:04.950
All natural tomatoes used to
be green, tiny, and poisonous.

00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:07.010
Potatoes used to be poisonous.

00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:10.840
So what we've been doing
for a long period of time

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:13.424
is to evolve things
to our purposes

00:41:13.424 --> 00:41:14.840
and select things
to our purposes.

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:16.700
Now, what we've
been doing lately

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:21.650
is we've been doing things that
are, I think, far more extreme.

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:23.750
On the one hand you
could say, well, humans

00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:26.570
are just a evolutionary system
and they're a natural outgrowth

00:41:26.570 --> 00:41:28.710
of an evolutionary system.

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:31.000
Yeah, but I think
it's important to make

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.180
a distinction between
what we're doing,

00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:34.680
how we're engineering
stuff, and how

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:36.550
things worked in Darwin's time.

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:39.529
Because if you don't do that,
then what ends up happening

00:41:39.529 --> 00:41:41.820
is you don't take responsibility
for what you're doing.

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:44.150
You kind of say, you know,
this stuff just happens.

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:46.440
It's all natural, que sera sera.

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:48.200
And it's not que
sera sera, right?

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:54.420
It's, I choose to do this at
this point to this species.

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:56.310
And that has real consequences.

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:59.530
And if we want to continue
to have the power we have

00:41:59.530 --> 00:42:01.090
and continue to
deploy it, we better

00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:04.015
recognize that this is a
break point in evolution.

00:42:04.015 --> 00:42:05.765
STEVE GULLANS: And
we're just following up

00:42:05.765 --> 00:42:06.598
on what Darwin said.

00:42:06.598 --> 00:42:09.780
He attributed natural selection
that anything was effectively

00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:10.990
not driven by humans.

00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:14.290
He used terms like artificial
selection, human selection,

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:15.892
because he understood
animal breeding.

00:42:15.892 --> 00:42:17.100
He understood plant breeding.

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:19.190
But he said these are
two different worlds.

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:21.390
And from his perspective,
150 years ago,

00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:24.080
nature will always win.

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:26.718
That's what we think
is in debate now.

00:42:26.718 --> 00:42:29.375
AUDIENCE: I guess I can't
get a sense of whether or not

00:42:29.375 --> 00:42:31.458
you guys think this is a
good thing or a bad thing

00:42:31.458 --> 00:42:33.830
to have the ability to do this.

00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:36.230
JUAN ENRIQUEZ: Well,
it's up to all of us.

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:40.480
We tend to be
optimistic curmudgeons

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:43.140
but, you know, it's
what we choose.

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:43.640
Right?

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:47.610
It's not just, oh my
goodness, this happened to me.

00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:50.020
There are consequences
to choices.

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:56.580
AUDIENCE: So what
would happen if we

00:42:56.580 --> 00:43:04.780
use this technology to engineer
our own selves to live forever?

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:08.170
And then we don't care
about future generations

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:09.990
because we'll just
stop procreating

00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:15.127
and-- isn't that a
possible scenario?

00:43:15.127 --> 00:43:17.210
STEVE GULLANS: It's certainly
a possible scenario.

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:19.010
I mean, the way we
see new technologies

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:21.370
in terms of health
care kinds of systems

00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:24.150
like we're talking about here
is, first you do the obvious.

00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:27.700
You take on tragic
neonatal diseases,

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:30.260
children born with genetic
problems and things like that.

00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:31.926
In fact, the first
gene therapy was just

00:43:31.926 --> 00:43:34.210
approved three years
ago for an inborn

00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:37.830
error of metabolism for kids.

00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:40.220
From there you move
into older people,

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:41.852
like cancers and
things like that.

00:43:41.852 --> 00:43:43.310
And that's where
these technologies

00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:44.601
are getting deployed right now.

00:43:44.601 --> 00:43:48.130
And we're at the very dawn
of these technologies having

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:48.950
an impact.

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:51.226
But in other aspects
of other things

00:43:51.226 --> 00:43:52.850
we've seen in health
care technologies,

00:43:52.850 --> 00:43:56.980
it's not very long before
they move into beauty.

00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:58.450
For example, you
have Lasik surgery

00:43:58.450 --> 00:43:59.760
because people don't
want to have glasses.

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:00.450
You have Botox.

00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:02.450
You have all of these
things that were initially

00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:04.820
designed to treat
diseases are actually

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:06.526
being treated for other things.

00:44:06.526 --> 00:44:08.400
And so aging and then
beauty, and then sports

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.780
comes in with the growth
factors and things like that.

00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:12.155
AUDIENCE: And you
can give people

00:44:12.155 --> 00:44:13.770
blood serum of younger people.

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:14.080
STEVE GULLANS: Absolutely.

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:14.790
And--

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:15.970
AUDIENCE: And also your own.

00:44:15.970 --> 00:44:17.490
You can donate now.

00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:20.590
STEVE GULLANS: There are many
ways-- so you go, I want health

00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:24.912
and then I want to not age, and
then I want to live forever,

00:44:24.912 --> 00:44:26.370
is basically what
it comes down to.

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:28.500
And people appear to
continue to pursue this.

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:31.730
Now, the technologies that
are going to come to be used

00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:33.360
are going to be more powerful.

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:35.580
And it really comes first
down to safety and costs.

00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:37.850
When will they be safe
and cost effective?

00:44:37.850 --> 00:44:39.642
And at that point--
well, we need

00:44:39.642 --> 00:44:41.350
to have a debate now--
but at that point,

00:44:41.350 --> 00:44:44.300
the rules will probably change
in terms of how societies look

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:47.790
at it, just as we have
rules around taking vaccines

00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:48.930
for the measles.

00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:51.560
It's not viewed as
a personal choice

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:53.560
in many parts this country,
whether you actually

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:55.330
get the measles or not.

00:44:55.330 --> 00:44:58.180
AUDIENCE: But I
would argue that it's

00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:03.170
a personal choice if you want to
live forever versus, you know--

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:08.740
and not have any children,
versus having children and then

00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:13.247
deciding to make room
for them on this planet.

00:45:13.247 --> 00:45:15.080
JUAN ENRIQUEZ: But see,
even your question--

00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:18.610
which is an interesting
question-- we decouple sex

00:45:18.610 --> 00:45:20.410
from time.

00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:22.890
So for our grandparents
it was basically,

00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:25.750
marriage and kids
a few months later.

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:26.422
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:45:26.422 --> 00:45:27.880
JUAN ENRIQUEZ: And
today we choose.

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:30.470
You know, I'm not going to have
kids for the next three years,

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:32.130
or even if I'm
going to have kids

00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:35.440
I can have kids and freeze
the sperm, freeze the eggs,

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:38.580
freeze the fertilized eggs, put
them into a surrogate mother

00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:42.470
and have a child that is
born years after conception.

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:44.860
And now you're beginning to
say, not only can I do that,

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:49.020
but I can begin to do some
diagnostics on the genes

00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:51.540
or I can change
part of the genes.

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:55.900
So there's a whole series of
really important questions that

00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:58.820
are going to change
and challenge us

00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:01.609
and our kids in ways that
we just can't imagine.

00:46:01.609 --> 00:46:03.150
None of us are going
to live forever.

00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:09.220
But we did double the
lifespan in the last century.

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:12.810
And we're likely to double the
lifespan again in this century.

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:15.500
And after that, as these
things accelerate-- right now

00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:17.910
we're adding about one year
of life per every 10 years

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:19.260
we live.

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:24.100
And as this stuff accelerates,
if life or consciousness

00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:27.460
becomes downloadable, then
you get some very interesting

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:27.960
effects.

00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:34.980
AUDIENCE: Devil's advocate here.

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:36.800
STEVE GULLANS: The curmudgeon.

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:39.830
AUDIENCE: So we all know one
of the most pressing concerns

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:43.420
about all of this is an
unlucky accident, right?

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:46.020
What was that science fiction
short story about Ice-nine?

00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:48.020
Wasn't it Ray Bradbury
or something where it got

00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:49.850
dropped in the sink
and the world froze?

00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:50.826
OK?

00:46:50.826 --> 00:46:51.500
STEVE GULLANS: Kurt Vonnegut.

00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:53.500
AUDIENCE: Yeah. "Cat's
Cradle" by Kurt Vonnegut.

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:54.010
OK.

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:56.380
So what if we, you know,
accidentally mutate

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:59.800
or deliberately mutate a
virus or a bacteria, something

00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:03.210
small most likely, that's
really good at what it does

00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:06.540
and it doesn't like-- well,
maybe we're food, right?

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:08.180
And we're kind of a
monoculture, right?

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:12.330
So you must get this question
all the time, don't you?

00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:13.534
And how do you answer that?

00:47:13.534 --> 00:47:15.950
JUAN ENRIQUEZ: I turn to Steve
and I say, go ahead, Steve.

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:23.060
STEVE GULLANS: We deal with
dystopian futures all the time

00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:23.970
and stuff like this.

00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:27.440
And it's been if you go
back to [INAUDIBLE] it's

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:29.030
the idea that
everything is coming

00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:32.620
to an end because of some new
technology is not unusual.

00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:34.290
That's a pretty typical thing.

00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:36.070
To think that this
is more powerful,

00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:39.190
at least today, than anything
we've ever seen before,

00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:41.550
in some ways is true but
in many ways is not true

00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:45.450
because it underestimates
what we as a human species,

00:47:45.450 --> 00:47:47.056
both technically
and I think morally,

00:47:47.056 --> 00:47:48.180
are going to be able to do.

00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:51.610
And that's because I'm working
from an optimistic perspective.

00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:53.570
I think our ability to
control these things

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:55.660
is better than
people appreciate.

00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:59.580
JUAN ENRIQUEZ: And the flip side
is, we're also building things

00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:02.230
like a digital
biological converter that

00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:06.280
will allow you to take
a small vial of flu,

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:11.480
sequence it, put it into a
computer program that compares

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:14.990
it to every known
flu, design a vaccine,

00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:17.480
beam that up to an airplane
and print a vaccine

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:20.270
before that airplane lands.

00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:23.110
So as we meet new
challenges as things

00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:26.710
evolve, as things
get created, I'm

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:28.660
pretty optimistic we're
going to be able to go

00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:30.060
after a whole series of things.

00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:32.920
I think we'll be able to
take out cancer probably

00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:35.910
in the next decade
or two, most cancers.

00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:38.530
I think after that
you've got to take out

00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:40.050
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:43.120
And once you do that then one of
the leading cause of accidents

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:47.520
in the world, with some research
that Steve did, is accidents.

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:49.220
It's falling down
staircases, it's

00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:51.460
getting tangled in bed
sheets, that's what

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:54.330
starts to kill a lot of people.

00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:57.160
Because we've gotten rid of
most of the top 10 killers

00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:58.716
from Darwin's time.

00:48:58.716 --> 00:49:01.460
If you look at top 10
causes of death in 1850,

00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:04.990
we've gotten rid of almost all.

00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:08.870
AUDIENCE: I very earnestly
hope you're right about that.

00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:11.030
JUAN ENRIQUEZ: So do I.
And if we're not right

00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:13.720
I'll give you a really
expensive bottle of wine.

00:49:16.451 --> 00:49:18.200
AUDIENCE: So you made
a lot of comparisons

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:19.940
to computer science.

00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:22.820
And I think one
thing that has really

00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:26.960
accelerated the speed at which
we can write computer code

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:30.280
is that we went from punch
cards, to assembly language,

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:31.430
to Java.

00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:33.850
And now-- Python, right?

00:49:33.850 --> 00:49:35.820
And you can just, like,
download libraries

00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:38.400
that do the common things
that you need to do

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:41.100
and you're just--
you're writing your code

00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:42.210
at a much higher level.

00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:46.159
Are there initiatives to do this
on a biological scale as well?

00:49:46.159 --> 00:49:47.950
STEVE GULLANS: There's
lots of initiatives,

00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:52.430
both in terms of designing
things and building things.

00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:55.810
And the first point I
should make is, like coding,

00:49:55.810 --> 00:49:57.210
you can learn it as a child.

00:49:57.210 --> 00:49:59.110
Manipulating genes you
can learn as a child.

00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:01.539
These are basically recipes
you can do in your kitchen.

00:50:01.539 --> 00:50:03.330
And you can go to the
internet and find out

00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:04.320
what the-- we're
talking about bacteria

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:06.020
that grow naturally everywhere.

00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:07.750
In the dirt, on your
kitchen counter,

00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:09.890
anything, and learning
how to manipulate those

00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:12.980
is not a huge technical change.

00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:15.460
We have not been operating at
a level of, basically, ones

00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:19.270
and zeros with ATCG and
higher-level programming

00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:21.325
languages effectively
are coming out right now.

00:50:21.325 --> 00:50:21.950
AUDIENCE: Yeah?

00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:23.020
STEVE GULLANS: These are
some of the companies we're

00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:24.603
seeing-- yeah-- where
you can actually

00:50:24.603 --> 00:50:27.370
take a metabolic pathway
and slot that in,

00:50:27.370 --> 00:50:30.420
and you can take a sensing
pathway and put that in.

00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:33.410
And then the synthetic
systems to build these things,

00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:36.196
computerized, roboticized
events are actually

00:50:36.196 --> 00:50:38.894
going to allow you to
assemble things in--

00:50:38.894 --> 00:50:40.060
AUDIENCE: At a higher level.

00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:42.870
STEVE GULLANS: And there's
libraries of functional units.

00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:44.320
These are called BioBricks.

00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:47.010
Actually the name was made up
here in [INAUDIBLE] and people

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:48.220
at the MIT.

00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:48.830
BioBricks.

00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:50.500
These are actually
functional units

00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:52.150
from different species
that are stored

00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:53.780
and they actually give
you a three by five card

00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:55.530
with a gene on it--
spotted onto it if you

00:50:55.530 --> 00:50:56.910
want to take it home with you.

00:50:56.910 --> 00:51:00.820
So this is no different than
the 4H club or the erector set

00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:03.040
in terms of understanding
the components in building.

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:05.309
And we know there will be
higher level things that

00:51:05.309 --> 00:51:06.600
are built on top of each other.

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:07.266
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:51:07.266 --> 00:51:09.804
Thank you.

00:51:09.804 --> 00:51:11.220
AUDIENCE: So coming
back to random

00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:13.910
versus non-random mutation.

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:16.480
You'll have to excuse my
ignorance in this field,

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:19.120
but what is the
source of randomness

00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:21.432
for the random mutation?

00:51:21.432 --> 00:51:22.890
STEVE GULLANS:
Random mutation-- we

00:51:22.890 --> 00:51:26.910
have three billion GATs and Cs
in a single set of chromosomes

00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:30.290
in a human, and every
time a cell divides--

00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:32.900
and you're filled with
gazillions of cells-- it has

00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:35.120
to make an exact copy of that.

00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:37.290
And that exact copy
is done by enzymes.

00:51:37.290 --> 00:51:40.050
And going from mother
to child there's

00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:43.030
about 100 errors made
in that copying process.

00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:46.450
It's just a stochastic,
as far as we can tell,

00:51:46.450 --> 00:51:49.750
almost random or random
event across the genome.

00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:52.105
And so these are just a
single G or a single T

00:51:52.105 --> 00:51:53.630
or A or C is changed.

00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:56.850
And if it doesn't affect you
functionally you're fine.

00:51:56.850 --> 00:51:59.450
A simple arithmetic
analysis says,

00:51:59.450 --> 00:52:02.620
if there's 7 billion
people on the planet you

00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:04.142
have 3 billion bases of DNA.

00:52:04.142 --> 00:52:05.850
So there's more people
than there is DNA.

00:52:05.850 --> 00:52:07.080
And everybody carries 100.

00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:11.090
That means 700 billion
DNA sequence errors exist.

00:52:11.090 --> 00:52:13.770
So every possible mutation
that you can live with

00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:15.079
exists already on this planet.

00:52:15.079 --> 00:52:17.370
We just have to sequence
everybody to see what's there.

00:52:17.370 --> 00:52:18.786
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
but if the process

00:52:18.786 --> 00:52:21.310
is a purely
mechanical or chemical

00:52:21.310 --> 00:52:23.700
I don't see a source
of randomness there.

00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:26.810
STEVE GULLANS: The
randomness is-- well,

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:30.337
could make it more frequent
with radiation and other things.

00:52:30.337 --> 00:52:31.420
It's a thermal inactivity.

00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:34.800
It's a mis-recognition
of the perfection.

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:37.650
The idea is, an enzyme is
looking for a substrate.

00:52:37.650 --> 00:52:40.910
And apparently it gets it
right 99.9% of the time

00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:42.375
in finding the right substrate.

00:52:42.375 --> 00:52:45.000
JUAN ENRIQUEZ: And the nuance in
your article-- in your comment

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:50.110
is important because when
you look at DNA research

00:52:50.110 --> 00:52:53.120
by Ting Wu over at
Harvard is showing

00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:57.220
that there are highly
conserved sequences that

00:52:57.220 --> 00:53:00.010
are common to animals,
that are common to humans,

00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:01.350
that are common to plants.

00:53:01.350 --> 00:53:04.730
So there are certain
pathways, certain genes

00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:07.940
that are common across
various species.

00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:10.380
It means, if you get a
random mutation in that,

00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:13.380
likely the animal dies
or the plant dies.

00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:15.100
So some of the sources
of randomness--

00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:17.560
if you get radiation
and the radiation

00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:19.670
hits and splits your
DNA in a certain way,

00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:22.290
if a chemical comes in
and splices your chemical

00:53:22.290 --> 00:53:24.530
in a different way,
if the sun comes in,

00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:27.690
if alcohol comes in,
if tobacco comes in,

00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:29.040
if coal smoke comes in.

00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:30.660
So there's a whole
series of things

00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:34.350
that are trying to rip
your DNA apart every day

00:53:34.350 --> 00:53:37.180
and your DNA is continuously
re-stitching and remaking

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:38.150
itself.

00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.650
Right?

00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:42.750
And in a bunch of these places
those cuts are at random.

00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:45.290
If they're cuts at random
in the wrong place,

00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:46.960
the organism will die
and not reproduce.

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:49.820
STEVE GULLANS: You
get cancer, basically.

00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:54.440
AUDIENCE: So if you look at
the DNA as a closed system,

00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:56.770
there's no-- you're
saying there would

00:53:56.770 --> 00:53:59.447
be no sources of
randomness in that case.

00:53:59.447 --> 00:54:01.280
STEVE GULLANS: If it
was 100 percent closed.

00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:04.110
But just a cosmic ray coming
in and hitting the DNA

00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:06.390
can actually cause a
single base to change.

00:54:08.974 --> 00:54:10.140
And that has to be repaired.

00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:11.598
And if it's not
repaired properly--

00:54:11.598 --> 00:54:13.799
and so the point of
living to 100 is,

00:54:13.799 --> 00:54:16.090
this is happening every day,
every second in our bodies

00:54:16.090 --> 00:54:16.970
in every single cell.

00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:18.370
We're trying to correct things.

00:54:18.370 --> 00:54:20.200
It is a very rare event
for these mutations

00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:24.580
to arise because we have so many
redundancies in the pathways.

00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:26.690
Not wholly closed.

00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:28.770
AUDIENCE: So my question
is, what sort of effects

00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:31.880
are humans having on the
random mutation side of things?

00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:36.050
Do we see a change in
random mutation rates?

00:54:36.050 --> 00:54:39.954
I mean, I could see things
being radiation or hormones.

00:54:39.954 --> 00:54:42.370
STEVE GULLANS: Well, that was
a piece of the last century.

00:54:42.370 --> 00:54:44.640
I mean, we were not
dummies when we figured out

00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:50.540
that asbestos, radioactivity, a
lot of toxins, DDT, et cetera,

00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:53.880
were causing outbreaks of
cancer and other diseases.

00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:58.570
And so they tended to be organ
specific because the toxin

00:54:58.570 --> 00:54:59.740
would accumulate there.

00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:01.120
Or with radiation.

00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:03.260
Or tended to be in cells
that reproduce quickly

00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:06.050
because the DNA was being
repaired all the time--

00:55:06.050 --> 00:55:07.775
or was more likely
to be changing.

00:55:07.775 --> 00:55:10.250
And so as we're aware the
cancers were coming up.

00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:11.750
In terms of it being
random, there's

00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:15.330
only one paper I know that
says that there is something

00:55:15.330 --> 00:55:17.570
about the process
that is not random,

00:55:17.570 --> 00:55:20.180
and it has to do with some
asymmetry about the enzymes.

00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:23.870
But in general people have
described it, since the 1920s

00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:27.800
and since including Mendel's
ideas of genetic units

00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:32.740
or genes, that these are just
absolutely random processes.

00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:35.286
AUDIENCE: Is the amount--
so you said 100 per--

00:55:35.286 --> 00:55:37.535
STEVE GULLANS: Per generation
it ranges from 50 to 400

00:55:37.535 --> 00:55:38.475
in different papers.

00:55:38.475 --> 00:55:39.850
AUDIENCE: Is it
going up or down?

00:55:39.850 --> 00:55:41.430
STEVE GULLANS: Well, that's a
new paper that just came out

00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:43.300
a couple months ago from David
[INAUDIBLE] because that's

00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:45.310
how we do our genetic
clocks and how long ago

00:55:45.310 --> 00:55:49.890
we separated from apes is based
on how many mutations they

00:55:49.890 --> 00:55:51.060
have relative to us.

00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:53.890
Now, if the clock was
400 per generation

00:55:53.890 --> 00:55:55.790
it's a different time
period versus 100.

00:55:55.790 --> 00:55:57.445
So right now the
operating number

00:55:57.445 --> 00:55:59.110
is 100 until we get more data.

00:56:03.590 --> 00:56:07.810
AUDIENCE: This talks
started out by emphasizing

00:56:07.810 --> 00:56:11.310
that mutation is a very
important part of evolution,

00:56:11.310 --> 00:56:13.380
essential.

00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:16.520
I have some sort of-- I may have
some sort of genetic mutation

00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:21.330
that has led me to be in
favor of nuclear energy.

00:56:21.330 --> 00:56:23.470
So I want to ask a question
about radioactivity,

00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:26.160
ionizing radiation,
and that is that life

00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:30.080
has evolved bathed
in radioactivity

00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:33.680
for billions of years
and therefore, one, life

00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:34.680
is very resistant to it.

00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:36.888
We have all these mechanisms
that are self-correcting

00:56:36.888 --> 00:56:38.820
and this error correction
that you mentioned.

00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:41.865
And also it seems like, without
all that ionizing radiation

00:56:41.865 --> 00:56:43.240
evolution certainly
wouldn't have

00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:45.990
proceeded as quickly as it had.

00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:47.924
Does that sound right?

00:56:47.924 --> 00:56:49.090
STEVE GULLANS: That's right.

00:56:49.090 --> 00:56:51.720
I mean, the earth is a
protected-- relatively

00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:52.780
protected environment.

00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:55.260
Life first arose in
water where you actually

00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:56.260
have more protection.

00:56:56.260 --> 00:57:00.460
And there are enzymes that
actually repair and prevent--

00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:02.610
it's actually an
oxidizing reaction that

00:57:02.610 --> 00:57:06.460
is result of radiation that
actually breaks the DNA

00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:07.750
and causes the problems.

00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:10.200
So we have lots of--
dealing with oxygen

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:12.830
as well as radiation has been
something we've worked against.

00:57:12.830 --> 00:57:16.860
There is a species of
bacteria called-- I forgot.

00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:17.400
Radians.

00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:19.080
JUAN ENRIQUEZ:
Deinococcus radiodurans.

00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:19.913
STEVE GULLANS: Yeah.

00:57:19.913 --> 00:57:22.590
It can handle a million full
bore radioactivity exposure

00:57:22.590 --> 00:57:26.690
than we can, simply by revving
up all of these mechanisms.

00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:29.280
And so there's a yin
and yang play about,

00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:31.650
we need to adapt to
the current environment

00:57:31.650 --> 00:57:32.900
if the environment's changing.

00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:36.780
We actually rev up these systems
to repair and to proliferate

00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:38.480
as a species, or any species.

00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:40.850
JUAN ENRIQUEZ: And we are
unfortunately out of time.

00:57:40.850 --> 00:57:43.220
So what we'd like
to do is just, you

00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:46.230
know-- this is something for
all of you to think about.

00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:49.030
This is one of the most exciting
areas sitting out there.

00:57:49.030 --> 00:57:52.610
There are very few adventures
that are as important

00:57:52.610 --> 00:57:54.680
and will change
the world as much

00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:56.370
as understanding life code.

00:57:56.370 --> 00:57:58.930
So have fun with it.

00:57:58.930 --> 00:57:59.760
Guide it.

00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:00.820
Help us.

00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:01.970
Debate it.

00:58:01.970 --> 00:58:04.275
That's partly why
we wrote this book.

00:58:04.275 --> 00:58:05.650
STEVE GULLANS:
One brief comment.

00:58:05.650 --> 00:58:07.066
You don't need to
know any biology

00:58:07.066 --> 00:58:09.450
to read this book, by the way.

00:58:09.450 --> 00:58:11.710
It was written for
my kids and my wife,

00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:14.296
as well as for Juan's
kids and his wife.

00:58:14.296 --> 00:58:15.920
JUAN ENRIQUEZ: Thank
you all very much.
