00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And this might have required a little thought, but since we have figured out that

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
each time this loop here runs, it puts at least 1 vertex from the best possible vertex cover

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
into its solution. It means that this loop can run at most K times

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
because once it has run K times, it must have put all of the vertices from

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
the minimum vertex cover into its solution. And in that case all of the edges

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
are covered. So the condition for this while loop here saying that some edges

00:00:30.000 --> 99:59:59.000
must still be uncovered cannot be true any more after this loop here has run K times.
