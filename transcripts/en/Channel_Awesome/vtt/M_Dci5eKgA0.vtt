Hello! I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it, so you don't have to. Hey everybody, it's January! You know what that means!

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.500
Probably not, 'cause I just made it up! It's Nickelodeon Month!

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:31.000
[90s Nickelodeon theme]

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.940
Nickelodeooooon!

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.520
Nickelodeon, the first television network made for kids BY kids. Well, okay, not by kids.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.339
That would be stupid, but certainly the first television network FOR kids.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.739
This was a groundbreaking channel with a groundbreaking notion. And what did this groundbreaking creation give us?

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.960
Mostly British and Canadian shows.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.360
But we didn't care! It was on all the time! That is, until evening when it was switched over to older adult shows on Nick at Nite.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.449
But even those were so unplausible and ridiculous that we enjoyed them too. But, let's be honest, after a while

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.400
there's only so many reruns and syndicated shows that they could run, so Nickelodeon finally made the logical choice to produce their own material.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.799
And what was the result?

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.000
Nicktoons, a series of cartoons made specifically for the Nickelodeon channel.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.200
There were many of these cartoons, and they even continue the trademark name of Nicktoons even to this day.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.400
But we were there when they first popped up and don't you forget it.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.600
So, let's take a look at one of their finest, and certainly strangest of shows: Ren and Stimpy.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.600
A lot of people have mixed feelings towards this cartoon and there's a good reason: It's friggin' insane!

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.500
Little made sense, and half the time the humor came from just how totally out of control and psychotic it was. And it kicked ASS!

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.239
Sure, it was gross and vulgar, but on the other hand...

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.600
It was GROSS and VULGAR! Kids love that kind of stuff, and this was one of the first cartoon shows to totally engross us in it.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.300
I mean, no other cartoon looked or acted like this. It was something completely different.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:03.900
So, how do I really describe what this show is like? Well, it stars a big dumb cat named Stimpy and angry Mexican Chihuahua named Ren.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.200
Ren: "You sick little monkey!"

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.000
And the rest, in all honesty, is pretty much like talking to a kid on the ultimate of sugar highs.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.200
Man: "Hey, kid! What do you want to see on TV?"

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.000
Kid: "I don't knoooow..."

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.900
Man: "Have some candy!"

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.549
*ding!*

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:25.759
Kid: "I want to see a dog and cat dancing around like Jell-o! Then I want to see them hit their butts together 'cause butts are funny!

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:28.300
"Then I want them to tell my grandmother to suck eggs!"

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.319
Stimpy: "I'll teach your grandmother to suck eggs!"

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.800
Kid: "And then I want them to take a hammer and smash themselves on the head with it!"

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.400
[Laughs]

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.400
[Snores]

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:47.200
One of the biggest controversies about the show is whether or not Ren and Stimpy are gay, to which the creator of the show, John Kay, answered:

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.000
"I don't know, it's none of my business."

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
To be honest, I already talked about this show before on one of my countdowns, so I'm not going to go into too much detail.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.459
But let's just say the show definitely knew how to capture the craziest side of our silliness.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.730
So let's move on to Nickelodeon's other biggest hit [rugrats]. This was made in a more innocent time

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.760
We're crawling babies were funny men with purple hair was acceptable and keyboards synthesizers seem to rule the Earth

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.960
the show was pretty much about... babies...

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.160
And, that's it. It was pretty much just about babies.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.380
[Announcer saying Adventure Ho!]

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.380
so they dealt with tough, nail-biting dilemmas like

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:29.989
"Can't the dog come with us," or, "do we need to take a nap?" or, "You want me to do

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.340
What on there!?" Chucky: They call it gettin'

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.800
potty-trained! Critic: actually this episode is, probably, one of the most fans as it talks about what all of the kids love to talk about,

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.960
shitting. Chucky: They're trying to make me use that instead of my diaper!

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.700
Phil: That can't happen

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.860
Dhil: Yea! How's that gonna fit in your pants!?

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.460
Critic: Oh, this is just too precious. Tommy: Maybe you could just stop pooping all together! Critic: and that's just gross.

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:02.059
Dhil: Maybe you could put alotta napkins in your pants, and use 'em like a diaper! Critic: That's even grosser.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.470
Phil: Maybe you could poop in your room and not in your toy box! Critic: Okay, stop stop.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.160
Look, weather you call it poopee or poop or whatever

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.300
It's still shit, you're talking about shit! knock it off, you're grossing me out!

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.860
[Gross pooping noise]

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.220
Chucky: Uh oh...

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.320
Critic: Oh, that's charming. Chucky: They can't make me

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:29.710
I'm gonna wear my diapers forever, and nobody is gonna stop me! Critic: Don't worry a kid when he gets be 80

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.280
you have to wear him again anyway.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.409
Speaking of growing up,

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:36.099
I always imagine what these kids would look like when they eventually got older

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:41.499
I think everybody imagine that like Chucky would grow up to be Garth Tommy will grow up to be Paul giamatti

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.250
Twins would grow up to be john and Joan Cusac, because they already look alike,

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:51.519
And the always power-hungry Angelica? Well for some reason I always saw her as Hillary Clinton

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.439
I can't help it, it's just the first thing that popped in my head. Actually something I always noticed about these cartoons

00:04:56.439 --> 00:05:02.499
Is that they always open in a strange way that is they usually do an extreme closeup of something and then eventually back off to

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.380
Show us what it is. That sounds fine and good, but what happens when the image almost looks pervert in like this one

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.600
Is it... two pigs humping?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.620
Is it the inside of a woman's...?

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.120
What is that!

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.540
Oh, it's the inside of a dog's mouth panting

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.320
Duh!

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.779
Though the other kids are cute

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:36.669
I guess, the one kid that everyone seems to remember is angelica for being such a brat little bitch.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.759
Angelica: You, little babies really make me laugh

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:41.719
Can i get on the phone? Huh huh huh huh-?

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:45.219
Don't you dummies know anything?
Critic: Yeah, everyone remembers

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:47.219
How harsh she was but here's the thing,

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:53.940
She's so mean that she's actually kind of creepy. Don't believe me look what happens when I put her face over these disasters

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:05.320
[Satanic Laughing]

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:12.540
But not even Angela and all the negativity can prepare you for the scariest, ugliest,

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:17.240
Most horrifying creation that Nickelodeon studios has ever produced...

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.810
Doug...

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:26.289
Now perhaps some of you are wondering why I think so harshly of what appears to be a relatively harmless cartoon

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:27.129
well

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:32.589
Let's just say you knew someone with a very similar name, someone who grew up with that name all his life

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.919
It happened to be raised at the exact same time this show came out.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:43.440
Do you think any jokes are funny remarks in connection with this show could possibly affect his life in any negative way? Do you?

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.600
DO YOU!?

00:06:45.600 --> 00:07:04.860
[Rabid audience laughter and "Doug funny" jokes/teasing]

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:11.560
Whoa... excuse me, I uh... just having another one of my random psychotic episodes brought on by this very show

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.420
Luckily I didn't take anyone's life this time

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.860
but with that said

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.870
But with that said this was a pretty lame show

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.260
I mean the show was pretty much just about a kid who went to high school and

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.460
That's it. It was pretty much just about a kid who went to high school

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.000
[Confused announcer saying "Adventure... Ho?"

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:41.360
Doug or, Doug Funny if you want to know his full name has some very odd friends, like Mosquito Valentine, Bud Dink, his dog

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.580
Porkchop, and Patti Mayonnaise.

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:50.000
What is up with these names what you didn't have room for Johnny Pictureframe Larry Toiletpaper or Suzy Contraceptive?

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:56.800
Ugh. He spends most of his time going after patty mayonnaise because, well, she looks pretty and apparently that's all he needs

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.040
Doug: Patty Mayonnaise...

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.620
Doug 2: She's just as bland as I am.

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:08.380
Also, what is up with everybody's skin Color in the show? Did the town get infected by radioactive poisoning?

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.880
Blue dude: Yo man, let me take care of this!

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.380
Lesser Doug:  I never liked them "blue people,"

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.100
On top of that, the music always sounds like it is literally

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.280
farting out its soundtrack. Just listen,

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:23.180
[Music sounds very wet and uncomfortable]

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.080
[Seriously this reminds me of the Rugrets clip]

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.340
We're gonna need a faster Tempo, Howard more pork and beans!

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:32.690
There's also this bully named Roger who constantly tries to make Doug's life a living hell.

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:37.069
Why? because all kids with leather jackets are just bullies now. Did you know that?

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:42.950
It's like an official law. He also travels around with his pet cat named Stinky, who probably lives up to his namesake

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:45.829
This show is so unrealistic

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:46.440
I mean

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:52.039
what kind of boy would travel around with a cat where leather covered his hair in gel obsess over his looks and

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:56.060
constantly co-actor a submissive boy, roughly his age- oh...

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:01.580
Think the best way to describe this show is that it's kind of like the early episodes of the simpsons

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:08.719
They're not funny not well animated and surround you in a world of awkward uncomfortableness, But whereas the Simpsons got funny, Doug

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.900
Just psychologically tortured me for a life. I mean uh...

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.080
Psychologically tortured anyone named Doug for life (hahaha.. ha)

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.200
[Incomprehensible Noise, maybe "Next show"?]

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.820
Rocko's Modern life

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:26.100
This show is kind of like ren &amp; Stimpy except maybe a little bit more reserved and not quite as controversial

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:33.119
But I did capture a lot of the zaniness as the show's main character was a tiny Kangaroo with an australian accent, who, for some

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.900
reason has a gigantic

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.310
hole in his face

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:42.510
Must have been the battle of the boomerangs, koala bears and wallabies. You know the great war of the australian stereotypes

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:48.630
Where the dingoes go high into the night attacking the armies of shrimp on the Barbie?

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.340
But the ancient league of fosters bombed all the alligator Hunters, leaving nothing

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:58.590
But the Kangaroos and eucalyptus leaves to brave the darkness. Or, so I've heard.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.530
Rocko also has a cast of interesting characters

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:07.350
Most notably a cow named Hefer, who is kind of like an inbred version of the starfish from Sponge Bob

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:14.310
Philip Turtle --All who looks like woody allen is just as slimy, and of course the Big-heads who I swear are just the Grinch's

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.680
Testicles if they sprouted legs and started complaining about everything.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:23.160
Frog thing: Oh Ned, this mountain cabin sounds SO romantic!

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:25.040
Doug 2; Douglectric Dougaloo: You know I used to be a man,

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:30.810
But I thought my voice was too feminine so I changed. Rocko himself is a pretty normal and innocent character

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:34.739
But the adventures he embarks on certainly are not. For example,

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:38.190
There's one episode where Philbert is looking to practice dentistry on his friend

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:42.510
So he takes him to the academy of dentists where he performs in front of a stadium of people?

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:46.710
But that's not the weird part. He is then taught by a teacher who is a cat with a hook for a hand

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:54.150
but that's not the strange part. One of Rocco's teeth breaks loose grows seven stories high and starts attacking the City by destroying all the

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.689
buildings while Philbert tries to dress up like the tooth Fairy to stop him

00:10:57.689 --> 00:11:05.480
But that's not the strange part, no the strange part is this: Talking Foot: hey kids. My name is goorden. Let's talk about-

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:13.580
[Critic yelling over foot loudly]

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:18.940
Critic: So, for as fucking weird as many of these jokes get sometimes they hit a little too close in

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:24.849
Familiarity. like tell me this bit sounds familiar at all. Philbert: I never really wanted to be a dentist anyway

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:30.550
I always wanted, to be a chimney Sweep. [I] didn't want to be a barber anyway. I wanted to be a lumberjack

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.100
leaping from Roof to

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:40.209
Oldtown High Rises leaping from tree to tree as they float down the mighty rivers of British Columbia, and I'd sing

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:42.020
sing

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.020
sing sing

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:51.909
[I] mean, there's paint omage and others just plain ripping off and I [needed] these were balls of great comedians

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:57.310
Have to stop all right enough [is] enough. [this] is the final this is a very very last draw

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:05.260
Well at least we get some originality from the next show that popped up ah real monsters now. I have to admit

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:09.939
[I] was just starting to get out of the nickelodeon phase when the show came out, so I didn't watch much of it

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:14.380
But what I did was a pretty cool show all the monsters look creative than him really funny

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:21.219
Enjoyable personalities the story was about an academy of monsters whose job was to go out into the world scare the daylights out of people

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:28.239
Return back with a report of their partners gee would it be horrible as some other successful studio pawn that office their idea how much?

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.589
It so the lineup you have take is who kind of looked like the noise from the Domino's commercials?

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:38.290
Crowd who looks like how most people look after laser eye surgery just keeping it real people and don't bleed

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:41.920
Huh kind of looks like [beetlejuice] is dildo if he had one

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.950
I guess she's supposed to have some sort of accent

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:49.749
But God help me if I can tell you which one they've got to do something if humans are not afraid of him

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:55.459
Thank you fear of all monsters. [it's] like somebody said this character has an accent. Okay, what kind?

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:57.510
just an

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:58.680
accent

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.210
They all have to work for [their]

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:06.079
Intimidating boss known as the ground who ice where's the cartoon version of Tim curry from Rocky horror picture Show?

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.030
sweet Transvestite

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:10.430
On [this] show was good

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:15.500
But I always had the feeling that some of these jokes had a double meaning like listen to some of these lines and tell me

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:22.130
If they sound decent have you fucked good boy? Oh? Yeah? [oh] our mothers and fathers loves each other very much

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:27.289
[yeah], hey what hey what if you see a monster just saying

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:29.310
coochie-Coochie

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:33.890
All right, [Noah's] going to what you go around my monster. I just [supposed] to use two fingers

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:38.270
next character

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:43.879
All right, this is the last show. I'm gonna talk about because this is when I officially stop watching Nickelodeon

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.999
I actually never saw a single episode of this show

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.630
But I know a lot [of] people did so I decided to take a look at it from what I can gather

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.780
it's a show pretty much just about a kid in the Bronx and

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.289
That's it [it] pretty much [is] about a kid in the Bronx

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:09.349
It's a tough time where kids walk like they're a production of West side story girls repeatedly shout the word arnold for some strange reason

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:19.030
And an army of boys against an army of girls ultimately results in the boys very politely stepping out of their way

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.480
I'm high

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:24.249
There's a boy named Arnold who was blessed without the pressures of having a personality?

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:29.319
His best friend Gerald the one black person that every white person claims to know and then there's hell

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:36.819
Who's so tough that she actually names her fists? They're gonna have to answer to old betsy that's not so tough

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:40.329
I named my [fists] - this is Glenda and pancake [I]

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:45.249
know it doesn't seem very threatening, but when you look at the

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:52.869
Job if they had to deal with tough nail biting city drama then everybody in the Bronx has to deal with like

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.160
again

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:07.869
Even though Helga constantly makes fun of Arnold she secretly has a crush on him [that] quite literally drives her to madness. [oh]

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:15.640
Go [in] love you, and yet. I hate you [and] I love [you] hate you

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.890
you

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:24.309
Arnold we love him so much [sir] which [leads] either the heads of summer

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:33.649
Also, maybe it's because I don't watch the [show], but why does Arnold wear a plaid skirt?

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:38.570
[I] mean is it a kilt is it a jacket is he just an open transvestite

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:43.730
I mean Brooklyn that wouldn't surprise me but come on. How about a little clarification yeah well from Whatever reason

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:48.469
I guess the show didn't seem that bad from what I saw, but [sadly] I've reached my peak by this point

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:50.540
I had run older and Nickelodeon cartoons

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:55.730
No longer seemed entertaining it strange to think that for all the loud of bizarre shows I remember

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:58.669
Nickelodeon [Ag] had a lot of quiet and subtle shows as well

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.500
It was like the mood swings of children's programming. We loved it every last bit

00:16:04.019 --> 00:16:09.349
nicktoons were different surreal and one-of-a-kind making it a very memorable part of our childhoods and

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:14.180
Trust me when I say I'm [not] really as bitter about the whole doug show as [eyelid] on

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.209
I mean, it didn't leave nearly as bad a mark as you amazing

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.240
Singing it's going back going back

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.620
I like to do this. I'm the nostalgic
