00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.420
[Captions by Mike R. at Y Translator]
I kinda want to try just doing

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:03.160
a big, scaled-up version of that

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:06.419
where I just get, like,
a gallon of oil

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:10.610
boiling and on fire, then pouring, like,
a gallon of water onto it.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.240
I don't know if this dome
would be big enough

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.900
to contain that fireball, honestly.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.280
That would be a lot of fire.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.280
Hey, guys, I'm Nate.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.410
Welcome back to the dome, where,

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.529
as you can probably see by my breath,
it's pretty chilly.

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.199
Today, we've got another fun experiment.

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.659
Salt and oil are usually things that
go really well together on foods.

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.730
Today, we're gonna see if
they go really well together

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.939
when the salt is 1800º Fahrenheit.

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.460
We're gonna melt down some salt
until it's nice and liquid,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.680
and then we're gonna pour
that superhot salt

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.610
onto three different types of oil
to see how it reacts.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.390
We've got some standard liquid cooking oil,
we've got some butter

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.910
and then we've got some motor oil.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.510
We're gonna try pouring molten salt into
all three of those and see what happens.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.760
The flash point, or the point
where these oils should light on fire,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.060
is well below the melting temperature of salt.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.570
So, we might be able
to get these to light on fire.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.620
Let's find out.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.720
Let's fill our crucible with
salt and fire up the furnace.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.480
That looks like a good amount of salt.
Here we go.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.060
We're gonna start using our cooking oil,

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.850
and while our salt is
just finishing up melting in the foundry,

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.100
we'll fill our pot.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.940
Now, I don't think that pouring salt into oil 
will have any large splashing or explosive effects.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.920
But as a precaution,
I am wearing this jacket.

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.600
I'm gonna even put the hood up,
I'll have glasses on,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.650
and I'll have
my thick leather welding gloves.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.130
Like I said, I
don't think it will explode.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.900
I hope it'll light on fire.
We'll find out.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.380
Whew! Look at that.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.020
That is some toasty salt.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.600
All right, here we go.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.340
3, 2, 1.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.300
All right. That lit on fire
just exactly like I was expecting it to,

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.180
but I did not see
the formation of the salt coming at all.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.660
Look at the shape of that.
It's like coral or something in there.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.880
That is wild.
That is so weird. Wow!

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.820
Also, it kind of smells like
we're cooking now, cuz, you know,

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.440
salt and oil together,
that's not unpleasant.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.800
Look at at that shape.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.360
I hope I can get that all out
in one piece from the pot.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.549
It might be a little bit fragile
so it might break when I try,

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.510
but man, that is cool.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.790
Also, the oil is just still on fire.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.349
It's kind of interesting because
most of the oil, I think,

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.750
is not hot enough to be burning,
but it lit the surface on fire,

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.750
and so we'll see.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.220
Maybe that's now heating it up even more.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.720
It's hard to tell.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.659
I haven't lit a whole lot of oil on fire.

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.269
Maybe it's something I need to play with.

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.680
But, yeah, this is pretty cool.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.860
Let's see if it will blow out.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.239
Hmm.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.440
I think the moisture from my breath 
makes it angry.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.680
It does not want to blow out.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.960
What do you think?
Should I pour some water on it?

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.780
Of course, I should.
I'm gonna pour some water on it.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.920
Hah! That was great.
Nice, little fireball.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.460
I love the way that traveled up like that.
That looked really good.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.760
And interestingly, it did put the fire out.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.040
Actually, I think it was that
the fire went into a fireball

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.480
It might have burned up all the oxygen,
so there was no more for it to be burning,

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.480
but I don't really know.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.780
But in the end, it looked cool.
No one got splattered.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.600
Nice little tower fireball.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.000
And now the fires out,

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.680
so we can try and take our chunk
of weirdly shaped salt out.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.600
There we go.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.500
That is what happens to our molten
salt when I poured it into the cooking oil.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.760
And I will tell you, there were many things
I thought might happen.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.040
It never occurred to me 
that this would happen.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.740
Now, I'm curious if it will do that
with the other kinds of oil.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.980
We've also started to fry our board a little bit

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.740
because our oil is still very toasty.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.960
Fried wood. Mmm.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.080
Next up, we're going to see what happens
if we pour our molten salt onto butter.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.280
Now, this isn't going to start as a liquid,

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.520
so I'm sure we'll have
something of a different result.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.600
I don't even know
what it is that's igniting.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.340
All right.
There you go.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.640
Molten salt onto butter in 3, 2, 1.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.040
That's a lot of thick smoke.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.560
I think most of the flames went out,  though.

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:24.020
I hear it bubbling a lot.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.200
Now butter has a lot more water in it.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.540
Butter isn't as pure of an oil as cooking
oil.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.130
It has a lot of other
chemicals and materials in it.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.720
That smells really good.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.300
Smells like something delicious cooking.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.500
Boy, that is some boiling oil right there.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.100
Still going.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.640
It's been there for like a minute and a half.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.680
So, it's obviously very hot.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.100
But I'm curious if it's flammable.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.760
So, I'm gonna hit that with the blowtorch
and see if it'll ignite.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.639
Nope. Something's bubbling and boiling,
but it's not lighting on fire.

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:03.479
Our butter didn't light on fire
the same way or cooking oil did,

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:04.810
but it did boil a lot.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:10.240
And I think that's because there are
some non-oil components to butter.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.830
I think the milk fat
that butter is made from

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.069
still has water in it –
something like that –

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:16.699
and now it's just boiling,
and that's why it didn't ignite.

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:18.560
But I'm curious to see what happened
to the salt on this one.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.379
So, I'm gonna dispose of the butter

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:22.690
and then see what the salt
underneath it's looking like.

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.190
All righ. So, I poured off the melted butter.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.600
And you can see where the two lower blocks
of butter were still in the pan.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.520
So we've got the salt that poured down
melting the top two bricks of butter,

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.180
and the bottom two took longer to melt,

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.280
and so, I think the salts
solidified around those two blocks.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.280
So we just have the two gaps
where they were.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.920
Then, of course, they melted,
as well, from the heat.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.580
Salt number one. Salt number two.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.300
Well, we've got one more
kind of oil to try,

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.300
so, let's melt up some more salt,
try it on that.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.220
We're gonna be doing this with motor oil.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:04.980
3, 2, 1.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:08.720
And it's on fire.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.120
Excellent.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.160
Well, the motor oil lit on fire,
very similar to how the cooking oil did,

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:20.130
making some nice boiling,
bubbling action there, too.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.099
I can't really see what the salt has done.

00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:24.129
It hasn't reacted the same way.

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:26.199
We don't have the large
coil-looking formations

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:28.190
that we did with the cooking oil.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:29.750
Hard to tell what we do have going on.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.110
It doesn't smell as good
as it did with the butter.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.100
That smelled really good.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.900
I think we have the oil
now vaporizing and burning.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:49.880
Ahh. [LAUGHS] it's just so warm,
it reignited itself.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.100
Interesting how different those turned out.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.060
I definitely like the one
from the cooking oil the best.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.260
That's fun.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.520
This has now cooled off.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.800
So this is salt that cooled down in butter.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.940
Pretty good.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.020
A little burned tasting,

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.580
but I can taste butter
and I can taste salt,

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:24.960
and that's a good combo.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.940
But it also tastes like burning.
That part's not great.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:31.600
I'm not going to try licking that one.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.900
Frankly, I'm not too interested
in trying to lick that one either,

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.700
although it does look just really neat.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.380
Molten salt poured into
three different types of oil.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.380
We've tried pouring it into cooking oil,
we tried pouring it onto butter,

00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:45.500
and we tried pouring it onto motor oil.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:48.040
The cooking oil and motor oil
both burst into flames

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.079
almost immediately and stayed burning.

00:08:50.079 --> 00:08:53.269
The butter lit on fire very briefly,
but then was put out,

00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:57.080
and I think that's by all of
the non-oil solids and liquids

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.880
that might make up the butter.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.829
It was very fun throwing
a little bit of water

00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:03.029
onto our oil fires and, of course,
that, explodes.

00:09:03.029 --> 00:09:06.540
And you should never do that anywhere
that could catch things on fire –

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.529
like a kitchen, or
most places at your house,

00:09:09.529 --> 00:09:12.850
or anywhere that isn't
a concrete dome with a dirt floor.

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:15.360
This is a very safe place
to burn things and, even so,

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.140
I was careful to be wearing gloves,
long sleeves, a hood, glasses,

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.400
thick pants, everything
to keep myself protected.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.540
I think by far, the most surprised
I was at this whole experiment

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.250
was what happened to the salt
when we poured it into the cooking oil,

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:32.920
how full of something, I don't know,
air, or bubbles, or oil,

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:36.630
or something that the salt got
when we poured it into our canola oil,

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:37.630
that part surprised me.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:38.630
Overall, I'm glad to have learned

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:42.470
that salt does not explode on contact
with oil or anything like that,

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:44.220
but it does catch it on fire.

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.470
And that's always fun.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.240
