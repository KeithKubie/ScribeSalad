00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:05.560
IDO GREEN: Hi.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.057
I'm Ido Green, a developer
advocate for Actions on Google.

00:00:09.057 --> 00:00:11.390
Did you know that building
apps for the Google Assistant

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.270
can reach users on
million of devices?

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.550
In this video, I'm
going to show you

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.480
how to get more users to your
app for the Google Assistant.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.590
There are four ways for users
to get your app for the Google

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.600
Assistant through
explicit triggering,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.360
implicit triggering, discovery
in the Google Assistant

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.350
Directory, and clicking on
the Assistant Directory link.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.190
Let's go deeper on each one.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.380
Users can invoke your
app by explicitly

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.690
asking for it by name.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.310
When you submit
your app, you could

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.890
provide a list of
triggering phrases

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.350
that when combined
with your app name,

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.470
will be recognized as a
request to use your app,

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.890
such as OK Google,
talk to Bitcoin info.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.550
You could also talk with an app
and ask for a specific action

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.020
in one sentence.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.270
And yes, it supports
deep links, so when

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.700
users ask for your app
to perform something

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.800
in particular, for
example, OK Google,

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.040
ask Bitcoin info for
the current price.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.280
Here are some good examples
of explicit invocation

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.210
in the console.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.360
Remember, multiple
samples help the algorithm

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.390
to do a better job of
steering people to your app.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.365
So use a few examples.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.740
Another way for users
to invoke your app

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.490
is by implicit triggering.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.250
This type of invocation occurs
when a user asked the Google

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.430
Assistant to perform a
task, and the platform

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.920
decide that your app
has an action that can

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.720
complete the user's request.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.610
Here's an example
using Dialogflow.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.680
In Dialogflow, your actions
and the invocation phrases

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.420
are defined as user
says expressions

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.170
for triggering intents.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.680
Here, we're providing
some phrases

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.100
that would trigger the Ask
Bitcoin info app to get

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.660
the current bitcoin price.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.610
Make sure to keep
your action invocation

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.860
phrases specific to
the app use cases

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.812
and build phrases to include
both verb and an object.

00:02:04.812 --> 00:02:06.770
And if you want to learn
more about Dialogflow,

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.370
please visit Dialogflow YouTube
channel for great videos that

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.560
will teach you how to
use this powerful tool

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.120
for natural language processing.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.350
If a user asks to play
a game, the Assistant

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.784
may offer them a few options
from the apps available.

00:02:21.784 --> 00:02:23.450
This is another other
way as a developer

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.910
to tell the Assistant
what your app can do.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.340
Users can discover your app
for the Google Assistant

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.460
through the Google Assistant
Directory, a great place

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.910
to explore all available apps.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.500
Users don't have
to install anything

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.530
in order to access the
Google Assistant Directory.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.900
You could reach it
inside the Assistant app

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.966
by clicking at the
top-right button.

00:02:43.966 --> 00:02:45.590
It will show you all
the different apps

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.510
for the Assistant
that are available.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.070
Finally, driving users to
your app directory page

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.760
will give them a chance to try
it out, rate it, and share it.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.100
This mean even more users.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.740
You can hyperlink to your
app's Assistant Directory page

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.420
and promote it just
about everywhere.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.470
Share it in social media, blog
about it, create an ad banner,

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.710
or offer it to users from
your current services.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.010
That was it.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.670
Now you know four
great ways to get

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.330
your app discovered and used.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.510
Please check out the YouTube
description below for links

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.480
and learn more about
invocation and discovery.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.850
Until next time, be strong
and create amazing apps.
