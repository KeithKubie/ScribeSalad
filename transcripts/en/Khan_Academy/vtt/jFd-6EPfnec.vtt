00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.180
 

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.820
Welcome to the greatest
common divisor or greatest

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.030
common factor video.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.850
So just to be clear, first of
all, when someone asks you

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:16.530
whether what's the greatest
common divisor of 12 and 8?

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.060
Or they ask you what's
the greatest common

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.790
factor of 12 and 8?

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.150
That's a c right
there for common.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.600
I don't know why it
came out like that.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.640
They're asking you
the same thing.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.260
I mean, really a divisor is
just a number that can divide

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.100
into something, and a factor--
well, I think, that's also a

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.190
number that can divide
into something.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.140
So a divisor and a factor
are kind of the same thing.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.200
So with that out of the way,
let's figure out, what is the

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.420
greatest common divisor or
the greatest common

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.900
factor of 12 and 8?

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.980
Well, what we do is, it's
pretty straightforward.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.940
First we just figure out the
factors of each of the numbers.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.370
So first let's write all of the
factors out of the number 12.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.260
Well, 1 is a factor,
2 goes into 12.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.100
3 goes into 12.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.780
4 goes into 12.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.960
5 does not to go into 12.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.710
6 goes into 12
because 2 times 6.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.230
And then, 12 goes
into 12 of course.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.080
1 times 12.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.940
So that's the factors of 12.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.440
Let's write the factors of 8.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.610
Well, 1 goes into 8.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.950
2 goes into 8.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.640
3 does not go into 8.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.930
4 does go into 8.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.840
And then the last factor,
pairing up with the 1 is 8.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.100
So now we've written all
the factors of 12 and 8.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.580
So let's figure out what the
common factors of 12 and 8 are.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.020
Well, they both have the
common factor of 1.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.390
And that's really
not so special.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.370
Pretty much every whole
number or every integer has

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.500
the common factor of 1.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.930
They both share the common
factor 2 and they both

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.080
share the common factor 4.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.620
So we're not just interested in
finding a common factor, we're

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.390
interested in finding the
greatest common factor.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.210
So all the common
factors are 1, 2 and 4.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.590
And what's the
greatest of them?

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.830
Well, that's pretty easy.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:03.900
It's 4.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.240
So the greatest common
factor of 12 and 8 is 4.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.540
Let me write that down
just for emphasis.

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.670
Greatest common factor
of 12 and 8 equals 4.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.950
And of course, we could have
just as easily had said, the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.510
greatest common divisor
of 12 and 8 equals 4.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.195
Sometimes it does
things a little funny.

00:02:27.195 --> 00:02:28.365
Let's do another problem.

00:02:28.365 --> 00:02:30.980
 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:41.900
What is the greatest common
divisor of 25 and 20?

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.775
Well, let's do it the same way.

00:02:43.775 --> 00:02:47.060
The factors of 25?

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.430
Well, it's 1.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.400
2 doesn't go into it.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.160
3 doesn't go into it.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.430
4 doesn't go into it.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.065
5 does.

00:02:52.065 --> 00:02:54.280
It's actually 5 times 5.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.140
And then 25.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.570
It's interesting that
this only has 3 factors.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.870
I'll leave you to think about
why this number only has 3

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.620
factors and other numbers
tend to have an even

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.245
number of factors.

00:03:05.245 --> 00:03:07.940
 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.525
And then now we do
the factors of 20.

00:03:09.525 --> 00:03:12.670
 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:21.020
Factors of 20 are 1,
2, 4, 5, 10, and 20.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.300
And if we just look at this by
inspection we see, well, they

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.060
both share 1, but that's
nothing special.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.110
But they both have the
common factor of?

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.560
You got it-- 5.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:37.300
So the greatest common divisor
or greatest common factor of 25

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.040
and 20- well, that equals 5.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.120
Let's do another problem.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.950
 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:54.700
What is the greatest common
factor of 5 and 12?

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.430
Well, factors of 5?

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.330
Pretty easy.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.350
1 and 5.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.360
That's because it's
a prime number.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.080
It has no factors other
than 1 and itself.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.380
Then the factors of 12?

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.180
12 has a lot of factors.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:14.270
It's 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:20.530
So it really looks like only
common factor they share is 1.

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.370
So that was, I guess, in some
ways kind of disappointing.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.760
So the greatest common
factor of 5 and 12 is 1.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.510
And I'll throw out some
terminology here for you.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.040
When two numbers have a
greatest common factor of

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.210
only 1, they're called
relatively prime.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.100
And that kind of makes sense
because a prime number is

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.890
something that only has 1
and itself as a factor.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.730
And two relatively prime
numbers are numbers that

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.200
only have 1 as their
greatest common factor.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.690
Hope I didn't confuse you.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:52.600
Let's do another problem.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.780
 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:04.580
Let's do the greatest common
divisor of 6 and 12.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.680
I know 12's coming up a lot.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.820
I'll try to be more creative
when I think of my numbers.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.050
Well, the greatest common
divisor of 6 and 12?

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.920
Well, it's the factors of 6.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.770
Are 1, 2, 3, and 6.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:23.480
Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3--
we should have these

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.980
memorized by now.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:29.000
3, 4, 6, and 12.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.730
Well, it turns out 1 is a
common factor of both.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.350
2 is also a common
factor of both.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.550
3 is a common factor of both.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.100
And 6 is a common
factor of both.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.920
And of course, what's the
greatest common factor?

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.540
Well, it's 6.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.780
And that's interesting.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.610
So in this situation the
greatest common divisor-- and I

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.600
apologize that I keep switching
between divisor and factor.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.160
The mathematics community
should settle on

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.200
one of the two.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.220
The greatest common divisor
of 6 and 12 equals 6.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.680
So it actually equals
one of the numbers.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.270
And that makes a lot of
sense because 6 actually

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.720
is divisible into 12.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.940
Well, that's it for now.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.650
Hopefully you're ready to do
the greatest common divisor

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:12.820
or factor problems.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.960
I think I might make another
module in the near future

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.550
that'll give you more
example problems.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:18.984
