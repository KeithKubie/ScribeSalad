00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.100
Hello I’m Daven Hiskey, you’re watching
the Today I Found Out YouTube channel.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:10.050
In the video today, we’re looking at who
the original Tom was in the expression “Peeping

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.730
Tom”
The phrase “peeping Tom” first appeared

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.699
in the accounts for the English city of Coventry
in 1773.

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:22.230
Specifically, the accounts note that the city
had recently purchased a wig and paint for

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.489
an oak effigy of “Peeping Tom”, using
money from the town’s coffers.

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:28.539
So who was this effigy of?

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:29.539
No real person.

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.871
“Peeping Tom” is an iconic part of a legend
surrounding a real person from the 11th Century

00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:35.550
called Lady Godiva.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.890
This legend states that Lady Godiva once rode
through the city’s streets on horseback,

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.600
totally naked, in protest of her husband’s
unfair taxation of the populace.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.470
While exact circumstances surrounding this
now mythical ride change depending on which

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.400
source you consult, the general story is that
Lady Godiva asked her husband on behalf of

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.600
the town to lower taxes.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.130
Her husband, knowing his wife's chaste nature,
joked that he would lower taxes if she agreed

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.220
to ride naked through the streets.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.000
Lady Godiva, much to the surprise of her husband,
accepted this offer and appealed to the townspeople

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.500
to avert their gaze as she did the deed.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.630
The Lady being popular with her subjects,
unlike her husband, the townspeople dutifully

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.140
locked their windows and doors and Lady Godiva
rode proudly through the streets atop a white

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.800
stallion with only her long, flowing locks
covering her more sensitive regions.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.250
She then returned to her husband, he, true
to his word, lowered taxes for the town.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.140
While Lady Godiva (meaning "Gift of God")
and her husband, the enormously wealthy Leofric,

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.700
Earl of Mercia, most certainly did exist,
as you’ve probably guessed even without

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.880
supporting facts, historians are in near universal
agreement that this ride never happened.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.080
To begin with, the first known reference to
the famous ride appeared some two centuries

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.890
after the Lady in question died, first mentioned
in the book, Flowers of History written by

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.320
one, Roger of Wendover.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.240
Although Roger claimed to have gleaned the
contents of his book from, to quote, the “books

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.680
of catholic writers worthy of credit”, his
version of the legend of Lady Godiva’s ride,

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.770
which featured knights flanking her and a
gathered crowd, rather than people boarding

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.979
up their windows and letting the Lady pass
in peace, is considered to be nothing more

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.090
than a fabrication of an unsourced anecdote
that survived from Lady Godiva’s lifetime.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.420
Over the years, this story was taken as fact,
and numerous embellishments were added, leading

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.430
to the versions we know today.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.060
Where exactly the legend of this ride came
from is even more perplexing given that, according

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.090
to every contemporary source from her time,
Lady Godiva and her husband, Leofric, were

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.060
notable philanthropists who frequently gave
money, gold and even buildings to the church,

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.560
and once even paid for the building of a monastery
in Coventry.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.430
Another factor that confuses historians about
the origin of the legend of Godiva’s naked

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.410
ride is the fact that, as noted in The Domesday
Book of 1086 (a comprehensive record of most

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.900
every notable person in England and their
holdings, written likely within a decade of

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.070
the Lady's death), Lady Godiva was in her
lifetime one of the few women in the entire

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.400
country to be a landowner, controlling a number
of large estates around Coventry and the surrounding

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.400
area.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.959
This makes it highly unlikely that she would
have needed to appeal to her husband to lower

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.640
taxes as she owned much of the city, and thus
would have been the person responsible for

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.730
setting taxes in Coventry, not her husband.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.239
So where does Peeping Tom come into this?

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.940
Well the short answer is that he doesn’t,
or at least he didn’t until sometime around

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.099
the 17th or 18th century.

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.190
The legend of Godiva’s ride remained basically
the same as the one previously mentioned until

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.900
around the 1700s, when some versions began
mentioning a man, eventually named Tom.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.290
According to these newer versions of the legend,
while nearly every townsperson dutifully complied

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.700
with Lady Godiva’s wishes to avert their
eyes as she rode through the town, "Tom the

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.629
tailor" couldn’t resist catching a glimpse
of the Lady in the buff and so drilled a hole

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:48.660
in his shutters to watch her ride by.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.819
Tom’s fate differs depending on the version
of the legend you read, but most claim that

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.849
he was either killed or blinded.

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.489
The reasons for either eventuality range from
Tom being struck blind by Godiva’s beauty,

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.159
killed by God for ignoring Godiva’s request
(the Lady in question being explicitly named

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:08.830
as "beloved by God" in the earliest forms
of the legend), or simply being beaten half

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.470
to death and blinded by the rest of the townspeople
when they found out.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.519
Either way, Tom is a modern embellishment
of a story of the legend, with no mention

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.600
of him in any version of the legend for nearly
a half a millennium after its creation.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.780
Another thing pointing to "Tom", at least
as a named character, being a relatively modern

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.330
invention is that the name, “Thomas”,
is not Anglo Saxon.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.580
"Tom" was, however, a common moniker for a
generic man since around the 15th or 16th

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.490
century in England, which is likely why this
particular character was eventually given

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.490
this name.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.610
(The first documented instance of the character
being called Tom didn't occur until June 11,

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.280
1773, when the Coventry annals mention the
aforementioned wig and paint for the character's

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.280
effigy.)

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.430
In any event, in the late 17th century, the
people of Coventry began reenacting the Lady's

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.520
ride as an annual town event.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.020
The Godiva Procession has been happening in
the town since around 1677 or 1678 and is

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.010
still celebrated, albeit sporadically, today.

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.770
It generally involves an actress riding through
the town on horseback, sometimes naked, sometimes

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.360
not, depending on the sensibilities of the
time.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.440
Unlike in the legend, the people of Coventry
gleefully watch and celebrate the ride.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.770
Within about a half century of the start of
the Godiva Procession tradition (with the

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.910
exact date unknown), the people of the town
created the aforementioned effigy of Tom,

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.590
which still exists today, giving us our first
definitive mentions of the character.

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.560
One potential origin story for the character
of Tom has been suggested via the journals

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.540
of three soldiers who visited Coventry in
the early 17th century.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.500
They explicitly note the story of Lady Godiva's
ride and also mention her hair, which is covering

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.290
her breasts and mid-section, offending "wantons
glancing Eye".

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.790
From the text, it isn't clear whether they
are referring to a peeping Tom figure when

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.740
mentioning "wanton" or Leofric himself.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.970
If the former, this would be the first known
reference to a peeping Tom in the story.

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.480
Importantly, they also mention seeing a painting
of Lady Godiva's ride which is thought to

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:07.280
be a 1586 work that shows a man in a window
looking down upon the nude Lady as she rode.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.229
(This man's presence in the painting was only
re-discovered in 1976 after the painting was

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:14.650
cleaned and he once again became visible.)

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.740
The soldiers, and others from this time, may
well have mistook this man for being a random

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.610
"peeping Tom", when in fact the man shown
is Leofric himself, observing his wife's lonely

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.080
procession from a window.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.669
Whatever the case, over the years, the phrase
“peeping Tom” became synonymous with the

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:33.240
act of watching someone without their knowledge,
as well as another way to call someone a pervert.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.650
The phrase was first defined in the Classical
Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue written in

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.460
1796 as: “A nick name for a curious prying
fellow.”

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.039
So there you have it, Peeping Tom wasn’t
a real person, but a 17th century legend attached

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:51.760
to a legend about an 11th century noblewoman
that, despite having no basis in fact, persists

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.200
today in popular culture because it involves
a famous woman who rumor had it got naked

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.200
in public.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:11.169
Apparently people back then weren’t so different
than today, eh?
