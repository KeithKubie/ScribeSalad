Now before we write that program, let me ask you. If

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.240
you are writing the Take A Break program, what steps would

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.270
you take to get to the output. Don't worry about writing

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.420
code right now, in plain English, simply identify the steps you would

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.010
need to take to make this program work. Step one do

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.020
this, step two do that. You can submit your answers on the

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.910
discussion forum. And while you are there you can read the

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.550
ideas others submitted on the forum as well. The next video will

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.820
give you a quick tour of how to use the forum.
