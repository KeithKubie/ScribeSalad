SPEAKER 1: Today,
we have the pleasure

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.450
of having to Mick
Ebeling talk to us.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.370
He was raised in a
family of entrepreneurs

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.400
and philanthropists.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.390
And he's the founder of the
Not Impossible Foundation,

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.110
a nonprofit organization that
develops creative solutions

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.950
to real world problems,
as well as, The Ebeling

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.760
Group, an international
production

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.260
company and creative
think tank, representing

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.950
some of the world's
leading design

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.130
and directing collectives.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.230
He was recently honored
as one of the top 50 Most

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.780
Creative People of 2014 and
received the 2014 Muhammad Ali

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.835
Humanitarian of the Year award.

00:00:36.835 --> 00:00:39.210
He actually lives right here
in Los Angeles with his wife

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.420
Caskey and three children.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.964
Let's give a warm
welcome to Mick.

00:00:43.964 --> 00:00:48.567
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:48.567 --> 00:00:51.150
MICK EBELING: Nice to be here,
you guys, nice to meet you all.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.180
How many people
actually live in Venice?

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.490
OK, it was good to see you guys
come over in the neighborhood.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:05.010
We've been here since '95--
'93, '94-- when a lot of people

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.680
wouldn't set their feet
upon this area over here.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.190
So how many of you guys know
anything about Not Impossible?

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.140
Hopefully-- awesome, I
love that-- brand spanking

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.560
new audience.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.480
So I'm going to tell
you guys a little bit

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.380
about Not Impossible.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.921
But I'm going to it
through the story

00:01:22.921 --> 00:01:25.130
of why the heck I'm even
standing in front of you

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.530
guys today.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.300
And it really comes down
to everybody has a story.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.250
Everybody here is sitting
here for a reason.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.390
Everybody is in their
job for a reason.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.355
Everybody is where
they live for reason,

00:01:40.355 --> 00:01:42.330
who's married who they
married, or dating who

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.650
they're dating for a reason.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.097
But it all kind
of comes back to,

00:01:45.097 --> 00:01:46.680
this is my belief,
at least, this kind

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.539
of sliding doors thing,
where you just make

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:49.830
certain decisions in your life.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.663
And all of a sudden,
that leads to something

00:01:51.663 --> 00:01:53.290
and leads to something.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.950
The reason I'm here today
is because of this guy.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.250
This guy's name is Tempt.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.290
And Tempt, in the
'80s and '90s, was

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.790
one of the foremost
graffiti artists.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.970
And he came home from a
run one day and said, Dad,

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.300
my legs are tingling.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.330
And that was the
onset of something

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.385
called ALS, which now a lot
more people are aware of, thanks

00:02:14.385 --> 00:02:17.710
to the Ice Bucket Challenge,
which was a fantastic thing.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.656
But ALS is this horrific
disease that basically-- you

00:02:21.656 --> 00:02:23.280
can describe it in
many different ways.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.210
But it's kind of like the blob.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.870
And it moves up your
body and renders

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.740
you completely paralyzed.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.380
So one of the most
horrific things about,

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.070
though, is that you retain
your sense of feeling.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.640
As opposed to
breaking your neck,

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.360
where you can't
feel anything, you

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.840
can actually feel like if your
hand is cramped or hot or cold.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.780
And so, it's a really
really gnarly disease.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.430
So, my production company
decided one year, hey, instead

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.500
of giving our clients
a bottle of wine

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.850
or some fruit basket or
muffin plate or something

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.687
that they would like forget
about the second they got it,

00:02:58.687 --> 00:03:00.270
let's make a donation
on their behalf.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.870
So we chose the
Tempt One Foundation.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.051
And we chose them just
because of who he was

00:03:07.051 --> 00:03:08.050
and what he represented.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.680
And we had just
recently discovered

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.730
kind of what this Tempt
guy was all about.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.900
So we went and met with
his father and brother,

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.620
and we sat across the table
from them and said, listen,

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.990
I want to give you this money.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.656
What are you going
to use the money for?

00:03:20.656 --> 00:03:23.120
And his brother said, I just
want to talk to my brother

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.730
again.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.480
So I want to give them a device
that helps me talk to him.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.380
And I said, what do you mean?

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.110
Because I thought,
at that time, I'd

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.830
never been exposed to anybody
who had any kind of paralysis.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.160
Everybody is only
aware of the things

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.565
that they're aware of-- kind
of an obvious statement.

00:03:38.565 --> 00:03:40.815
But if you have someone in
your in family with cancer,

00:03:40.815 --> 00:03:43.390
or if you have someone in your
family who's in a wheelchair,

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.300
you kind of understand the
plights and the situations

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.950
around those particular people.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.270
I had never been around
anybody who was paralyzed

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.480
and who was unable to talk.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.131
So my assumption
was-- and actually,

00:03:54.131 --> 00:03:55.380
let me ask people in the room.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.610
How many people
here are aware of,

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.060
or been exposed to, or who
have family members of people

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.768
who had Trapped In
Syndrome, who were not

00:04:02.768 --> 00:04:04.480
able to talk in any way?

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.630
OK, yourself, all right.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.510
So how many people here think
that just one of those Stephen

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.070
Hawking machines is just
readily available for people?

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.570
Right?

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.680
Me, I thought that was just
the way that it worked-- no.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.160
And you probably know that
as well-- not the case.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.740
I said, well, why doesn't he
have a Stephen Hawking machine?

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.780
Why doesn't he have one of those
machines that Christoper Reeves

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.488
or Stephen Hawking or
these other people?

00:04:28.488 --> 00:04:31.120
And he said, that's if you have
insurance or you have money,

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.520
and we have neither.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.770
I said, well, how do you talk?

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.150
And he said, we talk
through a letter board.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.070
We have a piece of paper,
and we run our hand along it.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.020
And when Tempt gets to
a letter, he blinks,

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.520
and we write that down,
and then we start again.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.640
So to say, I'm cold,
or my hand is cramped,

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.850
or my neck is kinked,
or something like that

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.940
is this horrifically
long process

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.780
to actually communicate.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.100
And at that time, when I was
exposed, I was flabbergasted.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.470
It was 1995.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.000
And everybody who
works for this company

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.410
is very familiar
with Moore's Law.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.700
Everybody is very familiar
with how fast technology

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.229
works and evolves.

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:17.020
In that classic commercial
where the person

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.933
that puts in a 3D
television on their wall,

00:05:20.933 --> 00:05:23.770
and they go outside, and
the bus goes by that says,

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.212
New 4-D Television?

00:05:25.212 --> 00:05:26.170
That's kind of classic.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.080
That's the way technology works.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.540
So I was flabbergasted that
this guy wasn't communicating.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.110
He had no way to communicate
except for this piece of paper.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.650
So I have a process.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.910
And that process
is that you commit,

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.410
and then you figure
out how the hell

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:43.576
you're going to pull it off.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.010
And knowing that there were
people who had these machines,

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.160
and knowing, because
my background was

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.790
in technology, but from
the standpoint of 3D

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.730
and animation and
design and things

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.130
like that, I knew
enough about programming

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.547
to make myself dangerous.

00:06:01.547 --> 00:06:03.630
But I said, listen, here's
what we're going to do.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.500
One, we're going to get Tempt
a machine so he can talk again.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.180
And two, the next time
there's a fundraiser,

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.880
which is how I became
aware of Tempt,

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.900
next time there's a fundraising
and there's art on the wall,

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.477
it's going to his
art on the wall.

00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:19.810
He's going to be the one
drawing again, not someone else

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.220
drawing again.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.630
And they went, really?

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:23.480
I said, really.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.610
They said, really?

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:26.705
Yes, really.

00:06:26.705 --> 00:06:28.800
We high fived, and we hugged.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.690
And then I was like, oh, my
god, what did I just commit to?

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.980
I had no idea how I was
going to pull that off.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.480
So what I like to do, and this
is the way that I live my life,

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.370
is I love to surround
myself with people

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.610
who make me feel stupid.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.760
If you live your life
like that, you're

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.301
the guy at the dinner
table-- the guy

00:06:47.301 --> 00:06:48.760
or the girl at the
dinner table who's

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.884
winning, because everyone
else is smarter than you.

00:06:50.884 --> 00:06:53.320
So the end of the night,
when the check comes,

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.620
you've learned more
than everybody else.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.414
So I love to invite
brilliant people

00:06:58.414 --> 00:07:00.580
and just have conversations
with them and dialogues.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:01.559
So that's what I did.

00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:03.600
I invited all these crazy
hackers and programmers

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.612
to my house.

00:07:04.612 --> 00:07:06.320
And we had a couple
theories, and we just

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.780
started to explore them.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.730
And the theory was
well, wait a second.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.550
What if we started to-- like,
we know we can get him a device.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.470
We know we can go
and we can break down

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.187
the insurance
company kind of walls

00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:18.770
and get him a Stephen
Hawking machine.

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:19.340
And we did that.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.230
That was something that
just-- I mean, I'm a producer.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:22.850
So I don't know how to
take no for an answer.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.433
We just kind of kept going and
going and going, until finally,

00:07:25.433 --> 00:07:26.220
they said, uncle.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.750
And we got him a device that
allowed him to talk again.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.750
But the second part of
getting him to draw again

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:31.850
was different.

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:35.040
So we said, what if we
use the eye as a way

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.550
to kind of that's the tip of
the pencil or the paintbrush,

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:38.280
if you will.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.773
And what if we mapped
the surface of the eye

00:07:40.773 --> 00:07:43.820
and kind of flattened that
out, so that he could move,

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.090
and that is how he
actually did his keystrokes

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.745
or his paintbrush strokes or,
in this case, his spray paint?

00:07:49.745 --> 00:07:51.620
And so we came up with
the theory of this is.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:52.703
It's called the Eyewriter.

00:07:52.703 --> 00:07:54.749
And the Eyewriter,
because my heritage

00:07:54.749 --> 00:07:56.540
of where I live right
here in Venice Beach,

00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.490
is made from materials that
you find in Venice Beach--

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:02.670
$8 cheap sunglasses
from the Venice Beach

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:06.770
boardwalk, coat hangers
from my local dry cleaner.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:09.830
And then we ordered
a web camera.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:11.920
And we hacked them all together.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.680
And at the end, this
is what happened.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.397
Tempt is the ultimate
graffiti artist.

00:08:20.397 --> 00:08:21.730
He's put Los Angeles on the map.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:23.040
He's always been next level.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.920
He probably is the
most versatile artist.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.109
Tempt is an innovator.

00:08:27.109 --> 00:08:27.900
People respect him.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.010
They know who he is.

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:30.540
He's an OG.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:31.419
He's such a force.

00:08:31.419 --> 00:08:32.710
Nobody compares with his style.

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:34.539
He's one of the top
five in the world.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:37.395
Him being laid up, I
don't think about that.

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.690
When you get diagnosed
with ALS, it's

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:49.710
a traumatizing
experience because you're

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:51.910
told you have only
so long to live,

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:53.900
and you will spend your
time completely trapped

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.110
inside a body that
doesn't move anymore.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:59.230
I hate seeing him like that.

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:03.470
There's so many times where he
could have just slipped away.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:06.910
But he's sticking it in there.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:08.540
It's all about that
one phone call,

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:12.000
the phone call that I
almost did not pick up.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.640
Mick definitely was
on the other end.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.735
I had to be involved with
Tempt and just helping him.

00:09:16.735 --> 00:09:19.505
I had no idea how I was
going to come through

00:09:19.505 --> 00:09:20.890
on what I committed to.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.400
Our writing culture was born of
making something from nothing.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.460
I laid in bed, exploding
with ideas that branched out

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.150
from that initial concept.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.635
That's when I knew
I wasn't done yet.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.587
So at the end, we had all
these guys at our house,

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:50.170
and we hacked and we programmed
for about two and a half weeks

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:53.630
and ate a lot of pasta
and spaghetti and beer

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:54.884
and came up with this is.

00:09:54.884 --> 00:09:55.800
This is the Eyewriter.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.820
And it is as beautiful
as it looks right there.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.210
It's zip ties and
duct tape and coat

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:04.044
hangers and cheap sunglasses.

00:10:04.044 --> 00:10:05.460
But at the end of
two weeks, Tempt

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.000
drew again for the first time.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.070
And it was this
amazing experience.

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:11.870
And we're all down the parking
lot outside of his hospital.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:14.160
We kind of kicked his bed
around so he could see out.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.200
We set up a projector.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.620
It was awesome because we
broke into a car lot next door

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.810
and then projected it on
the side of a building.

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:22.710
And he drew again.

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:24.580
And he drew, and
everybody high fived.

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.660
Then we had some
beers, and it was just

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.260
this awesome experience.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.570
And then we went home,
because that was it.

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:33.420
There was no kind of bigger
picture, grander plan.

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.480
It was more like we knew
we could have Tempt draw.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.280
So we did it.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.696
We did it because
we could, and we

00:10:38.696 --> 00:10:41.930
wanted to help this one person.

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:46.280
And then, we kind of quote,
"woke up" the next day.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.429
And it was "Time Magazine's"
top 50 Inventions of 2010.

00:10:49.429 --> 00:10:51.720
And "Gizmodo" called it "8
Incredible Health Inventions

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.170
That Transform Lives."

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:55.480
And it's now a part of
the permanent collection

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.360
at the MOMA.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:01.090
And it was-- we were like,
what the heck just happened?

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:04.960
We just did something,
essentially, because we could,

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.750
because we wanted to.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.660
And then, it just took
off like wildfire.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.474
We started to think,
wow, is this something

00:11:10.474 --> 00:11:11.515
that we should replicate?

00:11:11.515 --> 00:11:13.389
Is this is something
that we should do again,

00:11:13.389 --> 00:11:16.080
and what did we do, that
we can replicate it?

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.592
And so, in the process of
I'm thinking about this,

00:11:18.592 --> 00:11:20.300
and is this something
I want to continue,

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.400
we got an email from Tempt.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.540
And Tempt's email
said this, "that

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:28.010
was the first time I've drawn
anything for seven years.

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:30.420
I feel like I had
been held underwater,

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.270
and someone finally reached
down and pulled my head up

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:35.440
so I could take a breath."

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:40.140
And we got that, and I remember
actually getting that email

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:43.162
and saying, well, I don't know
what we did, or how we did it,

00:11:43.162 --> 00:11:45.120
but we've got to figure
out how to do it again.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.250
And we've got to
figure out how to keep

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:47.780
doing this over and over again.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.870
And that was the launch
of this concept from me

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:51.120
of Not Impossible.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.540
Not Impossible was-- it was
the culmination of me looking

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:59.100
at things that-- I knew Stephen
Hawking had this device,

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.467
and I knew that it existed.

00:12:00.467 --> 00:12:01.800
But why didn't it exist for him?

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.290
And I knew that there was
these things out there.

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:04.990
So how could we take
something that's

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:08.260
impossible for one person,
and make it not impossible?

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.890
And what would happen if
there was other things

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:12.040
out there like that?

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.906
And because of my
infatuation with technology,

00:12:14.906 --> 00:12:16.030
I said well, wait a second.

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:18.613
What if we take technology, and
we make it not just technology

00:12:18.613 --> 00:12:20.920
for technology's
sake, but technology

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.860
for the sake of humanity?

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:25.170
What happens if we churn
this into something

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:28.360
that we use technology and
we hack and crack and make

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.630
and reprogram and
bust open things,

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:33.880
and actually churn it into
something that accomplishes

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.210
a fundamental social good?

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:38.132
Then, what could happen?

00:12:38.132 --> 00:12:39.840
And so in this obsession
with technology,

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.530
I started to obsess about
this concept of impossible

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:44.750
and started to look at,
well, what is impossible?

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:46.620
Well, the reality
is you can't name

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:52.935
anything that was not impossible
at one time-- nothing.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.230
Go for the obvious.

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:00.250
Look around this room-- from
projectors and computers

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.670
and cellphones and kind of
the obvious stuff, right?

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:07.540
Now let's go back
a couple hundred,

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:08.850
a couple thousand years.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:10.320
How about clothes?

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.604
Just the concept of
clothes or woven clothes.

00:13:13.604 --> 00:13:16.020
Depending on your religious
beliefs, go back even further.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.170
How about walking upright?

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:23.550
So everything, truly
everything-- and everybody

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:25.080
in this room knows this.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.230
How many things did you
guys launch this month that

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:29.955
were impossible last month?

00:13:29.955 --> 00:13:30.830
How about this week?

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:32.042
How about today?

00:13:32.042 --> 00:13:32.750
You guys do this.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:34.991
You guys are almost immune
to it at this point.

00:13:34.991 --> 00:13:36.990
And we, I think, as a
society, are immune to it,

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:39.340
especially, in the
technology space.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:43.020
Well, then, if that's the
case, then impossible really

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:46.945
isn't a question of 'if,' it's
a question of a 'when.' So

00:13:46.945 --> 00:13:49.320
in this kind of obsession, I
started looking at different

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.120
things.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.460
and one of the case studies
that I love to kind of site

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:56.900
is what impossible
incites in people

00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.120
is this sense the permission.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.610
And this guy is a guy
named Roger Bannister.

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:06.660
And Roger Bannister, in 1954,
was the first human being

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:10.610
in all of recorded
history to ever break

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:12.766
the four-minute mile.

00:14:12.766 --> 00:14:16.210
All of recorded history
is a big amount of time.

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:19.750
We've been recording history
for a couple years now, right?

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:24.740
He breaks it on May
6, I think, of 1954.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:29.830
Within 60 days, two more
people broke that record.

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:31.500
All of recorded
history-- nobody.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.200
He breaks it-- two more
people, including himself,

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.860
breaks that record.

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:39.480
So once impossible
becomes possible,

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.110
it's a sense of permission
that's granted to everybody.

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:43.460
And everybody goes and does it.

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:46.340
And that's just, again,
that's not rhetoric.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.650
That's statistics.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:49.330
That's factual data.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:53.730
So for us, as human beings,
when we look at things,

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:55.900
and we look at things
especially in things

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:57.800
that are helping
other human beings,

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:58.970
maybe it's not possible now.

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:00.660
Maybe pure water's
not a possible now.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:01.993
Maybe this, that, and the other.

00:15:01.993 --> 00:15:03.804
It's just a question of time.

00:15:03.804 --> 00:15:05.220
Look at all the
medical inventions

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:06.590
that are coming out nowadays.

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:10.430
The guy that discovered the
test for pancreatic cancer.

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:12.470
He's a high school kid.

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:14.280
He's a high school kid.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.820
So these things
are just a question

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.028
of time, which I find
incredibly motivating, in terms

00:15:18.028 --> 00:15:20.800
of anything that we
set our sights on.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:24.490
So Tempt is kind of Act One
or Chapter One, if you will,

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:26.080
of the Not Impossible story.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.760
Chapter Two happened
on July 11--

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:32.250
again, a Venice Beach story--
at a restaurant right over

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:34.060
on Abbot Kinney.

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.160
I was out to dinner
with somebody.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.700
And we started
talking about things.

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.470
And we started talking
about this guy.

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:42.410
This guy's name is
Doctor Tom Catena.

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:44.409
And this guy I'm
out to dinner with

00:15:44.409 --> 00:15:45.700
said, yeah, this guy's amazing.

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:47.470
He's this doctor in
Sudan in this area

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:49.440
called the Nuba Mountains
and blah, blah, blah.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.105
And we start
talking, so I do what

00:15:51.105 --> 00:15:52.560
every self-respecting
human being

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.260
does at the end of
an interesting night.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.634
You go back and
you look up online

00:15:56.634 --> 00:15:59.490
and you Facebook them, right?

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:01.600
So I go back and
look at this guy,

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.600
and I read this
story by Alex Perry

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.810
that talks about this doctor.

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:07.530
And this doctor is alone
in the Nuba Mountains,

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:09.810
and he is treating these people.

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:14.600
And this Nuba Mountains
is-- has everyone here been

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.090
educated in the United States?

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:18.330
Who hasn't been educated
in the United States?

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:20.450
So you guys probably
know where Sudan is.

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:23.905
For for those of you who are
educated in this country,

00:16:23.905 --> 00:16:25.280
you probably don't know.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:29.260
So Sudan is located in a country
called Africa-- or a continent

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.680
called Africa.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.375
But it's a contested--
Nuba Mountains

00:16:33.375 --> 00:16:37.420
is the contested area
between Sudan, which is kind

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:38.990
of North Sudan and South Sudan.

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:41.110
And it's one of the
most recent countries.

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:44.880
It was July-- I
think it was July 11.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:48.310
Yeah, July 11 in
2011, I think is when

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:50.400
they received independence.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:55.560
So there's this war going on
between North Sudan, or Sudan,

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.310
and South Sudan.

00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:00.630
They declare independence
and the Nuba Mountains

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:01.800
gets the raw of the deal.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:02.900
Because when they
draw the lines,

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:03.840
the Nuba Mountains
have been fighting

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.119
on the side of the south.

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:07.089
But when they're in
the negotiation table,

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:09.310
they said, oh, let's just
move that line this way.

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:10.440
And Sudan got screwed.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.359
Or I'm sorry, the Nuba
Mountains got screwed.

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:15.880
They got put in essentially
the camp, or the country,

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.079
that they had been fighting.

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:19.599
So the government
of Sudan-- I promise

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:22.200
this isn't a political-- this
isn't a Michael Moore talk,

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.720
I promise.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.369
So the government of
Sudan then implemented

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:30.510
a classic military
approach, which

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:34.000
is you bomb, burn, and pillage.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000
You drive everybody out.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:35.499
And then.

00:17:35.499 --> 00:17:38.140
When your ground forces come in,
no one's there and you go, oh.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.620
And you plant your flag and say,
looks like there's no one here

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:41.150
to fight.

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:41.650
0

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:45.420
So they've been constantly
bombing this area.

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.380
Well, this doctor
named Doctor Tom

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:49.640
is treating all of the people.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.942
He's the only doctor
within a 1,500 mile radius.

00:17:51.942 --> 00:17:53.400
And he's treating
all these people.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.910
He does, literally,
everything, from drawing

00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:00.490
blood to appendectomies, to
crazy complicated surgeries,

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:02.610
to really simple surgeries,
and delivering babies.

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:03.818
And he's this incredible guy.

00:18:03.818 --> 00:18:08.380
Well, when the war
broke out, his bosses

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:12.310
basically said, hey,
you've got to get out.

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:13.370
It's gnarly over there.

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:15.420
And he said, I'm a
missionary doctor.

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:16.890
This is what I do.

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:18.570
I don't run when it gets tough.

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:19.980
That's when I stay.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:20.920
And so, he stayed.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.230
And so I'm like, this is
incredible to learn about him.

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:25.130
Well, the gnarly part
about it is the way

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:27.940
that this war works is
that the government,

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.520
in that military tactic
of driving people out,

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.940
they just constantly do
these bombing missions.

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:35.650
And they roll
55-gallon drums filled

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:38.170
of jet fuel and shrapnel--
metal shrapnel-- out

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:40.550
of the back of prop planes.

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:43.410
So you want to talk
about precision bombing?

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:45.160
This is the antithesis of that.

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.340
They roll these things out.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.570
Well, when they hit the ground,
they spray shrapnel everywhere.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:51.620
So the good thing, if
there is such a thing

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:56.180
as a good thing about a bomb,
is that if you're below ground,

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:59.530
if you get into a foxhole-- and
there's foxholes everywhere--

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:00.310
you're good.

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:04.410
Because as long as you're not
in the path of the shrapnel,

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:05.064
then you're OK.

00:19:05.064 --> 00:19:06.730
And the dust settles
and people come up.

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:08.260
And the people are
so resilient, they

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:09.718
actually grab parts
of the shrapnel

00:19:09.718 --> 00:19:11.830
and use them for farming tools.

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:14.070
That's kind of how
resilient the Nubans are.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:17.060
So part of this story
that I read in "Time"

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:20.530
was this young boy
named Daniel was out

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:25.980
tending his family's herd,
and he heard the bomb come.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:27.170
And he looked around.

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:29.170
There wasn't a foxhole,
so he hid behind a tree.

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:32.180
And he wrapped his arms
around a tree like this.

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:34.800
And the bomb went up not
far from where he was.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:38.300
And the tree protect his body,
but it blew off his arms.

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:43.090
So this is at 11
o'clock at night.

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:43.940
This is the image.

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:46.324
I come back from dinner,
and I'm reading this,

00:19:46.324 --> 00:19:47.240
and I'm learning this.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.700
And this is the
image that I see.

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.660
And I'm just kind
of sitting there

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.280
a bit aghast, a bit shocked.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.830
I wasn't really expecting this.

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.700
And where I'm sitting
at my kitchen table,

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.840
I'm looking down
the hallway where

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.880
these three knuckleheads sleep.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.820
And this thing in the article--
the very end of the article--

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:07.500
Daniel said when he woke
up, Doctor Tom saved them.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.890
He stitched him up.

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:11.250
And when Doctor Tom saved
him, when Daniel woke up

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:14.870
he said, if I realized
he was an armless boy,

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:17.520
he said, if I
could die, I would,

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:21.804
because now I'm going to be
such a burden to my family.

00:20:21.804 --> 00:20:24.220
And I don't know how many
people here are parents in here,

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:26.950
or have nieces and nephews,
or just likes kids.

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:29.240
But the concept of a
kid wishing that they

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.090
could die because
they're going to be

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:34.770
a burden to an adult, for
me, was just like, ooh.

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:38.260
And especially, I couldn't
imagine these guys saying that.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.227
So my process kicked in.

00:20:41.227 --> 00:20:43.060
I'm like, I don't know
what I'm going to do,

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:47.140
or how I'm going do it, but
I've got to do something.

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:50.340
So in my research
around Not Impossible,

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:51.984
I had launched Not
Impossible labs.

00:20:51.984 --> 00:20:53.400
In Not Impossible
labs, we started

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.500
to celebrate other
people who we thought

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:59.080
were just doing crazy stuff, who
are inventing things or doing

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.350
things or hacking things.

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:02.500
And we had just done
a story on a guy

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:06.394
who had 3D printed a
hand out in Africa.

00:21:06.394 --> 00:21:08.310
And we were like, OK,
good, there's something.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:09.620
We've got something here.

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:11.647
So again, surround
yourself with people

00:21:11.647 --> 00:21:12.730
that make you feel stupid.

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:14.521
I borough in a bunch
of people to my house.

00:21:14.521 --> 00:21:15.890
We moved all of our stuff out.

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:17.520
We moved out into
the back, again,

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.860
like we did for the Eyewriter.

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:23.030
We started cooking lots of
carbohydrates for everybody

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:23.910
all weekend long.

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:24.550
And we started to hack.

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:26.770
And we went through, and we
started to 3D print things,

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:29.103
and sort of to play with
different types of prosthetics.

00:21:29.103 --> 00:21:32.080
And we invited owners
of 3D printing companies

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:35.290
and started to look at do we
use plastic, or do we use wood?

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:37.040
This is the carpenter
from South Africa

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:40.210
who first made the robohand, the
hand that we did a report on.

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:42.240
And so I knew that
something out there

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.826
had been done in this space.

00:21:43.826 --> 00:21:45.200
The end of our
hacker weekend, it

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.400
was an utter and
absolute failure.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.797
We had not reached-- we
didn't do anything right.

00:21:49.797 --> 00:21:51.380
One of the people
that we invited over

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:53.710
to do a test arm for, she
was missing a right arm,

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:55.080
and we made a left arm for her.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.620
It was just like a parade of
horribles all weekend long.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.840
But we learned what didn't work.

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.090
That's for sure.

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:04.904
So Richard said,
listen, mate, I know.

00:22:04.904 --> 00:22:06.070
I see that look in your eye.

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:08.180
I know that you're
not not going.

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:09.980
And I said, tickets are bought.

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:12.062
I'm going no matter what.

00:22:12.062 --> 00:22:13.520
It's just a question
of whether I'm

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.728
going to go out there and
actually get anything done.

00:22:15.728 --> 00:22:18.180
He said, look, reroute your
trip through South Africa.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.221
So I went to South Africa
and stayed with Richard

00:22:20.221 --> 00:22:21.650
for about seven days.

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:24.920
And we just printed all day,
all night, played with it.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:28.190
I made more wrong hands and
arms than you could imagine.

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:29.690
But I started to
get the hang of it.

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:32.600
And he showed me the ergonomics
of the hand, how it worked.

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.570
And then I bid his family
farewell, hopped on a plane,

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:41.670
and flew from Johannesburg to
Nairobi, and then from Nairobi

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:43.750
to this runway.

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:45.700
And this runway is in Yida.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.630
And Yida is a
refugee camps that's

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:51.790
very close to the border of the
Nuba Mountains and South Sudan.

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:56.270
And this is where all
the Nubans flee to.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:58.730
And then I got a chance
meet Daniel, the young boy.

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:03.160
The plan was to go
over after meeting him.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.590
We land, I go meet him.

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:06.920
I was incredibly nervous
about meeting this kid.

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.490
This entire project was
called Project Daniel.

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:10.573
And this is everything
we've been working towards,

00:23:10.573 --> 00:23:12.130
everything we've
been trying to do.

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:14.360
Go meet him, talk to
him for a little bit,

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.940
and then hop in a truck
and drive about eight,

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:21.210
nine hours illegally
across the border

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:23.671
with the SPLA, which is the
Sudanese People's Liberation

00:23:23.671 --> 00:23:24.170
Army.

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:26.290
They're going to guide us and
help to kind of get across

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:27.980
the border under
the cover of night,

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:30.440
and to Doctor Tom, who's on
the other side, who's actually

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.642
in the Sudan region.

00:23:32.642 --> 00:23:34.100
So we went over,
and we met, and we

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:36.237
talked to him for a little bit.

00:23:36.237 --> 00:23:37.320
There's a problem, though.

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.230
We packed up all the
trucks to get ready.

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:44.450
The security showed up and said,
listen, we're from the SPLA,

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:47.390
and you can't go.

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:49.270
And we said, what do
you mean we can't go?

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:51.900
And they said, we're sorry,
but the ceasefire ended.

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:54.960
So it's an active war
zone out there right now,

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:58.820
and we just don't feel
comfortable with you going.

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:02.920
And I did what every
self-respecting producer

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:07.410
in Los Angeles would do, which
is, maybe you don't understand.

00:24:09.725 --> 00:24:10.475
I'm on a schedule.

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.410
I brought some guys wit
cameras, some printers,

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:17.690
and some laptops, and
we're going to go up there,

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:18.350
and we're going to do this.

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:19.430
So if you can just--
And he's like,

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:20.600
maybe you don't understand.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.110
There's bombs and bullets
going on out there,

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:25.080
and you're not going anywhere.

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:28.740
So we spent about an
hour freaking out.

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:31.920
Like this whole mission
kind of crashed to a close.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.750
Our whole thing was
to get to Doctor Tom

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:37.940
and help Doctor Tom come
up with a methodology

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:41.449
that he could start to
do this for other people.

00:24:41.449 --> 00:24:43.240
So we're like, oh, what
are we going to do?

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.240
What are we going to do?

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.740
And luckily, one of
the local nonprofits

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:49.682
in the area, the
NGO, said hey, look,

00:24:49.682 --> 00:24:51.390
while you guys get
this stuff sorted out,

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:52.620
we've got a shed in the back.

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:55.225
If you want to work over in our
shed, then you can get going.

00:24:55.225 --> 00:24:56.350
I said, great, let's do it.

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:58.599
So we said, look, let's
start doing this now.

00:24:58.599 --> 00:25:00.140
We'll start teaching
people here now.

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.250
And let's at least
get an arm for Daniel.

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:05.080
So we went over, and we
started setting up the shed.

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:07.620
In the shed, AKA an
oven, because it was

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:10.785
100-and-something degrees out.

00:25:10.785 --> 00:25:13.410
And we just started working with
the cast and the forms of what

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:14.400
we were doing.

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.820
And getting to know
Daniel a little bit.

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:18.940
When I first met him,
he was pretty much

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.166
silent, didn't want to talk.

00:25:20.166 --> 00:25:22.040
And starting to get to
know him a little bit,

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.670
and kind of who he was.

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:26.590
And then we learned
the same TIA,

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:29.320
which is This Is
Africa, which is

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.920
the equivalent of Murphy's Law.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.190
Literally, if that
could go wrong, it did.

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:35.620
The electricity was wrong.

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:38.830
The electricity spiked.

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:40.230
It was so hot.

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:42.520
Everyone here is-- I'm
assuming at Google,

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:45.070
everyone here is fairly familiar
with how a 3D printer works,

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:46.770
right?

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:50.580
Tube of cold plastic goes
through extruder that heats it

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:54.870
up too hot plastic, turns
plastic to hot frosting,

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:56.740
grid, repeat.

00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:00.480
Problem-- if cold plastic is
so hot that cold plastic melts

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.460
to itself before it
gets to extruder,

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.820
cold plastic can't
go through piece

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:06.460
to make cold
plastic, hot plastic,

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:07.970
and it all melts to itself.

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:11.550
So it was so hot there that my
filament was melting to itself.

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:14.360
And it was just fouling up
every print we were doing.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.580
So we had to start
printing at night.

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:18.110
That's started to
work a little bit.

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:19.568
But then, we had
problems with that

00:26:19.568 --> 00:26:23.280
because most of these
printers give off light.

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:25.440
Light attracts what?

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.604
Bugs.

00:26:26.604 --> 00:26:28.020
Bugs in Africa are
a little bigger

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.550
than bugs in Venice Beach.

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:32.520
So I have these dive-bombing
pterodactyl-size moths

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.674
hitting my printer and
jamming up my printer

00:26:34.674 --> 00:26:36.090
so that I couldn't
actually print.

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:38.149
So it was one thing after
another after another.

00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:39.440
But it's called Project Daniel.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.970
And this is what I
woke up to every day

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:42.220
was Daniel sitting next to me.

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:44.044
So try-- everybody
repeat after me.

00:26:44.044 --> 00:26:45.460
Imagine Daniel
sitting next to you

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:47.500
and try saying,
sorry, Daniel, we're

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.610
not going to be able
to do this for you.

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:50.932
Yeah, you can't say it.

00:26:50.932 --> 00:26:51.890
It's impossible, right?

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:53.140
I don't believe in impossible.

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:54.700
That I believe is impossible.

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:57.130
So we just kind of kept
fighting through it.

00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:01.380
And then after kind of all
kinds of trials and tribulations

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:03.060
and mess ups, this
is what happened.

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:21.140
There's this thing
in me that loves

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:25.460
to see things that are not
supposed to be done, be done.

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:28.300
Daniel is just one of
50,000 amputees left

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:31.270
in the wake of the bloodiest
war Africa has ever known.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:37.200
We flew into an active
war zone in Sudan

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.210
with 3D printers, laptops,
spools of plastic,

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:42.792
and the goal to
build Daniel an arm.

00:27:42.792 --> 00:27:43.776
You ready?

00:27:56.090 --> 00:28:01.120
The concept of Project Daniel
was hatched on July 11th.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:04.870
And on November 11th, Daniel
fed himself for the first time

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:05.701
in two years.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.730
But it's never about
just one person.

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:17.100
If we could teach the
locals to do it themselves,

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:21.090
then Project Daniel could
live on long after we left,

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:23.150
and it did.

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:08.610
So that's Project Daniel.

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:13.110
And that's what happened, which
was take the first time Temp

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:17.230
drawing, on that kind of night
down in downtown Los Angeles.

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:19.619
And then take the moment
where Daniel fed himself

00:29:19.619 --> 00:29:20.410
for the first time.

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:22.576
And then that moment in the
room where he's actually

00:29:22.576 --> 00:29:24.460
throwing stuff to Doctor Tom.

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:27.620
It was a pretty awesome,
awesome experience.

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:33.210
So what I did around
this was essentially

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:36.900
a conclusion of you could go
about this a couple different

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:38.990
ways, right?

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:45.870
You could go about this
acting like a nonprofit,

00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:49.546
or you could go about
this and actually

00:29:49.546 --> 00:29:53.560
get corporations and
companies to get something out

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.860
of the process of
changing the world.

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:58.430
So my philosophy around
this, now, what I do

00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:00.575
is I believe that brands
can change the world.

00:30:00.575 --> 00:30:03.200
I believe that brands can change
the world because human beings

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.060
run those brands.

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.270
Human beings run
those corporations.

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:09.802
And I started off
as a nonprofit.

00:30:09.802 --> 00:30:11.260
And I used to joke
with my friends,

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:13.500
I was getting carpal tunnel
from like shaking the tin

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:15.624
can all the time, trying
to people through a couple

00:30:15.624 --> 00:30:16.495
shekels in.

00:30:16.495 --> 00:30:17.870
And I wasn't really
get anywhere.

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:19.990
And I spent most of my
time trying to figure out

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:21.864
how to get people to
give me money as opposed

00:30:21.864 --> 00:30:22.639
to doing the work.

00:30:22.639 --> 00:30:24.180
And then I realized,
well, what would

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:26.530
happen if I actually
started to think about this

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:29.420
in a completely different way?

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:32.370
And the different way is
this-- and Fuller says it

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:34.940
the best-- is that, if you
want to change something,

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:38.910
don't go about it by just
taking a new tack on things.

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:41.590
You have to clear the
slate and start it

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:43.890
from a completely new approach.

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:45.350
And that's what we did.

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:47.390
And so what we started
to do is say, well,

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:49.905
what happens if we got
brands, who already--

00:30:49.905 --> 00:30:53.140
and especially this company.

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:55.450
You guys understand this.

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:59.160
People and brands have a
message that they have to tell,

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:01.950
and they tell it in a
variety of different ways.

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:05.250
Well, what would happen if we
gave brands an incredible story

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:06.267
that they could tell.

00:31:06.267 --> 00:31:08.100
And they could say,
yes, we want to give you

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:09.370
money to go tell this story.

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:12.700
But this story is, instead of
being a comedian telling a joke

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.460
or a fictitious commercial
that's being made

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.252
or contest or
something like this,

00:31:17.252 --> 00:31:19.460
what if it was something
that's really truly changing

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:20.619
the world?

00:31:20.619 --> 00:31:22.910
That's something that brands
can sink their teeth into.

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:24.610
And that's something that
the people of those brands

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:26.050
can sink their teeth into.

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:29.100
So that's what we did, is
we got Intel and a company

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:32.032
called Precipart to get
behind Project Daniel.

00:31:32.032 --> 00:31:33.573
And then, we launched
Project Daniel.

00:31:33.573 --> 00:31:35.980
And we launched Project Daniel
actually a week ago last week

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:38.482
on January 6th, ironically, the
exact day that the book came

00:31:38.482 --> 00:31:41.650
out, which was nice,
nice serendipity.

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:45.470
And it launched, and
we got 420 million

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:50.270
earned media impressions in
14 weeks with zero paid media.

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:52.500
It was purely from
just people being

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:55.105
amazed by the
story really seeing

00:31:55.105 --> 00:31:56.990
the story as a valuable thing.

00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:59.860
And everybody in the
world covered it.

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:01.290
That's the value that Intel got.

00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:02.790
That's the value
that Precipart got.

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:04.456
And that's the value
that the world got,

00:32:04.456 --> 00:32:06.365
because now, the world
got a piece of code,

00:32:06.365 --> 00:32:09.500
and they got a manuscript, and
they got some instructables,

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:11.124
and they got a
how-to video on how

00:32:11.124 --> 00:32:12.290
to actually make this thing.

00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:15.290
Because everything we
do at Not Impossible,

00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:17.595
our theory is not IP.

00:32:17.595 --> 00:32:19.220
Our theory is not,
let's make something

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:21.630
and let's go be the
biggest 3D printing

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:23.300
prosthetic maker in the world!

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:25.270
It's like, no, give it away.

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:28.540
Because, the arm that we made,
and we launched a year ago,

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:31.210
that arm has been bested
probably four or five times

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:32.340
over since then.

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:36.050
Because our job was to
start to light the fuse,

00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:37.540
and then let people run with it.

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:39.930
When we made the
Eyewriter, we lit the fuse,

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:42.680
and the Eyewriter's almost
obsolete at this point

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:44.560
because you can
now-- the devices

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.090
that existed were $15,000.

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:47.730
We made it for $90.

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:50.350
Now you can get
beautiful devices

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:53.450
for $200 that are off-the-shelf,
that come in a nice box

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:55.010
and have customer support.

00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:56.940
And not some hacker
over in Venice Beach

00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:58.424
that put some stuff together.

00:32:58.424 --> 00:32:59.840
So that's what
we're trying to do.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:03.480
We're trying to incite and
provoke this type of change.

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:05.510
And that's what we were
able to do around this.

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:07.250
And we launched this
thing, and then, it

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:08.833
accomplished everything
that we wanted

00:33:08.833 --> 00:33:11.370
it to do as far as media goes.

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:14.060
Added a day, and then it
started winning awards, Telly.

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:15.850
And we got Best of
Show at the One Show.

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:18.790
And AICP created a
special award for us.

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:20.750
And we won at the
next awards for there.

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:23.640
At Cannes, which is kind of
the big advertising festival,

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:27.990
we won the granddaddy of them
all, which is the Titanium.

00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:31.410
And this was all about a story
about us going out and doing

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:32.870
good with technology.

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:35.520
So what this concluded
for us is-- not

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:38.457
concluded, what it just proved
to us is that our theory is--

00:33:38.457 --> 00:33:40.790
everyone's heard the theory
doing good is good business.

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:41.900
Everyone's aware of that.

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:43.760
And everybody in this
room, most likely,

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:47.870
makes decisions on purchases
based on whether they

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:49.680
know a company is doing good.

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:52.520
But doing good is
also good branding.

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:55.797
And if we can actually take--
what Not Impossible wants to do

00:33:55.797 --> 00:33:57.880
is take all these different
initiatives that we're

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.450
doing right now,
and match them up

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:02.320
with corporations who
can get the word out,

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:06.280
because your company and other
companies like your company,

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:11.210
you have this massive, massive
megaphone that nonprofits

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:13.770
don't have access to.

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:17.170
And at the end of the day, I'm
judging us by whether or not

00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:18.610
we're doing good in the world.

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:20.210
And whether we do
good in the world

00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:25.260
is measured by how powerfully
our message gets out there.

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:28.199
And I absolutely believe
in the power of the story.

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:30.400
The story that we
told was about-- this

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:34.150
is a critical point
to this, as well.

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:35.982
Well, usually I say,
there's probably

00:34:35.982 --> 00:34:38.190
nobody in this room with
the net worth of Bill Gates.

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:40.980
But I'm at this company, so
I can't make that assumption.

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.760
Maybe some of you have
been here a long time.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.724
But most people don't have
Buffett or Gate's type net

00:34:46.724 --> 00:34:47.370
worth.

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:52.167
So you can't attack things
like hunger or malaria

00:34:52.167 --> 00:34:53.000
or things like that.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.650
As noble and as
amazing and those are,

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:58.250
how do you wrap your arms
around the concept of malaria

00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:00.620
as a single human being?

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:03.540
Or hunger, how do you wrap
your arms around that?

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:07.610
But if I said, there's a dude
outside that needs a sandwich.

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:10.520
Can you loan me $5 or
just run and pilfer one

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.770
from the a Google cafeteria?

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:13.562
Can you hook me up?

00:35:13.562 --> 00:35:14.519
Do you want to do that?

00:35:14.519 --> 00:35:15.270
The answer is yes.

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:17.000
If I say, hey, can
you really quickly,

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.340
I need to solve world hunger.

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:19.465
Do you want to help me out?

00:35:19.465 --> 00:35:21.410
You're like, uh.

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:23.295
So the powerful
thing is the power

00:35:23.295 --> 00:35:29.420
of one story about one person is
what we base our philosophy on.

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:31.270
Our philosophy is
help one, help many.

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:32.629
You help one person.

00:35:32.629 --> 00:35:34.670
But by helping that one
person, has the potential

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:36.010
to help many, many people.

00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:37.940
And that's through
the power of story.

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:40.934
So we go through and we tell
stories about this all the time

00:35:40.934 --> 00:35:41.850
on Not Impossible now.

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:43.410
We're constantly telling
stories about things.

00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:45.080
We just ran at CES
having our minds

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.900
blown about all these
incredible people who

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:49.300
are out there doing incredible
things around technology.

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:53.540
But we're not so interested
in the 70-million-inch curved

00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:55.570
plasma, as we are in
these different devices.

00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:56.970
We're like, oh,
interesting, what

00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:59.140
if we took that and
matched it up with that,

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:00.700
and then matched that with that.

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:03.199
And then, krchk, we Frankenstein
something that can actually

00:36:03.199 --> 00:36:05.140
accomplish something amazing.

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:07.790
So the question that
we ask to you guys,

00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:09.799
and the question that
I ask to my readers,

00:36:09.799 --> 00:36:11.590
and the question that
ask to the people who

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:14.860
are familiar with Not Impossible
is, what's your story?

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:18.835
What's your story, and even more
importantly, who is your one?

00:36:18.835 --> 00:36:21.210
Who is that one person, what's
that one invention, what's

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:24.120
that one thing that
you can do that

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:26.010
can lead to something
that can help

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:28.170
many, many people
around the world?

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:32.920
And ultimately, that's
who is your Daniel.

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:33.930
So help one, help many.

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:35.070
Thank you, guys, very much.

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:37.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:42.569 --> 00:36:44.360
AUDIENCE: Can I ask
you stay for questions?

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:45.651
MICK EBELING: Sure, absolutely.

00:36:52.684 --> 00:36:55.183
SPEAKER 1: I have a couple of
technical questions, actually.

00:36:55.183 --> 00:36:56.200
MICK EBELING: Uh, oh,
I'm not the tech guy.

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:58.420
I'm going to preface
that right now.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:00.325
AUDIENCE: But on
the Eyewriter, I'm

00:37:00.325 --> 00:37:02.950
just wondering, when you your
drawing something by blinking

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:06.300
your eyes around as
the brush, and then you

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:09.900
want to look at
what you've drawn,

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:11.921
how do you avoid
scratching over?

00:37:11.921 --> 00:37:13.420
MICK EBELING: It's
a great question.

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:16.760
So there's two ways to engage
ocular recognition technology--

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:19.050
and I'd never said those
three words in a row

00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:23.060
prior to the Eyewriter, ocular
recognition technology-- blink

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:24.600
and gaze.

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:28.340
So the way the Eyewriter worked
is that Tempt was laying there,

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:30.170
and he would stare,
and he would blink,

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:31.610
and that puts the pencil down.

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:33.440
And he would blink, and that
would pick the pencil up.

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.899
So you would just blink and
pick it up, and then move or do

00:37:35.899 --> 00:37:38.523
what you want to do, and figure
out where you want to go again.

00:37:38.523 --> 00:37:39.940
And blink and set it down again.

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:44.430
And his skills as an artist-- I
can barely draw a stick figure.

00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:47.940
What he was able to do with
his eyes and essentially

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:51.400
a two-dimensional application
with a pencil and a paper,

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:53.450
essentially what
it was, what he was

00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:55.010
able to create
three dimensionally,

00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:57.301
was-- there's actually some
pictures of it in the book.

00:37:57.301 --> 00:37:58.080
You can see it.

00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:00.050
It's remarkable.

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:00.960
AUDIENCE: Very cool.

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:05.295
The other one was just how--
when Daniel was throwing

00:38:05.295 --> 00:38:06.580
the ball-- how was that--

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:07.996
MICK EBELING: This
is awesome, OK?

00:38:07.996 --> 00:38:10.460
Everybody put your hand out
in front of you like this.

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:14.460
Now, at the tip of your fingers
you've got guitar strings.

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:16.370
Those are tight
guitar strings, right?

00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:19.240
And it runs down your
hand, on your wrist,

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:23.650
around to the fulcrum point of
your elbow, and to your bicep.

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:25.199
Now go like this.

00:38:25.199 --> 00:38:26.740
What happens to
those guitar strings?

00:38:30.722 --> 00:38:31.430
They get tighter.

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:33.130
And what happens if
they get tighter?

00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:37.530
What happens to your
fingers if these are hinged?

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:38.570
They have to.

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:41.365
If they don't, if this is all
fixed, and you go like this,

00:38:41.365 --> 00:38:42.990
you're not going to
be able to bend it.

00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:44.720
So something has to give.

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.040
So you go like this.

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:50.360
It pulls on the strings
and your hand collapses.

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.480
So the concept of
throwing something-- I'm

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.850
looking for something to throw.

00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:55.500
Here, ready?

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.610
So I'm going to pick this up.

00:38:57.610 --> 00:38:59.420
I put my hand across like this.

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:00.380
I put my hand over it.

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.902
It took Daniel all of maybe
13 seconds to figure this out,

00:39:02.902 --> 00:39:03.402
too.

00:39:03.402 --> 00:39:04.570
It was incredible.

00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:05.740
You put your hand over it.

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:07.050
You bend your elbow like this.

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:07.800
It goes like this.

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.120
Now watch this.

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.120
I'm going to throw this.

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:11.200
Watch my arm, OK?

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:11.840
So it's bent.

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:13.710
It's collapsed.

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:15.040
The strings are pulled.

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:15.540
Ready?

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:18.400
This is a pitcher.

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:18.900
Arm's bent.

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:19.530
Arm's bent.

00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:20.270
Arm's bent.

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.770
Arm's bent.

00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:21.270
Arm's bent.

00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:23.700
Arm's straight with
my fingers open.

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:26.460
So he drilled three
perfect passes to us

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:28.110
with ball of Ace bandage.

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:30.130
And we were like, what
the hell is going on?

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:32.170
Is this kid like a
test tube quarterback

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:33.270
that we've discovered him?

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:35.806
It's like Manute Bol discovering
him in some foreign land

00:39:35.806 --> 00:39:37.010
and then bring him back?

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:39.590
And it's no-- it's just a
natural physiology of a throw.

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:41.430
It's like this, like
this, then you release.

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:42.471
So his fingers opened up.

00:39:42.471 --> 00:39:44.597
So he threw it to Doctor
Tom and me a couple times.

00:39:44.597 --> 00:39:45.721
It was like perfect throws.

00:39:45.721 --> 00:39:47.543
AUDIENCE: So the power
then actually came

00:39:47.543 --> 00:39:49.900
from his shoulders.

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:52.169
The arm itself was not powered?

00:39:52.169 --> 00:39:53.960
MICK EBELING: The arm's
not powered at all.

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:56.360
It's completely
man-- it's strings.

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.260
We looked at
different ways that we

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:01.290
might be able to create
things with power.

00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:03.266
And you put something
in a village

00:40:03.266 --> 00:40:04.890
where there's no
power, no electricity,

00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:07.200
and you've got a
feeble machines that's

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:13.180
going to last as long as a
bunch of first world countryites

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:13.680
are there.

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:15.471
And as soon as they
leave, it's going bust.

00:40:15.471 --> 00:40:17.400
So the way we did it is
we tried to make it so

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.959
that, oh, a string breaks?

00:40:18.959 --> 00:40:19.750
Great, restring it.

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:20.583
Oh, a finger breaks?

00:40:20.583 --> 00:40:21.356
Great, reprint it.

00:40:21.356 --> 00:40:23.105
We tried to make it
as simple as possible.

00:40:23.105 --> 00:40:24.355
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:40:24.355 --> 00:40:25.950
MICK EBELING: Absolutely.

00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:26.450
Yeah?

00:40:33.124 --> 00:40:34.290
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:35.665
I just want to
know, essentially,

00:40:35.665 --> 00:40:36.703
what are you up to next?

00:40:36.703 --> 00:40:38.536
Like, what's the thing
that's keeping you up

00:40:38.536 --> 00:40:40.660
at night now [INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:44.112
MICK EBELING: Hmm, no one ever
asked that question before.

00:40:44.112 --> 00:40:46.930
It's almost like I have
slides prepared for that.

00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:49.050
She's not a plant.

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:50.280
Did you know me before this?

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:50.540
AUDIENCE: No.

00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:52.415
MICK EBELING: That wasn't
a planted question.

00:40:52.415 --> 00:40:54.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] slides?

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:55.860
MICK EBELING: Yes, I do.

00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:58.540
Everyone-- that's kind of a
little game I play in my head.

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:00.020
Like, OK, is it going
to be the first question

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:01.090
or the third question?

00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:02.970
Usually in there.

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:10.010
So I got taken, a while ago,
right after Project Daniel

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:13.030
launched in April
of last year, and I

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:15.410
got taken to hospital or
a rehabilitation hospital

00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:16.600
in Mexico City.

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:20.660
And they took me, and it's
just this incredible pediatric

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:22.110
rehabilitation center.

00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:25.460
And at the end of my tour,
they showed me this room.

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:28.250
And this room was kind of all
their gadgets and whatnot.

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:31.640
And this is a little
girl named Pia.

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:36.480
And she's on a treadmill,
hanging from straps,

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:40.190
and she's got these little,
elliptical like robots

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:43.000
on the side of her legs.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.210
And what this is, is
she's got cerebral palsy.

00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:50.250
And when you have
cerebral palsy--

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:54.510
in my very unmedical
definition of cerebral palsy--

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:56.870
it's the bridge
between the brain

00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:59.430
and the muscles isn't fire.

00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:01.580
So the act of me
saying I'm going

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:05.330
to walk, I just told my legs to
do that, and I do it naturally,

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:06.310
right?

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:09.850
But there's no firing there.

00:42:09.850 --> 00:42:11.970
It's not firing down to
tell the legs what to do.

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:14.690
So what this does, is it
kind of reverses the signal,

00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:17.440
and it starts to show her brain
the other way like, hey, this

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:18.900
is what it feels like to walk.

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:21.365
So like a DJ, you kind
of cross-fade it down.

00:42:21.365 --> 00:42:23.690
And over the period
of a year, she

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:26.622
starts to learn what it
means to be ambulatory.

00:42:26.622 --> 00:42:27.330
And it's awesome.

00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:31.210
And the human body is
just an incredible thing.

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:33.699
So I'm watching this thing,
and I'm like, this is amazing.

00:42:33.699 --> 00:42:34.740
And we went out to lunch.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:39.245
The guy that ran this hospital,
who's incredible human being,

00:42:39.245 --> 00:42:42.642
we went out afterwards and I
said, man, this is amazing.

00:42:42.642 --> 00:42:44.600
I love that last thing
that you just showed me.

00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:48.070
But my question is, with
as many kids as you see--

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:51.650
and they saw-- I got there
at about noon for my tour.

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:54.150
And they had already
seen, by noon,

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:57.660
1,200 kids in this facility.

00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:59.910
So I said, with as many kids
as you see, why don't you

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:02.317
have just rows of
these things and just

00:43:02.317 --> 00:43:04.650
like literally just pumping
people through these things.

00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:07.410
Because if you use this,
they said, that the kid

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:08.770
can walk in a year.

00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:12.340
And if they don't, it could
take five years, if even.

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:15.010
And with the
classic parallel bar

00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:17.204
and with the physical
therapist right down

00:43:17.204 --> 00:43:18.120
and working with them.

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:20.270
It's very kind of one-on-one.

00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:23.830
He says, I'd love to
have that, but they're

00:43:23.830 --> 00:43:26.680
half a million dollars each.

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:29.290
And so, who are the
technical people in here?

00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:31.717
Who's on the programing side?

00:43:31.717 --> 00:43:33.800
You guys know the MasterCard
'priceless' campaign?

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:40.200
Treadmill, $200.

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:45.970
Climbing straps, $40
brand new at REI.

00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:48.470
You guys want to take a shot
at how hard it would be to just

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:50.670
create something to like this?

00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:53.690
Try, try as hard as you might
to try to get that price up,

00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:55.320
and I couldn't get it up.

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:57.410
So I said to him-- remember
the whole commitment,

00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:58.539
figure it out?

00:43:58.539 --> 00:43:59.580
I had a voice in my head.

00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:02.620
Its was like, be careful.

00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:05.980
You didn't know jack about
optical recognition and 3D

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:08.930
printing, but this one
might be a little bigger.

00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:10.110
And I ignored the voice.

00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:11.250
And I said, all right.

00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:11.990
How about this.

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:17.830
Let's say I can make this thing
for you for under $100,000?

00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:19.720
And he said, I'd by
20 of them from you.

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:25.185
And I went, all right,
I'll be right back.

00:44:25.185 --> 00:44:28.140
And this-- actually,
this week is a huge week

00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:31.710
because we're finalizing some
of the partnerships around this.

00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:36.800
But we are going to create a
low-cost ambulatory exoskeleton

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.860
called-- all of our initiatives
are called What They Do,

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:40.600
Not Impossible.

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.830
So this is called
Walk Not Impossible.

00:44:42.830 --> 00:44:44.789
And we're going to create
this thing so that we

00:44:44.789 --> 00:44:46.746
can do exactly what we
did with the Eyewriters,

00:44:46.746 --> 00:44:48.490
exactly what we did
with Project Daniel.

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:50.600
And our goal is to get,
within three years,

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:54.510
over 1,000 kids walking
again for the first time.

00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:57.620
And the coolest
thing about it is

00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:59.770
that in the room that I
built of all the people

00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:02.450
that made me feel
stupid, one of my friends

00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:05.150
said, hey, if you ever do this
again, my son is a programmer.

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:07.120
Can he come and he'll
just like go get you guys

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:08.550
waters and things like that?

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:10.133
And we said, sure,
yeah, come on over.

00:45:10.133 --> 00:45:11.660
His name's Joel.

00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:13.690
I was at-- when he was born.

00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:15.020
I've known him his whole life.

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:17.850
And so he kind of sat
quietly in the room.

00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:21.840
At the end of all of these
really smart people with lots

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:25.200
of initials behind their name
talking, he raised his hand

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:28.720
and said, hey, do you
mind if I share something?

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:30.600
I've got a couple ideas.

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:34.885
And we went , sure,
Joel, go ahead.

00:45:34.885 --> 00:45:37.170
Go ahead, go ahead.

00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:39.840
And he just dropped knowledge
on us for about three minutes

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:40.470
straight.

00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:43.116
And the sound of everyone's
jaws just going ooh,

00:45:43.116 --> 00:45:45.510
ooh, ooh, as he dropped it.

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:48.560
And I'm proud to tell you that
the Granada Hills High school

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:52.210
robotics team are the
lead manufacturers

00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:53.840
and hackers on this assignment.

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:57.100
And they are blowing
people's minds right now.

00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:57.990
It's just incredible.

00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:01.680
So we actually--
Wednesday, we are

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:04.880
going to be filming our
prototype going live

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:05.790
for the first time.

00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:06.748
We hope to be an alpha.

00:46:06.748 --> 00:46:09.420
That will be the prototype.

00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:13.100
And the one thing is
I didn't tell the guy

00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:15.600
when I went to lunch with them
that I'd be done by December.

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:16.830
But that was kind
of in my own head.

00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:19.246
So I'm pissed off that I missed
my deadline by about three

00:46:19.246 --> 00:46:21.100
weeks to have this thing done.

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:23.320
But we'll have our
prototype this week.

00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:26.710
We'll hopefully have alpha
within 30 to 45 days.

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:30.851
We'll go into beta
with Cornell Medical

00:46:30.851 --> 00:46:33.350
back east with a thing called
Burke Rehabilitation Hospital.

00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:34.500
They're looking at
partnering with us

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:35.630
just in some of our trials.

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:38.865
One of our amazing allies and
volunteers works back there.

00:46:38.865 --> 00:46:40.990
And then, we're going to
try to blow this thing out

00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:41.800
to the world.

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:45.550
So that's next thing we're
working on right now.

00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:48.650
We're we launch this
week or next week,

00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:51.970
another iteration of a
communication device for people

00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:53.220
who have Trapped In Syndrome.

00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:55.800
And it came, actually,
a introduction

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:58.100
through a bunch of
Googlers, actually,

00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:00.470
up in the San Francisco office.

00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:02.620
I met a guy named Alan Yu.

00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:07.430
And Alan heard me talk at the
Exploratorium in San Francisco,

00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:10.690
and came up afterwards
and said, we

00:47:10.690 --> 00:47:13.182
have this thing called the--
you guys do 20 Percent, right?

00:47:13.182 --> 00:47:15.140
He's like we have this
thing called 20 Percent.

00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:17.870
I don't know what I can do
around with my 20 Percent,

00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:19.220
but I want to try to help you.

00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:21.880
And so he just started doing
what is kind of gift is.

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:23.440
And what his blessing
is he started

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:24.840
making introductions to people.

00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:26.410
And he introduce
us to some people,

00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:31.000
and now HP kind of came on board
to help us with this thing.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.660
And we're launching this
thing called Don's Voice.

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:40.850
Don's been married to
Lorraine now for 25 years.

00:47:40.850 --> 00:47:46.770
And he hasn't spoken to her
for 15 because he had ALS.

00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:48.270
And he's a farmer.

00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:52.260
And he lives a very simple
life in northern or two

00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:53.920
hours outside of Canada.

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:58.042
And we basically recreated
his letter board.

00:47:58.042 --> 00:48:00.000
You know the letter board
that Tempt was using?

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.625
So this is where I
was just like, what?

00:48:04.890 --> 00:48:08.480
It was 2013, and Don was
still using a letter board.

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:11.780
And I'm like, you're kidding me?

00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:16.120
It sounds very simple, but the
pragmatism around it is very,

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:19.100
kind of, I think, is what
makes it so brilliant.

00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:21.780
If I gave all of
you guys a new phone

00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:24.300
or new keyboard for
your computers and said,

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:24.890
here you go.

00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:27.440
But I changed the order of it.

00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:29.380
Would that be like the
most frustrating thing

00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:31.160
in the world for you?

00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:32.910
Well, if you had a
letter board that you'd

00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:36.120
been using your whole life your,
whole kind of paralyzed life,

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:38.080
and it's laid out the
way that your loved one

00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:42.290
or caretaker laid it out, that's
what you're used to, right?

00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:43.170
That's your keyboard.

00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:44.420
That's your interface.

00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:48.120
So we basically created
an ocular recognition tool

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:50.830
that lets you customize
your interface so that it

00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:52.050
mimics your letter board.

00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:56.070
So that when you transition
from the paper route

00:48:56.070 --> 00:48:58.400
to the digital route, it's
a very fluid transition.

00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.330
And that allowed him
to write a love letter

00:49:00.330 --> 00:49:02.380
to his wife for the first
time in 15 years, which

00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:03.840
was a really awesome story.

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:06.990
So those are two projects that
we're super passionate about.

00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:10.510
And that'll launch either
this week or next week.

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:11.510
So, take a look for it.

00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:13.480
Yeah?

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:18.483
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] makers
of those expensive [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:18.483 --> 00:49:20.920
like the walker and the--

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:22.560
MICK EBELING: Not yet.

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:23.850
Not yet, but we give it away.

00:49:23.850 --> 00:49:28.650
Like how do you-- yeah,
this is going to broadcast,

00:49:28.650 --> 00:49:30.500
so I'm not going to
talk too much smack.

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:33.400
But are mantra is
to give it away.

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:37.710
If it was to harness the IP
and try to make a profit,

00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:40.410
then-- I believe in
an original idea.

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:43.880
And I believe that people, if
they come up with something

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:46.230
great, then they should be
able to make money doing it

00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:47.479
and build a company around it.

00:49:47.479 --> 00:49:50.220
And I don't believe the
people's communication

00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:52.575
and mobility should be
hinged by whether or not

00:49:52.575 --> 00:49:54.090
they have money or insurance.

00:49:54.090 --> 00:49:57.720
So we do it, and then we
put out there to the world.

00:49:57.720 --> 00:49:59.580
And if people take it
and make it better,

00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:02.665
which they've done on everything
we've done so far then, great.

00:50:02.665 --> 00:50:04.295
That's what we
want to see happen.

00:50:04.295 --> 00:50:06.170
AUDIENCE: So that leads
to the question, what

00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:07.795
is your business model then?

00:50:07.795 --> 00:50:09.420
Because I know a lot
of other companies

00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:11.670
are trying to get into the
'good' space, like do good.

00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:14.230
Yet, their business model
isn't set up to enable that

00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:16.650
or Google has 20 Percent.

00:50:16.650 --> 00:50:18.110
How does [INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:18.110 --> 00:50:20.860
MICK EBELING: It's
a great question.

00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:24.040
HP is going to pay
somebody for content.

00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:27.590
Now the concept that the
get is an amazing story

00:50:27.590 --> 00:50:29.940
around Don and Lorraine Moore.

00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:32.287
Intel is going to pay
somebody for their content.

00:50:32.287 --> 00:50:34.370
They get a story about a
young boy feeding himself

00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:36.020
for the first time in two years.

00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:38.570
The robot walker is going
to be an incredible story,

00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:40.670
as you can imagine, with
all the different stories

00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:44.290
that come out of that, where
kids becoming ambulatory.

00:50:44.290 --> 00:50:45.830
We are storytelling company.

00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:46.790
That's what we do.

00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:49.170
But rather than
funny or die, where

00:50:49.170 --> 00:50:55.620
it's about comedy or Michael
Day about exploding things,

00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:57.760
our stories are focused
around technology

00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.160
for the sake of humanity.

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:00.690
And that's kind of how we do it.

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:03.210
And then, we have different
kind of off shoots.

00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:05.460
And the business model is
such that Not Impossible Now

00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:06.720
is an ad-supported site.

00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:08.660
So you can go and
you can just like

00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:14.200
you would go to CNET or Vice
or TechRepublic or Gizmodo

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:16.175
and see those things,
now you're seeing

00:51:16.175 --> 00:51:18.300
stories that are kind of
focused on that technology

00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:19.341
for the sake of humanity.

00:51:19.341 --> 00:51:20.409
So, we're growing.

00:51:20.409 --> 00:51:22.450
We're growing that side
of the business, as well.

00:51:22.450 --> 00:51:25.050
But right now, our
primary is through brands

00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:27.230
seeing what we're doing
and going, that's amazing.

00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:28.646
How can we get
part of that story?

00:51:31.179 --> 00:51:32.637
AUDIENCE: What does
your wife think

00:51:32.637 --> 00:51:34.500
about you going to a war zone?

00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:38.500
MICK EBELING: So my wife is
co-directing the documentary.

00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:40.280
She's an incredible storyteller.

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:44.390
And we both put blinders
on a little bit.

00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:48.440
And we're about to
release the cut.

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:50.010
We're about in our final cut.

00:51:50.010 --> 00:51:54.760
And now that she saw how
gnarly it was over there,

00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:58.550
and she's seen all
the footage, we've

00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:01.520
had conversations about
the fact that it probably

00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:05.490
wasn't something that would
have been as encouraged.

00:52:05.490 --> 00:52:10.775
But it's also, she would
never-- she's incredible.

00:52:10.775 --> 00:52:12.150
And she would
never have said no.

00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:13.441
And I would never have said no.

00:52:13.441 --> 00:52:16.340
Because when you're called
to do something like that,

00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:17.580
you get that gut reaction.

00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:20.240
And we see incredible
things come across our desk

00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:21.376
every single day.

00:52:21.376 --> 00:52:23.500
We get voice mails and
emails and Facebook messages

00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:24.500
all the time.

00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:27.077
And we always are trying to
encourage people to do it.

00:52:27.077 --> 00:52:28.910
But when you get hit
in the gut by something

00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:32.189
and you know you have
to do it, there's

00:52:32.189 --> 00:52:33.480
nothing religious about at all.

00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:35.860
It just like, OK
you need to do it,

00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:39.900
and that was kind of the
thing with Project Daniel.
