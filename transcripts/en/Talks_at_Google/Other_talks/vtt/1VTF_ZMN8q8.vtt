00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
&gt;&gt; As you guys know, this is Dale Dougherty
who is co-founder of O'Reilly Media and founder

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:15.370
of Make Magazine and the Maker Faire so if
you could just give a round of applause.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.370
[applause]

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.270
Dale Dougherty: Good. I have to stay near
the podium I gather. How many of you are familiar

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.570
with Make and Maker Faire? Good. That's probably
why you're here. You know, today I tried to

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.829
put some context around what I see in what
we're doing and also show you a lot of things

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:36.950
that are coming up in Make and talking a bit
about Maker Faire and I'm going to start with

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:45.560
a fairly gratuitous video but it actually
shows a festival in Mexico. It has nothing

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.010
to do with Make or Maker Faire and I don't
think I could do what they're doing at Maker

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.080
Faire without getting a huge amount of trouble
and to be said, you probably shouldn't do

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:04.259
this at home either. It's called Sledgehammer
Fireworks. [video playing in background] And

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:11.430
they tape explosive to an end of a sledgehammer
and then hit it on an I-Beam. [video continues

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:22.990
to play in background] It's very much a DIY,
get involved, do it yourself thing and what's

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.329
kind of interesting in this video is a fella
comes up

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:31.470
related to the person shooting the video and
starts asking questions and they say, "Hey,

00:01:31.470 --> 00:02:14.340
do you want to try
it?" So let's go from there. [fireworks in

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:57.430
background from video] Is it possible to turn
the lights off over

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:20.349
here? [video continues to play in background]
Watch how quickly this guy comes up behind

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:35.530
him. At any rate, so it's not something you
want to do I think but it's kind of interesting,

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.620
not only the activity as a group
of people doing something but they dress the

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.180
part and do that which kind of leads me into
my idea here that

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.879
I wanted to talk about. Do you know there's
84,000 people registered on the US Census

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:55.799
who list a primary
occupation as Elvis impersonator? You know,

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.420
there's something about - well, I'm calling
it the rise of

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:06.249
tribute bands. Amateurs acting like pros,
doing things that are like what someone else

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:10.390
does but doing it at
their own level, you know? And to some degree

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.310
to be able to take an idea, make it your own,
and perform it

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:23.919
in front of people. Here's a five year old
kid who dressed up like the drummer from KISS

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.020
and you know
creates a YouTube video [video playing in

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.960
background] and you know you probably wouldn't
watch him if he

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:37.120
wasn't dressed up like Eric Singer. [video
continues to play in background] What is it

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.020
that's going on here?
You know, to some degree there are musicians,

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.960
there are bands out there but as in this quote
here he said,

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.590
"You know, let's be Guns and Roses for Halloween."
They went out and said I get to play someone

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:58.660
and be that person that I really admire but
they somehow got a crowd and it mattered to

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.820
them that they got a group of people in front
of them. This is another tribute band, DSO,

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:10.259
Dark Star Orchestra. They actually recreate
Grateful Dead concerts. They take a particular

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:13.410
concert on a particular date and they play
every song that

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.480
was played by the Grateful Dead on that date.
They sell CDs and they sell everything. I

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:24.030
mean, they've become their own touring band
and this is my [inaudible] Led Zeppelin tribute

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.160
band and you know a reporter asked him, "Do
you think the rise in the number of tribute

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.120
bands means that's something missing from
today's music?" And he says, "Yes, you know.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:40.139
It's too corporate. Creativity is gone." I
mean, you're basically copying someone and

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:47.289
saying that creativity is gone but one of
the patterns that I'd like to talk about is

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:51.580
in many ways that when you make something,
it doesn't have to be your own idea. It doesn't

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:58.629
have to be original. Copying is a particular
human thing that we do well and it's a pretty

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:02.169
good starting point for many of us and it
often

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:07.199
leads to other things. I mean you could argue
that Guitar Hero makes everyone into a tribute

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:12.379
band and you
play in your living room. We came across this

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:19.150
group, Guitar Zeros, who take Guitar Heroes
and began playing real music with their play

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:25.979
guitars. They took the plastic guitar controllers
and realized it had sensors and you could

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:30.050
do different movements with it and then they
plugged it up to their own controller and

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.060
began to
create their own music, create their own band

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:40.419
and we put them on the cover of Make last
year sometime so

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:46.250
it's a pattern. These are enthusiasts. They
are doing something they love, their amateurs.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.759
That's kind of
the root word, root meaning of the word amateur

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:53.919
but I think what's often lost in this is that
their actually

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:58.169
really interested in creating a following.
They want to connect to other people. This

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:02.050
is something that they
on one hand do on their own but they want

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.259
to connect to other people doing similar things
and they want to

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:11.020
share that with other people, which sort of
leads me to this kind of idea about what can

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.789
we learn from
garage bands, what can we learn from that

00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:17.599
process meaning; and I'm thinking in terms
of education. I'm

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:24.349
thinking in terms of innovation so it's a
kind of pattern. A garage band, you don't

00:07:24.349 --> 00:07:28.889
necessarily need formal
training in music say to play in a garage

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:33.470
band. It might help but it's not required.
What's almost more

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:37.879
important is your own initiative, that you
start something yourself and you're committed

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:43.509
to working at it
and then pretty soon you begin to find other

00:07:43.509 --> 00:07:47.000
people who are at your own level of ability
or interest and you

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.349
try to meet with them and you try to get together
and do things. Something that I'm seeing kind

00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:58.030
of broadly
in this area, and not just garage bands, but

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:02.050
you think about it; today in many, many different
areas,

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:08.550
amateurs and professionals are using the same
tools. In this case, it's guitars. In the

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:12.030
case of publishing,
I'm probably using the same tools that my

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:16.991
audience is using. We are all kind of converging
on the same tool

00:08:16.991 --> 00:08:23.629
set but behind it you practice and you play
and that's kind of the pattern of making for

00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:27.240
most people. You
are practicing something to get better at

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:32.220
it but you're also playing, you're enjoying
it and as I said earlier, you realize that

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:39.250
at some point it's okay to copy. We probably
call it sharing in a more fashionable sense

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:45.291
but we inherently copy each other just as
when you watch that Sledgehammer Fireworks

00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:51.960
you start thinking about, "Well, really? How
could I do that?" But also you begin to create

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:56.690
a following and you're interested in that
and I think that's again what we're beginning

00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:01.490
to see in Makers. What's really different
today say from the models of a lone tinkerer

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:06.279
is that they, it's easier for them to connect
with other people. You are often dependent

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:13.519
on the people in your neighborhood, the people
in your school to find sort of fellow travelers.

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:18.779
Today, I think you can reach out and connect
to lots of different groups but in the garage

00:09:18.779 --> 00:09:23.150
band model, you're looking for venues. Where
can we go to play together? Where can we get

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:28.140
friends to come and see us? And how do you
develop a following over time, and even how

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:35.110
you track that. Well of course, garage bands
go back to even the idea or the paradigm if

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:39.950
you will of garage invention, which is obviously
well known in the Valley here but what you

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:46.130
might not know as well as this is Bagley Avenue.
It's the garage of Henry Ford where in 1896

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:52.000
he built his first vehicle which he called
the Quadricycle. It was really built from

00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:02.550
bicycle parts and that's what his garage looked
like then but interestingly enough for Ford,

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:08.829
he had a kind of similar idea. He wasn't the
inventor of automobiles, he was really someone

00:10:08.829 --> 00:10:16.370
who was trying to create an affordable, reliable
vehicle that he thought more people could

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:22.100
use. His real interest was to help get people
off of farms and into cities. He grew up on

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:27.610
a farm himself and he thought that was just
a terrible place to have to be all by yourself.

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:34.740
He was also afraid of horses and didn't like
farm work so he wanted to remove some of the

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:40.560
drudgery; but you know there was also this
social component of garages. They were places

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.680
to hang out or in the case here of the Homebrew
Computer Club, which is again it's almost

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:51.260
mythical, in terms of the formation of and
start of computing in the Valley but Steve

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:57.200
Wozniak says, "I just love going to the Homebrew
Computer Club and showing off my ideas and

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.959
designing neat computers. I was willing to
do that for free for the rest of my life."

00:11:01.959 --> 00:11:07.270
And there were things like the West Coast
Computer Fair where early Apple II computers

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:11.930
were shown to people and they had no idea
that other people would be interested in what

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:17.720
they were doing. Well today, maybe the equivalent
of the Homebrew Computer Club is something

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:27.370
called Hackerspaces. This is NYC Resistor
in Brooklyn and it's probably a couple of

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:33.480
years old. There are several in the Bay Area,
Noise Bridge in San Francisco is one hackerspace

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:39.320
and they are kind of a growing movement. These
are a group of individuals who get together

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:44.649
to rent a space, buy equipment, maintain it,
and they pay somewhere between $80 and $100

00:11:44.649 --> 00:11:55.209
a month to get together and have a space to
make things in, but like the garage bands

00:11:55.209 --> 00:12:01.750
this is sort of the garage bands of the Make
world. This is MakerBot and it's their product

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:12.680
and that's Bre Pettis on your left - well
no, your right. Sorry. And you know they made

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:19.839
this, started it as a business out of NYC
Resistor and you know it's essentially a long

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:24.930
and open source model where there was a project
called RepRap which was trying to do 3D printing

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:33.180
and they took that project and really packaged
it up a nice way. They took the open source

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:42.649
and they used an Arduino controller and they
kind of just created a polished kit that made

00:12:42.649 --> 00:12:48.940
it affordable for a new audience of people
to have 3D printers and you know this is kind

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:54.610
of what it looks like sort of being put together.
You know, you have to build the casing and

00:12:54.610 --> 00:13:00.240
connect all the electronics together but it's
taking something that, which I'll be talking

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:07.459
about today; it's taking something that costs,
let's say 15 to $20,000, and bringing it down

00:13:07.459 --> 00:13:14.279
to a $1,000 or less as a kit model. It kind
is reminiscent of those of you who might remember

00:13:14.279 --> 00:13:19.899
laser printers and things of how they started
out very expensive in the almost $30,000 range

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:26.199
and then began finding a broader audience
and came down dramatically in price. So one

00:13:26.199 --> 00:13:33.529
aspect is there's a community behind the MakerBot
and they're producing drawings and things

00:13:33.529 --> 00:13:42.079
that you can use on the MakerBot to create
objects and so you could go to this site called

00:13:42.079 --> 00:13:48.320
Thingiverse, download the graphic, and play
with it, modify it, or just send it right

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:55.160
out to the printer. This is a part and it's
assembled, someone is making a model of a

00:13:55.160 --> 00:14:00.380
cathedral, a gothic cathedral and they're
printing out all the individual parts and

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:07.990
then assembling it like that. So, a really
kind of interesting application so that it's

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:13.850
not only the tool but the tool also creates
a community of users who share designs and

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:21.750
expertise. We're not Rolling Stone but these
guys did get on the cover of Make with their

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:27.050
MakerBot in the current issue and we're really
talking a lot about 3D printing and CNC machines

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:34.000
in that. So, kind of relating to the tribute
bands, is sort of, I think, one of the opportunities

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.570
in making is this idea of doing knockoffs
and we sometimes say that fairly negatively

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:44.209
and say that China does this knockoff of American
products and things but maybe we need to do

00:14:44.209 --> 00:14:49.990
our own knockoffs and we certainly see that
in the DIY world. Again, taking something

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:54.740
that's an industrial 3D printer, looking at
the technology and how with various components

00:14:54.740 --> 00:15:02.340
can I make a thousand dollar version of that.
Some of these things are rather fanciful and

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:07.959
different. This is something coming to Maker
Faire called Hermes. Someone built a space

00:15:07.959 --> 00:15:13.829
shuttle for themselves. They intend it to
fly someday but right now it's kind of connected

00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:23.660
to their garage in Arizona, but again it's
 - if you remember, Make is sort of based

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:27.970
on some of the old magazines like Popular
Science and Popular Mechanics and you know

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:32.350
if you go back and look at those old covers,
often it was you know "Build your Own Space

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:37.930
vehicle". In the '50s, it was that sort of
level of fantasy. In fact, they say the most

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:43.619
popular cover is sort of the car that converts
to a plane and every now and then they'll

00:15:43.619 --> 00:15:48.860
 - it's never been solved in a useful but
everybody believes it's around the corner.

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:58.750
Here's an example of a group called Backyard
Brains. Their PhD graduates from Michigan

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:06.649
in Neuroscience and this a device they call
the SpikerBox and they are trying to measure

00:16:06.649 --> 00:16:16.170
the flow of neurons in an insects leg and
all it does is produce a sound of that flow

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:22.550
and they can strike it and do different things
but what was interesting there is these guys

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:27.880
said that it was the third year of grad school
before they got access to the device to hear

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:32.259
this, to plant the electrodes in the insects
leg and listen to it, and that device costs

00:16:32.259 --> 00:16:39.339
about $40,000. Well, their SpikerBox is about
a $100 kit and their idea is well suddenly

00:16:39.339 --> 00:16:45.230
that device could be out in a high school
biology classroom and you could this experiment

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:51.110
[video playing in background] You can kind
of hear a little bit of it there. It could

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:58.019
be broadened in its use to larger audience.
You know, they said think about what if

00:16:58.019 --> 00:17:02.699
telescopes were only available at observatories,
you know? What does it mean to have a telescope

00:17:02.699 --> 00:17:05.340
that's
affordable and in your backyard so I think

00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:12.370
there's areas of knockoffs like this in scientific
instrumentation and other perhaps industrial

00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:19.280
equipment that we might be seeing from Makers.
Either to make something more affordable,

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:24.650
to realize that there are now open components
such as micro controllers that could be used

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:29.490
in making that thing and that a community
can help put it together and finally that

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:34.440
the use could be extended to a broader audience.
This is kind of, in some ways, an idea that's

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:40.550
related to Eric Von Hippel's book in "Democratizing
Innovation" and his idea is that a lot of

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:47.920
product innovation comes from user communities,
not just from a R&amp;D process, which is what

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:52.900
our more conventional model is, and that users
are able to innovate themselves, that they

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:57.910
don't have to develop everything they need.
In fact, being able to

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:03.000
borrow and put together things that other
people have done is pretty much a Makers skill

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.370
but I think the
most important point is that users benefit

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:09.450
directly from their own innovations and he
gives a lot of

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:18.570
examples from extreme sports where someone
wants to modify a kayak to go down a certain

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:23.340
kind of rapids and the need a snub nose kayak
and the manufacturers don't make that, they

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:27.240
don't believe there's an audience for that
so someone begins to make that, other people

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:33.081
see him, and you know it's often the start
of a small business. We had a Young Maker

00:18:33.081 --> 00:18:38.760
program in San Francisco at the Exploratorium
and one of our young - he's a junior at Mountainview

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:48.110
and he's a professional skateboarder downhill
and he is modifying, he's never had to make

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:52.270
something like this before, but he's modifying
the trucks of his skateboard because he wants

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:59.470
a different kind of feel on such a fast ride
so it's a kind of a similar thing where he's

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:02.790
at the edge of
performance of what standard equipment would

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:07.791
offer and he wants to extend it. These are
all Model T's that

00:19:07.791 --> 00:19:12.750
have been modified in the field for different
purposes and you know it sort of tells you

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:17.380
that hacking has
been going on for a long time, that we modify

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:21.680
the things we use. We change them because
we see opportunities to use them in ways that

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:28.640
they're not intended and this is an example
from Monkey Bikes and these are LED wheels

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:34.500
which you know we can put on a bike and you
might use it for just a form of expression

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:42.590
but it also sort of serves as a safety device
as well, but again modifying something fairly

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:48.340
simple so in many ways what I see in the Make
Spaces and from the beginning is people are

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:53.580
playing with technology the way we play with
music or we play in other areas, and out of

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:59.820
that sparks new ideas and sparks sort of new
opportunities to meet other people. Communities

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:07.590
organize around projects and tools and skill
sets. I mentioned Arduino and it's becoming

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:13.140
this really important thing that a lot of
people are learning electronics to be able

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:19.590
to create specialized devices. I was meeting
with someone yesterday who's at Stanford working

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:25.360
on an artificial knee, the JaipurKnee, and
you know they are really fascinated by what

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:31.790
cheap micro controllers can allow them to
do in areas that they might not have had and

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:36.320
again part of the design going on with something
like JaipurKnee was to make it affordable

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:45.960
in a very different market. We also have artists
collaborating and creating new forms of expression.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:53.580
This is a pulse jet organ which not only makes
terrific sound but it shoots flame in the

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:59.160
air and I just like the idea of the keyboard
there connected to something that complicated.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.690
What's pretty cool too is it also folds up
into a little car and like something from

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:08.740
Star Wars rolls away after a performance.
We also form communities in workshops and

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:16.100
with hand tools and the other kind of things
that we have at hand but one of the things

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:19.880
that I'm particularly interested in, and this
is kind of the heart and soul of Make, is

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:26.910
that instructions or patterns, patterns for
other people to follow and

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:32.490
sharing those instructions is pretty powerful.
Instructions are the open source of making.

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:36.770
It is our code
base. It's here how I did this. It might be

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:42.080
someone's particular way of doing it, it might
be more like a general recipe for doing a

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:49.570
class of things but essentially when I came
up with the idea for Make, I saw that

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:53.410
technology magazines really didn't contain
those kind of instructions anymore. They talked

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:55.990
about
technology but they didn't really say how

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:59.600
they were put together or how you might do
this yourself so by

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:04.380
having those instructions, you allow someone
to respond by saying, "I'd like to build that.

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:09.220
I'd like to
learn how to do that." Our very first issue

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:15.260
 - I often use this because this was sort
of a really typical but

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:22.810
kind of emblematic project for Make. It was
kite aerial photography. There's a KAP community

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:27.320
out there and
there's all kinds of rigs you could build.

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:29.700
Chris Benton, who's a professor of architecture
at Berkeley,

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:35.450
designed one made of Popsicle sticks and using
a disposable camera, and it went off once

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:39.380
during a flight but
you know it was combining something that was

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:45.390
pretty fun anyway as a kid, to fly kites,
with photography and it really gives you a

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:51.450
perspective that you don't get from the ground.
This is off of Point Reyes and I don't

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:55.120
know, it's a little hard to see but if you
follow the black string up the kind of the

00:22:55.120 --> 00:23:02.310
middle of it, that's kind of where the kite
is and then Chris is standing on that brown

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:09.930
pad in the center there taking the picture
so it began as a work project for him. As

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:15.000
a professor of architecture, he wanted to
see buildings from different angles and he

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.520
wanted to understand kind of how they would
like. If you look at a building straight down

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:25.790
from an airplane, you know you're not seeing
those angles and if you look at it from the

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:30.150
ground, you're only looking up so that was
his original intent but he's become actually

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:39.110
a photographer with a gallery of photos that
he's taken with different rigs. Take it one

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:45.240
step further and you began taking model rocketry
that you did as a kid and figuring out that

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:49.330
you could take a disposable video camera [video
playing in background] and put it inside of

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:58.280
the rocket and film your own space flight,
or not quite space flight, but you know what

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:05.340
I mean. We also see, and this is one of those
issues of making a radar detector from a Hot

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:12.460
Wheels toy. It's just how we're taking - in
fact, we have a lot of consumer technology

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:18.490
out there that people are harvesting the components
from and remaking something else with them.

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:22.730
One of the most popular is actually the Wii
controllers which have a lot of very cheap

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:27.610
sensors in them and it would be almost as
expensive to buy them separately. So again,

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:33.251
enthusiasts are people that are doing something
they love doing. They're playing, they are

00:24:33.251 --> 00:24:37.990
figuring it out, and their creating a following.
In many ways, that's kind of what we do on

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:46.630
Twitter. We tell people about what we're doing
and share links about what other projects

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:51.850
are going on. We don't always do that. This
is a Tweet-a-Watt project we had where we

00:24:51.850 --> 00:25:00.530
plug an appliance into a device called a kilowatt
and then it was modified to have a wireless

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:06.070
capability to upload the data to a computer
which then publishes it to Twitter so that

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:11.020
you could actually have a Twitter conversation
with your appliance about how much power it's

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:16.710
using on a daily basis. So I think when we
look out there, we see people building their

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:22.810
own networks around what they do. Some are
creating things, some are consuming things,

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:28.420
but there all sharing things back and forth
and I think it's kind of interesting. At least

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:36.430
as a publisher, that's how I think of my audience
as doing this stuff to extend their network

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:42.880
and to some degree my job is to help them
extend that network. To connect them to others

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:48.460
and connect them to other communities and
that's really what I see we are trying to

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:53.970
do at Make, is sort of creating this network
of Makers. A kind of movement where people

00:25:53.970 --> 00:26:01.200
have used the term Maker to mean something
almost general that allows them to connect

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:05.700
to different groups, even though one might
be in Robotics and the other might be in soft

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:15.470
circuit embroidery and another might be in
fire machines. So I'm particularly interested,

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:20.660
and I was going to do a little more in this
talk, but it's just who's following whom in

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:26.560
these sort of special interest communities?
This is not necessarily Make related but this

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:33.330
is Twitter users most followed by people that
had posted during the Web 2 Summit, one of

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:36.970
our guys in research did this but I think
we're getting to a place where we're starting

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:42.200
to get tools through Google's open social
and others where the activity that people

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:52.870
are doing in these communities can be sort
of understood and connected to more easily.

00:26:52.870 --> 00:27:00.010
I'm in the process of organizing Maker Faire
this year not just in the Bay area but in

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:04.180
Detroit as well as New York City, and going
to a place like Detroit is very different

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:10.250
then the Bay area. It's one of the most depressed
regions in the country, schools are terrible,

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:16.200
there's blight, there's all kinds of really
challenging issues there but there are lots

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:22.040
of creative and technical people there who
I think we're trying to help network them

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:28.150
together, to get them to know each other,
and to allow them really the freedom to work

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:36.180
together to create something new for Detroit.
It's pretty exciting but I think in many ways

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:42.910
it's like how do I - what kind of tools can
we use to make that process more transparent

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:49.690
to more people? Makers know where things - where
to get supplies, at least in their area. They

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:54.980
know where someone is an expert in something
or who makes something somewhere and I have

00:27:54.980 --> 00:28:00.210
this idea that over time we'd like to be engaged
in mapping some of these communities in terms

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:06.490
of where the capabilities are, where the assets
are, where the Makers in that, and even from

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:11.340
a publishing point of view. Publishing talks
about, or media talks about, demographics

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:15.230
and psychographics. I think we're going to
come up with something close to a term like

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:21.680
social graphics, which allows us to understand
that each person that we talk to isn't an

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:26.250
individual, they're actually a network. They
take something, like a message from Twitter,

00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:31.860
and it might be oh "Sledgehammer Fireworks.
That's a cool video. I'm going to send that

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:39.400
out to my group." And I'm, in a sense, feeding
my own network with content from various sources

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:51.160
so the idea from activity groups and other
things really connect people in terms of what

00:28:51.160 --> 00:29:07.210
they're doing and in terms of who they are.
[inaudible] They bring together a lot of very

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:12.460
different styles of making. A lot of different
kinds of people and I think that makes a difference.

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:18.410
It's not just geeks, it's not just electronics.
There are all kinds of different kinds of

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:23.850
making. Some on the artistic side, some on
the deep technology side. I'm going to talk

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:27.550
about a few of the projects that interest
me this year that I've seen coming in for

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:36.040
Maker Faire. One is a Gigapan and this was
a project from Carnegie Mellon and NASA. They

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:43.030
collaborated on how to take high resolution
photographs like panoramas by using a device

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:49.300
that basically takes multiple high res photos
and then they stitch them together through

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:58.350
software so it's been focused on panoramas,
creating like this top image of the Bay and

00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:07.080
the bottom image where you can zoom in but
what's kind of interesting and new that I'm

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:13.310
seeing is now they're starting to use for
macro photography. To take things and in effect

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:22.310
enlarge them the way that they've been doing
panoramas so I met with - there's a gigamacro.com;

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:27.460
Gene Cooper; and this a rig but what's kind
of cool in how this ties together is he's

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:35.280
mounted basically his camera on a CNC machine
so it can make very, very small steps to traverse

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:43.080
say that butterfly and take a complete picture
of it and to give you a sense of it, and this

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:50.400
doesn't do a great sense of it, but that's
a picture of an eagle feather that was taken

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:55.620
with this rig. It's composed of 7,500 different
pictures that have been stitched together,

00:30:55.620 --> 00:31:00.180
and again, you know, you don't quite get the
idea of the resolution from my picture of

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:05.770
a picture but he was in the office last Friday
and it was fascinating to see what they're

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:12.890
doing there so again, this is, they are working
on it as a kit, as something that - and the

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:18.430
kind of transformation that happens is they
were talking to a natural history museum that

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:22.630
if someone wants to find a specimen in a natural
history museum, you have to make a reservation.

00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:29.040
You have to fly there and look at it. What
if they create something like this that creates

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:36.940
a very, very high resolution image of that
object? Here's another fellow - there's a

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:44.701
HAM radio club. HAM is as old as, and it sort
of gives birth to electronics in many ways,

00:31:44.701 --> 00:31:53.630
but they are connecting sensors and equipment
to measure heart rate and temperature and

00:31:53.630 --> 00:32:04.630
communicate over frequencies but you know
also GPS so they just last weekend, or on

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:14.770
the 20th, did a jump from 20,000 feet to produce
that map of - here's how this jumper came

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:22.570
down to Earth so it's really pretty interesting.
Apart from just mapping say a

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:29.130
jump, they are also using it potentially to
monitor and communicate between a group of

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:36.880
jumpers which is
sometimes a problem in their space. I put

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.930
this in there just because - back to my copying
thing, people do

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:47.580
simple things that are fun. Make a photo booth
and you know the equipment is not particularly

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:50.510
expensive but
the idea is something that's sort of popular

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:55.270
and so Ray Munson building a photo booth for
Maker Faire and he wants to create photos

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:59.090
like that which you can go in with your girlfriend
or boyfriend and have a picture

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:06.470
taken. We also will have bigger things like
Soma which is the Flaming Lotus Girls installation

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:10.760
set up at
Maker Faire and you know, we're not just about

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:14.650
new technology. We also cover some of the
older stuff [video

00:33:14.650 --> 00:34:03.200
playing in the background] This is an ad created
by one of our exhibitors [video continues

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:25.520
playing in
background] So the last thing I'll say, this

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:32.020
is a sensor activated squirrel cam so the
idea is that it's

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:38.720
written in a processing language on the Arduino
and outside a window is a sensor and the squirrel

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:41.580
trips the
sensor, takes the picture, it's uploaded to

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:45.160
the website, and it sends it's user an email
that the squirrel

00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:53.310
is out there. The interesting thing is the
person that created this application said

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:58.260
they modified the
CatCam project in our book by Tom Igoe of

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:02.820
making things talk, modified it instead of
monitoring a cat, it's

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:08.910
monitoring a squirrel but I was looking on
the website and this is an 8th graders project

00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:13.410
which is pretty
impressive work. So our theme for this year

00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:19.350
at Maker Faire is Young Makers and we've been
working with Pixar and the Exploratorium to

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:25.102
engage more young kids in making and we had
a program last Saturday at the Exploratorium

00:35:25.102 --> 00:35:31.530
on making music. It featured several different
kinds of people who make musical instruments

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:37.990
and everything from a kelp horn which is a
piece of seaweed taken from the ocean and

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:45.450
dried and Krys Bobrowski is a French horn
player but she plays the kelp horn and it's

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:53.830
beautiful sound. Through Walter
Kitundu, who started off as a DJ, and he began

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:57.780
obviously making sounds with a turntable then
began adding

00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:06.330
other things and ways of making sound next
to the turntable and began making instruments

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:10.570
and he demonstrated a kind of harp that was
also connected to his computer and he was

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:14.310
looping out some beautiful sounds, and then
Gee Wang from Stanford who is the developer

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:19.980
of the Ocarina application, which is, you
know, you blow into the IPhone and you play

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:26.790
it like a flute, so there's such an interesting
mix of technologies here but part of it is

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:33.040
we want to open it up to - we are seeing it
open up to kids more and more, to get kids

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:39.340
making things. It's a great way for them to
take something in the magazine and copy it

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:44.890
and try to make it
themselves. Our next issue, which comes out

00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:52.040
in a couple of weeks, is called "Remote Control
Everything" and it actually started because

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:57.690
I found some guy's; we didn't replicate this
in the magazine but they modified a car so

00:36:57.690 --> 00:37:02.700
they could drive it with an IPhone. I mean,
sit on the roof of the car and you know, go

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:06.570
left, right,
forward, backward. It's on a test track as

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:14.810
we say but it's pretty interesting. This one,
you can't see it very well, but it's a lawnmower

00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:19.280
so you can sit in your chair, have your drink,
and let the robotic lawnmower

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:26.730
mow your lawn and that's the kind of things
that's coming up. You also see up there "Build

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:29.520
this Twittering
Cat Toy" so we are still back to cats and

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:35.270
we're still back to pets. Ways to every time
your cat hits the toy, it sends a message

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:42.810
to you and let you know that the cat is active
somehow. That's pretty much what I wanted

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:47.550
to kind of show you is just sort of some different
kinds of projects, different kinds of patterns

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:56.820
of making that I'm seeing and we'd love to
have you. Maker Faire is also - our applications

00:37:56.820 --> 00:38:00.760
are still open. If you have a garage project
or something that you're working on, something

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:06.190
you'd like to share with other people; anything
from a performance piece, an installation

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:12.270
piece, an exhibit, a tabletop full of electronics
and explain to people, we'd love to have you

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:14.410
there. If you go to makerfaire.com, there's
the call for

00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:22.350
Makers link, and fill it out and let us know
what you'd like to do there. So, thank you

00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:24.620
very much and I'd be
happy to answer any questions you have. [applause]
