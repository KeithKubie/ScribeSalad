00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.630
MATTHEW SPELLBERG: I knew
actually that I wanted to

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.300
teach in a prison before I
came to graduate school.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.740
And I picked Princeton in part
because I knew that there was

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.460
a prison teaching
program here.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.920
BETH STROUD: The students
are incredible.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.430
They are the most motivated
students I've ever met.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.790
ROSS LERNER: There are some
people who are drawn to it for

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.280
reasons that have mostly
to do with activism.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.310
And then there are people who
are drawn to it mostly because

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.430
they identify as educators.


00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.770
MARCUS JOHNSON: And we got the
question, they're like, well,

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.160
we know you're paid.


00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.620
We're like, actually
we're not.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.620
And so we got a battery of
questions like, well, do they

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.850
pay for your gas?


00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.110
Do they pay for your food?


00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.460
We're like no.


00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.850
We actually want to do this.


00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.100
GILLIAN KNAPP: It's
pure teaching.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.080
It's chalk.


00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.120
It's waving your hands.


00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.730
It's talking to people.


00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.470
It's doing your calculations,
your essays, your corrections

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.940
in pencil and paper.


00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:14.600 position:97%
 


00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.640
REGINALD MURPH: I became
involved in the teaching

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.620
initiative because there
was a flyer in the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.450
hallway of the prison.


00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.090
I was walking.


00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.790
And I remember seeing it.


00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:23.430
And I'm like, naw.


00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.120
How good could college
classes be in prison?

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.690
And I was with my cell mate.


00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.390
And he was telling, he's like,
maybe you should just try it.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.110
Just do it.


00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.160
You get out of the cell
a little more.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.760
I'm like, all right.


00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.070
I'll try it.


00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.260
And I'll do it.


00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.880
And I did a public speaking
class, which I loved.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.100
And it was a really
good class.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.090
And then I started taking
more and more.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.850
SANDRA SUSSMAN: Our students
are just incredible, really

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.200
motivated, passionate about
learning and about turning

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.400
their lives around through
education.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.300
MARCUS JOHNSON: I would say that
I am a role model, and

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.990
particularly as a black male in
a prison population that is

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.780
over represented in
African Americans.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.840
ROSS LERNER: Genuinely you are
pushed to be a better teacher,

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.960
because you'll really be called
out if you're not being

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.960
a good teacher in
this context.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.540
BETH STROUD: I've heard so many
of them say that they

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.920
wish they had applied themselves
more in middle

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.270
school, and high school, when
they have the opportunity, and

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.010
how happy they are despite where
they are to have that

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.010
opportunity to have a second
chance at that opportunity to

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.780
take learning seriously.


00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.720
REGINALD MURPH: If I had to
speak to an inmate that was

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.970
kind of hesitant about going
to school, I guess I would

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.050
advise him just take a class,
see where he's at.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.720
But if he wants it, and he does
see a future for himself,

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.930
then he definitely pursue it.


00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.150
Because you can't
lose nothing.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.170
It doesn't hurt to try.


00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.230
And also, I mean, it's real.


00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.550
It's a real thing.


00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.800
I was happy when I took
the Princeton classes.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.440
What makes a great great is
not the goals that the

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.540
accomplish but the obstacles
they overcome to accomplish

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.400
those goals.
