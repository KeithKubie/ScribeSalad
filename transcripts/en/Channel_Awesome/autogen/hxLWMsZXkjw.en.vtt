again not all the comedy works but
 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.770 align:start position:0%
again not all the comedy works but
that's<00:05:42.680><c> nitpicking</c><00:05:43.400><c> you</c><00:05:44.120><c> know</c><00:05:44.240><c> just</c><00:05:44.570><c> are</c><00:05:44.690><c> the</c>

that's nitpicking you know just are the
 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.190 align:start position:0%
that's nitpicking you know just are the

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
trade-off you do with kid shows so uh
 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.740 align:start position:0%
trade-off you do with kid shows so uh
episode<00:05:48.200><c> 2</c><00:05:48.350><c> has</c><00:05:48.500><c> gotten</c><00:05:48.770><c> really</c><00:05:48.980><c> fun</c><00:05:49.340><c> and</c><00:05:49.750><c> it's</c>

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
nice to see the Buffalo finally fly and
again<00:05:52.970><c> like</c><00:05:53.510><c> the</c><00:05:53.690><c> angles</c><00:05:54.110><c> that</c><00:05:54.170><c> they</c><00:05:54.440><c> get</c>

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 align:start position:0%
again like the angles that they get
 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.230 align:start position:0%
again like the angles that they get
again<00:05:54.920><c> I</c><00:05:54.950><c> serve</c><00:05:55.190><c> connect</c><00:05:55.730><c> this</c><00:05:55.880><c> to</c><00:05:56.090><c> the</c>

again I serve connect this to the
 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.360 align:start position:0%
again I serve connect this to the

there's<00:05:58.760><c> a</c><00:05:58.850><c> scene</c><00:05:59.120><c> where</c><00:05:59.360><c> like</c><00:05:59.660><c> Aang</c><00:05:59.930><c> is</c>

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 align:start position:0%
there's a scene where like Aang is
 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.830 align:start position:0%

swings<00:06:04.970><c> like</c><00:06:05.300><c> this</c><00:06:05.540><c> trying</c><00:06:05.840><c> to</c><00:06:05.930><c> get</c><00:06:06.080><c> his</c>

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:06.230 align:start position:0%
swings like this trying to get his
 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.170 align:start position:0%

balance<00:06:06.410><c> back</c><00:06:06.770><c> and</c><00:06:07.010><c> you</c><00:06:07.430><c> really</c><00:06:07.670><c> sort</c><00:06:07.910><c> of</c><00:06:08.000><c> feel</c>

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 align:start position:0%
balance back and you really sort of feel
 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.540 align:start position:0%
balance back and you really sort of feel
you<00:06:08.360><c> can</c><00:06:08.540><c> go</c><00:06:08.650><c> like</c><00:06:09.650><c> that</c><00:06:09.830><c> come</c><00:06:10.040><c> on</c><00:06:10.160><c> lean</c><00:06:10.370><c> back</c>

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 align:start position:0%
you can go like that come on lean back
 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.330 align:start position:0%
you can go like that come on lean back
lean<00:06:10.760><c> back</c><00:06:10.820><c> uh</c><00:06:11.510><c> something</c><00:06:12.260><c> about</c><00:06:12.350><c> the</c><00:06:12.740><c> angles</c>

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 align:start position:0%
lean back uh something about the angles
 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.390 align:start position:0%
lean back uh something about the angles
that<00:06:13.580><c> they</c><00:06:13.790><c> get</c><00:06:14.170><c> in</c><00:06:15.170><c> the</c><00:06:15.320><c> style</c><00:06:15.590><c> animation</c>
