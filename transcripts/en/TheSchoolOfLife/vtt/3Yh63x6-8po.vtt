We call this bit of our channel the curriculum.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.800
It's where we invite you to come and see what the greatest minds in the world have thought

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.180
and why their ideas matter right now.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:15.200
It's like the ideal university education compressed into a range a beautiful, useful, little films.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.100
Our curriculum is divided into 8 parts:

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:24.900
philosophy, political theory, eastern philosophy, sociology, psychotherapy, literature, art/architecture, history.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.820
In each category we look at the most important things.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.280
The big question we've been asking all of them is: what are the urgent things you want to say to us today?

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.080
What part of life could you help us with?

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.180
What's the main advice you'd like to give the modern world?

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.100
Each individual film in the curriculum is conceived as part of a sequence,

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.660
which will take you around the really vital ideas in a given field.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.820
Take your time to travel around them.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.540
It will all add up to an introduction to the most useful and interesting concepts in the world.
