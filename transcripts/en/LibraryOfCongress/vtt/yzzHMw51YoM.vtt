Just show me with a show of hands.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.810
Do you have any favorite
stories you like to tell?

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.820
Anybody? Come on.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.580
We all have our favorite
stories you know,

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.390
we talk about that one time we fell
down the stairs and the one time,

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.480
you know, we had milk shoot out
of our nose and things like that.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.780
Okay, yeah me too.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.480
Everybody has their favorite
stories, and so do these two people

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.010
who are coming to the stage.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.840
They also have many of their
favorite stories to tell.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.790
They've worked together to write
"Flying Lessons &amp; Other Stories."

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.190
The people I mentioned are Ellen
Oh and Megan Medina who are two

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.490
of ten collaborators, that's
a big word, collaborators here

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.100
for their story collection;

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.100
ten people all working
together that's what the means,

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.560
"collaborating" working
together to write one pieces.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.130
That's so, that's so much fun.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.500
In this collection, is not only
funny, but it's also sweet.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.920
So it makes your heart feel
like oh, you know, it's sweet.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.010
This impressive group of authors
and these two who are here today,

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.320
they have earned among these
two and the other eight authors,

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.580
they've earned every major
award in children's publishing.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.020
That is a lot of awards.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.510
Let's give them a hand for that.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.040
[ Applause ]

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.630
That's more awards than I can even
attempt to name in this intro.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.430
And they've gained popularity
as New York Times bestsellers.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.080
These distinguished authors
deliver a book full of ten unique

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.540
and vibrant stories
and I can't wait to see

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.210
which one's they've chosen
to share with us today.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.510

&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Thank you.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.250
Hi everyone.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.270
I'm kind of jealous
of your bing bags.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.510
I want one up here.

[ Background Conversations ]

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.860
&gt;&gt; Should I just start
singing into; oh, it's one now.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.140
Hi. I almost started
to sing a song for you

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.190
and then you would have run away.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.900
Thank you all for coming.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.300
We are here to talk
about this book called

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.670
"Flying Lessons &amp; Other Stories"
and I'm the editor of this book.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.730
It's an anthology and it's put
out by We Need Diverse Books

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:31.300 position:56%
and Random House Crown Books for
Kids, and Meg Medina who is also one

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.970
of the, you know, founding
members of We Need Diverse Books.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.540
It has her wonderful
story in here too.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.140
So, does anybody know about
We Need Diverse Books?

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.610
Yeah. Wonderful.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.430
So, we did this anthology
because we wanted to make sure

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.170
that there was a book
of stories that kind

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.180
of like represented
everyone's life experiences,

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.440
everyone's personal stories,
and to kind of let people know

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.260
that we are all the same as humans,
but with a diverse range of stories

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.720
and backgrounds and cultures,

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.220
and sharing those stories is
really the best way to kind

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.510
of like have an impact in the world
and get to know each other better.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.470
So, I wanted to kind of talk about
who we're missing today though.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.770
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yes.

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:24.680
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: We are missing
Tim Tingle and Kwame Alexander.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:31.210
Kwame had a very sad
personal tragedy in the family

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.100
and so we miss; we will miss him
here today of course and Tim is

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.290
in Texas and we all know how
bad the situation is over there

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.770
and that's why he couldn't
come over.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.010
So, Meg had this great idea, if you
don't mind, I can't take selfies,

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.050
but maybe she can take a selfie
of us with you guys is that okay

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.500
and we can say to Kwame and Tim?

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.210
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Her
arms are too short.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.460
We're going to turn around and
we're going to take a picture

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.570
of you, so try to look good.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:58.870
Okay?

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.170
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Okay?

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.470
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: And we're
going to tweet this;

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.730
we're going to send this Kwame and
Tim and tell them we're thinking

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:12.050
of them and we miss them.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.350
Okay?

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.460
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: So, everybody say hi.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.880
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: So, look good.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.510
Alright? Alright.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.820
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Don't
make fun of our backs.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.120
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Are we ready?

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.850
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Oh, there's
a lot of them.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.150
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yeah.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.450
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Alright.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:30.750
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: One, two, three.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.050
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Okay, immortalized.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.860
I'll send it after we
finish talking today.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.160
Thank you.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.360
Okay, so one of the things about We
Need Diverse Books is that the idea

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.520
of having diverse stories
is really important

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.780
because stories are a
universal experience,

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.630 position:56%
and I love this anthology because I
think what every author here did was

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.370
write a story that was
very personal to them;

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.470 position:56%
something that they might not have
shared or something that really kind

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:04.670
of is reflective of a story that
they never saw for themselves

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:10.810
when they were younger and
I think that, you know,

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:19.360
the best way to start maybe
is to kind of talk about some

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:25.650
of the stories exactly in here.

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:31.200
And, let's see, what
are we going to do?

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.320
We, we're going to talk about
how do they, fiction and fact.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.620
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yes.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.960
Alright, so no matter what
you write as a writer even

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.080
if you're writing fiction,

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.970
you're not really too far
away from your truth ever.

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:54.370
So, things you remember from being
a kid, the person who scared you,

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:59.790
the person who loved you,
your favorite teacher,

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:04.060
your most horrifying
teacher, your best friend,

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.670
the friend that made your
life miserable last year,

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:08.970
etcetera-etcetera.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.600
They all stay in there and I think

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:17.070 position:56%
in these ten stories we all did
pretty much that, a version of that.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:21.700
So, who was here this
morning when RJ Palacio came

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:25.680
to speak this morning,
raise your hand?

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.160
Yeah, I was here too.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.970
I got up very early for that.

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:38.150
So, here's a funny thing that
Raquel and I, or RJ Palacio

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.470
and I were best friends
growing up in elementary school.

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:47.110
Which is a great friend;
she lived on a 160th Street

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:50.850
and lived on 158th Street.

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:58.050
Raquel's family is from Columbia
and my family is from Cuba

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:03.600
and so we were the only two
Latina girls in our class.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:08.830
Now, we had lots of
different kids in our class.

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:16.230
We were very lucky that we
were in a school that had lots

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:20.140
of different backgrounds,
but we happened

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:27.180
to be the only two
Latina girls in the class.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:33.070
So, I remember one time her
building was two blocks from mine

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:34.650
and they all looked the same.

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:37.030
Do any of you live like that?

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:41.420
We lived on a series of blocks
that were four buildings

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.060
that were exactly the same;
one, two, three, four.

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.680 position:56%
I can tell them apart because of
the stoop and the names on the bells

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.180
and things like that,
but they were different.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.280
You know, they were
basically the same building.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:09:01.000
And one day, the police cars
came outside of Raquel's building

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:09.930
and then the ambulances came, and
then all the neighbors came out

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:14.670
and stood around like "what's
happening, what's happening?"

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:19.410
And the very sad thing
that happened is

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:23.880
that an older gentleman
had passed away.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.930
He had died in his
apartment on the first floor.

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:28.320
Raquel lived on the first floor.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:35.620
And so we were so afraid that
we had been in this building

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.210
with this dead body and
this man and we were,

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:41.530
it was just amazing watching
this whole thing transpire.

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:44.770
So, when Ellen came
to me and she said,

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.820
"Will you be in this anthology?"

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:51.380 position:56%
And she's going to tell you all
about Soman and how that came to be.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.680
I said, "Yes!

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:53.980
Of course."

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.280
And she said, "It's middle grade.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.580 position:56%
So you want to really write a story
that has to do with kids, nine, ten,

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:57.880
eleven, twelve in that age group."

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.180
And I thought, the dead
body in Raque's building.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.480
So, when it came time to writing

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.780
"Sol Painting" that's
what I pulled from.

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:03.080
Should I do that paragraph?

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.380
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yeah.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.680
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: And this is what it
sounds like when you take something

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.980
from real life and then you mix it
all up and you make it into fiction

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.280
and this is just the
first paragraph.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.580
"I reach inside the window of
Papi's van and I yank on the handle

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:10.880
to open the passenger door.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.180
It's my turn to ride in front.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.480
Roli sat there last time.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.780
You think they'll need
a painter in there soon,

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.080
Papi asked as I slide
in next to him.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.380
I follow his gaze to the second
floor of building twenty-two.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:18.680
Men dressed like astronauts
are tossing furniture

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:19.980
into the tall canisters
that are marked "biohazard."

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.280
Dona Roza, one of the old
ladies who lived over there died

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.580
in her living room last week.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:23.880
Her TV was on so no one
knew anything was wrong

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.180
for two whole days.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:26.480
That means we were all
sleeping near a corpse.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.780
A shiver runs through
me every time I think

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.080
about Dona Roza's ghost
hovering in the halls,

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.380
insulted that no one
noticed she was dead."

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.680
So, I think that's how
we do these things.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.980
[ Applause ]

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.280
We figure out the piece of
childhood, the things that happened

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.580
to us when we're kids
that we never forget

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:36.880
and sometimes they're
really big things

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.830
and sometimes they're a really
small thing and then we steal them

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:42.320
and we stretch them and we change
them and we make them into fiction.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.710
Is that how you do it?

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:46.010
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yeah.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:49.340
Kind of. I don't know
how I really do it.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:50.640
I have no secrets.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.150
I'm just a mess inside.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:56.850
But I'll tell you this, I had to
write the forward for the anthology

00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:00.100
and does; how many
of you are writers?

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.400
Anybody writers?

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.100
Okay. Alright, if you are a
writer you know my pain, right?

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.300
Isn't it hard drafting
that first version

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.090
of whatever you have to write?

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:10.390
Yeah, yeah?

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:13.050
Okay, if you said no,
I don't like you.

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:17.410
But, so I had to write the
forward for this anthology

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:20.890
and at first I was like "We Need
Diverse Books because it's good

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:23.670
for the kids" and my
editor was like, "No,

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:24.990
no nobody's going to read that."

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:29.360
I'm like, "Well, okay you
know let me do some research."

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.630
Statistics say that
blah, blah, blah, blah."

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:34.160 position:56%
"No, no. That's not working for us."

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.460
And is say, "Okay."

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.760
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Don't
you love editors?

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.090
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: I love and
hate my editor, right?

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:41.240
And I said to her, "What
do you want from me?"

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:45.830
And she said, "Just tell us a
personal story that meant something

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:50.560
to you, that would kind of you
know resound in your readers,

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.740
like that they could
kind of relate to."

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.940
I said, "Okay, I'll tell
them the cat story."

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.810
And this is a true story.

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:00.680
When I was nine of
ten-years-old, I forget.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.400
It's kind of a blur.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:07.520
I was walking down the streets; I
grew up in Brooklyn and I also was

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:12.060
in one of those big like buildings
that everybody can't tell apart.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:16.540
But my building had a big "No pets
allowed" sign in the lobby, right?

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:18.070
And I always wanted a pet.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:21.100
I mean, I have, I had a baby
sister, but kind of you know,

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:22.710
babies they coo, they're

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:24.830
in the diapers all the
time, they're no fun.

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:29.190
I wanted a pet, and I happened
to be walking home one day

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:31.890
from the library, of
course, because I lived

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:34.770 position:56%
in a library and there was a kitten.

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:38.640 position:56%
A cute little black and white kitten
right next to the dumpster and I was

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.460
like "Oh my god this is so cute.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:45.140
I'm going to name him George and
I'm going to take him home with me

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.730
and nobody will know that
I have him in my room.

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:51.830
My parents will never know
and I'll take care of him."

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:57.610
And I hid George under my shirt
and I walked the five blocks home.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:03.660
Well, by the time I got home
I looked like Frankenstein.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:09.810
Like I was like, he had managed
to scratch every part of my body.

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:11.990
My eyes were swollen shut.

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:14.590
I looked like boiled
eggs, you know, just like.

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:18.730
I had like leech marks all over
my body and I could barely see,

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:21.810
but I stumble into my house and
my parents are like, "Oh my!

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.110
What the heck happened!"

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:26.490
And I'm like, "This
is my cat George.

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:28.790
I love him."

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:34.540
And they said, "He's
trying to kill you.

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:36.480
You're allergic to cats."

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.870
I was like, "No."

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:41.720 position:56%
And my parents took the cat away
and I'm like, "No George come back."

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.850
And he went arsk!

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:46.600
He scratched me one good time.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:50.120 position:56%
And the reason why I ended up
telling that story in the forward is

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.310
because literally every
family reunion

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:55.970
after that my parents
would be like oh the story.

00:13:55.970 --> 00:14:00.600 position:56%
"Remember that time Ellen, you know,
found a cat that tried to kill her?"

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.380
So, a now I have dogs.

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:05.820
I'm not allergic to dogs.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.120
I have two dogs.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.700
Cats hate me.

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:13.960 position:56%
But I love that story because it
kind of tells exactly how, you know,

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:17.770
childhood is; children
when you're going

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:20.910
through life you will have
good moments and bad moments.

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:24.890
You will make horrendous mistakes
like picking up a stray cat

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:28.540
from a dumpster and then you'll
have wonderful glorious moments too

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.790
and I think kind of
like those stories.

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:32.090
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yeah.

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:33.390
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Everyone has
them and I, we wanted a chance

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:36.290
to share those stories
in this anthology which.

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:38.270
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: I want to
tell them about the title.

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:39.570
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yes.

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:41.120
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: To me,
like do I have anyone

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:44.780
out here is a Soman Chainani fan?

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:46.080
Ah.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.380
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Ah.

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:48.680
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yes.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.290
And so, Soman's story is called
"Flying Lessons" and it ended

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.550
up being the title of
the whole anthology.

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:53.850
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: "Flying Lessons.

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:55.150
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Which I
love and his story is

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:56.930
like almost directly from life.

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:58.230
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yes.

00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:59.530
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Because
of his grandmother.

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:00.830
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yes.

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:02.130
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Right?

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:03.430
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: May I read?

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:04.730
Okay, I'm going to skip
ahead and do this one thing.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:06.030 position:56%
When you write short stories, right,

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:07.570
it's very different
from writing novels.

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:11.930
It's really, really hard which is
why I didn't write a short story

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:13.510
and Meg did.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:15.980
So, I had the easy job.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:20.010
Well, one of the things about short
stories is how quickly can you hook

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:21.560
the reader, right?

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:25.670
Now if you notice when Meg read her
story, I think as soon as she got

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:29.640 position:56%
to the dead body part you were like
wow, I kind of need to keep reading.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.940
Am I right?

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:32.240
Am I right?

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.540
Dead bodies kind of do that.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:34.850
Alright, so let me read
you Soman's first line

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:40.380
of his story which is right here.

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:45.150
Flying Lessons; Soman Chainani.

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:49.190
"Nani wears a fur coat
to the beach."

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:51.670
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yeah.

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:52.970
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Okay, right there.

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:56.610
Now when he told me this story
before WNDB every came to be,

00:15:56.610 --> 00:16:01.250
before this anthology ever came to
be, he told me Nani wore stilettos

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:05.300
and a fur coat to the beach and
I'm like dying with laughter.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:09.180
And what's funny is that as kind
of like the kids of immigrants,

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:12.510
we were like telling these stories
to each other and we're laughing

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:15.530
and we're connecting and
I remember saying to him,

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:18.820
"These stories would
make a great anthology."

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:23.460
So fast forward a couple of months
later, WNDB happens and I say

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.330
to Soman who we happen
to be having breakfast

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:30.570
with our mutual editor Phoebe Yeh
and I said, "Hey, Soman remember

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:34.960 position:56%
that story about Nani going, you're
grandmother going to the beach in a,

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:39.520
you know, full fur coat and
stilettos and leaving you there

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.260
on a nude beach when you
were eleven-years-old?"

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.080
And he's like "Yeah."

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.040
I said, "Can you write that
story for the WNDB anthology?"

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.100
And he's like, "Of course."

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.860
And that's how it came to be.

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:52.590
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: I think
we all said of course.

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:53.890
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yeah.

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:56.170
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Like every
author that Ellen I think called

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:59.160
and you said "Would
you be willing to",

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.820
like before you even finished
this sentence we said yes.

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:03.120
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yeah.

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.560
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: And I think that is
because I think all ten of us feel

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:10.520
so strongly that we want
everybody to see themselves

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.450
in the pages of those books.

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:15.860
So, to the extent that we could
write a story from our own

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:19.470
like race, Lin from her spot
and Jackie Woodson from hers,

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:22.040
and Kwame Alexander from
his, and Tim Federle,

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:25.380
I mean all of us our
own tiny little piece

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.430
of experience and put it out there.

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:30.380
I think what happens sometimes
with storybooks like this is

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:35.460
that kids get to, they don't maybe
connect with every single story,

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:39.190
but there is at least one that
has a character that they go,

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:42.610
"That's exactly what
it feels like to be me,

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:45.300
or that's exactly like
someone I know."

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.780
And that for me has
been like the fun part.

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:49.080
And I do love story.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.490
I love writing short story.

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:52.750
Does anybody here write
shorty story at school?

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:54.050
Yes, I love them.

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:58.380
I love them because you know how
I think of them is I think of them

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:02.660
like paintings and
here's the difference.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.990
When I'm writing short story,

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:08.640
it's like being an
impressionist painter, it's dabs.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:12.650
It's little points of color and
you have to sort of stand back

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:17.750
from the work and then you see the
picture of the boats and the women

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:19.900
in the background and so
on, but when you're up close

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.620
to it you don't really see it.

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:23.940
You're just sort of suggesting.

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:28.790
Well, when you write a novel, you
have to write every last character,

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:30.590
you have to fill-in
every single line,

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:34.210
and that's a really realistic
painting, those paintings that you,

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:36.350
it looks like you can take
the apple right out of

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:38.420
that painting and eat it.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:43.490 position:56%
So, for me I think the beauty of the
short story is that, that it's just

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:49.200
like a little nugget that gives the
reader an idea of the whole world

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.890
that that kid is in and I
also like that it's short,

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:56.390
because sometimes reading
makes you tired, right?

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:59.290
I love to read but
sometimes I get tired reading,

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:02.700
and so when I have a book of
short storied I can read one,

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.610
I can read two, and then I'm good.

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:07.520
What do you love?

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.190
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: I don't
get tired reading.

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:10.490
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Never?

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:11.790
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: No.

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:13.640
I don't get; if I don't like
the book that's different,

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.940
but I don't get tired of reading.

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:16.240
I have another problem.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.470
I'm like once I start I can't stop.

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:19.770
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Oh.

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:21.070
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Anybody one of those?

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:23.100
Once I start, I cannot stop
which means four O'clock

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.800
in the morning I'm
still like reading.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.100
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yeah.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.070
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Which is, you know,
which is not great, but yeah no.

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:30.700
I don't get tired of reading,
but I think what I love

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.880
about short stories
is that it is kind

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:38.050
of like a perfect microcosm
right there for you to jump in,

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:41.750
get to know a world
and then jump back out.

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:45.410
You know, and which like let's face
it, with a novel you kind of have

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:49.700
to have you know four, five, six
hours having; who are slow readers?

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.570
Anybody take like days to read?

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:52.870
Yeah. I feel you.

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:54.170
No, not really.

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:55.470
I read very fast.

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:58.520
I read like in a couple of
hours, but I feel the pain

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.380
of taking a longtime to read.

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:04.150
So, I think what short stories
do is allow you to get in and out

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:07.990
of that world really quickly
which is really great,

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:10.010
and what I like about
the short stories here is

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:11.850
that you have all ranges.

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:15.190
You can, you have the stories
that make you cry, right?

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:19.250
I cried when I read
Jacqueline Woodson's story;

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:21.520
Jackie Woodson fans here?

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:26.700
Yes. "Brown Girl Dreaming" should
be required reading for everyone.

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:32.330
She wrote the most beautiful
story in this book and I cried.

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:34.850
I cried even reading
Matt de la Pema's story.

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:37.150
Who; basketball fans,
any basketball fans?

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:41.110
Yes. Alright, you know, when we
talk about like how truth goes

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:48.460
into your fiction, Matt played
basketball, blah-blah, all his life

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:52.000
and he wrote a basketball story
which is just amazing, a realistic

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.840
and brilliance, and
like Kwame wrote a book

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:58.040
in verse of story in verse, so.

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.680
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yeah, we're
never far from our truth I think

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.480
and there's a new anthology coming.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.070
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Oh yeah.

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:05.370
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: So.

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:06.670
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Young adults.

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:07.970
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: For teens, right?

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:09.270
So that comes out next year.

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:10.570
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yeah.

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:11.870
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: I think.

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:13.170
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yeah.

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:14.470
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Who's in it?

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:15.770
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Lamar
Giles is the editor

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:17.070 position:56%
and that will be called "Fresh Inc."

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:20.360
It's going to have Jason Reynolds,
Nicole Yoon, Daniel Jose Older,

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:25.890
Malinda Lo, Sharon Flake, Gene
Luen Yang, Eric Gansworth,

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:30.020
Sara Farizan, and Melissa
de la Cruz.

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:34.410
So there's a superstar list of
authors in that anthology too.

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:35.710
Yes.

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:37.010
&gt;&gt; What's it called again?

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:38.470
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: It's called
"Fresh Inc."

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:39.770
It will come out next year.

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:41.070
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: It's called what?

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:42.370
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: "Fresh Inc."

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:43.670
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: "Fresh Inc."

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:44.970
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: "Fresh Inc."

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:46.270
Yeah.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:47.570
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: For YA anthology.

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:48.870
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Uh-hum.

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:50.170
For YA anthology.

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:51.470
What, but you know what?

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:52.770
Wonderful news.

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:54.070
Also, from "Flying Lessons" is

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:55.370
that Meg's story is also
going to be a novel.

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:56.670
Meg.

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:57.970
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yeah.

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:01.070
So, when I finished
writing "Sol Paining, Inc."

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:06.990
Phoebe said to me, "I have a
funny feeling that these people,

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:09.750
that there's more to this
story than just this story."

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:14.390
I said, "Oh, yeah that's
interesting", and I just went away.

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:20.580 position:56%
And then I published with Candlewick
usually and so I was contracted

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:23.780
for a couple of other
books, and so I started

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:27.620
to write this middle grade novel
that my thinking is that it's

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:30.620
about a young girl whose
grandfather is changing

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:36.650
at the same time she is changing
and it ended up being Mercy,

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:38.740
and Chloe [phonetic]
and all the same people;

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:41.370
the Suarez family come to be.

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:43.880
So it was really like
the opposite experience

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:48.880
and so I had this tiny little
morsel and I had to pullout.

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.820
But as it happens,
I've done that before.

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:56.560
I have a novel called, "Yaqui
Delgaldo" and that book also began

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.530 position:56%
as a short story and became a novel.

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:01.280
So, sometimes it's just framework.

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:05.600
It's just sort of what I'm
changing here and there.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.900
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yeah.

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:08.470
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: So, and you have
a novel out this year also.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:09.920
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Oh, yeah.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.220
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: It's scary.

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.800
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Does anybody
like ghost stories?

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.100
Yeah, okay great.

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:18.480
You like really, really
scary ghost stories?

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.970
No? Who said no?

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:22.390
Who said no?

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:24.860
Okay, I'll pretend I
didn't hear that no.

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:26.160
I love scary stories.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:29.820
I mean, like I was a kid that read
Stephen King like in the middle

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:34.010
of the night where I curled up
in my bed and then I had to pee

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:38.470
and the hallway was really dark and
I'm like, "I can't go out there.

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:41.460
There's a clown that's
going to kill me."

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:46.410
I saw many sunrises before I was
able to go the bathroom safely.

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:50.210
But, I wrote a; so I had
to write a ghost story

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:52.280
and the ghost story
I wrote is called

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.210
"Spirit Hunters" and
it's out right now.

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:58.210
And it's about a girl
who can see ghosts

00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:00.940
but doesn't realize she can see
ghosts until about halfway through;

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:04.000
that's a little bit of a spoiler.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.910
But while I was writing this
book, this is a true story.

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:13.830
Ignore the man in the
black on the stage.

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:17.490
While I was writing
"Spirit Hunters" I

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:19.710
like to write in the
middle of night.

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:22.890
So, it's two O'clock in the
morning and I have a dog and all

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:27.220
of a sudden my dog comes running
into my room and starts barking

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:31.740
at absolutely nothing, and I'm
like "Why are you doing that?"

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:33.040
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Doo, doo, doo, doo.

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.340
Doo, doo, doo, doo.

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:35.640
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: "Who are
you barking at?"

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:36.970
And then all of the
goosebumps up and down my arms.

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:42.740 position:56%
The hair stands on my like up on my
head and I'm like there is something

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:47.520
in this room with me and my
dog and I cannot see them,

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:55.780
and I got to get the, you know,
whoops, I got to get out of there!

00:24:55.780 --> 00:25:01.450
So, while I wrote my ghost story,
I was visited by real ghosts

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:05.320
and I think they were telling me
that I was doing a really good job,

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.150 position:56%
because I've already had people tell
me this book is too scary for them

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:10.200
to read and they're adults.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.700
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:13.610
So, I know that kids can
take it better, right kids?

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:14.910
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:17.130
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Alright, yeah
we're braver than adults.

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:19.920
Did you notice I said "we?"

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.220
I admit it.

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:22.520
I am a kid at heart.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.820
So, kids are braver than adults.

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.680
So, yeah this is a
very scary ghost story.

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:30.030
The adults might have to take it
with a little bit of a warning,

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:31.980
but yeah so that's
another true story.

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:37.310
I was visited by a ghost or
maybe it was my imagination.

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:39.510
You can take with it what you want.

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:41.970
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: I'm
fascinated by you.

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:47.240
I can't stop watching
her beautiful hands.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.500
How about you guys?

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.100
Are you finding that
you're watching her a lot?

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.720
I think it's amazing.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.200
What do you want to know?

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.500
Questions?

00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:58.800
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yeah, does anybody?

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.100
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Oh, but wait.

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.760
They told me that if you have
questions they'd like you

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.620
to go the microphones
on either side.

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:07.900
So, what would you like
to know about writing,

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:13.920
about any of the stories in
the book, about us as writers?

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.820
Raise your hand.

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:17.470
Thoughts, questions.

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:21.210
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yeah, go up
to the mic right there.

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:24.650
Uh-huh. I'm going to
steel your bing bag.

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.420
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: I do
love these bing bags.

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:29.480
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: I know right.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:32.750
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: We're going
to start on this side.

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:37.660
&gt;&gt; Do you know about how
many books you've written?

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.760
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: I know
how many I've wrote.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.060
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yes.

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.360
Alright, so you tell
them while I count mine.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:45.600
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Oh, yeah I have to
count; I have written four books.

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:49.560
I've been three anthologies,
and I have another book coming

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:54.090
out next year which is;
which will have a new name,

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:57.030
but currently is called Soul
Eaters and it's a sequel

00:26:57.030 --> 00:27:02.560
to "Spirit Hunters" and it's even
scarier than "Spirit Hunters."

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.930
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: And I've
wrote six, and I have an,

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:08.810
I'll be in another anthology this
March called the "Radical Element"

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:13.340
for teens and my next book
based on "Sol Painting Inc."

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.580
comes out next fall.

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:16.880
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you.

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:20.060
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Thank you.

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:27.760
&gt;&gt; How long did it take to get like
every author's like little story?

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.060
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Oh, that's
a good question.

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:32.640 position:56%
How long did it take me to get
everyone's story into the anthology?

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.790
Well, we gave them
deadlines but not all

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:38.770
of them listened to the deadlines.

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:40.070
So, it ranges.

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:42.440
We had some people give their
stories right away like within

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:45.440
like three to five
months and we had a few

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.930
that took like oh maybe a year.

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:53.010
It just kind of like depends
also on their schedules,

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:56.610
like a lot of authors they have
so many commitments already

00:27:56.610 --> 00:28:01.480
that writing for us I
knew it was a big ask, so.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.170
Thank you.

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:04.850
Next, uh-huh.

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:07.920
&gt;&gt; I was wondering what your
favorite horror movie was.

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.320
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Oh-oh.

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:16.130
Okay, favorite horror movie was
Stephen King's "The Shining."

00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:19.210
The movie that scared me
the most was "The Ring"

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:23.360
and that it was because, okay I
could not sleep for months after

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:26.470
"The Ring" and my kid was
like, you know, five-years-old

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:29.300
and had long black hair like this.

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:34.070
And in the middle of the night
she came over saying "Mommy."

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:38.750
And I have not watched a horror
movie since, but I'll read them.

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:41.230
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: I like "Get Out."

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:42.530
That's my current.

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:43.830
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yeah.

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:45.130
I forgot about that.

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:46.430
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yeah,
That's my current favorite

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:47.730
and I don't like scary movies.

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:49.030
I hate to be scared.

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:52.470
I'm a big fat chicken.

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:53.770
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yes.

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:55.330
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite movie?

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:57.610
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Oh.

00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:00.960
Well, I like so many movies,

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:04.270
but like every time I see a good
one I say, that one's my favorite,

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:09.460
but one that I sort of have liked
throughout many years is called

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:10.830
"Big Fish."

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:12.130
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Oh, that's a good one.

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:13.430
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yeah.

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:16.830
"Big Fish" and it's strange
and it's got magical realism

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:19.100
and it's got all kinds
of weird things.

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:20.570
You can get it, like
you can rent it,

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:22.800
you can download it [inaudible],
it's called "Big Fish."

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.100
How about you?

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.050
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: My favorite all time
movie is the "Princess Bride."

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:27.350
&gt;&gt; Mine's "Star Wars."

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:28.650
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Oh, "Star Wars."

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:29.950
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: "Star Wars."

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:32.690
Yeah. Which one?

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:33.990
&gt;&gt; The Clone Wars.

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:36.720
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Oh, I get it.

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.020
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Thank you.

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:39.950
Alright, this side.

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:41.250
Yes, hi.

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:43.830 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Can you read us your scary story?

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:49.410
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: I can't right
now because I don't have it,

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:54.270
but if you want to look for it it's
in the libraries and the bookstores

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:56.590
and it's called "Spirt Hunters"

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:58.860
and hopefully maybe
sometime soon I will be able

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:01.360
to do a reading for
it, but thank you.

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.560
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:04.860
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Hi.

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:07.880
&gt;&gt; Did everyone write one story or?

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:10.190
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Did
everyone write one story?

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:11.490
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yeah, uh-huh.

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:12.790
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yeah.

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:14.090
I think that's what.

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:15.390 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: And then actually one
thing we didn't mention was we had a

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:18.860
short story contest where it was
open for everybody like from kids

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:22.820
to adults all throughout to write
a story that could be included

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:26.600
in the anthology and we had
a short story winner, so.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:27.900
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: It was Tracey.

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:30.810
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yeah, Tracey Baptiste,
"The Rice and Beans Chronicles."

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:32.110
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yeah.

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:33.410
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yeah, yeah.

00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:34.710
I want you guys to remember
that so the next time

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:37.540
if you see a short story
contest you should enter.

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:40.870
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Enter, enter,
enter is absolutely true.

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:43.340
&gt;&gt; Where is this information?

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:46.310
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Oh, on our
website; weneeddivresebooks.org.

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:47.610
&gt;&gt; What's it?

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:50.610 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Weneeddiversebooks.org.

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:51.910
Hi.

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:56.770
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite
book that you wrote?

00:30:56.770 --> 00:31:00.720
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Oh, you know
that's like asking your;

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:04.140
have you ever asked your
mother who her favorite kid is?

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:05.440
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.740
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: It never goes well.

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:09.550
I like different books for
different reasons, right?

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:13.860
So, I have a book called
"Tia Isa Wants a Car"

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.740
and I have a real Tia Isa
who still lives with me

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:19.770
and she really bought the first
family car, so I kind of like

00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:23.020
that one, but I also like this
booked called, "Yaqui Delgado"

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:26.150
which is about bullying
which I really liked also.

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:27.450
Which, how about you?

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:28.750
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Oh, well
right now I'm going

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:30.240
to say my favorite book
is still "Prophecy",

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:33.620
because it was my first book
and also because I wrote demons

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:37.480
that eat your inside organs
out and then wear your skin

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:41.650
like a Halloween costume
and I think that's so fun,

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:43.020
so that's still my favorite.

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.390
Is that, is that terrible?

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:45.690
Oh fifteen minutes.

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:46.990
Okay. Thank you.

00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:48.290
Hi.

00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:49.920
&gt;&gt; Hi. So, what's your
favorite writing style?

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:53.110
Do you like write things down
and then forget about them

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:56.310
or do you write things down
when you have a complete idea

00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:57.610
of what you're going to write?

00:31:57.610 --> 00:31:59.420
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Ah, that's
a good question.

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:04.940
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yeah, so
I think that I do not;

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:07.420
I wish I were a writer
that kept a journal.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:09.790
I wish I could say to
you, "I have a journal.

00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:12.210
I keep track of everything
and then I go back

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:13.800
to it and pull things out."

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:17.790
That's not really how I work,
but I have a really great memory

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:21.810
which makes me a very dangerous
person to be related to.

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:28.460
And so, I will think on
something, I will remember myself

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:32.870
at a particular age and then
I sit down with a journal

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:38.590 position:56%
and I just remember that in as much
detail as I can and I tell the truth

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:42.260
about it which is the tricky part.

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:45.740
I tell the truth about
it as much as I can.

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:49.060
You know, when we're adults
sometimes what we try to do

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:53.870
or what happens to us, is that we
remember what it is to be a kid

00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:56.570
with a very happy face on it.

00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:59.910
We forget like the harder
parts of being a kid.

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:02.410
So, when I'm writing;
when I'm remembering,

00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:05.760
I really try to remember the
funny parts, the good parts,

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:10.330
but I also really try to remember
the very sad and difficult things

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:13.740
when you're dumped, when your
friend says they don't like you,

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:15.570
when you're not invited
to something,

00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:18.730
when you don't make the
team, when you fail the test,

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:20.920
when you're disappointed
in your parents,

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:24.360
when you find out your parents
have lied, when you lie,

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:28.400
like all of those things
that we like to forget about.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:35.610
And I write about those and then
I take them and I stretch them.

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:39.900
I create like I'll take two
or three people from real life

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:44.690
and I smoosh them together
to make one new character,

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:49.070
but what always has to be there
is the truth of what it felt

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:52.070
like to be a kid in that situation.

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:53.370
Everything else I make up.

00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:55.730
How do you do it?

00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:57.030
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: I'm an outliner.

00:33:57.030 --> 00:33:59.650
I outline everything
and I think it's

00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:02.460
because of my being a
lawyer for 20 years.

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:06.330
I have to outline and I have
conclusion and the answer is this

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:09.950
and that's where I write to and
my conclusion never changes.

00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:13.180
Everything else might change
in the front or the middle,

00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:15.120
but I write to my conclusion.

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:18.400
I think that's from being a lawyer
and being like oh the answer has

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:20.930
to be, you know, yes or no.

00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:22.790
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: What
kind of law did you do?

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:24.090
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Boring law.

00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:26.650
Very boring law.

00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:27.950
Thank you.

00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:29.250
Hi.

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:33.220
&gt;&gt; How long does it take
you to write a book?

00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:35.540
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: It's a that
depends kind of question.

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:39.470
It took me, for "Prophecy" I
wrote a first draft in five months

00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:41.870
and revised it for three years.

00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:44.360
Yeah, how about you?

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.570
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: I, it
really is different.

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:48.920
Sometimes a picture book
will take me three months,

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:50.980
sometimes it will take me a year.

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:53.940
A novel usually takes
me about three years

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:59.430
from the time I first have the idea
to the time I see it in a book,

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:03.650
and the short story, I want to
say it took like six months for me

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:07.690
to have, you know, work it out
a couple of times, you know,

00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:09.150
and you know how this is.

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:11.730
You write the first
copy and it's terrible.

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:13.030
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yes.

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:14.330
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Right?

00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:15.630
And then you have to go
back and reimagine it

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:19.230
and fix what's terrible
and keep working at it.

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:22.410
Like that thing that your
teachers do to you when they say,

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:23.710
"You need to revise this.

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:25.010
I don't understand this.

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:26.310
This isn't clear."

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:29.050
Like that never goes
away if you're a writer.

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:31.780
That is exactly what your
editor will do to you

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:34.700
as well until you get it right.

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:36.390
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:37.950
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Hi.

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:42.070 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hi. I just have a weird question.

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:46.970
Do you write in the time
that the story took place

00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:51.920
in say your life or
you write nowish?

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.220
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yeah.

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:54.520
Good question.

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:55.820
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Well you
wrote "Burn Baby Burn."

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.120
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Both.

00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.420
There's two.

00:35:58.420 --> 00:35:59.720
You get to choose.

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:01.740
So you can write; when
you're writing now,

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:05.340
it's called contemporary, right?

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:06.960
So, we do write contemporary works.

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:09.860
Like these are all contemporary,
or most of the stories are.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:11.160
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Most of.

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.460
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Grace's is a.

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:14.290
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Grace's is a; it's a
fantasy, pirate, girl pirate story.

00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:15.590
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Right.

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:19.580
But, I wrote another book for high
schoolers called "Burn Baby Burn"

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:25.010 position:56%
which is set in 1977 in New York
City, and that's historical fiction.

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:26.310
That's history.

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:28.240
And so you have to do all
the research for that.

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.570
But I'll tell you a secret,
it really doesn't matter

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:33.560
if you're writing historical
fiction or contemporary.

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:37.990
It always has to feel even
if it's historical fiction,

00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:40.830
like it's really happening.

00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:46.660
Even if it's in 1940, you have
to feel like you're in 1940.

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:51.070
&gt;&gt; Also, weird question; if
you're "Harry Potter" fans

00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:53.190
which Hogwarts house are you in?

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:54.660
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: I'm a Ravenclaw!

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:56.140
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Are you?

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:57.450
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

00:36:57.450 --> 00:37:00.040
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: I have
not done the test.

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:04.030
I would say, you know, I would
say Gryffindor except they're just

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:07.240
so good that I'm like, "Do
I want to be that good?"

00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:08.540
I don't know.

00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:10.190
I know, I don't think I'd
want to be a Slytherin,

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:12.610
so would you let me be
a Ravenclaw with you or?

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:13.910
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: No I'm a Ravenclaw.

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:15.210
She didn't take the test.

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:16.510
She doesn't get to be distorted.

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:17.810
Sorry. Take the test.

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:19.110
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Fine, fine.

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:21.930
I see how it is Ellen Oh.

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:23.230
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Thank you.

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:24.530
HufflePuff.

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:27.300
Hi.

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:31.280
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite
story in the book?

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:32.580
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Oh.

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:36.060
You know that question about
like who's your favorite kid?

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:37.590
I have three, right?

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:39.950
That's the same question
to ask me as an editor.

00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:43.500
I love all of these stories for
all different reasons, but Meg.

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:46.010
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: I have no such
consumptions so I'm going

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:51.720
to tell you Jackie Woodson's story
is the last one in the anthology.

00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:54.180
It's truly beautiful.

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:55.480
I love that book.

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.780
I loved it.

00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:58.080
I loved it, loved it, loved it.

00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:01.150
They're all good, but that
for me, it was my favorite.

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:04.680 position:56%
But favorite is like saying what's
the best flavor of ice cream, right?

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:05.980
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Chocolate.

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:07.280
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: For
somebody it's chocolate.

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:09.630
For somebody else it's
vanilla, strawberry, chocolate,

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:12.180
mint chocolate chip,
there's really no best.

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:13.480
It's really.

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:14.780
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Chocolate.

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.080
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: What sings

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.380
to your heart the most no
matter what Ellen Oh says.

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:18.800
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Ravenclaw.

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:22.490
Hi. Thank you.

00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:28.090
&gt;&gt; Hi. So, I one time flipped the
pages to part of a book one time

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:31.230
and it was scary that I
dropped the book and screamed

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:33.950
and it happened in
the school library.

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:35.830
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Oh wait,
wait it was scary

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:37.670
because well was there a
cockroach in it or something?

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:40.980
&gt;&gt; No. So, it was night
and there was

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:44.310
like an owl or something and stars.

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:48.410
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Oh, it
was a say it again.

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:54.030
&gt;&gt; It was at night and there was
like an owl or something and stars.

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:55.330
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Oh.

00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:56.630
Was it really scary?

00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:57.930
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:38:57.930 --> 00:38:59.230
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Night
is always scary.

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:00.530
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Do you think it was
scarier because it was nighttime

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:01.830
or it would have been
scary any time of day?

00:39:01.830 --> 00:39:05.080
&gt;&gt; I think it was would have
been scary any time of day.

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:06.380
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Oh, cool.

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:08.770
I want to know what book that is.

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:10.740
&gt;&gt; I don't know the title.

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:13.700
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Oh, but thank you.

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:16.310
&gt;&gt; You're welcome.

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:18.250
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite book?

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:20.180
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Favorite book.

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.950
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Of all time,
it was "Charlotte's Web."

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:27.220
I loved "Charlotte's Web"
because it was the first book

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:32.270
that really made me cry which
was an interesting reason

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:33.570
to love a book right?

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:35.580 position:56%
Oh, good it made me cry, I like you.

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:37.140
That's usually a smart thing,

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:42.170
but until that time I
was reading like words.

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:47.180
I was reading to be a reader,
but with "Charlotte's Web"

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:52.720 position:56%
that as I remember it, it was the
first book where I was like thinking

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:55.870
about friendship and
thinking about other things.

00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:57.170
So, for me it was that.

00:39:57.170 --> 00:39:58.470
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Well, when I was.

00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:59.770
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: How about you?

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:01.120
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yeah, when I was
young my favorite book was actually

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:04.550
"The Count of Monte Cristo" and I
think I became a lawyer because of

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:05.880
that book, because I
was like "revenge!"

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:11.000
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Do we see
a theme with Ellen Oh?

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.300
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Thank you.

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:13.600
Hi.

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:18.770
&gt;&gt; Hello. What would you
recommend to short story writers?

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:20.860
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Oh, what
would we recommend?

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:22.160
No you go.

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:23.460
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: What do
I; what's the question?

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:25.270
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: What would you
recommend for short story writers?

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:26.980
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Oh.

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:31.080
Okay, so here is really what
I would say, that the only way

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:34.230
to become a better writer
is just by doing it.

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:35.940
It's a lot like exercise.

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:39.040
Like when you first start to do
something you're muscles hurt,

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:42.530
you're taking Motrin, you're
just everything hurts you

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:45.490
and then you get stronger at
it and you get more coordinated

00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:46.870
and you know what you're doing.

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:51.500 position:56%
The same thing happens with writing,
so a lot of it is just doing it

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:54.170
and doing it and doing it
and getting better at it.

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:55.710
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: And also
reading every story.

00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:57.010
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yeah.

00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:58.310
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: With anthology.

00:40:58.310 --> 00:40:59.610
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: And read,
well right and others.

00:40:59.610 --> 00:41:04.250
I think like for me, I read;
there's not a day in my life

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:07.400
that I haven't read
some part of a book.

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:10.660
Every single day reading
is part of my life and I do

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:17.580
that for my own personal enjoyment,
but it also fills my toolbox

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:20.280
with ideas with the
way, different ways

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:23.980
that people have solved problems
in a book, different ways

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.340
that they've drawn characters.

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:30.760
So, the more you read the more
you know how to do it, but mostly,

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:36.350 position:56%
I would say dive in, remember a good
beginning those first two paragraphs

00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:39.370
have to grab you and
then just be brave.

00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:41.490
Write your way through to the end.

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:43.790
It might be terrible and
then you have a chance

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:46.000
to fix it all up again.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.300
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:48.600
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Thank you.

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:49.900
Next.

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:52.560
&gt;&gt; What is your favorite
horror novel?

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.010
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Favorite horror novel.

00:41:54.010 --> 00:42:00.310
Oh, I like "It" a lot, but
it's also why I hate clowns.

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:02.300
Is anybody scared of clowns?

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.180
Yeah, clowns are scary!

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:05.990
They're not funny.

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:07.290
What about you?

00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:08.590
What's your favorite?

00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:09.890
&gt;&gt; I don't have one.

00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:11.190
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Okay,
come back next year

00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:13.050
and tell me what your
favorite is them.

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:14.570
Thank you.

00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:15.910
Yes.

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:17.960
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite animal?

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:21.120
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Favorite animal, I
think we're dog lovers up here.

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.600
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Ellen likes cats.

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.900
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Cats hate me.

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:26.200
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Cats named George.

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:29.960
I, my favorite animal; I have two.

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:32.470
In the wild it's the elephant.

00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:38.230
I love the elephant because the
head elephant is the oldest female

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:43.900
and she has in her mind a
memory of the entire grassland

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:49.500
and she leads the entire pack to
safety and where they need to be.

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:53.780
I love that about elephants, and
also when something bad happens

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:57.050
to one of the elephants,
they collect themselves

00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:59.000
and they help each other grieve.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.680
I just love that.

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:04.350
They're also just big and weird
looking, you know, I love that.

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:06.350
But in practical terms,
I love my dog.

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:12.710
His name is Hugo Menendez, and
Hugo Menendez is a black Labrador

00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:18.880
and a Dalmatian so he's got spotted
paws and beautiful oily black skin

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:23.340
or fur and he is a big
chicken and I love him.

00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:24.640
You have cute dogs.

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:26.150
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: I have two dogs yeah.

00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:30.230
They drive me crazy like
my kids, but I love them.

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:31.530
Thank you.

00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:32.830
Hi.

00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:34.930
&gt;&gt; Who's your favorite librarian?

00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:38.720
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: My favorite librarian
right now, Dr. Carla Hayden.

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:40.020
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yes.

00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:41.320
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Is my
favorite librarian.

00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:42.620
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Carla Hayden.

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:43.920
Woo!

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:45.220
[ Applause ]

00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:46.520
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Thank you.

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:47.820
Hi.

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:50.470
&gt;&gt; Do you write more
than one book at a time?

00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:54.620
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: I can't even like
eat and walk at the same time.

00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:55.920
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: I've seen this.

00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:57.220
That's true actually.

00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:58.520
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yeah, yeah.

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:01.290
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: I try.

00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:03.830
Some writers can.

00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:08.730
Some writers love to do that
because when they get sick of one

00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:12.860
or they get stuck, they put it
away and they go to another one

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:16.020
and they work on that for
a while and they can do it.

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:20.620
I can't do it either, because when
I'm writing a book those people

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:23.140
in the book feel completely
real to me.

00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:24.840
I talk to them.

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:28.800
When I'm in the shower I do
dialogue like I'm with them.

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:31.490
I wander around the
grocery store talking scenes

00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:36.460 position:56%
until people think I crazy, and so
I have trouble pulling myself out of

00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:41.340
that and going to another book,
but some people can do it.

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:43.860
We have time for probably
two or three more questions.

00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:45.160
Yes.

00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:46.460
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yeah.

00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:47.760
Thank you.

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:49.060
&gt;&gt; What's the longest
book you've ever read?

00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:50.360
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: The longest.

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:51.660
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Read?

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:52.960
Oh.

00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:54.300
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: "Harry Potter"
which one was the middle one?

00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:56.390
No, I think maybe "War
and Peace", right?

00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:57.690
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Oh my gosh.

00:44:57.690 --> 00:44:58.990
I, it had to be Leo Tolstoy.

00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:00.290
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yeah.

00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:01.590 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: It was, I don't know.

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:02.890
"Anna Karenina" is so,
the big fat ones at.

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:04.190
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Well, yeah Tolstoy.

00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:06.630
See? Long, long, long stories.

00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:08.600 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Also, what's your favorite fruit?

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:10.140
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Favorite fruit?

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:15.170
Cherries, but I'm allergic
to them and I still eat them.

00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:17.580
I get all, and I'm
like eating them still.

00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:18.880
Terrible.

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:21.130
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Long live the peach.

00:45:21.130 --> 00:45:23.050
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Thank you.

00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:34.190 position:56%
&gt;&gt; If you had to choose one word how
would describe how much fun you had

00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:36.030
writing the books?

00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:37.350
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Ahh.

00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:38.920
One word? She's hard.

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:40.220
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yeah.

00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:44.670
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: That's a
mean question, one word.

00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:46.160
Awesome. That's lame.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.460
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yeah.

00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:52.280
You know, I feel like brotherhood.

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:53.580
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Brotherhood.

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:54.880
Ah, that's a good one.

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.180
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Because
I felt like all

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:58.830
of us together we're
pulling together

00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:02.870
to create this beautiful thing.

00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:04.170
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: I agree.

00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:05.470
Thank you.

00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:07.870
That's a great question.

00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:09.170
Hi.

00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:10.470
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Hi.

00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:14.750
&gt;&gt; Hi. My question is what's your
favorite "Harry Potter" character?

00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:16.050
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Hermione.

00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:17.350
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Hermione.

00:46:17.350 --> 00:46:18.650
Come on. Hermione.

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:20.240
You know.

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.780
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Thank you.

00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:25.510
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: He's the only
one who knew everything.

00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:26.810
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: One last
question maybe.

00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:28.130
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yes, this is it.

00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:29.530
Or no, two more right?

00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:32.150
There's one child, yeah.

00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:36.490
&gt;&gt; What was the book that
inspired you to write these?

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:38.140
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Oh.

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:43.040
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: "The House on
Mango Street" by Sandra Cisneros.

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:50.520
It was the first book that I saw
Latino girl and her family in it

00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:56.110
and I read it and it thought, oh
my gosh my [foreign words spoken]

00:46:56.110 --> 00:47:02.110
and my neighborhood, like it
could be a book, and it was,

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:04.230
it changed everything for me.

00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:05.530
How about you?

00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:07.280
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Well, for me wanted
to write because of "Harry Potter."

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:08.610
Oh, I know.

00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:13.040
Like a lot of children's authors
say that, but it really was to me

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:17.010
so mind-blowing to read
"Harry Potter", yeah.

00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:18.310
Thank you.

00:47:18.310 --> 00:47:19.670
We'll have one last question.

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:21.940
&gt;&gt; What's the first
book you ever read?

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:25.460
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: You know,
we're kind of old.

00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:30.690
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Speak
for yourself sister.

00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:37.350 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: First book we read, uh.

00:47:37.350 --> 00:47:40.130
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: I think
I read way back,

00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:44.000
I mean really the very first things
were the Dick and Jane readers.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.300
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Oh, yeah!

00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:46.600
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Right?

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:47.900
See Sally.

00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:49.200
Sue; See Sue.

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:50.500
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: See Spot run.

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:51.800
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yes.

00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:53.100
That kind of thing.

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:54.400
That's how they taught
us reading back then.

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:55.700
Ay, yi, yi, yi, yi.

00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:57.000
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Three boring stories.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.300
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yes.

00:47:58.300 --> 00:47:59.600
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Yeah.

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:00.900
That was it.

00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:02.200
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: That was
literally the first thing.

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:03.500
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Thank you.

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:04.800
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Okay.

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:06.100
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: I think
we're done right?

00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:07.400
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: You've
been so wonderful.

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:08.700
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: You've been wonderful.

00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:10.000
Thank you!
