&gt;&gt;Presenter: Welcome everyone.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.850
We're very pleased to welcome Bruce Philp
to our Authors at Google talks this afternoon.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.092
He speaks to us today about branding; a concept
that is very central to our lives here at

00:00:13.092 --> 00:00:16.160
Google and to the internet as a whole.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.140
As Google maintains one of the most respectable
and recognizable and even flexible brands

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.689
in the world, it will be interesting to hear
his perspectives which he outlines in his

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:26.689
current book.

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.829
Now, Bruce has taught at OCAD University up
with our neighbors to the North in Canada

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.930
and has focused on constructive ideas in his
private practice as well.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.850
He was the co founder of the GWP, a brand
engineering firm, and is currently a strategic

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.360
consultant to companies looking to manage
their brand strategy.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.640
He speaks to us today about his most recent
book, "Consumer Republic: Using Brands to

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.620
Get What You Want, Make Corporations Behave
and Maybe Even Save The World."

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.100
This book was in fact released in the United
States just yesterday so we are very pleased

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.239
to have the book right out of the starting
gate.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.280
His thesis is simple, brands make corporations
accountable and culture is something that

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.260
is permanently engrained in the notion of
a brand identity.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.770
Let's listen to how Bruce and his knowledge
can help us save the world.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:24.710
So, without further ado, please help me welcome
Bruce to Google.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.159
Thank you.

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.159
[Applause]

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:33.119
&gt;&gt;Bruce Philp: Thank you very much for that
kind introduction and I should start by saying

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.460
I'm really, actually quite glad to be here.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.030
I'm actually really glad to be here.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.420
If I'm honest I checked in on four square.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.759
And I don't think I'm alone in this.

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.229
I think you probably get this a lot.

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.229
When I was preparing for this event today
I watched a number of previous authors' videos

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.659
on YouTube to see kind of how they handled
it and I noticed that if there was one thing

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.639
that they all had in common it was that they
began by saying how happy they were to be

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:01.779
here.

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:05.130
I think that's got a little something to do
with the power of your brand and that's kind

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.981
of what I'm here to talk about today, is the
power of brands.

00:02:07.981 --> 00:02:13.720
And I think, I'd like to think about this
dialogue as being among us as consumers rather

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.270
than as professionals because I think that's
where the real battleground is in the years

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.130
to come and it has a whole lot to do with
the thesis of my book.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.409
I have a bit of a fantasy about how this turns
out today and it goes like this, when we're

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:33.791
finished you walk out of here with your faith
in capitalism restored or, at least, your

00:02:33.791 --> 00:02:37.989
faith in that part of capitalism that has
to do with corporations serving customers

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.970
and customers rewarding that service with
profit.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.340
I think it's a terribly important concept.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.400
You may not share the belief that it's threatened
but it is.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.159
There are a lot of people in the world that
think that ought to be ash-canned and, at

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:56.019
the very least, reformed radically and that
capitalism is kind of top to bottom a bad

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.099
thing.

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.292
I think there's a lot of bad practice in capitalism
but I think there's a sort of central soul

00:03:01.292 --> 00:03:05.730
to this thing that has a whole lot to do with
the relationships that corporations and consumers

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.489
have through their brands and that that is
very much worth saving.

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.290
So in this little dream of mine you'll go
home and the next time you go to the mall,

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.950
rather than feel as if you are a predator
or a prey and rather than feeling as if you're

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.579
potentially going to be victimized by a corporation,
I'd love you to feel as if it's election day

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:31.360
and you have a responsibility that while challenging
and difficult, is kind of uplifting and empowering.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.459
So that's my dream for how today's experience
or, perhaps, the reading of "Consumer Republic"

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:38.810
will turn out for you.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.239
It's certainly how it turned out for me writing
it.

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:48.069
I'd like to start out by maybe telling you
a little bit about myself as context.

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:55.870
I'm fairly sure that no one who has ever visited
this facility knows less about calculus than

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.519
I do.

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.999
And it was my complete and abject failure
at calculus that eventually guided me to a

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:06.480
career in marketing, those two things being
diametrically opposite in that they're kind

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.709
of polar opposites in the universe so I became
a marketing guy.

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.930
A couple of things about being a marketing
guy that aren't very pleasant, one of them

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.459
is that we aren't what you called an endangered
species.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.630
If, I went on LinkedIn a couple of weeks ago
to see how many people there were on LinkedIn

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.970
claiming marketing as part of their expertise,
as part of their resumes and the number was

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.110
something like 8.7 million and that seems,
if anything, light to me.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.870
I've certainly seen that many opinions expressed
in a single meeting about issues to do with

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.910
marketing so, at any rate, we're not what
you call an endangered species.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.120
It's also very true that were not always very
popular.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:50.900
My job in the last three decades has been
to separate you from your money and to make

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.919
a profit for corporations that I represent
in the course of doing that.

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:01.560
The former CMO of Coca Cola Company, guy named
Sergio Zyman, once described marketing as

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.330
the process of selling more things to more
people for more money.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.039
It sounds a little predatory, to me.

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.730
So when you stand back from that and say,
okay here's a marketing guy who, A, is not

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.229
particularly irreplaceable, if the missiles
were coming in and we were inviting the important

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:20.150
people into bomb shelters I don't think I'd
be at the front of the line and secondly we

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.080
don't do a job that people consider very popular.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.670
Why then, would I put my career at risk to
write a book that invites people to spend

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.470
less money and buy fewer things?

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.660
That seems suicidal.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.560
Even Martin Luther, I think, must've had tenure
when he nailed his thesis to the cathedral

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.560
door.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.880
I don't have any more; I don't have that much
job protection, probably a good deal less,

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.210
so why would I do that?

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:43.310
Why would I take that chance?

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.880
And I guess the short answer is that this
is my, this is me doing what I can to kind

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.470
of start some conversation that might result
in saving the world.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.470
That seems ambitious but what's life without
a horizon?

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.360
The long answer is a little more complicated
because I really believe that if we wanna

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.361
save the world, I'm not sure where that process
is gonna end, but I am pretty sure that that

00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:07.270
process ought to begin at the mall.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:13.520
If we wanna save the world we should start
at the mall because consuming, if we really

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.720
boil it down to what that all means, not just
to you and me in our living rooms and kitchens

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.410
and garages but to the planet, consuming is
how we shape the world we live in.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:28.520
Everything that we have inherited everything
that surrounds us, environmentally and financially,

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:34.009
all begins with the process of someone exchanging
money for goods or services.

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:37.610
I believe that brands are what democratized
that process.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.669
I'll come back to that theme a little bit
later on and hopefully persuade you that that's

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:45.960
true, but I fundamentally believe that brands
are how that process of commerce remains democratic

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.729
or how the consumer retains some control over
it.

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:54.590
And I also truly believe that we have a good
deal more to fear from a world without brands

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.960
than we have to fear from the one that we
have in front of us right now.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:05.389
So, to explain why I think brands are so important,
this is a story I kind of like to tell as

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:14.750
an illustration, when I was 16 I got the opportunity
to start making my own consumption decisions.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:18.860
In our house that meant, look we'll provide
you with food and shelter and socks and underwear

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.840
but if you want any more than that then you're
gonna have to go pump gas and I still think,

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.020
by the way, that's not a half bad way to raise
children.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.889
But, anyway, there we were and the first thing
I wanted when I had my own money and the right

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:35.889
to spend it as I chose, the very thing I wanted
was blue jeans.

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:40.069
The 19 century economist, Thorstein Veblen,
coined the phrase, "conspicuous consumption"

00:07:40.069 --> 00:07:46.729
in 1890, whatever 1899, I think.

00:07:46.729 --> 00:07:52.409
He described the ultimate purpose of conspicuous
consumption to look as though you were refraining

00:07:52.409 --> 00:07:54.159
from productive employment.

00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:59.259
So the reason he argued, in 1890 whatever,
that we buy things is we wanna look like we

00:07:59.259 --> 00:08:01.700
don't need to work.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:08.039
So for generations of teenagers from, really,
the end of second world war till the 1990s,

00:08:08.039 --> 00:08:12.550
blue jeans were kind of the Lingua Franca
of that and that's how we told the world we

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:14.920
were no longer under the control of our parents.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:19.479
That we were no longer in the thrall of parental
control and that we were making our own choices

00:08:19.479 --> 00:08:23.850
independently, wearing blue denim was how,
was kind of how you started to do that.

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:28.970
Everything else was a bit of an accessory
but it all started with the jeans.

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:31.800
There was a catch.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:36.610
I went to a country high school so where I
grew up, wearing blue jeans could mean one

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:37.610
of two things.

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:41.620
It could mean that you were autonomous and
therefore cool or it could mean that you had

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:47.060
just mucked out a stall and didn't have time
to change your clothes before you got to the

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.060
bus.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.180
So that presents a bit of a complication in
terms of social meaning, right, if I walk

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:55.100
into the classroom and I'm wearing blue jeans
and we're, in any way, uncertain about what

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.930
those mean, then the real value of me having
bought them in the first place is called into

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:00.210
some question.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:05.670
So, teenagers being the geniuses they are
with popular culture at my school and many

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:08.839
other schools like it, we arrived at a solution
to this problem.

00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:11.220
The solution was gonna be Levis.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:17.180
So if you wore Levis which tended to be more
of a city person kind of brand at the time,

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:23.110
it cost a little more money, they were 17
dollars instead of 15 dollars, and they came

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:27.320
in different kinds of blues, so if you bought
the Levis then the signal you were sending

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.980
the world is, as I described earlier, that
you were an autonomous free thinking individual

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.160
and therefore cool.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:39.579
And if you wore any other type of blue jeans,
Carhartts or Lees or GWGs or any one of a

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:43.200
dozen others that were available at the time,
then there was at least a question about what

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.351
you were, you were either trying too hard
or not hard enough or maybe, God forbid, you

00:09:47.351 --> 00:09:51.050
really were mucking out stalls before you
got on the bus to come to the school in the

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:52.050
morning.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.050
So Levi solved that problem.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:57.960
But, of course, the produces another problem
because if the objective is to be cool we

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:04.120
can't allow just anyone who's got 17 dollars
to be cool, right, I mean that kind of undermines

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.060
the whole point of it.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:11.070
So there needed to be some kind of social
control imposed on this process whereby, just

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:14.081
because I can afford to buy the blue jeans
for 17 dollars didn't necessarily mean that

00:10:14.081 --> 00:10:16.149
I cut the mustard.

00:10:16.149 --> 00:10:19.970
And that decision was made communally and
was enforced in the following way, at some

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.550
point, when you were standing in front of
your locker getting your calculus textbook

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:29.410
for another self esteem crushing hour with
Mr. Quigley someone would come up behind you

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:32.020
and tear the tab off the back of your pants.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:36.279
Now, it was no mystery from that point on
who made your jeans but it was also no mystery

00:10:36.279 --> 00:10:42.590
that the group had decided, socially, that
you didn't merit the right to wear that brand.

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:45.670
So you ended up having to endure, you know,
potentially another year, depending on how

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:50.080
fast you were growing, of wearing these pants
that were rendered, somehow, anonymous.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:57.010
So, aside from the obvious trauma that this
clearly left me with all these years later,

00:10:57.010 --> 00:11:00.019
there were two really strong impressions from
this experience that had a whole lot to do

00:11:00.019 --> 00:11:05.930
with how I ended up in this racket and bear
a lot on what we're here to talk about today.

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:09.860
And the first was the sheer power of it.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:18.079
I mean, it is absurd to reduce branding to
a simple identifier for a value proposition

00:11:18.079 --> 00:11:20.610
&gt;&gt;Bruce Philp: Yet, still in business schools
today, this is how it's taught.

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:23.779
It's still in advertising agencies and in
board rooms around the world this is still

00:11:23.779 --> 00:11:25.120
how we look at branding.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.079
What is the label we're gonna attach to our
value proposition?

00:11:28.079 --> 00:11:30.910
And, of course, that's ridiculous.

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:34.000
The greatest power a brand has lies in it
social meaning.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.480
And as the industrial age disappears further
and further in the rear view mirror and marketing

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:44.790
becomes less a question of just making better
things and much more a question of social

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:49.399
meaning and kind of tribalism, that whole,
that whole thing becomes bigger and more powerful

00:11:49.399 --> 00:11:51.870
and more true.

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:56.320
If our choices, as consumers, could not be
observed, in other words if this was the future

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:01.040
and we were all wearing silver lame suits
with white lightning bolts across the front

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.670
and no one ever saw us buy anything, I don't
think there'd be much of a career in marketing.

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:09.940
I wonder if anyone, except possibly Google,
would have a future in commerce and, certainly,

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.880
the world would be a good deal less interesting.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:18.829
So social meaning is immensely powerful in
the branding equation and that left a strong

00:12:18.829 --> 00:12:19.829
impression.

00:12:19.829 --> 00:12:22.690
And the second strong impression that I was
left with is that it was consumers, who in

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:24.850
part, conferred this power on the corporation.

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:30.839
At the end of the day, Levis was no more able
to buy coolness than I was.

00:12:30.839 --> 00:12:38.839
And, although they were more successful, the
fame of that brand lay in its ability to make

00:12:38.839 --> 00:12:42.870
money and that was also its vulnerability
because it was the consumer who made the decision

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.040
that this was the brand that mattered.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.740
That decision happened socially.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:50.250
It happened without the technological tools
that are available to us today but the process

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:51.900
is not very much different.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:56.260
It was organic, it was natural and it happened
from the street and Levis could not have succeeded

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.220
without it.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:03.339
As in a democracy, it was the people who kind
of, ultimately, hold that power.

00:13:03.339 --> 00:13:04.889
So, and those
[Coughing]

00:13:04.889 --> 00:13:08.110
&gt;&gt;Bruce Philp: people are also capable of
taking it away and that actually happened

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:09.260
to Levis some years later.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:14.180
The beginning of the 1990s when generation
X was coming of age, so these were people

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:23.500
born between 1960 and 1980 let's say, this
was a group of people who did not believe

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.260
in tribal conformity at all.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.620
They actually, they had a massive impact on
culture in this regard.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.910
They just shattered it into a million pieces
and everyone was a tribe of one.

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:36.579
And it's no coincidence that Levis was there
after handed the worst most challenging decade

00:13:36.579 --> 00:13:39.180
they ever had in the history of the brand.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:44.230
So people give meaning to that power and people
have the power take it away.

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:48.639
The value of brands lies in social meaning
and that meaning is confirmed by we the people,

00:13:48.639 --> 00:13:53.490
if I can borrow from the declaration of inde--
pardon me, the Constitution.

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:57.980
This is what I learned from my, this is what
I learned from my trousers that left an enduring

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.610
impression and probably got me into this business.

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:03.829
And, in a sense, it was the birth of this
book.

00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:07.360
But it took a couple more things to happen
before I actually got around to writing it

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:12.370
because the advertising business is, if you
watch Mad Men, is nothing but fun and martinis

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:16.790
and why would you sit down and write a book
if you could avoid doing that.

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:22.949
And the two things that happened were these,
first of all, in 2000, Naomi Klein publishes

00:14:22.949 --> 00:14:25.510
a book called "No Logo."

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:27.949
It's a brilliant piece of propaganda.

00:14:27.949 --> 00:14:33.740
Her journalism is sound and the issues that
she deals with in that book are important

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.290
and real issues.

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:39.670
The trick that she pulled was attaching those
issues to the brands that we all wear because

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:45.540
she knew, she knew that we weren't gonna get
emotionally engaged in a sweat shop in Indonesia

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:49.150
but we might get emotionally engaged with
a logo that's on our shoes.

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:55.699
So, in as much as the issues that she raised
were terribly important and remain so, the

00:14:55.699 --> 00:15:00.300
way she raised them was a little bit intellectually
dishonest in the sense that both brand names

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:04.699
were the only thing that kept those corporations
from behaving even worse than they did which

00:15:04.699 --> 00:15:08.959
is a theme we'll come back to in a second.

00:15:08.959 --> 00:15:12.139
So that bothered me cause I was concerned
that maybe we were gonna throw some babies

00:15:12.139 --> 00:15:20.850
out with some bath water and brands were very
much our best hope not our worst enemies.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:23.750
We certainly agreed on the problem just not
what to do about it.

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:28.130
The second was the economic meltdown and at
the time I was working very closely with a

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:33.450
bank brand here in the United States and,
so, I was quite close with how people were

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:37.829
dealing with the question of money and credit
and the guilt associated with those things

00:15:37.829 --> 00:15:39.480
and what it all meant.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:46.070
And in early 2009 before the extent of the
financial services industry's role in all

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:51.519
this had become clear people were very willing
to blame Madison Avenue for what was happening.

00:15:51.519 --> 00:15:55.310
And according to a Gallup poll in the spring
of that year something like two thirds of

00:15:55.310 --> 00:16:00.730
Americans were prepared to blame marketing
for the meltdown if you can imagine.

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:07.100
And that just terrified me because I knew
from working in financial services how dangerous

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:14.720
it can be for brands to operate without the
kind of accountability that your running shoe

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:22.730
maker or your toothpaste maker has and I also
knew that if we disconnected the behavior

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:28.730
of corporations from their relationship with
consumers that all would be lost.

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:32.860
So I thought maybe it was time to put the
martini glass down and stand up in defense

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:40.320
of brands and maybe try to sell people one
last time on why they matter so much to us.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:45.000
So in the process of writing the book I came,
I arrived at sort of three kind of thundering

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:52.930
revelations that I think changed me pretty
profoundly.

00:16:52.930 --> 00:17:00.800
The first one was that it turns out that consumerism
has always had a political soul.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.459
That's a difficult thing to understand when
you're wandering through the mall today and

00:17:03.459 --> 00:17:09.160
you see people behaving the way that they
seem to, particularly when times are good.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:14.990
But, in fact, the political soul of consumerism
was almost at the genesis of it.

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:17.330
A historian whose work I consulted

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:20.900
&gt;&gt;Bruce Philp: writing the book, talks about
the emergence of consumerism is happening

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:28.250
at the period of enlightenment, so the 17th
century and 18th century and some important

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:30.340
things are happening especially in Western
Europe.

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:37.400
At that time you see people living above subsistence,
on a large scale, you see a push towards secularizing

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:41.950
society, trying to reduce the role of the
church in the way that things are run and

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:48.030
you see colonialism producing a group of people
who have money but didn't inherit it, people

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:52.700
who have means but weren't born to a title
or to aristocracy.

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:59.080
So this historian reports, unfortunately,
that the excesses of consumerism emerged almost

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.080
immediately.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.150
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Bruce Philp: You know, people got into debt

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:04.540
and bought too much stuff almost right out
of the gate so shame on us.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:10.310
But, also, what makes the point quite persuasively
that one of the biggest effects this had was

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:12.190
the tearing down of class structures.

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:18.080
That if this merchant class was capable of
buying some of the trappings of wealth and

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:23.540
aristocracy that, by definition, devalued
that wealth and aristocracy and began to tear

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:31.310
down this stultifying, feudal, medieval class
system that had held so much of that society

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:36.710
back for centuries and centuries before that
and that's kind of interesting, to me.

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:41.050
And, in fact, it's ability to sort of tear
down class structures and secularize society

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:45.400
and make people autonomous and free thinking
individuals, remains to this day.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:51.350
The writer of that particular book points
out that every totalitarian society that's

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:57.060
emerged in the last, even a hundred years,
has had as a common theme, an opposition to

00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:00.370
consumerism, right, from Nazi Germany to modern
day North Korea.

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:05.570
If you want to keep, if you want to keep the
hob nail boot of oppression on a people, the

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:07.201
first thing you do is take control of the
media.

00:19:07.201 --> 00:19:10.420
The second thing you do is stop them from
expressing themselves, expressing their free

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:16.100
will by participating in the economy.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.470
Tyrants hate it, they always have hated it.

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:21.780
There are no tyrants who are pro consumerists
that I can think of.

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:28.710
And anything that scares power that much is
probably worth being careful with.

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:36.440
The second thing that I learned is that capitalism
has always had a habit of outsourcing its

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:38.870
conscience to the marketplace.

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:42.790
Not entirely, and there's a spectrum of behavior
as corporately for this.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:46.440
Obviously there are companies that behave
well because that's the right thing to do.

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:53.690
But, broadly speaking, our choices are what
direct the behavior of corporations, in essence.

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:59.070
They don't hear rhetoric, they don't hear,
they don't hear verbal threats, they don't

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:02.800
hear, they don't hear, really, reputational
threats unless it starts to hit the bottom

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.780
line but they do hear the cash register ring.

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:10.450
And that is to them the only signal that is
really reliable about what it is we want,

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:14.550
about what it is we'll tolerate.

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:20.770
And marketers tend to chase around like 6
year olds after a soccer ball; they are obsessed

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:24.930
with knowing exactly what it is we want because
that's the past in prosperity.

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:29.830
So what we want, as I mentioned at the top,
an effect that kind of builds the world we

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:30.950
live in.

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:36.570
This is true to such an extent that the market
research business is one of the biggest kind

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:38.790
of corners of the marketing industry in the
world.

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:44.070
The top five marketing research companies
worldwide, alone, count for something like

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:45.720
20 billion dollars in sale.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:50.390
And when you consider that their product is
an intellectual product, that's not an unimpressive

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:51.390
number.

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:56.950
We are deeply obsessed with what, we as marketers
are deeply obsessed with what's on people's

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:57.950
minds.

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:02.670
And what people want does tend to be the most
powerful force shaping the world that we live

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:04.090
in.

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:10.120
And the third thing that I learned was that
the threat to the marketplace is exactly the

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:14.300
same as the threat to democracy and it really
has a lot to do with why the moment we're

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:18.780
in right now is so terribly important and
so terribly timely.

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:25.180
And that threat is this sort of unholy feedback
loop between cynical corporations and disengaged

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.790
consumers.

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:31.900
Corporations make money; they make money in
the delta between what it costs them to make

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:35.330
a product and what we're prepared to believe
that it's worth, right?

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:39.090
It almost doesn't matter what you're selling
that's how it works.

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:41.080
That's what we call profit.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.710
So faith is where the money is.

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:50.410
It, faith in the brand and in the corporation
is where all the money is.

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:53.570
And when we tend to forget about this as consumers,
bad things happen.

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:57.300
And the most common dynamic looks a little
bit like this, we disengage from a category

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:02.020
cause we don't, we don't care anymore or we
don't trust it or we're cynical and upset

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:05.490
about something bad that it has done.

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:08.590
What happens then, in the marketing world,
is the price becomes the focus in that category;

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:14.190
it tends to commoditize and when that happens
you tend to get fewer bigger players.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:20.080
So like telecom, for example, airlines, you
get fewer bigger players and as a result consumers

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:21.840
tend to lose choice and power.

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:26.780
So, so, that dynamic, there are lots of others
that are equally malignant but that's the

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:29.010
most common and the easiest one to understand.

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:33.550
If we stop caring then a marketer believes
they can only win on price, if they try to

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:37.631
win on price then they kill every marginal
player, the industries consolidate, they become

00:22:37.631 --> 00:22:44.900
too powerful, consumers lose choice and the
rest, as it were, is history.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:48.610
Disengagement from a democracy tends to produce
a dictatorship and disengagement from marketplaces

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:52.850
tends to produce monopolies and I think, I
come from a country where because of the relatively

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:58.591
small population that we have, a number of
industries by practical necessity are, are

00:22:58.591 --> 00:23:02.480
oligopolies or democracies and I'll tell you
it's not nice.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.560
We feel less powerful.

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:07.480
When I pick up the phone to call the people
that supply my wireless services, for example,

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:11.220
as I did this week, still being unable to
connect to the internet with my cell phone

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:18.280
in Silicon Valley, their relative disinterest
in my problem speaks loudly to that fact that

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:21.540
I really only have one other choice where
I come from.

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:28.130
So, disengaged, cynical consumers in a consolidated
marketplace don't tend to produce a very happy

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:32.050
outcome for anybody and it gets really scary
if you're selling physical products that get

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:34.410
produced in factories.

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:37.560
In a sense this is kind of how, this is the
kind of thing that drove me the most because

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:43.560
I know as a marketer how obsessive marketers
are with what consumers think of them.

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:47.600
We know how, I know how closely marketers
listen to consumers.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:53.480
I don't know if consumers know that but, or
if they always necessarily wanna know that.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.960
But they listen obsessively and they always
have.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:03.160
I mean, the year I turned 16, the year I was
buying my Levis, and subsequently being excommunicated,

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.160
was the same year that the UPC code was introduced.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:11.230
And the UPC code on other things was a mechanism
for allowing marketers to listen to the, to

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:15.680
observe the behavior of the consumers in something
closer to real time.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.230
So that urge has always been there.

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:22.930
What's changed, I think, in a lot of ways,
so, so marketing is inherently an empirical

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:28.140
process and it always has been and it's all
about try something and observe the effect

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:31.640
that and then decide whether you wanna repeat
that process or not.

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:36.730
What's changed, I think, very recently is
that we're not rats in a maze anymore.

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:41.340
It used to be, when I started out in this
business, if you were particularly in the

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:46.170
packaged goods world, that you came up with
the strategy, you deployed the strategy, you

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:49.740
waited 12 weeks for the next Nielsen report
and you all sat in a room and flipped through

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:55.210
this kind of arcane document and tried to
ascertain what affect you'd have with your

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:56.210
strategy.

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:58.141
And if it appeared to be successful you'd
rinse and repeat and do it again and if it

00:24:58.141 --> 00:25:01.720
appeared to be unsuccessful you'd make up
some excuse but you never really knew why

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:05.490
it didn't work so people's careers were advanced
more on the basis of how well they could dodge

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:06.490
blame.

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:08.520
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Bruce Philp: than, than real accountability

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:09.910
and off they went.

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:14.670
And that's not like it anymore, now the chess
game is happening in real time at an incredibly

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:19.680
accelerated rate to the point where we can
know, depending on the business we're in,

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:24.560
in sometimes seconds or minutes what effect
the tactic has had.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:29.140
So you may choose to think that we are still
rats in a maze.

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:33.390
I'm less sure who the rat is anymore but I
am sure that we're certainly in a position

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:37.310
to comment on the quality of the cheese in
a much more precise and persuasive way than

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:39.600
we ever have been in history.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:43.950
So I've kind of come to believe that right
here and right now is a signal moment for

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:49.880
this corner of capitalism because that possibility
of conversation and kind of real time, very

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:57.320
accurate, empirical marketing has arrived
at the same moment when we're asking ourselves

00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:01.710
these terrible questions about, about what
are we gonna do with, about over consumption

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:07.400
and what are we gonna do about our excessive
use of credit and the bad consumer behavior

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:11.880
that seems to be propelling these terrible
things.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.900
So my little cry in the wilderness is why
don't we, while we're at it, while we're solving

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.490
these big problems, why don't we reinvent
consumerism?

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:23.830
Let's accept that we're not gonna kill it,
cause we're not and let's see whether we can

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:26.970
level the playing field a little cause it's
tools are being given to us.

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:31.480
And let's see if we can give it a conscience
because that's possible.

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:36.030
And let's see if we can use consumerism as
a way of creating value for society.

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:38.750
That's an outrageous idea, maybe to some people,
but why not?

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:43.170
This, there has never been a better moment
to kind of, to kind of take those dares and

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:47.910
to create a system in which corporations make
money by doing the right thing and don't make

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:50.470
money by doing the wrong thing.

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:54.230
The conditions for that have never been better.

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:58.450
Fairly or unfairly, the initiators of that
change are gonna have to be us on the supply

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:02.140
side, the ones who are going to the mall.

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:03.630
So, how do we do that?

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:05.660
How do we give consumerism a conscience?

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.010
How do we give capitalism a conscience?

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:13.130
How do we level the playing field and make
our consumption decisions a force for good?

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:18.270
And in the book I try to boil it down to three
principles which are, buy less, buy better

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:19.270
and be heard.

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:24.780
And so I'll kind of unpack each of those briefly,
for a second.

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:30.150
In terms of buying less, we are in this trouble
because there are too many of us who want

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:34.840
too much stuff too soon.

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:38.070
It's not a very elegant description of the
problem but it seems to be a pretty accurate

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:39.090
one.

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:43.100
We have a credit crisis and we have an environmental
crisis because there's too many humans on

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:47.140
the planet who want too much stuff and they
want it right away.

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:51.920
That is clearly not sustainable and it's particularly
so because we tend to act it out in two ways.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:55.460
We act it out by demanding we pay less for
the products we buy which I think produces

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:58.380
more negative outcomes than it does positive
ones.

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:02.430
And by borrowing to accelerate the process
of acquisition and most of that is a result

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:05.210
of some kind of social pressure.

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:09.471
Back to the blue jeans, we're not gonna stop,
the question is how do we continue so that

00:28:09.471 --> 00:28:11.630
we at least buy ourselves some time.

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:18.170
And maybe create a system that is capable
of coming somewhere close to sustaining the

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:20.540
demands we're putting on it.

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:27.770
So I think the answer is, the answer begins
with simply buying less and that clearly,

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:31.850
that clearly has a benefit in terms of how
much stuff gets produced and the resulting

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:33.970
impact on the planet.

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:38.710
But what's less obvious is that buying less
stuff also means that purchases are gonna

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:42.090
be more special from a corporate point of
view.

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:45.760
If I'm only gonna see you every 5 years for
a new toaster rather than every two years

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:48.950
for a new toaster, I'm gonna take that moment
a hell of a lot more seriously.

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:52.950
I'm gonna make sure that I satisfy you because
in 5 years when you come back for a new one,

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:54.570
it's me you come to.

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:58.790
That's, I think, a critical principle.

00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:05.340
So the foundational notion is the one I think
is likely to get the least kind of pushback

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:07.560
is that we ought to buy less.

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:11.550
The second point gets a little more interesting
because I'm suggesting that while we're doing

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:14.070
that we buy better, we buy better stuff.

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:18.910
I became quite interested in some features
of the German economy when I was writing this

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:24.960
book and, most notably, up until 2010 they
were the biggest industrial economy on the

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:25.960
planet.

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:31.900
They also had a pretty good environmental
record when it came to manufacturing processes

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:39.400
and to product stewardship, arguably the best
in the world.

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:44.840
What interested me about this was that they
were able to do these two things to be among

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:50.390
the most conscientious producers of goods
on the planet and to be the biggest endurer's

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:55.340
industrial economies in the world by producing
really good stuff instead of lots of good

00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:56.340
stuff.

00:29:56.340 --> 00:30:00.330
And this is kind of a forgotten industrial
age principle.

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:06.340
When I first started working with Japanese
companies in the mid 1980s, I was very impressed

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:11.800
by how the ability to produce large quantities
things produced efficiencies and made products

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:15.450
more accessible to more people and that seemed
like a good thing to me.

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:22.460
But it seems to an extremist that has produced
a kind of appetite for production, for production

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:23.460
sake.

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:27.650
And when I look at the German economy and
its current resilience and those two features

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:31.480
I talked about earlier, it's hard not to ask
ourselves, "What would happen if we tried

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:36.220
to behave that way, in a way that, if we try
to behave that way when we shop, if we chose

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:44.270
to buy things that were simply better and
lasted longer, that could be prepared, that

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:46.060
we might, in some cases, pass onto our kids.

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:51.220
But that in any case would not fill tables
at garage sales and flea markets.

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:56.350
It sounds pretty good on the, on the surface
of it but there is a catch and the catch is

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:59.610
we have to be prepared to underwrite that
by paying more for things, for certain things.

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:06.290
We have to be prepared to underwrite that
by spending, you know, 75 bucks on that toaster

00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:07.960
instead of 25 bucks on that toaster.

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:11.260
Reasoning that over time you'll end up buying
fewer toasters and the long term economics

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:12.720
are gonna work out for you.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:19.230
But, in the meantime, we need to reward moderated
production with better profit margins, it

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:20.230
just makes sense.

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:23.650
That's the part that we have to bring to the
table.

00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:31.820
I think that that could produce some interesting
effects and not least of those effects is

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:34.890
that we might bring back the idea that profit
must be earned.

00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:39.590
It might bring back the idea that people can
make money by building great things instead

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:43.950
of by finding ways to build them in greater
quantities and more cheaply.

00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:50.150
And I don't think that would be a bad feature
of the industrial age to bring back.

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:55.480
And then the third thing that I think we need
to demand of ourselves is that we be heard.

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.690
We make ourselves heard.

00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:02.350
We can send signals today that are earlier
and that are more specific and there are more

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:04.670
persuasive than just withholding our money
ever was.

00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:08.600
You know, just decades ago, if we were mad
at the Proctor and Gamble Company because

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.440
we didn't like the flavor of our Crest toothpaste.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:15.700
The only way we could make ourselves known
to them was to write a letter to someone in

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:21.090
customer service which may or may not ever
get to, to where it needs to be and, in any

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:23.100
case, we did not buy Crest the next time.

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:29.770
And now we have an infinite number of tools
available to us to kind of parse that reaction

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:35.890
more finely and make it more of a warning
rather than to simply kind of blunt, you know

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:41.300
denial of money.

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:42.900
And it isn't just complaints.

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:46.430
The one thing I think we're learning from
watching the way corporations are behaving

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:53.340
on Facebook and on Twitter, for example, and
I think on Google Plus it's starting to emerge

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:54.900
already.

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:58.990
Corporations will complete for praise and
the reason they'll compete for praise is that

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:00.130
it's public.

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:06.420
Praise in a social media environment is tantamount
to advertising because it does scale.

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:11.010
So what that asks of us is that we not only
make ourselves heard when we're unhappy but

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:13.170
that we make ourselves heard when we're happy.

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:16.630
And if we're willing to do that, if we're
willing to be reasoned and specific about

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:22.180
the things that we're not happy about and
if we're willing to be generous and specific

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:27.000
when things are happening the way we want
them to then you will find, very quickly,

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.590
the corporations will look for every chance
they can get to amplify that praise and every

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:33.820
chance they can get to attract more of it.

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:41.270
So this notion of being heard, not only in
open forums like Facebook and Twitter and

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:49.990
Google Plus, but even in the way that we interact
with brands online, in particular, is gonna

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:58.480
be watched, observed, processed, understood
and interpreted to mean something that I think

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:03.290
will produce a kind of better brand of capitalism,
if you like.

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:08.300
Much in a way that a free press is critical
to a functioning democracy I think our willingness

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:13.480
to create publicly available honest and, you
know, reactions to the product experiences

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:18.070
were getting and brand those things is gonna
be critical to this consumer republic that

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:19.200
I've been talking about.

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:23.250
In any case, the point is, to make the right
thing lucrative and the wrong thing not lucrative

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:31.070
and I think this fourth estate principle that
has deep roots in democracy is kind of how

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:33.830
we do that.

00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:40.300
This idea that we can, by becoming conscientious
consumers, produce better capitalists may

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:48.041
seem a bit quixotic and hearts a kind of action,
I'm not so sure that it's the latter but I

00:34:48.041 --> 00:34:52.130
accept that it's a bit of a dream and yet,
at the same time, there was already evidence

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:57.890
that this dynamic is taking place and that
it is having a commercial difference in a,

00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:03.540
a commercially important and relevant difference
in the way that capitalism operates.

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:09.200
We, we see a tremendous correlation between
the fame of a brand and the ethical behavior

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.040
of the corporation behind it.

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:14.490
One of the resources that I worked with in
writing the book was a Swiss company that

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:19.490
measures the ethical behavior of corporations
around the world, some 500 companies, and

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:27.160
they look at everything from environmental
stewardship to labor relations to human rights

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:29.940
and then they rank these companies according
to how ethical they are.

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:34.400
And when you look at this list the thing that
strikes you almost immediately is that the

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:38.220
brands that are at the top of the list, the
ones that are the most ethical, are all brand

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:40.550
names you'd find in your own house or find
at the mall.

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:43.600
And the brands that are at the bottom of the
list, the ones that are the least ethical

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.830
by in large, are companies that operate in
the shadows of capitalism.

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:52.160
They're companies that produce chemicals or
dig things out of the ground but, in any case,

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:56.900
are somehow beyond our reach as consumers
and that's a pretty powerful correlation even

00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:58.800
if it lacks clear causation.

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:04.470
And, in the meantime, when I take that list
and I line it up against the credible list

00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:07.450
of the world's most valuable brands, the overlap
is tremendous.

00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:12.170
And when I take that list and line it up against
the holdings of Warren Buffet's, you know,

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:15.490
Berkshire Hathaway and the overlap is tremendous.

00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:20.040
And when I take that list and line it up against
the list of the brands that Americans consider

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:25.230
the most trustworthy in the world and with
whom they plan to do business in the future,

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:27.970
again, the overlap is tremendous.

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:34.430
So there is an overwhelmingly powerful correlation
between how publicly a corporation has to

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:38.550
live its life through its brand and how well
it behaves.

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:43.890
Why should that be shocking because aren't
we the same way?

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:46.210
And the evidence continues to pile up.

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:51.750
Just last month there was a study published
that made the rounds in the marketing world

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:57.110
in which a research company had attempted
to understand what the fastest growing brands

00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:58.280
in the world had in common.

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:02.480
So it was a ten year study and they looked
at tens of thousands of brands around the

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:07.990
world and applied all kinds of science like
neurolinguistics and so forth trying to understand

00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:12.620
the nature of the consumers relationships
with those brands and came up with the conclusion

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:16.470
that the fastest growing brands in the world
are the ones who were trying to make people's

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:17.530
lives better.

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:22.270
I know, it sounds like they're just making
it up.

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:24.120
But the evidence was quite powerful.

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:30.090
That the attachment of those brands to what
they call fundamental human values had an

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:34.500
inescapable correlation to their growth as
a business and they kind of signed off by

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:40.080
saying that if you had invested the fastest
growing 50 brands you would have outperformed

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:45.130
the SNP 500 over that ten year period by something
like 400 percent.

00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:52.120
So, again, another piece of evidence that
being a good capitalist, being a good capitalist

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:59.110
aren't incompatible and I think we're seeing
increasing evidence of it day to day in small,

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:05.100
um, in smaller, less dramatic ways as corporations
come to terms with the fact that all of their

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:08.161
conduct is now observed and not just what
they say in ads.

00:38:08.161 --> 00:38:15.480
So, at the end of the day I think we can have
an impact and I think we are having an impact.

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:19.400
We are guiding corporate behavior and an entire
industry is growing up around this notion

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:24.300
of brand sentiment because corporations are
obsessively worried about this new public

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:27.190
face that they're developing.

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:31.780
This book says that this would be the worst
time to give up on branding, on branded consumerism.

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:36.700
This would be the worst time to give up on
that aspect of capitalism because we, right

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:39.470
now, are perfecting that feedback loop.

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:43.530
We have a better chance than we ever have
to be heard in a meaningful way.

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:48.890
And it would be the worst time because corporations
can see for themselves that they can make

00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:51.170
money by doing, by doing the right thing.

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:58.760
And, in, and, and in kind of more than anything
right now because we are asking these big

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:06.580
questions about how we go forward given that
the path has proven itself so completely unsustainable.

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:11.220
I think that disengaging now from branded
consumerism, treating marketing as if it were

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:15.090
a lousy way to make a living and relating
to branded consumerism as if it were a kind

00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:21.430
of scam would sell ourselves terribly short.

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:26.640
I think if we wanted to save the world we
should no more, we should no more give up

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:30.370
our role in branded consumerism than we should
give up the right to vote and that if we wanna

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:31.960
save the world we should, indeed, start at
the mall.

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:35.290
And we have a chance right now to make that
count.

00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:39.140
And, so, I thank you for your attention and
I'm happy to take questions if you have any.

00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:40.140
[Applause]
&gt;&gt;Bruce Philp: Thank you.

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:41.140
[Audience members talking]

00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:42.140
&gt;&gt;female #1: I just wanted to ask about your
thoughts about brands reviving themselves

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:58.130
after facing scrutiny, places like Shell and
BP, Nike, just any of your thoughts [inaudible]

00:39:58.130 --> 00:40:13.190
&gt;&gt;Bruce Philp: Right, so the question is about
brands that have come back from ethical disasters

00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:14.780
and revived themselves.

00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:23.880
I think those three stories that you identify,
Shell, BP and Nike are each a little bit different.

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:27.650
Nike, ironically, kind of redeemed itself
in the wake of No Logo.

00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:33.300
It gets mentioned in that book something like
37 times, she's really rough on them.

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:37.180
What's interesting is that book came out at
a time when Nike's power as a brand was at

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:39.090
its absolute peak.

00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:44.840
So they had a lot to, they had a lot to lose
because they knew they were way past building

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:49.150
a meaningfully superior shoe, it was all about
social meaning, it was all about street cred.

00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:54.440
So they, I speculate that they reacted to
that simply because they knew there wasn't

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:55.440
a choice.

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:59.340
They didn't wanna be, they didn't wanna be
the brand that they'd been painted as being

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:05.010
and they were in the, you know, fashion is
the most public and fragile, you know, arena

00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:07.380
to do business in for a brand.

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:11.480
The BP case is interesting because they, I
don't think they had any idea what they were

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:19.490
in for when the Gulf oil spill happened and
that story, in fact, concludes the book.

00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:23.880
My contention is that they, so they were the
80th most valuable brand in the world, according

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:29.130
to Interbrand, before that happened and they
had just spent millions and millions of dollars

00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:35.440
rebranding themselves and putting a new logo
on their filling stations and presented themselves

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:38.891
as kind of a green, you know, having a kind
of green agenda and then this terrible thing

00:41:38.891 --> 00:41:40.590
happens.

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:44.580
So I think what history has shown is that
they were not solely responsible for what

00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:51.771
happened there but the event ended up getting
branded the BP oil spill and I speculate that

00:41:51.771 --> 00:41:54.440
the reason is because they had a brand at
stake.

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:59.150
Because they had only recently put that kind
of like, you know, put that flag on the hill

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:02.430
saying we're gonna be the good guys and then
this terrible, this terrible thing happens

00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:06.640
and I, we can't go and, and refuse to buy
anything from Halliburton and we can't go

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:10.820
and refuse to buy anything from Transocean
but there still are 10,000 gas stations east

00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:13.530
of the Rocky's that wear that green flower.

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:20.260
I think BP was in a position where it didn't
matter what proportion of fault they earned

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:24.840
or who ought to pay for it, they had no choice
but to deal with the problem because they

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:27.290
had made this investment in who they were.

00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:32.800
So that was a case of the brand being used
by society to force the corporation into a,

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:36.750
I would argue, an extremely high level accountability.

00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:38.250
Shell I don't think is there yet.

00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:41.620
The thing we have to bear in mind is that
brands tend to be narrative.

00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:43.640
They tend to be narrative concepts.

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:47.850
We don't judge what a brand does as it were
happening on a clean sheet of paper; we judge

00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:51.500
them in the context of what they did yesterday
and what they did last week and what they

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:52.750
did last year.

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:57.670
BP's crisis may, in the long run, end up being
a blessing from the branding point of view

00:42:57.670 --> 00:43:00.690
if they show themselves to, you know, have
been redemptive.

00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:03.810
But so far, Shell's story is entirely rhetorical,
I think.

00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:06.210
So I think the jury's still out.

00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:11.480
That category's one that we have a hard time
engaging in cause it's just so difficult to

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:12.480
avoid.

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:16.130
But I think the Shell story is still largely
untold.

00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:22.220
&gt;&gt;male #1: So I had a question about the story
of Muji, the Japanese company

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:23.220
&gt;&gt;Bruce Philp: Right.

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:27.490
&gt;&gt;male #1: that's famous for no brand and
they've gotten some renown comments that it's

00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:32.430
no brand that sells the brand or does that
fit into your concept?

00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:33.430
[Laughter]

00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:38.240
&gt;&gt;Bruce Philp: So the question is around Muji
and their anti brand platform and how does

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:40.391
that fit into the story?

00:43:40.391 --> 00:43:46.020
The writer, Douglas Rushkoff, you know him
he wrote "Media Virus" and he once said that,

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:49.340
"Striving not to strive is striving none the
less."

00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:53.810
I just love that quote and no one can tell
me that Muji's not a brand.

00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:55.620
It is completely a brand.

00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:58.940
It's a brand for people who want to appear
to be above brands.

00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:04.290
And, so, I think they are absolutely subject
to the same laws as everyone else.

00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:08.520
They've just worked out the economics of their
business so that they don't have to be, they

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:14.750
don't have to operate at a huge scale which
normally is, that's gonna be a problem if

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:16.520
you try to be obscure and interesting.

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:21.450
But otherwise they are a brand and I would
suggest they're probably a fairly fragile

00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:24.260
one cause I don't know where you go with it.

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:29.440
These things tend to be viral in nature and
they've stretched into a lot of categories

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:30.440
with what they make.

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:35.660
So that's a very interesting case to watch
but I've had this question asked in classrooms

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:39.030
and I try to gently say I think it's a brand.

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:40.030
[Laughs]

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:41.030
&gt;&gt;male #2: You mentioned a moment ago that
we can't stop buying from Halliburton.

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:42.030
I'm thinking about buying a cell phone from
a company that made [inaudible].

00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:49.510
Do you think that our consumer decisions affect
the wheels of change and also do we have enough

00:44:49.510 --> 00:45:13.680
information to be able to know when you buy
a consumer product, what else is going on

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:16.520
with that?

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:25.510
&gt;&gt;Bruce Philp: Right, so I think there are
a couple of things to bare in mind here.

00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:32.200
The first is that commodity market operates
on this, on assumed demand.

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:37.910
So on some level our behavior, collectively,
does influence the way that those guys operate.

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:42.730
I think secondly we have to accept that there's
gonna be some differences we can make fairly

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:45.750
easily and there'll be some other ones that
are more difficult.

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:51.010
And thirdly we have to have some faith that
down the road, the responsibility at the supply

00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:55.180
chain level is gonna become a competitive
battleground.

00:45:55.180 --> 00:46:00.140
You can already see this with ethical and
fair trade products where people are using

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:04.760
the supply chain propositions to differentiate
themselves as brands and we should reward

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:06.730
that if it's true, we should reward that.

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:13.020
But, in the meantime, the examples of cell
phones is a very troublesome one because they

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:19.290
contain a metal that's only available, largely
available in Democratic Republic in Congo

00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:22.480
which is place where terrible things happen
to people.

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:29.960
And it seems, to me, unreasonable that we're
all gonna stop using cell phones but I think

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:33.660
that there's a case to be made that replacing
them every year might not be the best kind

00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:35.370
of global citizenship.

00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:41.320
The very least that we can do to minimize
our impact is not need quite so many of them.

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:46.820
And, yeah, you're right it's difficult to
sort of proactively look for this kind of

00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:52.030
information as a criterion to make an in perches
decision.

00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:55.920
But I think choosing to be aware of this stuff
and catching information as it comes by and

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:58.880
just making as many good decisions as you
can would be an awesome start.

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:01.810
&gt;&gt;male #3: Along that same line of reasoning,
since it can be so hard to keep track of all

00:47:01.810 --> 00:47:04.280
the details and all the supply chain issues
that may happen in production of your good

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:24.040
and being a good consumer, do you think it's
an opportunity for something analogous to

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:28.650
political parties, for consumer goods, like
fair trade is kind of an example of that but

00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:33.940
something to say this has our stamp of approval
for being produced ethically and that sort

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:34.940
of thing.

00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:41.740
&gt;&gt;Bruce Philp: Yeah I think if those kinds
of movements were to emerge and they were

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:46.020
real that would be fantastic but the damage
that gets done if they're not, if they turn

00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:50.340
out not to be real is just inestimable, right,
I mean we don't tend to be very forgiving,

00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:54.870
we don't tend to trust these things again
if we find out that they're fraudulent.

00:47:54.870 --> 00:48:00.800
So I would applaud that stuff but in the meantime
I'm kind of the view that we should just buy

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.150
as carefully as we can.

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:05.780
Don't buy more than we can enjoy, take care
of the stuff that we have

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:09.930
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Bruce Philp: because the foundation of this

00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:16.190
pyramid is still less and, as I say, I mean
this is low hanging fruit, it's a process.

00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:20.500
If we're back here having this conversation
in ten years I hope we're dealing with harder

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:28.520
issues that, that are of the kind you're talking
about because we dealt with all the easy ones.

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:50.270
&gt;&gt;male #4: What do you make of the distortion
by different consumers having different amounts

00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:51.860
of money so that people with more money would
have more influence, have more influence.

00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:52.860
So their issues would [inaudible.]

00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:53.860
&gt;&gt;Bruce Philp: It's a great question.

00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:57.060
Because there is some class equity in the
fundamental that we should buy less and buy

00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:58.060
better, right?

00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:03.080
Not everybody can afford to pay 2,000 dollars
for a stove or whatever.

00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:11.120
I think that the power of wealthier consumers
is immense and they probably have the first

00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:12.480
duty to do something about it.

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:18.300
I'm not gonna, gonna, gonna lecture a guy
who is working two jobs at minimum wage and

00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:22.730
barely keeping his family fed on why he should,
he shouldn't have bought that flat screen

00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:27.350
television for 299 when he could buy a better
one for 599 and not replace it, I mean, that

00:49:27.350 --> 00:49:31.450
would just be unconscionable.

00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:35.090
So I kind of turn my attention to the heaviest
consumers, the ones who are spending the most

00:49:35.090 --> 00:49:38.310
money and saying, "You can make the biggest
difference" you'll never catch me saying we

00:49:38.310 --> 00:49:42.030
need to legislate income, I'm not at that
end of the political spectrum.

00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:46.540
But I would say that if you're blessed with
wealth that, probably, one of the most meaningful

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:52.410
things you could do is apply it to teaching
corporations, you know, what the world wants

00:49:52.410 --> 00:49:53.410
to be.

00:49:53.410 --> 00:50:03.440
And I'm inclined to not put that sort of pressure
on people who are unable to act on it.

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:08.290
When it comes to the question of labor practices
that's a very tough one, I mean, in my dream

00:50:08.290 --> 00:50:12.890
we would repatriate a lot of manufacturing,
I think that's how the middle class was created

00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:14.850
and that's probably how we'll get it back.

00:50:14.850 --> 00:50:21.610
I'm not an economist and I'm certainly not
a politician so I kind of go back to my earlier

00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:27.970
sort of weaselly answer that let's dream of
having that problem.

00:50:27.970 --> 00:50:30.369
[Laughs]

00:50:30.369 --> 00:50:40.550
&gt;&gt;female #2: Just a quick comment that relates
to the discussion about marking goods as fair

00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:44.280
trade or otherwise helping goods in some way,
for instance the organic food group emblem,

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:48.770
of course, have something to be learned from
the senior that came from how quite a large

00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:53.680
number of people have debates about whether
organic food is actually better for the environment

00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:55.860
or better for health but what it actually
means as a certification is a generally utter

00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:56.860
debate.

00:50:56.860 --> 00:51:08.021
So perhaps that's the ordinance of where that
came from and how it became to be trusted

00:51:08.021 --> 00:51:09.021
and it'll be an interesting case to see whether
it can be applied to other goods as well.

00:51:09.021 --> 00:51:10.021
&gt;&gt;Bruce Philp: It would.

00:51:10.021 --> 00:51:14.360
I mean, the benefit I think that that movement,
if I can call it that, had was that it got

00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:15.360
to turn on fear.

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:19.350
I mean we, we're very easily engaged by being
concerned about what goes into our bodies

00:51:19.350 --> 00:51:25.300
and the problem becomes a little bit more
thornier if I want you to wear those blue

00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:30.580
jeans instead of those blue jeans because
those ones were made in a factory that, you

00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:33.740
know, took care of its employees and those
ones weren't.

00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:38.090
That's more abstract and, frankly, a little
less selfish.

00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:43.890
But I would love to see us begin to realize
that our interest in these kinds of issues

00:51:43.890 --> 00:51:47.850
is really just as great they're just not as,
just not as concrete

00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:53.440
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Bruce Philp: as eating chemicals is.

00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:55.250
Well I thank you very much for your attention.

00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:55.450
[Applause]
