Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience in working on music, I was off fucking around competing and paint ball tournaments that could get into painful. Oh Man. Uh, yeah. I had a team called stone to assassins and it was competitive paintball at the time. I was, you know, training, uh, martial arts as I've done throughout my life. And, uh, I was also playing competitive paypal and a martial arts we're doing showed a con. I started off with taekwondo and I got sort of, I mean it's, it's like, it was, uh, it was, the Dojo was cool, you know, and I was progressing quickly, but I sort of fell out with the master there with the sea floor or whatever. I can't remember what Nim, yeah. And, uh, one of my partners who I grew up with who is one of my partners in our Dr. Green thumb, um, Brandon, whatever his father, um, was, uh, was, uh, you know, Sensei and his sensei and became my sensei.

Speaker 1:          00:59          I went from taekwondo to show con and I started training with him. I mean, he had been in the Dojo since he was five years old training with this father. So, you know, I came into that, it took, it took a little bit of a convincing for me to go from one thing to another because it's such a different style. Um, but you know, I adapted to it and I liked it and it was, um, very different, less flash. But, uh, it's very disciplined in, in his father. You know, he was, you know, born in Japan, raised out there and he, he, you know, their, their shit is kind of different. They go to, to, to, um, martial arts universities and they get degrees in different martial arts so they can go and take like, okay, hop Quito in Jujitsu and showed O'Connell and all this and, you know, get their, their degrees, you know, they work, they were up in the belt system and all that stuff, but they become teachers through, through that university, I guess as fascinating.

Speaker 1:          02:01          And, uh, yeah, his, his father was one of the guys in one of the federations that, uh, he's one of the three or four senses that have to come in and give you the black belt when you actually get it. Ah, yeah. It, what was it, a s k FFA or something like I got this done karate federations. Yeah, something like that. Yeah. So you could imagine when Leo Machida came on the scene, you know, we were like, yeah, someone representing the style that, you know, we were training under anything yet a lot of people got excited when he came about. He was really the first guy to legitimize karate in the modern era of mixed martial arts. You show like if you could do all those other things, if you could stuff take downs and you, you knew submissions and all those things on top of that, you could live.

Speaker 1:          02:45          Yeah, you could. And you could do it in a weird way that people didn't really understand his timing. Yeah. Wonderboy Thompson similar to that too. It's got a weird timing. Weird timing. It's, it's, you know, and then the faints with the hips. He was good with that shit. Like, you know, he, he would throw people off with that. And you know, we, I just happened to go see his fight against Rashad Evans. Oh Shit. And a man. I mean, it surprised all of us. I mean, we thought he would win, but we didn't know he would win in that fashion. I mean, yeah, he was something special, you know what I mean? And he's doing, he's over at Bellator now, right. With his brother. His brother Chins has been over there for awhile. His brother, I think his brother's at Bantam weight or featherweight, one of those. But, um, yeah, that, that, I think it's good to go from taekwondo to other styles because taekwondo gives you a lot of dexterity.

Speaker 1:          03:33          You want, I'm going to move your legs easily. Yes, absolutely. It's a good foundation. Yeah. It's a good way to start off. It's good for little kids to the guest that doesn't, you know, there's not a lot of head contact or not as a nation to, yeah. Yeah. And then when you learn, if you weren't, if you really actually want to fight, you want to learn more. Tying all those other things you have way quicker. Legs. Yeah. They just move better. Yeah. For me, you know, I was never good with all those flashy kicked kicks like that. So, you know, big dude. Yeah. It was harder for me. Tae Kwan doe like the show Khan was definitely hard, but it was more suited for someone my size and style. The of hardstyle it is style. And He, you know, he, when he was training as, he would not let up because he'd go be reels here, let me go light on him now.
