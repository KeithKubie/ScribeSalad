00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800
 The Lord said to Abraham this is the beginning of the story 

00:00:05.875 --> 00:00:08.795
 Get out of your country! And from the house of your family 

00:00:08.795 --> 00:00:11.255
 And from your father's house 

00:00:11.255 --> 00:00:14.225
 To a land I will show you 

00:00:14.225 --> 00:00:17.315
 This is one of the sentences in which each paragraph is important 

00:00:18.155 --> 00:00:20.465
 Go somewhere you do not understand 

00:00:20.865 --> 00:00:23.865
 This is the first thing to get out of your country 

00:00:23.865 --> 00:00:25.825
 You know in the 1920s 

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:30.645
 There were a large number of American writers. Those who were expelled to Paris, including Hemingwa 

00:00:31.345 --> 00:00:34.265
 And who wrote "The great gatsby"? 

00:00:34.975 --> 00:00:37.995
 Yes fitzgerald et al 

00:00:37.995 --> 00:00:40.985
 The living was inexpensive in Paris at the time 

00:00:40.985 --> 00:00:43.685
 And part of their transformation into great writers 

00:00:43.685 --> 00:00:45.685
 The fact is that they were out of their country, 

00:00:45.685 --> 00:00:46.675
 This made them see the real state of their country 

00:00:46.675 --> 00:00:49.445
 Because you will not be able to see the state of your real country until you leave it 

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:52.945
 So you have to go into the unknown and this is God's first order 

00:00:53.015 --> 00:00:55.345
 Go to the unknown 

00:00:55.345 --> 00:00:58.205
 Because you know what you know 

00:00:58.205 --> 00:01:00.935
 This is not enough unless you think you are giving up 

00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:04.045
 If you are not perfect and do not think you are full you have to go to a place where you did not live 

00:01:04.165 --> 00:01:07.155
 This is the first thing for Abraham 

00:01:07.155 --> 00:01:10.175
 Well this is good and very logical 

00:01:10.175 --> 00:01:13.385
 Go to where you do not know 

00:01:13.385 --> 00:01:15.795
 What does it mean? 

00:01:16.355 --> 00:01:19.305
 Well that's the meaning 

00:01:19.305 --> 00:01:22.465
 It means keeping away from your family enough to be your independence 

00:01:22.465 --> 00:01:24.400
 This is not because there is a defect in your family, 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.485
 Perhaps there is perhaps a defect in you, 

00:01:28.485 --> 00:01:30.500
 But that means get away, 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.900
 You know I'm talking a lot to people who gave them their families extra protection 

00:01:36.945 --> 00:01:40.900
 They know it themselves, it destroys the need (for something) 

00:01:40.955 --> 00:01:46.400
 One of the things you see in America for example 

00:01:46.455 --> 00:01:51.400
 That the children of the first generation of immigrants are better off than their children (second generation) 

00:01:51.465 --> 00:01:56.400
 The reason for this is that first-generation children are driven by the need 

00:01:56.475 --> 00:01:59.405
 You do not know how much you need to pay 

00:01:59.405 --> 00:02:02.095
 Maybe I'm not disciplined enough 

00:02:02.095 --> 00:02:07.200
 If you do not solve your problem directly if you do not act honestly today 

00:02:07.285 --> 00:02:10.365
 If maybe you will never act honestly because of 

00:02:10.365 --> 00:02:15.900
 Because the separation between your foolishness and punishment is accomplished by your unqualified wealth 

00:02:15.915 --> 00:02:18.585
 So do not mature and do not learn and you 

00:02:18.585 --> 00:02:24.900
 To get yourself out of your subordination to allow the need to push you forward 

00:02:24.935 --> 00:02:28.355
 And become independent and mature 

00:02:28.355 --> 00:02:31.345
 I think that is part of what happens in our culture 

00:02:31.345 --> 00:02:38.200
 The force that attacks the current that goes in a straight line 

00:02:38.255 --> 00:02:43.900
 When our youth are specifically afraid of the strength of men because they are confused 

00:02:43.995 --> 00:02:47.145
 In the distinction between "power and power and power" 

00:02:47.145 --> 00:02:54.600
 The man "efficient and powerful" gets power as a secondary product 

00:02:54.655 --> 00:02:57.705
 But "efficiency and power" are everything 

00:02:57.705 --> 00:03:06.200
 Those who do not understand this fail to differentiate between "power and power" and are afraid of power 

00:03:06.205 --> 00:03:09.155
 They will destroy "efficiency and power" 

00:03:09.155 --> 00:03:16.000
 And this is a terrible thing because we need competencies, what will make us lose others in the long term 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:24.635
 If you move away from your country and from your family and from your father's house and go out and establish yourself in the world 

00:03:24.635 --> 00:03:27.675
 It is an invitation to adventure 

00:03:27.675 --> 00:03:33.500
 The first lines in the Abrahamic story are his call for adventure, great! 

00:03:33.585 --> 00:03:35.105
 To a land I will show you 

00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:37.715
 You know what this means? 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:52.525
 I was deeply astounded by the number of writers Carl Jung and clearly one of them wrote things like Nietzsche 

00:03:52.595 --> 00:03:55.845
 If you understand it you crash 

00:03:56.755 --> 00:04:00.000
 And one of the things Jung understood and understood by mental analysts 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 It is one of the most daunting things in analytical psychology thinking and is strongly linked to religious thought 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.615
 You are not the master of your house 

00:04:09.095 --> 00:04:12.425
 There are souls living within you, that is 

00:04:13.305 --> 00:04:18.900
 You have a will to be able to exercise some control over yourself 

00:04:18.955 --> 00:04:21.335
 But there are many things happening within you 

00:04:21.335 --> 00:04:23.815
 Look outside of your control 

00:04:23.815 --> 00:04:26.495
 Your dreams, for example, are a good example 

00:04:26.495 --> 00:04:32.400
 Or motives you might think they are strangers to you so you do not want to be part of you 

00:04:32.495 --> 00:04:37.700
 But the most accurate is what about your tendencies, what drives you to want something 

00:04:37.755 --> 00:04:39.085
 Where does this come from? 

00:04:39.495 --> 00:04:41.000
 particulary ? 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 Because you can not bring your own inclination 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.315
 If you are a student and study a difficult decision 

00:04:48.315 --> 00:04:50.595
 You may tell yourself to sit and study for three hours 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.515
 I sit down but do not happen what I wanted 

00:04:53.515 --> 00:04:56.965
 Your attention is distracted and may say OK, 

00:04:57.545 --> 00:05:00.455
 Attention from this if I could not control it 

00:05:00.455 --> 00:05:02.995
 Because you say it's your attention 

00:05:02.995 --> 00:05:05.865
 Well, if your attention was probably to be controlled but you could not! 

00:05:05.865 --> 00:05:11.425
 You might say what's in control? 

00:05:11.425 --> 00:05:13.615
 Maybe you think it's random, better not to be random 

00:05:13.615 --> 00:05:21.900
 I can confirm this because it occurs in schizophrenia, there is a factor of random attention, your attention is not random 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:32.000
 It is a course by which better phenomena are considered as characters under your personality and this is a partial description 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.055
 You can not make yourself inclined to something, tendencies show up and then control you 

00:05:39.735 --> 00:05:41.065
 This is quite different 

00:05:42.295 --> 00:05:44.000
 What controls you? 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:52.400
 How do you realize this? Is it something divine? He is my Lord because He controls you and can not do anything 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:06:01.700
 There is an appeal within you that drives you and determines your tendencies and sometimes it is sometimes dark and may not be 

00:06:01.765 --> 00:06:04.605
 But you are driven forward with what you tend to, if ..... 

00:06:05.945 --> 00:06:07.465
 if 

00:06:07.465 --> 00:06:12.600
 The idea that moves you away from your home and your father's home and the welfare of your childhood in your country 

00:06:12.625 --> 00:06:15.405
 It is something outside of you that you listen to, and listen 

00:06:15.405 --> 00:06:17.575
 That's true 

00:06:17.575 --> 00:06:20.455
 It can say I do not want to call this appeal to God or the Lord 

00:06:20.805 --> 00:06:23.575
 It does not matter what you call it 

00:06:23.965 --> 00:06:29.800
 It does not matter what is called, is an object and exists 

00:06:29.845 --> 00:06:31.800
 If you do not listen to this other thing 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:38.825
 If you do not listen to him, I have worked clinically and talked with enough people at my age to know this absolute knowledge 

00:06:38.825 --> 00:06:44.800
 If you do not listen to this thing that drives you forward you will pay a price you could not imagine 

00:06:44.855 --> 00:06:50.500
 You will get all the tragedies in your life and you will not find anything good in them 

00:06:50.595 --> 00:06:52.000
 Worse, you will know 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.925
 It is your fault that you lost what you could get
