KUMAIL NANJIANI: You'd
think Google would

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.940
have a better room than this.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.560
I thought there would be,
like, an awesome movie theater,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.240
and most people
are on the floor.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.740
Great.

That's how we roll.

That's-- you know, we gotta--

KUMAIL NANJIANI: You
want to stay grounded.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.210
DANA HAN-KLEIN: We
need server space.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.830
KUMAIL NANJIANI: I get it.

Kumail just read--

THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Kumail
just read "The Game,"

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.585
and started off with,
like, a hard neg up top.

00:00:34.585 --> 00:00:35.710
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Yeah, man.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.335
This is Google.

00:00:36.335 --> 00:00:37.930
You've gotta show
them who's boss.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.590
I bing, so I don't know what--

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.299

you're out of here,

00:00:45.505 --> 00:00:46.640
like, all right, gotta go.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.930
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Yeah.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.540
I went on Bing by mistake
once, and it said, you--

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.380

Was that just it?

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.366
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Yeah.

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:55.450

00:00:59.114 --> 00:01:00.330
KUMAIL NANJIANI: No, no, no.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.310
ZACH WOODS: Oh, no.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.850
This is-- my question
cannot support this level

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.680
of attention.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.050
I just was curious if you
used the phrase got on fire.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.940
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
Yeah, he did.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:09.640
ZACH WOODS: That was it.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.164

is going on the internet.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.550
It could be the next,
like, slang term.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.290
Everyone will be like
that's got on fire.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.420
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Got on
fire, it's gonna get on fire.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.390
DANA HAN-KLEIN: There we go.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.098
It'll be like a
self-fulfilling prophecy?

00:01:22.098 --> 00:01:23.240
Is that what that becomes?

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.760
ZACH WOODS: Yeah.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.134
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
I'd love to know,

00:01:25.134 --> 00:01:27.220
we just saw the first
episode of season four.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.178
What do you think the
biggest shift in reaction

00:01:29.178 --> 00:01:30.466
has been to the show?

00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:31.840
KUMAIL NANJIANI:
For season four?

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.080
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yeah.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.770
KUMAIL NANJIANI: We haven't
heard any of the reaction yet,

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:34.470
so we don't know.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.730
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Oh.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.142
Well, let's give them the
reaction for season four.

00:01:37.142 --> 00:01:37.603
KUMAIL NANJIANI:
Yeah, how do you--

00:01:37.603 --> 00:01:38.064
AMANDA CREW: Reaction.

00:01:38.064 --> 00:01:38.563
[CHEERING]

00:01:38.563 --> 00:01:39.450
Whoa, big--

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.530
ZACH WOODS: I would
say, just based on that,

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.235
the reaction is much more
coerced this time around.

00:01:44.235 --> 00:01:44.790
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Oh,
yeah, they hated it.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.320
They hated it.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.190
They're being paid to do that.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.880
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Can I say,
this is a very diverse crowd.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.310
It's white people
and Asian people.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.190
I see my people.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.990
This is great.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.490
Look.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.680
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
Yes, it's all the peeps.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.570
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Does this feel
threatening to you, white man?

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.800
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Yes.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.250
It's not my America.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.945
I want to see everybody's
H-1's right now.

00:02:05.945 --> 00:02:07.696
KUMAIL NANJIANI: I bet
there's a few here.

00:02:07.696 --> 00:02:09.986
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: You bet
there's a few H-1s in here?

00:02:09.986 --> 00:02:12.510
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Hey, man,
I was an H-1 until I found--

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.250
tricked someone into
falling in love with me.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.650
AMANDA CREW: And then made
a movie about it too, right?

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.950
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Yeah.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.056
AMANDA CREW: Yeah.

00:02:18.056 --> 00:02:19.430
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
I was an O-1.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.802
It's for artists of, um,
extraordinary ability.

00:02:23.802 --> 00:02:26.260
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Yeah, it was
made for people like Einstein

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.782
and then, you
know, these people.

00:02:27.782 --> 00:02:28.990
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Not L-1s.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.410
That was made for talentless
hacks like myself.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.780
Let's get into a strong
visa debate right now.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.610
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Let's.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.440
KUMAIL NANJIANI: I'll go
anti, just to stir the pot.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.905
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: [LAUGHS]

00:02:41.905 --> 00:02:44.280
DANA HAN-KLEIN: This ends in
me being fired, I feel like.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.530
KUMAIL NANJIANI: You haven't--

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.810
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: All of us.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.180
KUMAIL NANJIANI:
--done anything wrong.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.000
We have.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.357
Sorry, Dana.

00:02:49.357 --> 00:02:50.940
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I
am out of questions.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.380
No, how much did you
know about the goings-on

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.000
of Silicon Valley,
like this area,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.320
before you started the show?

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:01.150
KUMAIL NANJIANI: I didn't
know anything about it.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.020
I remember-- I feel like the
world outside Silicon Valley

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.870
has become much more aware
of the goings-on of Silicon

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.180
Valley in the last four years.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.110
Not because of our show,
but I remember the show--

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.420
when we did the pilot, I
would tell people I'm gonna do

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.131
a pilot-- a pilot is just,
it's just the first episode--

00:03:20.131 --> 00:03:21.130
called "Silicon Valley."

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.510
And they were like, oh,
is it set in the '90s?

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.509
And I was like, no, there's
crazy shit happening

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:25.560
there right now.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.390
And people-- it wasn't as much
in the mainstream consciousness

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.340
as it is right now.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.424
So I knew nothing
about it, really.

00:03:31.424 --> 00:03:33.590
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: I had
approached tech in general

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.520
just as a consumer, as,
like, a primarily a gamer.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.530
So, like, however it
was going to improve

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.590
my gaming experience, that's
usually where I checked in.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.660
And I would say my horizons
have broadened a little bit.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.380
And it's been interesting
to know, like--

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.180
well, to find out just the
business elements of it

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.190
all, just how much
money is flying around.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.290
It really does sort of feel
like this tech, nerdy Wild West.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.610
Everybody's shooting each
other with infrared laser

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.184
beams instead of pistols.

00:04:02.184 --> 00:04:03.850
ZACH WOODS: I hadn't
even really engaged

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.270
with tech as a consumer.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.730
Like, I was so frightened of
tech just in my daily life,

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.715
I used my father's email address
in high school, because--

00:04:14.715 --> 00:04:16.214
KUMAIL NANJIANI:
Which was zachsdad.

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:17.410
ZACH WOODS: Yeah, zachsdad.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.040
KUMAIL NANJIANI: At aol.gov.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.450
ZACH WOODS: We have ego boundary
issues between the two of us.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.800
But I was too-- it felt
too daunting to set up

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.287
a Gmail account, so that
was my relationship to tech.

00:04:28.287 --> 00:04:29.620
AMANDA CREW: I remember when I--

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.340
MARTIN STARR: It
felt too daunting?

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.990
ZACH WOODS: Daunting, yeah.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.991
I was intimidated by it.

00:04:31.991 --> 00:04:34.156
I, like, went to the login,
and it asked me my name,

00:04:34.156 --> 00:04:35.450
and I was like, fuck this.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.437
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:37.437 --> 00:04:39.520
AMANDA CREW: When I set
up my first email account,

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.170
I didn't understand what it was.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.820
So when I shared my email
address with my friend,

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.025
I was like, yeah, it's
www.cucumber_cutie@hotmail.com.

00:04:49.025 --> 00:04:49.525
And--

00:04:49.525 --> 00:04:52.970
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Oh, I'm so
sorry, a couple questions.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.531
Cucumber cutie?

00:04:55.531 --> 00:04:58.075
ZACH WOODS: That feels both
suggestive and infantile

00:04:58.075 --> 00:04:59.150
at the same time.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.780
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Yeah, it's like
a child trying to be sexual.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.093
ZACH WOODS: Oh, no.

00:05:03.093 --> 00:05:03.843
AMANDA CREW: I'm--

00:05:03.843 --> 00:05:04.926
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Cucumber?

00:05:04.926 --> 00:05:06.790
AMANDA CREW:
Cucumber_cutie@hotmail.com was

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:07.650
my email address.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:08.525
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Why?

00:05:08.525 --> 00:05:11.170
AMANDA CREW: And it was because
I was in the ninth grade,

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.190
and I was in the computer
class when I was making it,

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.130
and there was a poster that
said, cool as a cucumber.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.515
And I was like, yeah,
cucumbers are cool.

00:05:20.515 --> 00:05:22.194
So that was--

00:05:22.194 --> 00:05:23.610
KUMAIL NANJIANI:
That is adorable.

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.660
ZACH WOODS: Although
I shouldn't give you--

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.390
Kumail shouldn't give you shit,
because his first email was

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.770
dildoteddybear.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:36.640
KUMAIL NANJIANI: (LAUGHING)
I know you have questions.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.070
I will answer them.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.990
Dildo teddy bear.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.580
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
Why teddy bear?

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.310
Dildo I get.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.950
KUMAIL NANJIANI: It
was dildoteddybear--

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.110
ZACH WOODS: This is
the most-- like, it's--

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.060
KUMAIL NANJIANI: It
was dildoteddybear2--

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.960
ZACH WOODS: Yes.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.280
KUMAIL NANJIANI: --because
someone got to the--

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.210
ZACH WOODS: Because your
dad had dildoteddybear1.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.120
KUMAIL NANJIANI: My dad was
original dildoteddybear,

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.290
and I was dildoteddybear
Jr. And that's still

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.990
how we call each other?

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.640
Hi.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.610
Does that answer your question?

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.240
ZACH WOODS: Does this
count as sexual harassment,

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.260
since we don't work here?

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.680
DANA HAN-KLEIN: This
answers my question more

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.970
than I ever wanted, I think.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:04.720
ZACH WOODS: Sorry.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.240
It's gross.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.420
Sorry for saying that.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:07.836
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
It's a safe space.

00:06:07.836 --> 00:06:11.124
We're learning a lot about
each other, apparently.

00:06:11.124 --> 00:06:13.040
Has working on the show
made you, like, at all

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.456
more inclined to
learn about this?

00:06:14.456 --> 00:06:16.400
Or are you just
like, eh, I'm good.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.400
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: No--

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.540
ZACH WOODS: It's
interesting, it's not--

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.400
I mean, we're not--
at least for me,

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.750
I'm not going on any, like,
giant research expeditions

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.670
into-- but like, if I'm
listening to the radio

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.140
and a show about
tech comes on, I'm

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.260
more likely to understand some
of the, like, basic vocabulary

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
of it, or like
articles I'll read

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.580
that I wouldn't otherwise read.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.746
But yeah, I feel like it's
made me a little bit more

00:06:37.746 --> 00:06:38.610
familiar with tech.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.287
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: I've
definitely pursued it,

00:06:41.287 --> 00:06:43.620
just because the show's gotten
some sort of direct lines

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.840
not only to investors,
but developers, as well.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.900
And I always-- like,
talking again about games,

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.150
my favorite booth
at E3 is always

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.420
like the new, like,
rendered grass

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.190
that Nvidia has, as opposed to,
like, the latest modern warfare

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:57.690
game.

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.710
So like, I-- I kind of like the
elements and the pieces of LEGO

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.690
that go into building
the bigger picture.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.990
And just with the show
and kind of like--

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:08.752
I mean, as crass
as this is, like,

00:07:08.752 --> 00:07:10.710
the little bit of extra
spending money that you

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:15.250
get by being on TV, there's just
some opportunities to kind of--

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.550
to explore, just based on
if you have an interest

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.100
in a certain thing--

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.090
me, it's games and
the environment--

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:24.087
I think there's opportunities
to explore here in the Valley.

00:07:24.087 --> 00:07:25.170
And it's been interesting.

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:26.920
ZACH WOODS: Tommy's
been heavily investing

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.620
in bringing back Tamagotchis.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.270
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Yeah.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.760
Yeah, Tamagotchis.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.780
But I'm calling
them "Tommyguccis."

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.330
KUMAIL NANJIANI: And they're,
like, little versions of you.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:36.720
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Yeah.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.740
KUMAIL NANJIANI: And
you gotta feed 'em.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.650
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Yeah,
you gotta feed these guys.

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:40.920
KUMAIL NANJIANI:
Gotta feed these guys.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.140
AMANDA CREW: And you've
got to play with them.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:42.810
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: You've
gotta feed these guys.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:43.770
KUMAIL NANJIANI: It's
gotta be compliments.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:45.020
You feed it compliments.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:46.170
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
Yeah, they always

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.890
have just super low self-esteem,
and you have to pick them up.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:50.670
ZACH WOODS: But weirdly,
the more you praise them,

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:51.630
the hungrier they get.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:52.671
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Yeah.

00:07:52.671 --> 00:07:54.090
Yeah, it's a real
sad relationship

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.480
you have to develop
with these Tommyguccis.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.144
In Canada, gucci is--

00:07:59.144 --> 00:08:00.060
KUMAIL NANJIANI: What?

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.230
Don't say it.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:02.908
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
Yeah, just wanna--

00:08:02.908 --> 00:08:03.741
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Um--

00:08:03.741 --> 00:08:04.537
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:04.537 --> 00:08:06.745
DANA HAN-KLEIN: This is,
like, the most R-rated thing

00:08:06.745 --> 00:08:07.449
we've had.

00:08:07.449 --> 00:08:08.490
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Good.

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:10.846
We want to challenge you.

00:08:10.846 --> 00:08:12.720
KUMAIL NANJIANI: What
else have you had here?

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.540
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I don't
know, we've just--

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.915
KUMAIL NANJIANI:
So when you were

00:08:14.915 --> 00:08:17.140
saying that you guys
get big movies here,

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.150
this is where you
fucking show 'em?

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:19.951
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:19.951 --> 00:08:20.450
This?

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:21.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.935
MARTIN STARR: On
two tiny screens?

00:08:22.935 --> 00:08:25.660
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Yeah, you
bring in a bunch of chairs

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.470
from somewhere?

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:28.386
ZACH WOODS: Why don't
you just have one person

00:08:28.386 --> 00:08:30.100
hold their iPhone
while 300 people--

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.159
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Oh, no,
hold their Google phone.

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:32.610
ZACH WOODS: Sorry.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:33.119
Google phone.

00:08:33.119 --> 00:08:34.003
MARTIN STARR: Yeah, yeah.

00:08:34.003 --> 00:08:34.760
ZACH WOODS: Sorry.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:35.720
KUMAIL NANJIANI:
This is where you--

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.240
MARTIN STARR: You could have
one big screen, at least,

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.094
on this wall instead
of two tinier ones.

00:08:39.094 --> 00:08:40.005
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Well, where
would we put the logo--

00:08:40.005 --> 00:08:41.945
AMANDA CREW: Separated
by the logo, Google.

00:08:41.945 --> 00:08:44.320
KUMAIL NANJIANI: They don't
watch the movie, or the show,

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.736
they just look at
their own logo--

00:08:45.736 --> 00:08:46.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.669
--and they just smile and
cry, and all the emotions.

00:08:50.669 --> 00:08:52.960
And at some point the credits
roll and we come in and--

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.490
ZACH WOODS: It's on both
screens simultaneously?

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:56.890
MARTIN STARR: Is there usually
a partition down the middle

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:58.135
and you watch two
different things?

00:08:58.135 --> 00:08:59.634
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
There's a delay.

00:08:59.634 --> 00:09:01.270
The one screen is
30 seconds behind.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:03.025
It's a nightmare to watch.

00:09:03.025 --> 00:09:05.050
DANA HAN-KLEIN: --3D
projecting in the world.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:05.860
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
(LAUGHING) Yeah.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.068
ZACH WOODS: It feels like
a passive-aggressive attack

00:09:08.068 --> 00:09:11.980
against epileptic employees
if it's both simultaneously.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.250
Isn't that triggering?

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.580
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Do you
guys forget where you work?

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:20.181
Why do you have to
constantly be reminded?

00:09:20.181 --> 00:09:22.180
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: As
soon as they walk in, oh,

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.565
I'm in the wrong place, damn it.

00:09:23.565 --> 00:09:26.550
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Oh my
god, it says AltaVista.

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:30.335
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
Shoot, not today.

00:09:30.335 --> 00:09:31.335
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Google.

00:09:31.335 --> 00:09:31.975
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Google.

00:09:31.975 --> 00:09:32.750
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Yeah.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.416
DANA HAN-KLEIN: That's
one of the things

00:09:34.416 --> 00:09:35.500
your show gets so right.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.930
It's just all the weird
quirks, obviously,

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:39.760
somebody was paying
attention to it.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.990
Because all the Hooli
stuff, like the Pied Piper,

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:44.290
"swag, schwag, schwag"
is such a thing.

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:44.890
Like

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:46.780
It's just fascinating,
I think, for us

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.780
to watch because it's like
looking in a mirror, a very

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:53.115
scary mirror sometimes, but it's
definitely a fascinating thing.

00:09:53.115 --> 00:09:55.240
So it's interesting to see
how you guys approach it

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.720
because you're not in
tech you're actors--

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.470
KUMAIL NANJIANI: We
would read the scripts

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.429
and we would think that
this is so exaggerated,

00:10:01.429 --> 00:10:03.928
and then we come here and we're
like, oh, we underplayed it.

00:10:03.928 --> 00:10:04.615
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:04.615 --> 00:10:05.656
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Yeah.

00:10:05.656 --> 00:10:08.290
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Why does
it say Google on the wall?

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:11.735
You guys know where you
work, look at your badges.

00:10:11.735 --> 00:10:14.192
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:14.192 --> 00:10:15.275
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Yeah--

00:10:15.275 --> 00:10:16.941
KUMAIL NANJIANI: It's
funny because when

00:10:16.941 --> 00:10:20.170
we're shooting our show it
does say, HBO really huge,

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:22.210
and then we have
to CG it out later.

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:25.444
CG is-- I don't know if you
guys know computers, but--

00:10:25.444 --> 00:10:26.860
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
I think that's

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:30.040
a testament to the writers,
Mike and Alec and the whole team

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.920
there, they come
up here constantly

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.720
and mine for stories.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.330
And whenever-- Alec said
this-- whenever they're

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.870
in a narrative corner, when
they've backed themselves

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:43.810
into what happens
now, they usually

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.880
call someone up and
say what would normally

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:50.300
happen here and then get
their answer out of that.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.120
Their "solve" out of that.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:55.783
ZACH WOODS: It also seems
like people don't mind--

00:10:55.783 --> 00:10:57.480
you're really
pleased with "solve."

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.125
No, no, don't--

00:10:58.125 --> 00:10:59.410
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Hey,
you're really good.

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:00.580
You're really good on the show.

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:01.030
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Pling!

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:02.035
KUMAIL NANJIANI: There you go.

00:11:02.035 --> 00:11:03.118
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Pling!

00:11:03.118 --> 00:11:04.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:05.115
Points, points.

00:11:05.115 --> 00:11:06.698
ZACH WOODS: It feels
like people don't

00:11:06.698 --> 00:11:10.210
mind being made fun of as
long as they feel known,

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:13.390
as long as you pay
attention, and then people

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:15.370
will tolerate a high
degree of mockery,

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:17.260
or even enjoy it,
because it feels

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:22.030
like the compliment of careful
attention has been paid.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:26.470
And so it's nice when
tech people don't bristle

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:29.950
even though it's pretty I mean.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:31.943
It's nice because
it feels like, well,

00:11:31.943 --> 00:11:33.568
then we must have
got some of it right.

00:11:33.568 --> 00:11:35.276
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
Yeah, it can be mean,

00:11:35.276 --> 00:11:37.960
but it's also from the
point of view of the inside.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:38.619
It's not like--

00:11:38.619 --> 00:11:39.535
ZACH WOODS: Oh, yeah--

00:11:39.535 --> 00:11:42.040
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: --five
super aggressive alpha dudes

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.540
came to Silicon
Valley and was like,

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.380
look at all these dweebazoids!

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.040
That's not the show.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:48.560
It's this.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.950
ZACH WOODS: That was the working
title for the first season,

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:52.283
"Look At All These Dweebazoids."

00:11:52.283 --> 00:11:52.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:54.350
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: (LAUGHING)

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:56.204
KUMAIL NANJIANI:
We're dweebazoids too.

00:11:56.204 --> 00:11:57.245
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Yeah.

00:11:57.245 --> 00:11:57.990
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
Were they worried

00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:59.020
that "Look At All
These Dweebazoids"

00:11:59.020 --> 00:11:59.890
wouldn't fit on a shirt?

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:01.030
And they're like, we'd have to--

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.363
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: It does,
you just do a smaller font.

00:12:03.363 --> 00:12:05.577
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:05.577 --> 00:12:06.910
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Problem solving.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.050
I like it.

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:11.440
But I find it so interesting
when you guys get grilled

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.725
about tech questions,
and it's like, that's not

00:12:13.725 --> 00:12:14.840
your background.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.590
What's your instinct
to do in those moments?

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.395
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Literally
say, that's not our background.

00:12:20.395 --> 00:12:21.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:21.936
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Right.

00:12:21.936 --> 00:12:23.950
KUMAIL NANJIANI: We don't know.

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:26.080
We're all just
consumers of technology.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.080
People are always like, so
what's your billion dollar app

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:29.710
idea?

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:32.480
I wouldn't tell
you if I had one,

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.640
also I don't have one
because I'm an actor.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:41.570
I'm pretending to
be what you are.

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:44.440
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: It's a
bit like inviting an actor who

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.070
played a doctor on
a medical procedural

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:47.955
to give a speech at a medical--

00:12:47.955 --> 00:12:49.455
KUMAIL NANJIANI:
Or perform surgery.

00:12:49.455 --> 00:12:50.996
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:50.996 --> 00:12:54.160
Give me a 100 ccs of
gigabytes, is where we're at.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.012
KUMAIL NANJIANI: We are.

00:12:56.012 --> 00:12:57.220
That's the most technically--

00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:00.610
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: We have to
have an consultant on our show

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:03.430
on-set at all times because
we'll get these monologues

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:06.330
of like, [INAUDIBLE]
and all this--

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.490
I didn't even say
it right then--

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:12.186
and he has to come in and--
or it could be a she--

00:13:12.186 --> 00:13:14.430
he or she has to come in and--

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:16.222
KUMAIL NANJIANI: He or
she, but it is a he.

00:13:16.222 --> 00:13:17.471
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Thank god.

00:13:17.471 --> 00:13:19.236
KUMAIL NANJIANI: On
our show it is a he.

00:13:19.236 --> 00:13:19.980
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
Yeah, I mean--

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:20.710
KUMAIL NANJIANI: But he or she.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:21.565
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: It
could be a he or she.

00:13:21.565 --> 00:13:24.120
KUMAIL NANJIANI: This is
a great mix, by the way.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:24.965
It really is.

00:13:24.965 --> 00:13:25.590
MARTIN STARR: It actually is.

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:26.295
KUMAIL NANJIANI: It's a good--

00:13:26.295 --> 00:13:27.900
MARTIN STARR: I thought you
guys were saying Hiroshi.

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:28.812
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:28.812 --> 00:13:30.520
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
Hiroshi does come in.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.853
There's a big language barrier,
but Hiroshi does come in

00:13:32.853 --> 00:13:34.285
and tell us what's going--

00:13:34.285 --> 00:13:36.879
KUMAIL NANJIANI:
He's not a H-1B1.

00:13:36.879 --> 00:13:38.295
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
Direct him for us.

00:13:38.295 --> 00:13:39.480
KUMAIL NANJIANI: It's OK.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.956
Look at me, I can't be racist.

00:13:41.956 --> 00:13:44.080
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: It's
impossible for you to be--

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:44.625
KUMAIL NANJIANI:
It's impossible.

00:13:44.625 --> 00:13:47.126
ZACH WOODS: But you'll
put it to the test.

00:13:47.126 --> 00:13:48.740
KUMAIL NANJIANI: I have been.

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:52.796
Here's my observation
about Mongolian people.

00:13:52.796 --> 00:13:54.795
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
(LAUGHING) Mongolian people.

00:13:54.795 --> 00:13:55.461
ZACH WOODS: Wow.

00:13:55.461 --> 00:13:56.854
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Why?

00:13:56.854 --> 00:13:57.850
Why?

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:01.431
ZACH WOODS: He goes hard
at the Mongolian people.

00:14:01.431 --> 00:14:03.180
He's has a whole bit
about their barbecue.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:04.980
KUMAIL NANJIANI:
They love Popsicles.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:08.162
I make up stereotypes
and I double down.

00:14:08.162 --> 00:14:09.370
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Commit to it.

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:10.850
That's the true internet way.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:11.475
Yes, It's true.

00:14:11.475 --> 00:14:12.330
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Oh my god.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:13.380
Mongolians and their Popsicles.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.172
ZACH WOODS: You could
be president one day.

00:14:15.172 --> 00:14:16.380
KUMAIL NANJIANI: No, I can't.

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:17.220
I wasn't born here.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:17.867
Ugh.

00:14:17.867 --> 00:14:19.200
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Of Mongolia.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.880
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Of
Mongolia I could be, yes.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.004
They're very relaxed rules.

00:14:22.004 --> 00:14:24.690
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Yeah.

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:27.325
Kumail Nanjiani starts
feud with Mongols.

00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:31.136
KUMAIL NANJIANI: (LAUGHING)

00:14:31.136 --> 00:14:33.447
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: I don't
think Mongols is a PC term.

00:14:33.447 --> 00:14:34.195
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
I don't think so.

00:14:34.195 --> 00:14:36.152
KUMAIL NANJIANI: I
don't think that's good.

00:14:36.152 --> 00:14:37.200
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
We'll check it later.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.850
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: It's
just short for Mongolian.

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:39.740
KUMAIL NANJIANI:
No, don't do it.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:40.430
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
But it sounds weird--

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:41.000
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Yeah.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:41.780
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
Me even saying

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.990
Mongolian sounds like I'm
being mean, but I'm not.

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.490
Mongolian.

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:45.050
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Yeah.

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:45.750
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
I'm Mongolian.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:47.916
KUMAIL NANJIANI: As long
as you're not saying like--

00:14:47.916 --> 00:14:51.177
yeah-- "whore" after it.

00:14:51.177 --> 00:14:52.885
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
In a history context.

00:14:52.885 --> 00:14:53.625
KUMAIL NANJIANI: In
a history context.

00:14:53.625 --> 00:14:56.330
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: If you're
listening to Dan Carlin's--

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:57.522
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Yes.

00:14:57.522 --> 00:14:58.730
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: History--

00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:59.195
KUMAIL NANJIANI: "Hardcore--"

00:14:59.195 --> 00:15:00.986
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
"Hardcore History," you

00:15:00.986 --> 00:15:03.200
could talk about Jengis
Khan, as he says.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.235
What the fuck is
going on right now?

00:15:05.235 --> 00:15:06.170
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Hey.

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:06.470
Wait.

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:07.160
Yeah, I'm lost.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:07.810
Where are we?

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:08.310
Oh, OK.

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:09.560
DANA HAN-KLEIN: You're-- yeah.

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.470
This is why we have the signs.

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:17.810
This season seems to be a
lot about status changes

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:20.550
within the group, and you guys
are all in very different roles

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:21.360
and having to deal with that.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.450
What was the most fun part
to explore about that?

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:25.430
Because we're seeing
these different sides

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:26.747
of these characters.

00:15:34.171 --> 00:15:36.420
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Up until
this point, as the group,

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:40.452
they've seen obstacles come
at them from the exterior,

00:15:40.452 --> 00:15:41.910
but I think after
the first episode

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:45.600
you gather that the group
dynamic is being challenged.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.670
And as a result, I would
say over the season,

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:51.150
there's a little bit more
emotional anchor points

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:52.680
to kind of latch
on to, not to say

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:56.100
that the show's going to
become like "Girls" or anything

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:56.640
like that.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:01.470
It still is Mike Judge's
sentimentality level

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:05.460
which is small, he has a low
threshold for that stuff.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:08.340
But it's been nice
to latch onto that

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:10.380
and see this interplay
between the characters

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:13.080
in terms of what this sort
of like dynamite stick being

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.372
thrown into the group has been.

00:16:14.372 --> 00:16:15.913
ZACH WOODS: Yeah,
because once you've

00:16:15.913 --> 00:16:18.480
been doing a show for a while
the dynamics get locked in

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.505
and it almost becomes
predictable where you're like,

00:16:21.505 --> 00:16:27.000
oh, OK, Jared's going to
be mothering to Richard,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.945
there's going to be homoerotic
jousting between Gilfoyle

00:16:29.945 --> 00:16:30.445
and Dinesh--

00:16:30.445 --> 00:16:30.945
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:30.945 --> 00:16:34.050
--and you sort of know
what's coming, and then--

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:36.046
KUMAIL NANJIANI: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:36.046 --> 00:16:37.740
ZACH WOODS: But
when you mix it up,

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:40.346
when there's internal
strife, or internal drama,

00:16:40.346 --> 00:16:41.970
it's nice because it
gives you a chance

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:43.884
to throw all those
dynamics up in the air

00:16:43.884 --> 00:16:46.050
and see where they land,
and I thought that was fun.

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:48.341
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: No one
doesn't play their character

00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:50.490
in that process, it's
just like those characters

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:53.010
get put in a slightly different
circumstance, which is nice.

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:54.040
ZACH WOODS: Yeah.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.550
KUMAIL NANJIANI: And
this season there's

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:58.794
a bit more of a civil
war aspect to it where--

00:16:58.794 --> 00:17:00.960
MARTIN STARR: It's actually
called "Silicon Valley--

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:01.320
colon--

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:01.885
Civil War."

00:17:01.885 --> 00:17:04.370
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Yeah,
I'm Captain America.

00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:04.869
Why?

00:17:04.869 --> 00:17:06.404
You have a problem with that?

00:17:06.404 --> 00:17:07.730
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Yes.

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:09.405
KUMAIL NANJIANI:
What's the problem?

00:17:09.405 --> 00:17:10.579
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Accent.

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:12.014
Just the accent.

00:17:12.014 --> 00:17:14.430
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Man, this is
what America looks like now.

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:15.834
Get used to it, Canadian.

00:17:15.834 --> 00:17:18.119
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:21.230
Yeah, there is divisions
within the group, as Thomas

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:23.780
was saying, and so the season--

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:27.619
It's fun to take sides
with different people

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:29.870
than you've done
before and we're

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:32.280
put in very heightened
different situations.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.820
So it's cool to see these
characters that we've

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.674
been with for three years--

00:17:36.674 --> 00:17:38.090
a new side of them
because they're

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.220
in a completely different
situation than they've

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.084
been in before.

00:17:41.084 --> 00:17:42.500
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
What do you admire

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.210
most about the characters
that you're portraying?

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:46.490
KUMAIL NANJIANI: That's
an interesting question.

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:47.540
You're doing a great job.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.800
These questions are great.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:49.560
Seriously.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.060
It's true.

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:51.143
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Thank you.

00:17:51.143 --> 00:17:54.592
AMANDA CREW: And she
can handle our jokes.

00:17:54.592 --> 00:17:55.300
Not everyone can.

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.730
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Keep
coming after the logo

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:58.271
though we're going
to have a problem.

00:17:58.271 --> 00:18:00.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:02.040
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:18:04.875 --> 00:18:07.710
KUMAIL NANJIANI: I admire
my character's resolve.

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.870
He gets defeated all the
time, but he's always

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:11.707
very optimistic.

00:18:11.707 --> 00:18:14.040
And he thinks like, you know
what, this next one's gonna

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.020
work, and he always
falls flat on his face,

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.180
but he keeps going.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.890
He's like Wile E.
Coyote kind of,

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:25.105
and I think that's a very
hopeful, optimistic way to be.

00:18:25.105 --> 00:18:30.060
ZACH WOODS: I think I
like Jared's reckless love

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:30.560
for Richard.

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:35.160
I like the idea of completely
unself-protective adoration,

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.280
maybe to a pathological
degree, but I

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.655
think I wish I could
do that more readily.

00:18:41.655 --> 00:18:44.530
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
I like, I guess

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:47.530
you could see it as a
negative trait about Richard--

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.810
I like the negatives more than
the positives in a character,

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:54.730
they're funner to play.

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:58.180
The tabs versus spaces thing
is the perfect encompassing

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:00.910
of that where a casual
statement is made,

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:04.660
and then Richard just is
like, tunnel vision, can't not

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:07.720
think about it, like, I'll
hang onto that one later.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:11.870
And it just bubbles in him
and, obviously, spews out

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:16.167
in all kinds of ways,
that sounded gross.

00:19:16.167 --> 00:19:18.250
KUMAIL NANJIANI: What do
you mean bubbles spew out

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:19.751
in all kinds of ways is gross?

00:19:19.751 --> 00:19:21.000
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Who knows?

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.820
But it's just fun to play.

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.900
It's something, just
from a character point,

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:28.630
and also comedically that
you can really latch onto.

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:29.305
Yeah.

00:19:29.305 --> 00:19:31.126
MARTIN STARR: Amander?

00:19:31.126 --> 00:19:35.290
AMANDA CREW: She's a
bad ass bitch, Monica.

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:36.570
She smokes, so she's cool.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.640
In a James Dean kind of way.

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:44.580
But no, I really love her heart.

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:47.280
Because in a world
where everyone's just

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.290
doing what's best
for their company

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:51.150
and making money and
moving their way up,

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:53.820
she really believes
in Richard and what

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:58.590
he's doing and sometimes does
things that don't benefit her,

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:00.420
but she knows is going
to help out Richard.

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:03.600
And I admire that.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.135
I admire that a lot.

00:20:06.135 --> 00:20:07.530
MARTIN STARR: I think.

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:10.910
Gilfoyle doesn't give a shit
what anybody else thinks

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:13.830
about him or otherwise.

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:15.150
That's an admirable trait.

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:18.042
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:21.665 --> 00:20:23.040
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
I would ask who's

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.790
most like their character, but
I think I just got my answer.

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:27.266
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:27.266 --> 00:20:29.700
MARTIN STARR: I'm in character
year round from the moment

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:29.820
we did--

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.810
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Very
method, very method.

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:34.240
You're getting ready
for Season 5 hopefully.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.920
This is random, but who holds
the "always blue" record?

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.670
Does anyone hold the
"always blue" record?

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.350
MARTIN STARR: There's a
rubber band in that thing.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:41.445
We tricked you all.

00:20:41.445 --> 00:20:43.495
KUMAIL NANJIANI: But
we did do it without--

00:20:43.495 --> 00:20:44.995
MARTIN STARR: We
did it originally--

00:20:44.995 --> 00:20:47.966
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Why that
came about is actually we were

00:20:47.966 --> 00:20:49.340
messing around in
between takes--

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:51.270
this is the very first
episode we ever shot--

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:55.260
messing around doing that game
and they put that into the--

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.840
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Mike was
like, just do that on camera.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.850
And it became a recurring thing.

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:03.090
It was literally us killing time
between takes goofing around.

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:04.525
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Yeah, that's
happened a couple of times--

00:21:04.525 --> 00:21:06.000
KUMAIL NANJIANI:
And then, I read

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.810
a thing that was this huge
thing on Reddit that was like,

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:11.680
this is what the "always
blue" means, it's

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.040
a thing about how when
you're making code

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.860
it could be red or blue.

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:18.500
And it's this whole thing and
people are like, oh my god,

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.040
that scene in the
show's so genius.

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:22.710
Meanwhile it's totally random.

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:25.840
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: It's us
being full-blown timewasting

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:26.340
jackasses.

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:26.880
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Yeah.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.830
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Oh,
the jacket is a thing

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:29.830
that they incorporated--

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:31.404
MARTIN STARR: Yeah, that's real.

00:21:31.404 --> 00:21:33.947
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: You get
downtime in between set ups

00:21:33.947 --> 00:21:36.030
and you have some time,
we all sit around and goof

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:37.890
off and the idea--

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:44.670
ZACH WOODS: We shoot the show
on a studio lot and Martin

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:47.630
got us these scooters,
these electric scooters,

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:49.365
and so we thought it would be--

00:21:49.365 --> 00:21:51.090
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: We called
ourselves "The Rude Boys"

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:51.180
because--

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:52.638
ZACH WOODS: "Rude
Boys On the Lot."

00:21:52.638 --> 00:21:55.380
We got these stupid jackets that
said, "Rude Boys On the Lot."

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.960
MARTIN STARR: And we were
going to be a biker gang

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.414
with these EcoReco electric--

00:21:59.414 --> 00:22:00.830
ZACH WOODS: Tiny
electric scooters

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:02.010
and our purple jackets.

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:03.410
DANA HAN-KLEIN: With
the dice on the back.

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:04.610
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Yeah,
they had dice on the back.

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:06.735
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: And so
we were all wearing them

00:22:06.735 --> 00:22:10.080
to the set thinking,
this is cool,

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.210
but we get this is silly also.

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:16.530
And next thing you know,
two episodes later Jared

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:18.870
walks in with that
Pied Piper jacket,

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:20.670
and we're like, oh,
touche, writers.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:27.705
You've called us and
raised us and we fold.

00:22:27.705 --> 00:22:30.230
KUMAIL NANJIANI: --a
lot stuff from our life

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:32.550
that ends up on the show.

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:34.300
The gold chain thing that I had?

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:36.302
That was from my life.

00:22:36.302 --> 00:22:38.760
In high school I was like, I'm
going to wear a silver chain

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:39.610
and I'll be cool.

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:42.193
And it's that thing, as soon as
you get to school you're like,

00:22:42.193 --> 00:22:44.535
oh no, this is horrible.

00:22:44.535 --> 00:22:47.340
ZACH WOODS: When Jared
speaks in German in his sleep

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:50.390
that actually has
some basis in reality,

00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:53.880
but I never speak in
German in my sleep.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.840
I guess, this is a little bit of
a strange thing to talk about,

00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:00.680
but I'm Jewish, I'm
from a Jewish family,

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.180
I have great respect
for my people.

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:06.900
But my freshman year
at college I woke up

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:10.380
one morning and my roommate was
like, hey, man, you all right?

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:13.120
And I was like, yeah,
what are talking about?

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.870
And he was like, I was up late
writing a paper last night

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:18.690
and you fell asleep, and then
in the middle of the night

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:23.190
you sat up and made eye
contact with me and went,

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:29.370
I hate the Jews, and
then went back to sleep.

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:31.110
We celebrated
Hanukkah every year,

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:33.450
my sister's studying
to be a rabbi.

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:36.600
I'd just like to reiterate,
not reflective of my waking

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.640
feelings about Judaism.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.980
But I told one of the
producers that, and then

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.070
he started yelling in
German in his sleep.

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:44.389
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Ha.

00:23:44.389 --> 00:23:45.805
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
That's terrifying.

00:23:45.805 --> 00:23:47.210
ZACH WOODS: It's scary.

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:47.840
Sorry.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.423
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
Well, don't worry.

00:23:49.423 --> 00:23:52.448
I mean, even Hitler didn't use
chemical weapons so you're OK.

00:23:52.448 --> 00:23:54.705
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:54.705 --> 00:23:57.330
DANA HAN-KLEIN: We'll take a few
audience questions in a second

00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:59.550
if anyone wants to line up.

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:01.750
I'd like to know, what's
the last game y'all played?

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:03.040
KUMAIL NANJIANI:
Like a video game?

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.310
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yeah,
like a video game or not--

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:05.445
KUMAIL NANJIANI:
I've played "Zelda."

00:24:05.445 --> 00:24:05.940
DANA HAN-KLEIN: OK.

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:08.481
KUMAIL NANJIANI: And I'm playing
a game called, "Horizon Zero

00:24:08.481 --> 00:24:10.766
Dawn" that I really love.

00:24:10.766 --> 00:24:13.460
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: I
found that as time goes on

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:16.460
I've been less about playing as
many games as possible and more

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:19.340
like, I got a couple of standbys
that if I have time I play.

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:22.010
I play this very
intricate flight

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:23.420
simulator called, "DCS"--

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.079
"Digital Combat
Simulator"-- where

00:24:25.079 --> 00:24:26.870
you don't press a button
to start up a jet,

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:28.245
you click all the
little buttons.

00:24:28.245 --> 00:24:32.780
And that's so my dream,
is a steep learning curve

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:34.210
where you have to study.

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:37.040
And this game called,
"Legends of Grimrock 2," which

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:37.760
is pretty fun.

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.662
I like those weird
obscure PC games.

00:24:40.662 --> 00:24:41.870
Amanda, what are you playing?

00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:43.625
AMANDA CREW: Oh,
so much solitaire.

00:24:43.625 --> 00:24:45.485
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:45.485 --> 00:24:47.897
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Anything
with 52 cards, I'm in.

00:24:47.897 --> 00:24:49.730
AMANDA CREW: I'm still
waiting for the cards

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:51.995
to completely cover
the screen when I win

00:24:51.995 --> 00:24:54.420
and it always misses
the one corner.

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:55.295
So I'm still playing.

00:24:55.295 --> 00:24:56.753
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
I've also found

00:24:56.753 --> 00:24:59.174
a pretty good pen-and-paper
group that I love playing.

00:24:59.174 --> 00:25:01.340
I like "D&amp;D" and "GURPS"
and all that kind of stuff.

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:02.210
AMANDA CREW: "Werewolf."

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:03.501
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: "Werewolf."

00:25:03.501 --> 00:25:05.120
I lead you guys in
a "Werewolf" game.

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.090
So I think, yeah, those
kind of things are good too.

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:09.955
AMANDA CREW: Zach,
what are you playing?

00:25:09.955 --> 00:25:12.700
ZACH WOODS: Doing a lot of
"Pride and Prejudice"-themed

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:13.330
word searches.

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:14.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:18.350
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: When
we started filming actually

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:20.975
and Kumail and I and Martin
were talking about video games

00:25:20.975 --> 00:25:23.600
and stuff, and we're like, Zach,
did you ever play video games?

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.790
He says, oh, well, I
remember one of the games

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:28.560
that I played as a
child, it was on some CD

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.265
and it was essentially
an interactive jazz game.

00:25:31.265 --> 00:25:33.560
ZACH WOODS: My first--
the only video game

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:37.160
I had when I was a kid was a
jazz video game where you just

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.810
wander through the
history of jazz.

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:40.365
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:40.365 --> 00:25:41.990
And you can't really
get points, you're

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:44.545
just a passive participant
as jazz happens.

00:25:44.545 --> 00:25:48.872
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: It was like
"Zork" meets a jazz museum.

00:25:48.872 --> 00:25:49.580
ZACH WOODS: Yeah.

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:52.310
You just walk into like, and
now you're in New Orleans,

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:54.740
and now you're in Chicago, and
oh, there's Billie Holiday.

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.156
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Click on
the picture to find out more.

00:25:57.156 --> 00:25:58.644
ZACH WOODS: Yeah.

00:25:58.644 --> 00:26:00.560
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: I
mean, what a dweebazoid.

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:01.600
ZACH WOODS: What a dweebazoid.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.995
Look at all these dweebazoids.

00:26:02.995 --> 00:26:04.820
AMANDA CREW: Martin,
what are you playing?

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:07.320
MARTIN STARR: I think the last
time I played video games was

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:11.500
probably playing "NBA 2K"
whatever with y'all boys,

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:12.377
and lady.

00:26:12.377 --> 00:26:13.210
You've never played.

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:14.754
AMANDA CREW: I didn't play.

00:26:14.754 --> 00:26:16.670
ZACH WOODS: Sometimes
they'll play video games

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:17.686
and I'll just sleep.

00:26:17.686 --> 00:26:19.435
And then we'll all go
to one trailer and--

00:26:19.435 --> 00:26:20.720
MARTIN STARR: He'll be
at our feet laying--

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.678
ZACH WOODS: Like a dog.

00:26:21.678 --> 00:26:23.370
[LAUGHS]

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:25.050
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Yeah.

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:25.835
Yeah.

00:26:25.835 --> 00:26:27.210
I could talk about
games forever,

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:28.150
but that's totally boring.

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:29.110
ZACH WOODS: Look at
all the questions.

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:30.109
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Waiting.

00:26:30.109 --> 00:26:31.870
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Sir, go ahead.

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:33.455
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Sir!

00:26:33.455 --> 00:26:35.080
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Sir,
what's your name?

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:35.880
AUDIENCE: Sergey.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.630
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Sergey,
nice to meet you.

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:38.640
ZACH WOODS: --so
they got it right.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.140
Yeah.

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:41.229
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Sir
Sergey, nice to meet you.

00:26:41.229 --> 00:26:42.270
AUDIENCE: You're welcome.

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:42.910
Yeah.

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:44.618
But I had a question,
what are your guys'

00:26:44.618 --> 00:26:46.350
real-life inspirations
in Silicon Valley?

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:48.430
What do you do actually
to get a real sense of--

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:49.788
ZACH WOODS: That's offensive.

00:26:49.788 --> 00:26:50.715
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:50.715 --> 00:26:51.715
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Sir!

00:26:51.715 --> 00:26:54.340
ZACH WOODS: That's offensive.

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:55.470
What's our inspirations?

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:59.200
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: You
know, I feel like a bad actor

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:03.670
when I say I didn't do
any character studies.

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:06.070
Essentially it's an
amalgamation of myself

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:09.475
and all the kids I went to LAN
parties with as a teenager.

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:14.500
I've picked up pieces here
and there throughout life.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.250
Although very recently, I met
[INAUDIBLE] Richard Hendricks

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:20.630
who talked 4,000 miles a
second and got immediately

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:22.630
into the weeds about
something that you're like,

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:24.680
I don't understand you at all.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.880
But I said to the
guy who introduced me

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.440
I was like, why didn't
I meet him before?

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.490
But, yeah, what about you guys?

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:33.980
MARTIN STARR: For me
it was on the page.

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:36.940
The character was
kind of a conversation

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:40.030
that happened after the
pilot had been written.

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:43.090
And I think an
evolution of the show

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:46.057
came when they found
Kumail and myself,

00:27:46.057 --> 00:27:47.140
and these side characters.

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:53.320
They hadn't really fleshed out
the full group off the jump.

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.870
That's a basketball term
because you start the game

00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:56.950
with the throw the ball--

00:27:56.950 --> 00:28:00.370
the referee throws the ball up,
and then two guys jump for it.

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:02.871
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Martin
Starr's a big Clippers fan, so

00:28:02.871 --> 00:28:03.370
watch out.

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:04.780
MARTIN STARR: You
guys, what do you--

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:05.695
KUMAIL NANJIANI:
They're Warrior fans.

00:28:05.695 --> 00:28:06.695
MARTIN STARR: --up here?

00:28:06.695 --> 00:28:09.240
KUMAIL NANJIANI: They've been
Warrior fans for two years.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.880
Their whole lives.

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.970
They have loved the
Warriors as far back

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:14.630
as they can remember, 2014.

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:16.869
MARTIN STARR: You
guys started winning

00:28:16.869 --> 00:28:17.910
and now you're all dicks.

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:20.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:22.180
Congrats.

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:25.970
So I think they've figured
it out as they went along.

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:29.770
But we were lucky to be a
part of the spawning of it.

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:34.085
And inspired them and
they inspired, clearly,

00:28:34.085 --> 00:28:35.710
the characters because
they wrote them.

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:37.130
But a lot of it was on the page.

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:39.740
ZACH WOODS: I kinda think
of it archetypically almost.

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:41.740
I watched some documentaries
and read some books

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:43.450
about Silicon Valley,
but I think of it

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:47.770
as a family where Erlich's kind
of the belligerent dad, Jared's

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:52.930
kind of the passive mom,
Tommy's like the favorite son.

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:55.630
I feel like Dinesh is
the baby, Gilfoyle's

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:59.280
the cat who kind of like--

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:03.289
Monica, I feel like is the
grown-up next door neighbor.

00:29:03.289 --> 00:29:03.830
I don't know.

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:04.590
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
Or the fun aunt.

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:05.350
ZACH WOODS: Yeah.

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:05.510
Yeah.

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:05.935
Like responsible.

00:29:05.935 --> 00:29:06.855
KUMAIL NANJIANI: But she smokes.

00:29:06.855 --> 00:29:07.480
ZACH WOODS: Yeah.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.445
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Yeah.

00:29:08.445 --> 00:29:09.695
AMANDA CREW: She's
a bad influence.

00:29:09.695 --> 00:29:10.240
ZACH WOODS: See?

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.823
I think of it more
like that, like how

00:29:11.823 --> 00:29:14.200
it fits into the family as
opposed to trying to draw

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.570
from a specific tech person.

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:18.775
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Amanda?

00:29:18.775 --> 00:29:20.960
AMANDA CREW: It's
on the page, man.

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.550
Mike and Alec, they
do the research,

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:25.040
they do all the hard work,
heavy lifting, we're puppets,

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.210
we just read what's on the page.

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:26.900
ZACH WOODS: Right.

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:28.358
KUMAIL NANJIANI:
Thank you, Sergey.

00:29:28.358 --> 00:29:30.086
ZACH WOODS: Thank you.

00:29:30.086 --> 00:29:32.872
KUMAIL NANJIANI: What are
you working on, Sergey?

00:29:32.872 --> 00:29:33.760
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
Do we have to sign--

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.560
AUDIENCE: I work in Business
Operations Strategy team.

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:36.160
KUMAIL NANJIANI: What is it?

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.960
AUDIENCE: Business
operations strategy.

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.061
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Cool.

00:29:39.061 --> 00:29:39.560
Good luck.

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:45.670
Hey, Sergey, fascinating.

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:47.290
I don't actually
know what that means.

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:49.660
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I work here and
I don't know what that means.

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:50.980
I don't know if that's a
good thing or a bad thing.

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:52.563
KUMAIL NANJIANI: He
doesn't work here.

00:29:52.563 --> 00:29:54.287
Nobody knows that guy.

00:29:54.287 --> 00:29:56.870
MARTIN STARR: And he got back
in line to ask another question.

00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:59.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:59.010 --> 00:29:59.510
Hi.

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:00.343
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Hi.

00:30:00.343 --> 00:30:00.991
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:30:00.991 --> 00:30:01.990
Thanks for coming today.

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:03.000
My question is, in your--

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:03.595
KUMAIL NANJIANI:
What's your name?

00:30:03.595 --> 00:30:04.385
AUDIENCE: My name is Connie.

00:30:04.385 --> 00:30:06.255
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Connie,
nice to meet you.

00:30:06.255 --> 00:30:07.890
AUDIENCE: When you
guys visit the area,

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:10.270
have you guys encountered
any ridiculous real-life

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:11.405
situations?

00:30:11.405 --> 00:30:12.483
MARTIN STARR: Yeah.

00:30:12.483 --> 00:30:12.982
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:12.982 --> 00:30:14.825
KUMAIL NANJIANI:
Sometimes you'll--

00:30:14.825 --> 00:30:16.825
AUDIENCE: Like in the
context of Silicon Valley.

00:30:16.825 --> 00:30:18.950
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Sometimes
you'll go to a screening

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:21.283
and you'll think it's going
to be a great movie theater,

00:30:21.283 --> 00:30:22.165
but it turns out--

00:30:22.165 --> 00:30:25.130
ZACH WOODS: It just looks like
a Radio Shack that just closed.

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:27.387
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Yeah, it's
like a closed Radio Shack

00:30:27.387 --> 00:30:29.470
and all of them staring
at the name of the company

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:32.260
that they work for.

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:34.750
ZACH WOODS: Once-- well, this
isn't an at Silicon Valley,

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:37.000
but there's a big Silicon
Valley contingent at South

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.490
by Southwest, and that's
where we premiered the show.

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:42.400
And I was eating in the
lobby of the hotel right

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:47.230
before a premiere and I heard
a guy, in earnestness say--

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:49.847
he was pitching his app and
he said to the other guy,

00:30:49.847 --> 00:30:51.430
he was sitting across
from, he's like,

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:54.070
it is like the Mahatma
Gandhi of apps.

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:58.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:03.520
To be fair, it was an app that
overthrew British imperialism.

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.520
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
Something along those lines,

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:09.070
when the first season-- we went
up to TechCrunch in New York

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:11.620
to help, I don't know, either,
I think it was just to promote

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:14.950
or something like, that, and a
guy comes up to me and T. J.,

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:16.810
who unbeknownst to
him, how would he know,

00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:21.409
we're quite militantly atheist,
and he goes, OK, you're

00:31:21.409 --> 00:31:22.450
from the show, OK, great.

00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:25.880
I've got this app that
like it prays for you.

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:27.790
And we're like, what?

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:32.572
I guess you select your religion
and it prays on your behalf?

00:31:32.572 --> 00:31:34.030
KUMAIL NANJIANI:
That sounds great.

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:36.160
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
And I just saw

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:40.090
T. J., who barely
keeps it together 24/7,

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:42.010
just like the fire like--

00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:43.400
and I was like, we gotta go!

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:44.900
You're gonna
eviscerate that boy.

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:46.780
ZACH WOODS: I hope
it's like Tinder where

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:49.990
they show you Jesus and you
have to go left or right.

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:54.340
Obviously, no photo of Muhammad,
but whatever the next one is.

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:58.490
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Right,
it's just a bright circle.

00:31:58.490 --> 00:32:00.850
That app, don't
choose your religion.

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:02.980
You should choose all
the other religions,

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:05.131
so you're covering your bases.

00:32:05.131 --> 00:32:05.630
So you do--

00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:06.850
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
Or just tick all.

00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:08.725
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Yeah,
just be like, whatever

00:32:08.725 --> 00:32:10.730
you got, some on that side.

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:12.490
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
I mean, if that ever

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:17.952
gave anyone peace of mind,
you're doing it wrong, I think.

00:32:17.952 --> 00:32:18.910
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Thanks.

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:20.602
We have time for
one last question.

00:32:20.602 --> 00:32:21.560
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Oh.

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:23.145
KUMAIL NANJIANI: But what
about all these people?

00:32:23.145 --> 00:32:24.977
ZACH WOODS: We could
just speed round.

00:32:24.977 --> 00:32:27.060
KUMAIL NANJIANI: They can
all four ask a question,

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:30.240
and then we'll answer all of
them and it'll be so great.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.420
So hi, just ask all your
questions really quickly.

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:33.000
ZACH WOODS: Yeah, real quick.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.083
AUDIENCE: My name is Lisa.

00:32:34.083 --> 00:32:35.040
I'm a game designer.

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:37.530
This is related to
a previous question.

00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:40.727
And I know a couple of you
guys have played "D&amp;D."

00:32:40.727 --> 00:32:43.060
I was wondering what kind of
tabletop games you're into?

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:45.420
KUMAIL NANJIANI: OK, and
then the next guy's question.

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:46.380
Lisa, what tabletop--

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:47.070
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: --questions?

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:48.000
KUMAIL NANJIANI: We're
going to get the questions,

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.180
then we're gonna answer
all of them together.

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:49.745
Go, dude.

00:32:49.745 --> 00:32:52.036
AUDIENCE: --just in line to
represent one of the people

00:32:52.036 --> 00:32:53.190
from your place, so--

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:54.231
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Get out.

00:32:54.231 --> 00:32:55.620
AUDIENCE: I'm kidding.

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:56.740
My question was--

00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:58.739
KUMAIL NANJIANI: What do
you mean from my place?

00:32:58.739 --> 00:32:59.358
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:59.358 --> 00:33:00.600
AUDIENCE: KGS, bro.

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:01.510
KGS.

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:02.525
KUMAIL NANJIANI: KGS!

00:33:02.525 --> 00:33:03.150
AUDIENCE: Whoo!

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:03.420
KUMAIL NANJIANI: No.

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:05.210
AUDIENCE: Bro, that's
why green and white.

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:07.470
KUMAIL NANJIANI: You really--
we went to the same high school,

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:07.830
he says.

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:08.680
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: In
Hachi Chachi Karachi?

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.030
AUDIENCE: About 10
years later though.

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:10.770
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Ten years?

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:11.542
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:11.542 --> 00:33:12.390
MARTIN STARR: Wow.

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:14.409
ZACH WOODS: Oh, shit!

00:33:14.409 --> 00:33:14.909
Oh!

00:33:14.909 --> 00:33:16.520
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
Damn, you old, son!

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:17.025
You old!

00:33:17.025 --> 00:33:18.005
ZACH WOODS: Shots fired!

00:33:18.005 --> 00:33:19.338
MARTIN STARR: Sit down, grandpa.

00:33:19.338 --> 00:33:21.410
KUMAIL NANJIANI:
Ah, ah, my back.

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:24.060
AUDIENCE: The question was,
an alternative search engine,

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:26.143
that you mentioned, you
know, you started using it

00:33:26.143 --> 00:33:27.780
and it caught your
computer on fire.

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:29.070
I used to work for
that before this

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:31.278
and I just want to make sure
I didn't write any bugs.

00:33:31.278 --> 00:33:32.835
Could you tell us
the repro steps?

00:33:32.835 --> 00:33:33.997
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:33.997 --> 00:33:35.080
KUMAIL NANJIANI: The what?

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:35.750
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Go fight him.

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:36.190
Just go fight him.

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:36.720
ZACH WOODS: All right.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:37.370
OK.

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:38.310
And last question.

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:38.850
What is it?

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.590
AUDIENCE: I don't know
if I can follow that.

00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:41.923
KUMAIL NANJIANI: --there's two--

00:33:41.923 --> 00:33:44.072
ZACH WOODS: You definitely
can. (LAUGHING) Yeah.

00:33:44.072 --> 00:33:45.613
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
just wanted to know

00:33:45.613 --> 00:33:47.910
about any more moments
of improv or something

00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:49.230
that someone said on-set.

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:51.982
Last moment scripting things
between just actors on the set

00:33:51.982 --> 00:33:54.190
and if they ended up in the
show and what those were.

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:54.810
KUMAIL NANJIANI: OK.

00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:55.175
ZACH WOODS: All right.

00:33:55.175 --> 00:33:55.965
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Is
that all the questions?

00:33:55.965 --> 00:33:56.880
ZACH WOODS: "D&amp;D" is first.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:57.552
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Wait, you have?

00:33:57.552 --> 00:33:59.257
AUDIENCE: Nope, I'm all good.

00:33:59.257 --> 00:34:00.090
KUMAIL NANJIANI: OK.

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:00.420
All right.

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:02.753
ZACH WOODS: We should also
get Sergey's second question.

00:34:02.753 --> 00:34:04.284
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:04.284 --> 00:34:06.540
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Business
and strategy development.

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:09.239
Look, he's sitting there like
a king like, I nailed it.

00:34:09.239 --> 00:34:11.252
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:11.252 --> 00:34:12.585
What tabletop games do you like?

00:34:12.585 --> 00:34:13.560
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
Oh, yeah, "D&amp;D,"

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:15.060
"GURPS," "Call of Cthulhu."

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:18.100
I like some board games
like "Mansions of Madness"

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:19.770
and that "Battle
for Westeros" game.

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:23.550
But as long as there's a
character sheet, some dice,

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:26.909
and your imagination,
I'm into it, yeah.

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:30.960
KUMAIL NANJIANI: The second
question was impenetrable.

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:32.409
He made fun of me being old.

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:34.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:34.945
Third question?

00:34:34.945 --> 00:34:36.108
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: (LAUGHING)

00:34:36.108 --> 00:34:37.691
MARTIN STARR: There
is improv, but I'd

00:34:37.691 --> 00:34:41.020
say 95% of what
you see on screen

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:44.860
is either the exact words
as they were written

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:47.020
or we've played with
them a little bit

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:52.030
to make them feel our own, or
feel fresh, from take-to-take.

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:55.389
There is a lot of
improvisation, but most of all

00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:56.909
it just keeps us happy.

00:34:56.909 --> 00:35:00.190
It keeps us fresh and enjoying
the experience because you

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:03.460
do it so many times, and
the writing is so good,

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:06.400
so you really want it to
feel fresh when you say it.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:10.570
And so we play around and
enjoy having fun and making

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:11.770
each other laugh.

00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:13.870
KUMAIL NANJIANI: They're
so good at writing for us

00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:15.910
that most of the stuff
that you guys might think

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:18.000
is improvised is all written.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.644
They're just great--

00:35:20.644 --> 00:35:22.810
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: The
improv approach to this show

00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:26.230
is less about recreating
the scene in "a better way,"

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:28.870
it's more so finding a
moment with the character.

00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:32.830
Or if we think a particular
joke on page is funny

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:34.570
we usually maybe go
on a tangent to see

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:37.570
if we can build on that
even if it just gets cut

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:40.600
or they pick one thing from it.

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:44.550
Yeah, it's more a beat, an
extra joke here and there,

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:48.910
but there's very few instances
where they come with a scene

00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:51.610
and be like, hey guys, help us.

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:54.880
MARTIN STARR: Although I will
say that a lot of the Zach

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:58.930
moments from season
1 and 2, especially,

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:03.850
guided the writers towards
this underlying sadness that

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:04.765
has become Jared.

00:36:04.765 --> 00:36:07.180
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Jared's
backstory of pure hell.

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:10.120
MARTIN STARR: When I was--
like all of the orphan improvs

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:11.770
in the first two
seasons were really--

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:13.494
or like how gaunt and
shadow-like he is--

00:36:13.494 --> 00:36:15.160
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
The wasting disease.

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:16.030
MARTIN STARR: --like a ghost.

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:16.270
Yeah.

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:18.103
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
Just a really freak of--

00:36:18.103 --> 00:36:19.945
KUMAIL NANJIANI:
Multiple foster families.

00:36:19.945 --> 00:36:21.340
ZACH WOODS: Yeah.

00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:22.900
Well, one thing that's nice is--

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:27.450
Alec Berg and Mike Judge who
are the guys who run the show--

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:30.520
Alec Berg wrote on Seinfeld--
ran Seinfeld for a while,

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:33.310
Mike Judge, obviously,
has this crazy resume.

00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:37.210
And they could be real auteurs
and kind of dictatorial

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:39.220
in the way that
they run the show,

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:41.890
but they could not
be less egoless,

00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:43.750
they are so collaborative.

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:45.490
And that's really,
I think, unusual.

00:36:45.490 --> 00:36:47.531
You hear all these stories
where people are like,

00:36:47.531 --> 00:36:50.890
it has to be to the
syllable, and those guys

00:36:50.890 --> 00:36:54.110
it's just best idea wins
and usually the best idea's

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:55.750
their idea.

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:59.596
But you never feel like you're
under foot or something.

00:36:59.596 --> 00:37:00.345
I think it's good.

00:37:00.345 --> 00:37:01.900
MARTIN STARR: And I remember
when we were doing the pilot,

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:03.280
I forget what the
exact line was,

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:06.250
but I was saying
something a particular way

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:09.420
and it wasn't how it was
written and Mike came up to me

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:12.610
and said, hey,
could you say this?

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:14.585
And I said it in front
of him back to him

00:37:14.585 --> 00:37:16.960
and I was like, oh, yeah,
that's way better than whatever

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.450
the fuck I was doing
that was like fucking up

00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:21.445
what you had written perfectly.

00:37:21.445 --> 00:37:23.102
AMANDA CREW: And
then he beat you.

00:37:23.102 --> 00:37:25.300
MARTIN STARR: Then he
took his belt off and he--

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:26.272
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:26.272 --> 00:37:28.650
ZACH WOODS: It's a very
corporal punishment heavy set.

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:30.900
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH: Yeah,
yeah, we run it like a ship.

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:31.775
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yeah.

00:37:31.775 --> 00:37:35.052
KUMAIL NANJIANI: I feel bad,
Mr. KGS, what's your name?

00:37:35.052 --> 00:37:36.010
I didn't ask your name.

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:36.676
AUDIENCE: Usman.

00:37:36.676 --> 00:37:38.090
KUMAIL NANJIANI: Usman.

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:38.590
Right.

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:38.811
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:38.811 --> 00:37:40.805
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Look
him up in a yearbook.

00:37:40.805 --> 00:37:42.680
KUMAIL NANJIANI: I was
like, maybe he's lying

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.900
and I was like, nope,
that's a pretty deep cut.

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:47.279
THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH:
(LAUGHING) Deep cut.

00:37:47.279 --> 00:37:49.320
DANA HAN-KLEIN: My very
last question for you is,

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:51.580
pie-in-the-sky, unlimited
time, resources, whatever,

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:53.830
what project or role would
you like to explore outside

00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:55.496
of the one you have
on "Silicon Valley"?

00:37:55.496 --> 00:37:57.430
KUMAIL NANJIANI: I want
to be Captain America.

00:37:57.430 --> 00:38:00.190
I truly think we're ready.

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:01.750
Put me in, it's
not like President.

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:04.840
I don't gotta be born here
to be Captain America.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.820
This is what it's like.

00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:09.145
Just like a tiny
Pakistani Captain America.

00:38:09.145 --> 00:38:11.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:14.402
Thank you so much.
