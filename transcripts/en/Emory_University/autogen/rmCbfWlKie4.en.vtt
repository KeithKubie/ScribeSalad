perfusion really means blood flow to the

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280
perfusion really means blood flow to the
 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.190
perfusion really means blood flow to the
muscle of the heart and so we have

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200
muscle of the heart and so we have
 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.249
muscle of the heart and so we have

issues like should we even use computers

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790
issues like should we even use computers
 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.940
issues like should we even use computers
in medicine being part of a whole

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950
in medicine being part of a whole
 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.970

movement of trying to

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980
movement of trying to
 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.830
movement of trying to
make physicians understand that we need

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840
make physicians understand that we need
 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.339
make physicians understand that we need
to objectify the diagnostic process

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349
to objectify the diagnostic process
 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.630
to objectify the diagnostic process
software was giving away for free at the

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640
software was giving away for free at the
 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.420
software was giving away for free at the
time and so they had to be an

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430
time and so they had to be an
 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.979
time and so they had to be an
understanding that for for these tools

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989
understanding that for for these tools
 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.800
understanding that for for these tools
to move forward the people would have to

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810
to move forward the people would have to
 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.000
to move forward the people would have to
pay for them and which then took quite a

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010
pay for them and which then took quite a
 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.339
pay for them and which then took quite a
bit to convince companies to

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349
bit to convince companies to
 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.190
bit to convince companies to
commercialize it in to charge for it so

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200
commercialize it in to charge for it so
 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.050
commercialize it in to charge for it so
that's not the commercial aspect but

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060
that's not the commercial aspect but
 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.640
that's not the commercial aspect but
really we thought the commercial aspect

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650
really we thought the commercial aspect
 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.460
really we thought the commercial aspect
it's just like a drug it would not exist

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470
it's just like a drug it would not exist
 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.050
it's just like a drug it would not exist
and and so what promoted me to innovate

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060
and and so what promoted me to innovate
 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.309
and and so what promoted me to innovate
is basically the fact that realizing

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319
is basically the fact that realizing
 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.369
is basically the fact that realizing
that this could help and it does help

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379
that this could help and it does help
 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:13.069
that this could help and it does help
the diagnostic process that why not that

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079
the diagnostic process that why not that
 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:14.930
the diagnostic process that why not that
can the beautiful computers is that once

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940
can the beautiful computers is that once
 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.849
can the beautiful computers is that once
you have the software it can be run

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859
you have the software it can be run
 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.610
you have the software it can be run
anywhere and it could help people in

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620
anywhere and it could help people in
 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.220
anywhere and it could help people in
other places and not only for example at

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230
other places and not only for example at
 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.120
other places and not only for example at
Emory we have great physicians and still

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130
Emory we have great physicians and still
 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.849
Emory we have great physicians and still
the computer helps them with the

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859
the computer helps them with the
 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.120
the computer helps them with the
objective fala diagnostic process but in

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130
objective fala diagnostic process but in
 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.830
objective fala diagnostic process but in
other places where they have less

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840
other places where they have less
 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.920
other places where they have less
training on the specific techniques the

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930
training on the specific techniques the
 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.500
training on the specific techniques the
computer is even more helpful the most

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510
computer is even more helpful the most
 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.530
computer is even more helpful the most
important one is the one that quantifies

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540
important one is the one that quantifies
 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.300
important one is the one that quantifies
myocardial perfusion and what this does

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310
myocardial perfusion and what this does
 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.059
myocardial perfusion and what this does
is it looks at a large database of

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069
is it looks at a large database of
 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.819
is it looks at a large database of
patients both patients that were found

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829
patients both patients that were found
 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.559
patients both patients that were found
to be normal and patients to be found to

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569
to be normal and patients to be found to
 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.080
to be normal and patients to be found to
be abnormal and statistically looks at

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090
be abnormal and statistically looks at
 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.199
be abnormal and statistically looks at
the images and compares them to this

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209
the images and compares them to this
 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.559
the images and compares them to this
files to add to to flag whether this

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569
files to add to to flag whether this
 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.330
files to add to to flag whether this
particular patient or this particular

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340
particular patient or this particular
 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.170
particular patient or this particular
heart in a particular region is it's

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180
heart in a particular region is it's
 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.839
heart in a particular region is it's
lacking blood flow either doing exercise

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849
lacking blood flow either doing exercise
 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.050
lacking blood flow either doing exercise
or doing rest and then comparing one to

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060
or doing rest and then comparing one to
 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.300
or doing rest and then comparing one to
the other the other tools are related to

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310
the other the other tools are related to
 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.310
the other the other tools are related to
measuring the function of the left

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320
measuring the function of the left
 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.469
measuring the function of the left
ventricle so the left ventricle is the

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479
ventricle so the left ventricle is the
 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.000
ventricle so the left ventricle is the
main part of the heart that pumps blood

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010
main part of the heart that pumps blood
 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.430
main part of the heart that pumps blood
to the rest of the body so how well it

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440
to the rest of the body so how well it
 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.960
to the rest of the body so how well it
works as a pump I think really

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970
works as a pump I think really
 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.890
works as a pump I think really
incredibly important as to the status of

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900
incredibly important as to the status of
 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.300
incredibly important as to the status of
the disease and

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310
the disease and
 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.580
the disease and
and so again it's an objective number

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590
and so again it's an objective number
 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.560
and so again it's an objective number
and this is also measure from the same

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570
and this is also measure from the same
 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.890
and this is also measure from the same
study so from the same study we we were

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900
study so from the same study we we were
 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.130
study so from the same study we we were
able to measure many different things

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140
able to measure many different things
 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.580
able to measure many different things
from the beginning I realized that I

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590
from the beginning I realized that I
 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.800
from the beginning I realized that I
wanted to develop something that it

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810
wanted to develop something that it
 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.540
wanted to develop something that it
would be used in patients in other words

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550
would be used in patients in other words
 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.960
would be used in patients in other words
that it would be really frustrating to

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970
that it would be really frustrating to
 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.750
that it would be really frustrating to
come up with good tools that would only

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760
come up with good tools that would only
 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.650
come up with good tools that would only
