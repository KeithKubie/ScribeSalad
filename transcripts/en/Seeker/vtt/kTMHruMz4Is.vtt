00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:08.610
Science doesn’t lie, but scientists… that’s
a different story.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.260
Hi guys, Lissette here for DNews. The American
Statistical Association recently released

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.650
a statement reminding scientists what the
P value stands for… along with six guiding

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.240
principles on what determines statistical
significance. Why? Because scientists and

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.820
organizations might be gaming the system to
get results published, get funding, or generally

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.550
advance their career. But before we get into
that, let’s explain what they’re messing

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.280
with -- the thing called the P Value.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.940
It all has to do with how scientific experiments
work. As you know, many studies use a control

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.230
group and an experimental group. The experimental
group gets a pill, treatment, or some other

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.109
thing that scientists want to know more about
whereas the control group does not - it’s

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:54.819
just there as a comparison. This is where
the P value comes in. It helps us determine

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:59.469
whether any differences found between the
two groups are due to random chance, sampling

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.920
error, or the actual thing the scientists
were testing.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.380
The p-value is the probability that you would
get the observed results (or something more

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.509
extreme) if there is no real difference between
groups. It ranges from 0-1, and the general

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.200
rule seems to be that the lower the P value,
the better.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.200
Hypothetically, getting a P Value of 1 would
mean the results are definitely based on something

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.280
other than what you’re testing. A P Value
of 0 would be the results are definitely based

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.420
on what you’re testing. But these are the
extremes and generally not seen in studies;

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.660
In practice, anything less than .05 is considered
statistically significant.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.040
The problem is there is an overemphasis on
P values. The American Statistical Association

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.409
put out the statement clarifying the P value
because as the ASA’s executive director,

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.090
Ron Wasserstein remarks, "The p-value was
never intended to be a substitute for scientific

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.380
reasoning."

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.420
This is a big deal because it’s having serious
consequences in our knowledge and understanding.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.009
It means we might be neglecting important
and crucial areas of research. In practice,

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.440
it could mean we have a decreased understanding
of the true effect of a treatment or medication...

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.050
Because the overemphasis on P value often
leads to the neglect of other information

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.250
in studies - such as effect size.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.830
If you're a drug manufacturer and you have
a hair growth drug that you want to market.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.460
You conduct a study, and it comes up with
a P value of .05. Great. It means that there

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.970
is a small probability that an outside force
was responsible for the hair growth. So you’ll

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.090
buy that pill, right?

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.580
But hold on. What was ignored was the effect
size. What the P value is not telling us is

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.160
that those bald guys only grew 2 hairs and
not a full, luscious mane. So, technically,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.630
they’re still bald. This is part of the
problem. We shouldn’t be putting all our

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.860
faith in this one number. But scientists often
are, so much so that they might be skewing

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.880
their experiments to get lower Ps.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.950
Just like teachers teach to the test, scientists
design experiments to get the lowest possible

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:06.020
P at the expense of solid scientific reasoning
and investigation. Or after their experiment

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.450
is conducted, they select the specific analysis
methods that are more likely to lead to statistically

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.910
significant results and/or cherry pick which
results to include or leave out.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.690
So, why are scientists doing this? Well, that,
of course, cannot be answered with certainty;

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.500
but, it is telling that statistically significant
effects are much more likely to be published.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.250
Researchers Sullivan and Feinn found that
the number of studies published that contain

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:38.190
P values in their abstracts has doubled from
1990 to 2014, and of those studies that included

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:46.750
a P value, 96% were below .05. Getting published
can play a huge role in career advancement...in

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.501
the halls of academia, it’s either “Publish
or Perish.” So the Association’s recent

00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:56.020
statement is more than just about statistical
analysis - more than just about reproducibility

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.680
and replication. It’s about how and what
the scientific community values, redefining

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.510
these and moving away from a binary system
of statistical significance to one that views

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.250
evidence on a continuum.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.510
But, this is just one way that science is
failing us. Check out Dr. Kiki Sanford’s
