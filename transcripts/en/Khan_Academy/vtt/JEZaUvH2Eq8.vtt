00:00:00.644 --> 00:00:01.619
- [Voiceover] Which of the following

00:00:01.619 --> 00:00:05.215
is equivalent to the
complex number shown above?

00:00:05.215 --> 00:00:08.364
We have one, plus i, plus i
squared, plus i to the third,

00:00:08.364 --> 00:00:10.721
plus i to the fourth, plus i to the fifth.

00:00:10.721 --> 00:00:13.009
And they remind us, note: i is equal

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.215
to the square root of negative one.

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:16.922
And if i is equal to the
square root of negative one,

00:00:16.922 --> 00:00:19.503
that of course means that i squared

00:00:19.503 --> 00:00:22.733
is equal to negative one.

00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.216
Now, what I'm about to do is a review,

00:00:24.216 --> 00:00:26.816
and if all of this is
completely unfamiliar to you,

00:00:26.816 --> 00:00:29.732
I encourage you to look up the videos on

00:00:29.732 --> 00:00:32.393
i and imaginary numbers on Khan Academy.

00:00:32.393 --> 00:00:33.633
And on complex numbers.

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:34.710
But I'll give a quick review.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.335
If i squared, well let's just think about

00:00:36.335 --> 00:00:38.427
the different powers of i.

00:00:38.427 --> 00:00:40.662
So, what's i to the first power?

00:00:40.662 --> 00:00:41.679
Well, anything to the first power

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:44.441
is just going to be itself.

00:00:44.441 --> 00:00:46.634
So, that's just going to be i.

00:00:46.634 --> 00:00:49.052
What's i to the second power?

00:00:49.052 --> 00:00:50.698
Well, we just saw that, i squared

00:00:50.698 --> 00:00:52.079
is going to be negative one.

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.806
That's the definition of i.

00:00:53.806 --> 00:00:55.289
Or, some people define it that way.

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.575
Some people would say i is equal

00:00:56.575 --> 00:00:58.255
to the square root of negative one.

00:00:58.255 --> 00:01:00.895
Now what's i to the
third power going to be?

00:01:00.895 --> 00:01:03.414
Well, that's going to be i
to the second power times i.

00:01:03.414 --> 00:01:05.608
It's going to be i times i times i.

00:01:05.608 --> 00:01:06.482
We could write it that way.

00:01:06.482 --> 00:01:09.794
i times i times i.

00:01:09.794 --> 00:01:12.924
Well, i times i, this right
over here, is negative one.

00:01:12.924 --> 00:01:14.549
Negative one times i,

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.697
this is going to be equal to negative i.

00:01:17.697 --> 00:01:20.216
Now, what's i to the fourth power?

00:01:20.216 --> 00:01:24.808
Well, it's going to be i
to the third power times i.

00:01:24.808 --> 00:01:27.848
Well, i to the third power is negative i.

00:01:27.848 --> 00:01:30.693
And then you multiply that times i.

00:01:30.693 --> 00:01:33.070
Well, that's going to be the
same thing as the negative,

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.070
we can do this as a negative
one times i, times i.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.795
Well, what's i times i?

00:01:39.795 --> 00:01:41.156
That's negative one.

00:01:41.156 --> 00:01:42.741
So, it's gonna be the
negative negative one,

00:01:42.741 --> 00:01:44.935
that's gonna be positive one.

00:01:44.935 --> 00:01:47.962
And so, what's gonna be
i to the fifth power?

00:01:47.962 --> 00:01:49.974
Well, that's gonna be
i to the fourth power

00:01:49.974 --> 00:01:52.960
times another i.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.513
Well, i to the fourth power
we just saw, is just one,

00:01:55.513 --> 00:02:00.137
times i, is equal to i.

00:02:00.137 --> 00:02:01.131
And we can keep going.

00:02:01.131 --> 00:02:02.310
And this is one of the fun things

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.951
about the imaginary unit i,

00:02:04.951 --> 00:02:07.898
is that we see this cycle
as we increase the exponent.

00:02:07.898 --> 00:02:10.721
We do a bunch of examples
of this on Khan Academy.

00:02:10.721 --> 00:02:13.038
But we've gotten all the
powers that we care about.

00:02:13.038 --> 00:02:17.285
So, one plus i, i squared,
this is negative one.

00:02:17.285 --> 00:02:20.290
i to the third is negative i.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.753
Negative i.

00:02:21.753 --> 00:02:23.785
i to the fourth is one.

00:02:23.785 --> 00:02:25.390
i to the fourth is one.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.869
And then i to the fifth is i.

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:29.414
This is i.

00:02:29.414 --> 00:02:32.013
All right, so we have one minus one.

00:02:32.013 --> 00:02:34.858
So this and this are going to cancel out.

00:02:34.858 --> 00:02:38.535
Then we have an i and a negative i.

00:02:38.535 --> 00:02:41.136
So, i minus i, that's gonna be zero.

00:02:41.136 --> 00:02:44.408
And all we're left with is one plus an i.

00:02:44.408 --> 00:02:47.644
So that's this choice right over there.
