00:00:01.446 --> 00:00:06.760
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.260
ANDREW: OK, so
you're now looking

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.102
at a terminal that's in the
root directory of the project,

00:00:12.102 --> 00:00:13.560
and you know how
to publish things.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.810
I do not, so I'm actually--
this is-- sidebar,

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.297
I'm going to be learning, too.

00:00:17.297 --> 00:00:19.130
EMILY: I'm going to
post on Andrew's behalf.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.671
ANDREW: Yeah.

00:00:19.671 --> 00:00:23.950
[LAUGHS] Because I'm ignorant.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.439
EMILY: No, it's
going to be-- it's

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.730
going to be really complicated.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.740
Get ready.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:37.277
So we're going to do flutter
packages pub publish.

00:00:37.277 --> 00:00:39.110
And, actually, there's
an east egg in there.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.930
If you do "pub lish,"
that should also work.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.580
ANDREW: [SNORTS] [LAUGHS]

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.930
EMILY: Because
we're fun like that.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.440
OK, so publish, and then
we'll do dry run, just

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.335
to make sure there's nothing--

00:00:51.335 --> 00:00:54.440
ANDREW: I like a nice dry
run, yeah, that's nice.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.730
EMILY: OK, so that's our--

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.967
we're seeing the
outline of this thing.

00:00:57.967 --> 00:00:59.050
And we have some problems.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:00:59.670
ANDREW: Uh-oh.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.170
EMILY: OK.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.730
So let's see.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.675
We need to have
a upper publish--

00:01:04.675 --> 00:01:05.591
or published packages.

00:01:05.591 --> 00:01:09.270
We have an upper bound
constraint for SDK.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.275
We can add that in our
little pubspec.yaml.

00:01:12.275 --> 00:01:13.225
ANDREW: Mhm.

00:01:13.225 --> 00:01:17.714
EMILY: And then we
have some suggestions.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.630
"package doesn't depend
on barometer_example."

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.494
Well, yeah.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.360
Have we implemented--

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.180
ANDREW: We've
implemented no tests.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.400
EMILY: OK.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.730
Let's just take--

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:38.655
ANDREW: Just remove?

00:01:38.655 --> 00:01:40.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.320
EMILY: Yup.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.299
Excellent engineering
practices in action.

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.340
ANDREW: Yeah, I mean I
ran it once and it worked.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.490
What tests do we need really?

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.130
EMILY: Yeah.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.700
OK, so let us go
back to the studio,

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:01.010
and here's a less, like,
horrible way of doing this.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.210
Let's just comment it out.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.920
ANDREW: OK.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.100
EMILY: Oh wait.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.558
But we still have
to do this thing.

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:06.130
Ugh.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.919
OK, maybe we do need to--

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.480
it's probably going to be--

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.830
so I will say, when
you publish things,

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.210
there's also a
package scoring system

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.980
so that you can see how--

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.250
ANDREW: Oh yeah, do you want
to show the pub website just

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.104
so people know what
we're talking about?

00:02:24.104 --> 00:02:24.770
EMILY: OK, yeah.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.230
So Flutter pub.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.630
So there's Flutter packages,
and there's also Dart packages,

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.579
because this is just
the Dart ecosystem.

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.620
You can specify whether
you want Flutter-specific

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.380
packages, or web, or anything.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.590
And there are a whole
bunch of packages.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.630
For example, here's good
old Cupertino Icons.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.820
ANDREW: Yeah, many of
which we're already using.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.530
EMILY: And what do you know?

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.210
It is written by
the Flutter team.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.946
ANDREW: Oh yeah, Xiao.

00:02:51.946 --> 00:02:54.830
EMILY: And so there
are a chunk of packages

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.280
that are written by us.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.760
And oh, here's the
score right here--

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.705
score of 100.

00:02:59.705 --> 00:03:01.350
ANDREW: Oh, I didn't know
you could get a breakdown.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.880
EMILY: Yeah.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.950
So it's based on how
popular-- are people using it?

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.520
Because you could write
the most beautiful,

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.560
well-tested package,
but if it's not useful?

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.530
ANDREW: Then nobody can, yeah.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.730
EMILY: Health is involved--
like, how frequently are you

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:17.670
updating it?

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.420
And also it does some,
presumably, code analysis

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.070
of like, are you writing
good style Dart code?

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.010
Or are you adding tests?

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.010
ANDREW: Generating hundreds
of warnings any time

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.160
it is compiled.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.130
EMILY: And
maintenance-- oh, maybe

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.836
that's part of,
actually, the errors.

00:03:32.836 --> 00:03:33.710
ANDREW: Oh, tidiness.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:34.670
EMILY: Yes.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.350
And I will say, so by design
these are a little bit general,

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.900
because we don't want
people to game the system.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.150
So it's just like
these high-level things

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.550
that you-- you want to have
published packages that

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.430
have good style code,
but we're not saying it's

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.080
this metric, because then
people could game the system.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.460
So that package
has 100 of a score.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.701
It's between 0 and 100,
so 100 is the best.

00:04:01.701 --> 00:04:03.825
Obviously all of these are
going to be really high.

00:04:03.825 --> 00:04:06.380
I can show you a package that
I wrote that does not have 100.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.379
ANDREW: Oh, there we go.

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:08.300
EMILY: Let's see.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.050
What is it called?

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.095
It's called coverflow, I think.

00:04:15.194 --> 00:04:17.154
Simple_coverflow,
that's the one.

00:04:17.154 --> 00:04:19.420
ANDREW: Oh, it's all
the way down at 91.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.579
EMILY: OK, well, yeah.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:22.675
All right, so that's one.

00:04:22.675 --> 00:04:24.830
ANDREW: Is your
tidiness not up to par?

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:25.520
EMILY: Yeah.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.770
I'm actually curious.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.550
I don't know if
I've looked at why.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.355
Oh, popular.

00:04:29.355 --> 00:04:30.370
ANDREW: Popularity
is killing you.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.320
EMILY: We can't all be
very popular, oh well.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.020
Anyway, so those are the things.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.060
And so this back here
is doing a dry run

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.860
to see if we have these things.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:43.825
As we had this long--

00:04:46.464 --> 00:04:47.255
ANDREW: Digression?

00:04:47.255 --> 00:04:51.734
EMILY: Digression,
basically that

00:04:51.734 --> 00:04:53.900
was a long way to say that
if we take out this test,

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.220
it will probably get a
low popularity score,

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.300
but we can deal with that.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.146
ANDREW: OK.

00:04:59.146 --> 00:05:01.334
EMILY: So I've taken
out these tests.

00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:02.250
Let's do another dry--

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.550
ANDREW: Were there
two sets of tests?

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:04.716
EMILY: Oh, no, just the one.

00:05:04.716 --> 00:05:05.680
I just copied that.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.180
ANDREW: OK.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.826
EMILY: Or I commented out.

00:05:07.826 --> 00:05:10.075
ANDREW: I was thinking the
example might have had one.

00:05:10.075 --> 00:05:10.970
EMILY: Ah, you're right.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:11.560
ANDREW: And the plugin
itself might have

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.852
had one, although I don't know.

00:05:12.852 --> 00:05:13.685
EMILY: You're right.

00:05:13.685 --> 00:05:15.400
This is in the
example directory,

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.140
so maybe it's not
even this test.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.640
ANDREW: No, you're
in example there.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.520
No, you were right.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.210
But I think if we scrolled
down below lib here,

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.520
maybe there's another--

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.130
no?

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.978
EMILY: It doesn't look like it.

00:05:28.978 --> 00:05:30.364
ANDREW: What am I thinking?

00:05:30.364 --> 00:05:34.845
EMILY: I mean, this did say it
was example test, so I think.

00:05:34.845 --> 00:05:35.720
ANDREW: You're right.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.580
I'm getting confused.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:37.150
EMILY: So I think
it's still going

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.100
to complain about the
upper bound constraint,

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.714
but I think everything
else should be OK.

00:05:41.714 --> 00:05:42.880
And then we can go add that.

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:47.150
Oh, look at that.

00:05:50.272 --> 00:05:51.030
OK, example test.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.530
ANDREW: Oh, we're
not using anything

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.088
involving tests anymore.

00:05:56.088 --> 00:05:56.670
EMILY: Oh.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.350
ANDREW: So you take
out the import.

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.850
EMILY: OK.

00:06:01.897 --> 00:06:02.730
ANDREW: There we go.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:16.420
EMILY: OK, so now we need
to add our SDK constraint.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:21.900
And OK, so in that we're
going to open our pubspec.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.290
And so this is just
information about the plugin.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.724
So we actually don't want
to use this constraint,

00:06:35.724 --> 00:06:37.890
because we want to say that
it's valid for Dart 2.0.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:41.800
But I'm just copying it
to have a starting point.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.568
Oh wait, in environment.

00:06:43.568 --> 00:06:45.858
So do we have an environment?

00:06:45.858 --> 00:06:48.150
No, we don't.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:54.650
I believe we put this under--

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.910
ANDREW: You can always
look at coverflow.

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.275
EMILY: Oh, good call.

00:06:58.275 --> 00:07:01.190
What did past Emily do?

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:02.650
ANDREW: Past Emily
got things done.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.391
That's what she did.

00:07:04.391 --> 00:07:06.050
EMILY: Past Emily
knew how to do this.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.740
ANDREW: [LAUGHS] There it is.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.100
EMILY: All right, so yeah.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.522
It's just a standalone thing.

00:07:14.522 --> 00:07:16.382
We'll just copy that.

00:07:16.382 --> 00:07:18.090
That looks like good
version constraints.

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:19.560
ANDREW: Yeah, piece of cake.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.520
EMILY: Good job, past Emily.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.354
OK, so now let's
try a dry run again.

00:07:30.354 --> 00:07:32.270
ANDREW: What will it
yell at us for this time?

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.930
EMILY: Will it say
we're good to go?

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:38.500
ANDREW: [GASP]
Author and homepage.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.620
EMILY: OK.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:44.415
All right, so author,
Andrew Brogdon.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:50.015
ANDREW: You transposed
the D and the G.

00:07:50.015 --> 00:07:50.890
EMILY: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:51.585
ANDREW: It's OK.

00:07:51.585 --> 00:07:52.710
EMILY: I said it correctly.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:54.379
ANDREW: You did.

00:07:54.379 --> 00:07:55.420
Sometimes I get confused.

00:07:58.264 --> 00:07:59.212
EMILY: This is very--

00:07:59.212 --> 00:08:01.110
ANDREW: Sometimes.

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:02.460
EMILY: There you go.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.572
All right.

00:08:03.572 --> 00:08:05.030
ANDREW: A plethora
of contributors.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:05.650
EMILY: Yes.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:06.989
And homepage.

00:08:06.989 --> 00:08:08.280
Yeah, let's just do Flutter.io.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.340
ANDREW: Pick Flutter.io for now.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:14.315
EMILY: OK All right,
I think that's all.

00:08:14.315 --> 00:08:15.420
Let's try that again.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.295
I actually wonder what
I put for my homepage.

00:08:17.295 --> 00:08:18.320
ANDREW: I don't know.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.320
EMILY: I don't remember.

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.521
Your pubspec-- oh, jeez.

00:08:26.521 --> 00:08:27.020
Really?

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.019
OK, we need to fix this.

00:08:28.019 --> 00:08:29.350
This is a bug.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.493
I'm going to file a
bug report after this.

00:08:31.493 --> 00:08:32.159
Come on, people.

00:08:34.892 --> 00:08:37.350
ANDREW: It's going to give
out-- we didn't-- you didn't fix

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.730
the email one that
was right below it.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:39.646
There was another one.

00:08:39.646 --> 00:08:42.320
EMILY: Oh, OK.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.342
ANDREW: Name, bracket, email.

00:08:44.342 --> 00:08:45.490
EMILY: Oh my gosh.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:46.610
ANDREW: Is it an array?

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:47.900
Could you put in an array of?

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.295
EMILY: OK, I can do my quirky--

00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:51.885
ANDREW: [LAUGHS]

00:08:55.621 --> 00:08:56.795
EMILY: Yeah?

00:08:56.795 --> 00:08:58.240
Oh, I did it again.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.250
I misspelled.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:00.680
It's like I can't-- there we go.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.930
ANDREW: You just did it again.

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:02.722
EMILY: There we go.

00:09:02.722 --> 00:09:05.221
ANDREW: I'm getting flashbacks
to my high school graduation.

00:09:05.221 --> 00:09:06.440
EMILY: Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.960
OK.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:08.800
Yes.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.175
ANDREW: OK, let's
try this again.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:18.719
EMILY: OK, are we ready?

00:09:18.719 --> 00:09:19.260
ANDREW: Sure.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.721
EMILY: Zero warnings.

00:09:20.721 --> 00:09:21.220
Get ready.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:28.330
ANDREW: [LAUGHS] We're going
live with our moderately useful

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:29.540
plugin.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:30.680
Didn't--

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.420
EMILY: Oh yeah.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:32.320
Are we ready?

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.160
ANDREW: We're ready.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.924
Let's turn both
the keys at once.

00:09:34.924 --> 00:09:36.580
[LAUGHS]

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.630
EMILY: Waiting for
your authoriz-- oh yes.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:39.130
Oh great.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:40.210
I wonder if we actually--

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:41.640
ANDREW: Whoa, so
there's like a--

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:47.185
EMILY: So this is showing
that you are actually

00:09:47.185 --> 00:09:48.370
uploading every half.

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:48.870
So now--

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:49.700
ANDREW: Oh wow.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.371
EMILY: We might not
show this on the--

00:09:51.371 --> 00:09:52.870
ANDREW: Yeah, we
might actually take

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.800
the rare step of blurring
something out here,

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:55.840
which we don't normally do.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.240
EMILY: Go log in.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.365
I don't know your password.

00:09:57.365 --> 00:09:59.860
But meanwhile, we
can talk about--

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:00.451
look.

00:10:00.451 --> 00:10:02.200
ANDREW: Yeah, let's
talk about-- everybody

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.116
pay attention to Dash.

00:10:03.116 --> 00:10:04.240
EMILY: Dash is here.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.720
We have a guest appearance.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:15.104
Dash also is not the strongest
on Objective C coding,

00:10:15.104 --> 00:10:16.270
but she is learning as well.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:23.110
She is a fan of packages.

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:26.935
ANDREW: [SNORT] Long
walks on the beach.

00:10:26.935 --> 00:10:28.471
EMILY: [LAUGHS]

00:10:28.471 --> 00:10:30.430
ANDREW: Flying among
cartoon clouds.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:33.248
EMILY: Two-factor
authentication.

00:10:33.248 --> 00:10:36.032
ANDREW: Yeah, two-factor
authentication,

00:10:36.032 --> 00:10:38.200
as I'm putting in my auth code.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.200
All right, so pub
authorized successfully.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.795
EMILY: OK, so let's go back to--

00:10:43.795 --> 00:10:45.280
ANDREW: That is cool.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.510
So could we search for it?

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:47.430
EMILY: Well, hold on.

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:48.840
See if it actually went through.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:49.424
Go back to--

00:10:49.424 --> 00:10:51.715
ANDREW: I believe anything
that I see in a web browser.

00:10:51.715 --> 00:10:52.960
I don't understand.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.418
EMILY: There might
be another step.

00:10:54.418 --> 00:10:56.140
Oh, invalid, what?

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:57.680
ANDREW: No pubspec.yaml file?

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.944
EMILY: What?

00:10:58.944 --> 00:10:59.860
What?

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.540
We just wrote one.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:02.040
Hold on.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:08.830
Go back to Android Studio,
where we were editing

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:10.570
said pubspec.yaml.

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.785
ANDREW: There it is.

00:11:15.785 --> 00:11:16.680
Looks like a pubspec.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:17.304
EMILY: It does.

00:11:17.304 --> 00:11:18.430
ANDREW: I can zoom in.

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:20.660
Still looks like a pubspec.

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:21.675
EMILY: We saved.

00:11:21.675 --> 00:11:22.600
We did save.

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:28.632
For grins, let's
just try it again.

00:11:28.632 --> 00:11:29.382
ANDREW: All right.

00:11:33.424 --> 00:11:34.590
I wonder if I took too long.

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:35.530
EMILY: Because there it is.

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:36.030
Yeah.

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:40.232
Yes, we are ready.

00:11:40.232 --> 00:11:41.690
All that buildup,
and then really--

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:42.315
ANDREW: I know.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.030
EMILY: Oh.

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.900
ANDREW: What?

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:56.370
EMILY: [LAUGHS] Ugh.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:58.540
Really?

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.840
OK, yeah, time to
ask the internet.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:08.745
So I see a number
I've been browsing,

00:12:08.745 --> 00:12:10.540
and I see a number of solutions.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.090
I don't like their options.

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:16.630
The solutions that people
have said is, one was like,

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.630
I created a new project
and replaced the files,

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:21.060
and then it worked.

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:24.980
If that's the case, we have some
bugs in our development team

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.324
to work on.

00:12:26.324 --> 00:12:28.740
ANDREW: It's probably just my
fault. Like, a lot of things

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:29.490
are just my fault.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.800
EMILY: Well, we
will investigate,

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.740
and we will get back with you.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:34.987
But we'll just pretend.

00:12:34.987 --> 00:12:37.320
ANDREW: You've seen all of
the correct steps, ironically

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:37.820
enough.

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:40.300
Like, we got to the last
step and did it correctly.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.300
EMILY: So if you
are not Andrew, you

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.517
could follow all these steps
and you can see success

00:12:44.517 --> 00:12:45.600
in uploading your package.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.070
ANDREW: There you go.

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:52.050
EMILY: So do we want to do the
outline for the Dart streams

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:55.230
interface, or are we going
to call it good for today?

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:58.570
ANDREW: Let's look at the Dart
interface for the next one

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.780
and do that.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:05.430
Yeah, so OK, so call it quits
on the publishing section here.

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:08.850
And we're going to
switch seats, and we can

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:10.680
look at some actual Dart code.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:11.340
All right.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:14.990
