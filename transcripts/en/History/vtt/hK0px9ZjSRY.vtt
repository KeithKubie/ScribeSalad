00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:01.620
- Hey, how can I help you?

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.120
What is that?

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.710
BRANDON: I think it's a
Le Testophone French horn.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.620
To be honest, I haven't seen
one of these things before,

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.040
but it looks like something
right out of Dr. Seuss.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.330
Looks like a car horn to me.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.040
I guess it could
have been used

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.380
on a car, or more looks like
something of a calliope, maybe.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.210
Don't you think it
would be built better?

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.420
Maybe like a horse horn?

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.750
We're all in
agreement it's a horn.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.670
[horn sounds]

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.080
BRANDON: Today, I
brought into the pawnshop

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.920
on antique French horn.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.380
I'm selling the horn
today because I can't

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.880
really do anything with it.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.250
I thought it was cool, but
I can't put it anywhere.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.540
So I'll see if I can
get some money for it.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.000
The horn I'm bringing is not
in the greatest condition,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.420
but I'm hoping that
that doesn't matter just

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.580
because it's so old and unique.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.250
That is definitely cool.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.670
What you have here
is a really bizarre

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.210
horn that might have been used
on really high-end automobiles.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.380
When they first came out with
cars, they didn't have horns.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.170
Even up to the 1950s, it
was sort of the thing to get

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.000
aftermarket horns put on cars.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.210
Is there a date on it anywhere?

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.920
BRANDON: Well, I had 1942.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.620
It wouldn't have been 1942.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.540
And the reason why, in 1942,
France was occupied by Germany.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.710
They were not
making fancy horns.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.120
They were making only
war-related items.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.540
And we were definitely not
importing anything from them

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.210
because it was Nazi
Germany at the time,

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.290
and we weren't doing
business with them.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.620
What did you want to do with it?

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.290
BRANDON: I want to sell it.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.460
And how much do
you want for it?

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.120
BRANDON: $1,000.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.790
And how'd you get that price?

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.210
BRANDON: I looked it up online,
and I seen a few that were--

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.290
looked similar like that.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.080
So I thought, hey.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.460
It wouldn't surprise
me if one of these things

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.960
would go for $1,000
in great shape.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.500
This thing is a world
away from great shape.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.620
That's your problem.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.500
You have a horn
right here that's

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.290
missing and soldered over.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.000
Obviously, there was a
hole or something right

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.120
here happened, because they
put a bunch of lead solder

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.330
over the top of it.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.830
It's rusted.
It's bent.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.580
It's broken.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.330
And in great shape, I
imagine there's a possibility

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.750
that it could go for $1,000.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.170
In this shape, nothing.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.000
But unfortunately,
it's not for me, man.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.250
BRANDON: OK.
- All right.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.330
Thanks for bringing
it in, though.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.330
BRANDON: No problem.
Thank you.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.080
Chum, help some customers.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.620
[music playing]

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.790
BRANDON: Well, I was a
little disappointed that he

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.330
didn't even make an offer.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.170
So I'm going to
actually take it.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.830
I'm going to put
it online, and I'm

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.830
sure someone's going to, you
know, take it off my hands.
