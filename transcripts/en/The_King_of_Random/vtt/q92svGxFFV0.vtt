00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
[Captioned by Judy V. at Y Translator]
In today's video, we'll be
revisiting an experiment

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.720
where we combine super glue
with hot borax solution.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.320
We'll try a few different
methods of combining the two,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.860
and see how it reacts.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.660
[Music]

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.480
Not too long ago,
I had an experiment

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.100
where I took a balloon full of super glue,

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.360
submerged it underneath
some hot borax solution,

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.340
and then I popped the balloon,
and that looked really cool.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.720
It sort of exploded
and solidified all at once,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.520
kind of reminding me of
a giant kernel of popcorn.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.460
Today, what we're going to do is
revisit that with some better lighting,

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.220
a square walled tank,
so you can see everything better,

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.000
and we're going to try some of
the different ways to mix the two

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.300
that were suggested in the
comments of the previous video.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.680
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.900
We've got a 10 gallon fish tank
full of hot borax solution,

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.960
and we're going to try
combining it with super glue

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.100
in pretty much every way
we can come up with.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.420
Before we start pouring large
quantities of super glue into this tank,

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.600
I do want to try a few experiments with
other methods of combining these two.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.040
So we'll try making some super glue
into some plain borax with no water.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.780
We'll try mixing it into
a cold borax solution.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.480
We'll add some super glue to
hot water with no borax in it.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.300
We'll see if adding the alcohol ink
seems to change the reaction time

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.180
at all in the hot borax solution.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.640
We'll try loading some of
our super glue into a squirt gun,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.200
and a large plastic syringe,
and we'll see you how they react.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:39.680
[Music]

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.740
Super glue coming
in contact with the borax.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.060
I would say it solidified
pretty much instantly.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.180
Let's try just another
little squirt right here.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.520
See if does the same thing.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.740
I'm gonna try and poke it with my
finger just a little bit faster this time.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.840
[Music]

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.400
Yep, that is cured.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.200
Now, we have evidence that borax will 
solidify super glue just right on contact,

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.720
which helps explain why the hot borax
solution solidifies superglue so quickly.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.040
[Music]

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.880
Adding in some
borax to our cool water,

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.140
now with the borax
dissolved into the water,

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.500
water does cause super glue
to harden all on its own,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.220
and borax makes it harden very quickly.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.800
So, I expect that this will still cause
our super glue to harden quite quickly,

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.880
although not as fast as the hot solution.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.800
That was pretty neat.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.800
[Music]

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.740
So that definitely does go quickly.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.020
Also makes kind of a neat noise.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.940
As a comparison, now,
here is our hot borax solution.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:49.600
[Music]

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.060
So it works pretty well
in cool borax solution,

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.640
but hot borax solution is
even faster and more reactive.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.600
That's why we like to
keep it nice and warm.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.240
It is possible that this has more
to do with my squirting technique

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.320
than the temperature.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.480
But I also think that
the hot borax solution

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.980
makes for a fluffier plastic
than the cool borax solution.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.000
A popular request was to see
what would happen if we squirted,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.121
instead of the super glue into the solution,

00:03:14.121 --> 00:03:16.200
the solution into the super glue.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.980
So I'm now filling this cup
partway with super glue.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.160
We'll use a syringe and squirt our
hot borax solution into the glue.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.760
First couple drips.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.200
That was more dripping in than I wanted.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.600
[Music]

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.280
All right.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.120
Now, I'm just going to squirt
quite a bit in all at once.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:59.220
[Music]

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.060
We've got a tank full of hot water.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.600
Let's add in some borax.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.900
We tried loading some
super glue into a squirt gun,

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.900
but the squirt gun wouldn't squirt.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.640
I think some of the superglue must
have gummed up the work so quickly

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.060
that it wasn't really pumping
it out to the nozzle.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.900
In the last video, there were some
comments saying that the alcohol

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.200
that I used in the ink to dye the super glue

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.660
might actually affect the reaction time.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.960
I'm gonna do a little bit
of a side-by-side test of

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.540
super glue without ink,
and super glue with ink

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.200
to see if it seems that it's
going any faster or slower.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.420
[Music]

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.260
There's some super glue with no dye.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.160
[Music]

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.700
That is plenty of dye right there.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.640
[Music]

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.360
Got a good red color super glue going on.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.300
[Music]

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.060
If there is a difference in the
reaction speed, it's quite minimal.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.560
That is polymerizing very quickly.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:06.440
[Music]

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.800
It's cool how organic
this ends up looking.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.640
Like this looks like a creature
or coral, or something like that.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.200
It doesn't look like something
that was just manufactured.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.440
It kind of looks more
like something that grew.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.320
We did discover by accident that
if you add too much alcohol ink,

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.880
it actually causes a
reaction with the super glue.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.120
It heats up, bubbles, and polymerizes,

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.920
solidifying quickly, and
kind of dangerously, actually.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.900
We've seen what plane super glue
going down into the borax solution does,

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.280
but what happens if the super glue
is coated on something else?

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.940
Putting on a black glove
over another pair of gloves,

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.640
because well, two reasons.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.500
One, I don't want the super glue
to accidentally get on my skin,

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.860
and these other gloves are longer,

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.340
and two, the borax
solution is warm enough

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.120
that it's uncomfortable down inside,

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.840
and I think that the super glue
reacting will get even warmer.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.480
So this is a heat barrier around my hand.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:58.880
Here it goes.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.580
Three. Two. One.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.500
It was quick, but it wasn't very extreme.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.080
It was such a thin coating of
super glue that for the most part,

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.980
it just polymerized into a thin film.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:22.260
[Music]

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.812
It's glued shut.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:24.520
One.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:33.340
[Music]

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.980
That might be about the
quickest and strangest way

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.000
to go through 16 fluid
ounces of super glue,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.520
but it does look really cool.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.080
It's a fun reaction to try.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.320
It's a fun reaction to watch,

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.880
and uh, the result is really entertaining.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.800
If there's any other experiments
you would like to see us try

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.100
along these same lines,

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.600
or just with Superglue in general,

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.260
let us know down in the comments.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.900
Try and be a little bit more creative
than put it in a vacuum chamber,

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.860
put in the furnace,
put it in liquid nitrogen,

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.280
put glow sticks fluid in it.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.960
That's not the kind of ideas we're looking.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.500
I came up with those all on my
own as soon as I thought of trying

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.600
to use super glue for stuff.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.140
I want to see something new.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.300
Guys, we've got more for you to see.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.000
That box up at the top will
transport you directly to our last video,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.040
and you should go check that out.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.000
The box at the bottom will show you what
YouTube thinks you should be watching next,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.380
and if you hit this bomb in the middle,
you'll be subscribed to the channel

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.120
so you never miss out on the fun.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.000
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we'll see you in the next one.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.080
Talk to you then.
