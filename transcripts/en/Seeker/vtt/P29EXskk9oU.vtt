DANGIT mind control foiled again

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.240
Hey Guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.250
I’ve wanted to control things with my mind
since.. forever.. well mostly since I saw

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.789
Matilda when I was a kid.

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.040
While I don’t have super powers, maybe technology
can help me out.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.140
Brain-computer interfaces, or BCI are, just
like that sounds, devices that connect your

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.689
brain to a computer.

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.890
They can read your mind and make things move!

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.579
While it might seem like a fantasy, it’s
2016 baby and it’s real, it’s here and

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:35.579
they have many uses.

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.120
They are often a powerful aid to those with
severe disabilities that inhibit movement,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.960
like quadriplegics or those with cerebral
palsy.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.770
They help people communicate, walk, and even
drive a car!

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.770
Seriously.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.130
Recently, Chinese researchers introduce a
prototype for a mind-controlled car!

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.820
This particular technology uses an EEG, or
electroencephalogram, made up of 16 sensors

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.910
on a cap that reads electric signals from
the brain.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.860
Just by thinking, the controller can make
the car move forward and backward and even

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.860
come to a stop.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.860
A controller can also both lock and unlock
the vehicle without lifting a finger.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.150
But before you get too excited, the researchers
from Nankai University don’t intend to actually

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.880
produce one of these cars, it was more a practice
in seeing how useful such can tech can be,

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.970
especially for those with disabilities.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.520
Although BCI tech was first researched in
the 1970s, it’s come along way in the past

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.520
few decades.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.420
They work by measuring the signals brain waves
give off.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.150
These kinds of brain-computer interfaces can’t
read your every thought, but they can take

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.610
all the electrical buzz from your brain and
translate it into a single command like “walk

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.150
forward” with alarming accuracy.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.810
But a lot of what’s picked up is fuzzy white
noise from other brain signals or electrical

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.900
signals given off from muscles moving.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.150
An algorithm filters the the noise from the
notion.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.970
That notion has to be sustained “conscious,
intentional activity”.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.530
According to research given at the Annual
International Conference of the IEEE Engineering

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:00.020
in Medicine and Biology Society, some EEGS
can translate intention 98% of the time .

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.290
Now people, like paraplegic individuals can
browse the web and write emails by moving

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.650
a mentally controlled mouse.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.390
But it’s still a slow going and cumbersome
process; The system has to learn the patient’s

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.390
signals too.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.320
Both the patient and the computer are learning
the process at the same time.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.390
So it can take months of practice and training.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.670
Because many BCI spelling systems flash different
letters on a screen and you have to think

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.200
something like YES for the letter you want.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.640
The BCI reads that change in the brain waves.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.340
So you can imagine that it would take time
just to write your name.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.870
Some systems reportedly take a minute just
to type out less than 10 characters.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.230
As for walking, EEG controlled exoskeletons
like this one, help people who’ve lost control

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.410
of their legs walk again.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.470
But they take a whole crew of physical therapists
to help wire someone into the machine.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.510
So they aren’t just high tech toys.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.770
But if you’re more curious about the novelty
factor, this tech is already hitting the toy

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:51.770
market.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.770
Like the car, toys or other tech like this
only measure concentration and so can’t

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:53.770
control many factors at once.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.110
Like the car can only go forwards or backwards,
toys like Star Wars Science Force Trainer

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.350
only send a ball blowing up a tube.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.770
But more complicated gadgets are on the horizon,
one study published in the Journal of Neural

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.740
Engineering found that a person can control
a drone through an obstacle course, just by

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:07.740
the power of their thoughts.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:08.920
How cool is that?

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.319
We know you love watching online, but we’re
excited to announce DNews is now on Science

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.319
channel!

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.110
Trace and Amy will be sharing a minute of
the best in science in between awesome programming.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.430
So check out as Science Presents DNews at
9!

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.090
Every weeknight, Monday through Friday, and
use your twitter to let them know if you want

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.090
more!

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.170
So the power of the mind is pretty awesome.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.250
But your mind isn’t the only way to control
tech.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.820
The human body is full of kinetic energy,
potential energy, heat, and electricity.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.410
Maybe we can use these resources for energy.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.400
To find out more about how your body can be
a power plant, check out this episode right

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.400
here

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:58.210
So I really want to know…

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.860
HAVE YOU USED ONE OF THESE MIND CONTROL GADGETS?

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.390
Did they live up to your expectations?

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.060
