in 2017 we discovered the first visitor

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:11.129
in 2017 we discovered the first visitor
 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:12.799
in 2017 we discovered the first visitor
to our solar system that actually came

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809
to our solar system that actually came
 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.560
to our solar system that actually came
from another star this is really true we

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570
from another star this is really true we
 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.390
from another star this is really true we
discovered a really interesting type of

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400
discovered a really interesting type of
 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.820
discovered a really interesting type of
asteroid a rock flying through space and

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830
asteroid a rock flying through space and
 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.350
asteroid a rock flying through space and
it was something that we'd never seen

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:21.360
it was something that we'd never seen
 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.260
it was something that we'd never seen
before we knew for a fact that this rock

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270
before we knew for a fact that this rock
 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.880
before we knew for a fact that this rock
could not have come from our solar

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890
could not have come from our solar
 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.060
could not have come from our solar
system it was going so fast that it had

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070
system it was going so fast that it had
 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.650
system it was going so fast that it had
enough velocity to escape the Sun's

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660
enough velocity to escape the Sun's
 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.869
enough velocity to escape the Sun's
gravity entirely in fact when it went

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:32.879
gravity entirely in fact when it went
 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:35.540
gravity entirely in fact when it went
past the Sun in late 2017 at top speed

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550
past the Sun in late 2017 at top speed
 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.570
past the Sun in late 2017 at top speed
it was going 196 thousand miles an hour

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:38.580
it was going 196 thousand miles an hour
 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.149
it was going 196 thousand miles an hour
that's by far enough velocity to

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:41.159
that's by far enough velocity to
 

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:43.189
that's by far enough velocity to
completely go away from the Sun's

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:43.199
completely go away from the Sun's
 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:44.960
completely go away from the Sun's
gravity and go all the way out into

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970
gravity and go all the way out into
 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.810
gravity and go all the way out into
interstellar space now this object was

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820
interstellar space now this object was
 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.579
interstellar space now this object was
discovered by a program called

under any threat from an asteroid that
 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.799
under any threat from an asteroid that
might be coming near us we're also very

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809
might be coming near us we're also very

interested scientifically in where the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030
interested scientifically in where the
 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.450
interested scientifically in where the
asteroids are and how they formed it was

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460
asteroids are and how they formed it was
 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.790
asteroids are and how they formed it was
named Oh mwah mwah and that's the

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800
named Oh mwah mwah and that's the
 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.400
named Oh mwah mwah and that's the
Hawaiian word for scout the first

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410
Hawaiian word for scout the first
 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.460
Hawaiian word for scout the first
arriving of many and this was the first

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470
arriving of many and this was the first
 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.410
arriving of many and this was the first
thing we'd ever seen from another star

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420
thing we'd ever seen from another star
 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.330
thing we'd ever seen from another star
so the idea of being the first being a

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340
so the idea of being the first being a
 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.610
so the idea of being the first being a
scout was a wonderful and poetic thing

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620
scout was a wonderful and poetic thing
 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.560
scout was a wonderful and poetic thing
to name this thing to give you a sense

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570
to name this thing to give you a sense
 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.410
to name this thing to give you a sense
of how unusual oh Mumma is we know that

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420
of how unusual oh Mumma is we know that
 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.450
of how unusual oh Mumma is we know that
it's a rock like an asteroid in our

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460
it's a rock like an asteroid in our
 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.370
it's a rock like an asteroid in our
solar system but it has a completely

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380
solar system but it has a completely
 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.930
solar system but it has a completely
different shape we've never seen

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940
different shape we've never seen
 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.490
different shape we've never seen
anything in our solar system that looks

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500
anything in our solar system that looks
 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.620
anything in our solar system that looks
like this it's about a quarter of a mile

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630
like this it's about a quarter of a mile
 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.140
like this it's about a quarter of a mile
long and it's actually elongated like a

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150
long and it's actually elongated like a
 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.660
long and it's actually elongated like a
cigar it's ten times as long as it is

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670
cigar it's ten times as long as it is
 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.970
cigar it's ten times as long as it is
wide and we know that it's tumbling

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980
wide and we know that it's tumbling
 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.560
wide and we know that it's tumbling
through space it actually tumbles and

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570
through space it actually tumbles and
 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.690
through space it actually tumbles and
rotates around its axis about once every

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700
rotates around its axis about once every
 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.649
rotates around its axis about once every
7 hours

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659
7 hours
 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.020
7 hours
now that means it's tumbling pretty fast

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030
now that means it's tumbling pretty fast
 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.149
now that means it's tumbling pretty fast
so in order to stay together and not

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159
so in order to stay together and not
 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.399
so in order to stay together and not
just fly apart it must be pretty rigid

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409
just fly apart it must be pretty rigid
 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.530
just fly apart it must be pretty rigid
made of of rock or even something

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540
made of of rock or even something
 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.680
made of of rock or even something
metallic so it's a hard object elongated

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690
metallic so it's a hard object elongated
 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.780
metallic so it's a hard object elongated
tumbling through space and incredible

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790
tumbling through space and incredible
 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.350
tumbling through space and incredible
speeds

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360
speeds
 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.660
speeds
there also is something mysterious that

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670
there also is something mysterious that
 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.180
there also is something mysterious that
happened as this object left our solar

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190
happened as this object left our solar
 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.830
happened as this object left our solar
system it's actually now around the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840
system it's actually now around the
 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.410
system it's actually now around the
orbit of Jupiter and that has it changed

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420
orbit of Jupiter and that has it changed
 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.540
orbit of Jupiter and that has it changed
its trajectory just a tiny little bit

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550
its trajectory just a tiny little bit
 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.330
its trajectory just a tiny little bit
actually sped up a tiny little bit as it

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340
actually sped up a tiny little bit as it
 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.840
actually sped up a tiny little bit as it
went away from the Sun

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850
went away from the Sun
 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.000
went away from the Sun
and that wasn't expected we've seen that

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010
and that wasn't expected we've seen that
 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.770
and that wasn't expected we've seen that
sort of behavior from things like comets

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780
sort of behavior from things like comets
 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.740
sort of behavior from things like comets
that when comets have a bit of gas or

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750
that when comets have a bit of gas or
 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.150
that when comets have a bit of gas or
something trapped under the surface and

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160
something trapped under the surface and
 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.950
something trapped under the surface and
the Sun warms it up you can get a little

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960
the Sun warms it up you can get a little
 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.600
the Sun warms it up you can get a little
jet that comes off the comet a little

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610
jet that comes off the comet a little
 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.810
jet that comes off the comet a little
jet of gas that changes its velocity we

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820
jet of gas that changes its velocity we
 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.700
jet of gas that changes its velocity we
didn't think that Oh more more had any

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710
didn't think that Oh more more had any
 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.070
didn't think that Oh more more had any
of those volatile x' those gasses on it

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080
of those volatile x' those gasses on it
 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.990
of those volatile x' those gasses on it
but apparently it did as it went away

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000
but apparently it did as it went away
 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.180
but apparently it did as it went away
from the Sun it changes trajectory just

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190
from the Sun it changes trajectory just
 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.960
from the Sun it changes trajectory just
a little bit

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970
a little bit
 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.670
a little bit
it also has attracted some attention

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680
it also has attracted some attention
 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.070
it also has attracted some attention
because some people have wondered could

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080
because some people have wondered could
 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.860
because some people have wondered could
this be a technology could this be a

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870
this be a technology could this be a
 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.260
this be a technology could this be a
spaceship or part of a spaceship or some

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270
spaceship or part of a spaceship or some
 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.760
spaceship or part of a spaceship or some
people have talked about a light sail

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770
people have talked about a light sail
 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.980
people have talked about a light sail
something that actually can use stellar

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990
something that actually can use stellar
 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.900
something that actually can use stellar
winds to accelerate and move between the

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910
winds to accelerate and move between the
 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.150
winds to accelerate and move between the
stars I'm always very concerned when

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160
stars I'm always very concerned when
 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.460
stars I'm always very concerned when
somebody suggests a natural object like

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470
somebody suggests a natural object like
 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.210
somebody suggests a natural object like
Oh Momoa

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220
Oh Momoa
 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.940
Oh Momoa
might be an alien spaceship because for

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950
might be an alien spaceship because for
 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.350
might be an alien spaceship because for
one thing I think it takes away from the

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360
one thing I think it takes away from the
 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.020
one thing I think it takes away from the
incredible real facts we know about this

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030
incredible real facts we know about this
 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.600
incredible real facts we know about this
object and in my view of the universe

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610
object and in my view of the universe
 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.640
object and in my view of the universe
aliens are definitely not impossible

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650
aliens are definitely not impossible
 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.110
aliens are definitely not impossible
that there could be other life outside

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120
that there could be other life outside
 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.520
that there could be other life outside
the earth there could even be other

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530
the earth there could even be other
 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.500
the earth there could even be other
technologies outside the earth more
