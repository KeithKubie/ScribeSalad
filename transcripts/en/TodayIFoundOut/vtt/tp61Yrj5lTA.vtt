00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:26.590
The Numerous Bodies Recently Found in Ben
Franklin’s Basement

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.050
For eighteen years, Ben Franklin, the great
American inventor, diplomat, and signer of

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.960
the Declaration of Independence, was a tenant
in a beautiful four story Georgian house at

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.440
36 Craven Street in London, mere blocks from
the River Thames.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.180
As ambassador from the colonies, he entertained,
lived, and even allowed other intellectuals

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.460
of the time to stay at the house while he
lived there from 1757 through 1775.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.579
Nearly 225 years later, as the house stood
dilapidated and on the brink of collapse,

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.010
a group called “Friends of Benjamin Franklin
House” decided to renovate the building

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.270
and turn it into a museum honoring one of
America’s founding fathers.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.499
Work commenced, but only a month into the
renovation, a construction worker named Jim

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:12.369
Field made a startling discovery in the windowless
basement: A human thigh bone sticking out

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:13.960
of a dirt-filled pit.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.899
After further excavation (with the help of
the London police), more than 1200 other bones

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:23.829
– all dated from about 200 years prior – were
discovered in this one meter wide and one

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:25.399
meter deep pit.

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.420
This begged the question, what were human
bones doing in Ben Franklin’s house?

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.539
Was one of our honored American heroes also
the United States’ first serial killer?

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:37.469
The short answer to that latter question is
no.

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:40.819
Mr. Franklin was a lot of things, but “murderer”
wasn’t one of them.

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:45.170
After the discovery, the “Friends of Ben”
called in Dr. Simon Hillson and his team from

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.429
London’s Institute of Archaeology at University
College London.

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:52.849
After a bit of research, and analyzing the
remains, they soon came to the conclusion

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:58.359
that the bones once belonged to William Hewson,
an anatomist pioneer and “father of hematology”

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:00.979
– the study of blood and blood diseases.

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.840
So how did the bones end up in Ben Franklin’s
basement?

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.849
While studying at the University of Edinburgh
in 1761/62 (the same university where Arthur

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.659
Conan Doyle served as a clerk for Joseph Bell
a little over hundred years later, with Bell

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.650
becoming one of the individuals the character
of Sherlock Holmes was based on), William

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.099
Hewson caught the attention of the Scottish
scientists and surgeons, the Hunter brothers

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.420
. The brothers eventually named Hewson as
an assistant and partner in their anatomy

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.739
school, allowing him to continue his study
of blood.

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.310
In a famed experiment in front of the Royal
Society in 1770, Hewson used the flow of mercury

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.299
through a turtle to show how blood moves through
the lymphatic system.

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.640
This earned him high praise, election into
the Royal Society and the Copley Medal (outstanding

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.629
achievement in the physical and biological
sciences).

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.769
It also gained him a friend and admirer in
Ben Franklin.

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.659
On July 10, 1770, Hewson married Mary Stevenson,
a female acquaintance of Franklin and the

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:02.150
daughter of Franklin’s landlady at 36 Craven.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.719
Later that year, the Hunter brothers proposed
to break-up their partnership with Hewson.

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:10.959
According to PBS, it was because Hewson “no
longer lived in the school.”

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.920
Whatever the case, Hewson wanted ownership
over all the experiments he performed while

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.969
working there.

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:18.030
The Hunter brothers said no.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.299
This created a rift between great scientists
that Franklin attempted to mediate.

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.680
Said Franklin at the time,
“I should think it no Trouble to hear their

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.379
Complaints if I could be of the least Use
in accommodating their Differences; but since

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:35.170
that was not likely, I could only wish as
I had a Regard for both, that they would go

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.940
on to the End of their Term as quietly as
possible, since that would be most to the

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.849
Credit of both.”

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.510
With the partnership now broken, Franklin
offered to let Hewson come live at 36 Craven

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.680
and open his own anatomy school there.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.060
He accepted and his school officially opened
at Ben Franklin’s residence in September

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.129
of 1772.

00:03:55.129 --> 00:04:00.989
Among the bones found in 1998 at 36 Craven
were the remains of fifteen different people,

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.420
adults and children.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.499
They all showed dissection marks made by 18th
century surgical instruments.

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:11.090
A femur bone was found that was cut cleanly
through, probably used to demonstrate the

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.349
proper technique for amputation.

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.880
Skull fragments showed drill holes likely
made by a trepanning device, a pre-industrial

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.000
revolution practice (though, rarely, still
performed today) where holes were drilled

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.630
into the skull to relieve pressure on the
brain.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.990
Additionally, excavators found remains of
several different kinds of animals, horses,

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.900
cows, pigs, and even a turtle spine.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.070
It was clear that these remains were being
used for medical and scientific study, but

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.310
why didn’t Hewson properly dispose of them?

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.590
Why was he going to great lengths to hide
what he was doing?

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.140
And where did these human remains come from?

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.550
Throughout the Middle Ages and until late
16th century, dissections and autopsies were

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.900
completely illegal in England due to lack
of understanding of the medical necessity

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.350
combined with religious objections.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.760
This gradually changed starting in the 17th
century, when autonomical theaters were set

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.140
up in many European cities for doctors and
students alike to learn about the human body.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.770
These became giant spectacles and were hard
to gain entrance too.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.460
During this time, according to the Einstein
College of Medicine in Bronx, New York, dissection

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.790
was “associated with great dishonor” and
would often be used as a deterrent against

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.730
committing serious crimes.

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:24.660
The Murder Act of 1752 allowed for capital
punishment as well as having this provision,

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.960
“the body so delivered to the said company
of Surgeons, shall be dissected and anatomized

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.750
by the said Surgeons, or such person as they
shall appoint for that purpose.”

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.150
In other words, dissection became part of
the sentence.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.340
But dissection was only for those who had
already had their demise planned for them

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.540
by the state.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.850
As anatomy schools grew in practice (the first
official one opened at Penn University in

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.590
1745 – the school founded by Ben Franklin),
the demand for cadavers rose.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.500
There was no way the amount of executed convicted
criminals were going to match the need for

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.520
dissectable bodies.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:05.100
So, doctors, scientists, and surgeons turned
to a less than savory practice – grave robbing.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.290
In a few cases, the shortage of bodies for
medical professionals in Europe and America

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.570
even spurred some to commit murder in order
to sell the bodies to medical professionals.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:18.210
While it is not proven that William Hewson
resorted to grave robbing (and he certainly

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:23.320
didn’t murder anyone), it seems likely considering
the range and amounts of bones he had that

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.720
he at least paid grave robbers for bodies,
if not did the deed himself.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.661
In fact, the “Friends of Benjamin Franklin
House” speculate that Hewson’s bodies

00:06:30.661 --> 00:06:35.300
came from “resurrectionists – bodysnatchers
who shipped their wares along the Thames under

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.300
cover of night.”

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.930
To dispose of the bodies somewhere besides
in a basement pit was to risk getting caught

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.040
for illegal dissection and possible grave
robbing.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.230
All in the name of science.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.080
As far as how involved Franklin was himself
in these “illegal dissections” and the

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.650
anatomy school, there is no evidence in either
direction.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.650
It is even possible that Franklin had no idea
that anything technically criminal was being

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.810
done at the school in the house, though this
seems a bit of a stretch, given he knew the

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.660
work Hewson did and no doubt was well aware
of resurrectionist practices to supply medical

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.880
professionals with the bodies they needed
for their work.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.570
That said, Franklin was in and out often and
even when he was in London, he sometimes stayed

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.560
at a different house owned by the same landlady.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.770
So perhaps he at the least wasn’t ever present
for the transactions.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.180
We’ll likely never know.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.310
While the means with which Hewson acquired
at least some of the bodies were likely illegal,

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.180
the work he did was important.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:34.620
From 1772 to his death two years later, William
Hewson made several discoveries related to

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:35.850
the human body.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:40.360
He became the first person to observe lymphocytes’
production in the thymus and spleen.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.570
He became the first to describe clearly the
three components of blood – red blood cells,

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.390
white blood cells, and plasma.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:50.930
He correctly reported that red blood cells
were disk-shaped, unlike his contemporaries

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.730
who thought the cell was spherical.

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.850
Unfortunately, Hewson’s life met a tragic
ending.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:08:01.920
He contracted septicaemia (ironically enough,
a severe blood infection) in 1774 from a dissection

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.570
wound and died.

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:08.180
As Franklin said in a letter to his wife,
“Our Family here is in great Distress.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:12.820
Poor Mrs. Hewson has lost her Husband, and
Mrs. Stevenson her Son-in-law.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:17.860
He died last Sunday Morning of a Fever which
baffled the Skill of our best Physicians.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:23.180
He was an excellent young Man, ingenious,
industrious, useful, and belov’d by all

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.670
that knew him….He was just established in
a profitable growing Business, with the best

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:31.090
Prospects of bringing up his young Family
advantageously.”

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:35.890
Today, the “Benjamin Franklin House” on
36 Craven in London is open to the public

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:36.919
as a museum.

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:39.450
It is the last remaining home of the man himself.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:55.399
William Hewson’s dissection bones are currently
on display in the Seminar room in the house.
