00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.640
He's gonna take you back to the past!

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.600
To blow these reviews out of his ass!

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.800
He'd rather have...

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.760
a crocodile...

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.120
pin him down and suck on his cock!

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.440
He'd rather eat...

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.800
some rotten dog shit....

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.320
and drown it down with Rolling Rock!

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.560
He's the world's biggest and greatest cynic!

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.780
He's the Angry Video Game Critic!

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.960
He's the Angry Video Game...

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.820
Critic.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.500
*Impersonating AVGN* Hello. I'm the Angry Video Game Critic.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.300
I have a small penis and like to eat elephant shit for breakfast!

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.340
Ha ha ha!

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.420
*Normal voice* Alright, I'm not going to do that voice throughout the entire video.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.700
What I am going to do, though, is review a god awful video game based off of a god awful feature film.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.360
I'm, of course, talking about the horrors of "Bebe's Kids".

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.160
*Bebe's Kids (SNES Intro)*

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.800
For those of you who are fortunate enough to pass this movie up, I'll give you the premise.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.860
The film is about a guy who has to take three bratty kids to an amusement park...

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.260
as they do nothing but cause trouble and panic.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.440
The film was so bad that even the trailer couldn't make it sound good.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.380
I mean, listen to this tagline...

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.960
"Bebe's Kids! It's animation..."

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.720
*high five*

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.180
And that's about all they can say about it.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.180
They can't say it's a good film, a funny film, or even a film.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.220
All they can say is it's animation.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.040
That's pretty bad.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.440
Because someone at Universal foolishly thought this film would be a hit...

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.380
they did a video game tie-in for the Super Nintendo.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.520
Now, this film was based on the stand-up comedy of Robin Harris...

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.720
which he based on real life events.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.240
So, let me get this straight.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.820
I'm reviewing a game...

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.840
based on a movie...

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.200
based on a stand-up...

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.120
based on some woman's annoying kids?

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.260
Well!

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.280
If that's not the set up for the best damn video game in the world, I don't know what is!

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.780
Let's review this fucker!

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.620
Yea...

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.800
As you can tell, it's been a while since I used this.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.580
Alright. Bebe's Kids. Here we go.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.260
So, it starts off with you entering the theme park "Fun World".

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.600
Well... If you got to put the word "Fun" in the title, chances are it's not going to be that enjoyable.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.740
Now you can either be a boy or a girl,

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.080
and I'm going to choose the boy.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.040
So, you start off in the amusement park...

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.460
and the first thing you notice is the sign behind you.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.940
"NO VIbES"
"NO bEVIS"
"NO bEVIS"
"NO VIbES"

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.100
Oh boy, we're in trouble.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.680
*sigh*

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.780
Not only does this not make any sense...

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.320
but you notice that all the letters are capitalized except for the letter "B?"

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.380
Why the fuck is that?

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.280
Wait a minute. I just realized something.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.780
 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.040
In fact, it has all the same letters!

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.880
"VIbES" is actually an anagram for "bEVIS".

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.180
So much so, that they don't even capitalize the "b" when they rewrite it!

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.820
And the pattern is always 1 "VIbES" and 2 "bEVIS",

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.800
...never 1 "bEVIS" and 2 VIbES."

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.220
So, if "VIbES" is an anagram for "bEVIS..."

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.060
"bEVIS" is an anagram for "VIbES..."

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.160
and they always come to the order 1, 2, 1, 2...

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.120
that means...

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.840
*suspenseful music*

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.920
Absolutely NOTHING!

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.800
I just wasted five minutes on this game, and I haven't even pushed a button yet!

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.340
Alright. So you're walking through this amusement park,

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.400
though it isn't really as much walking, as it is swimming through air,

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.440
and you come across these people in costumes.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.360
They don't seem to be bothering me, so I just decide to move on.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:20.480
Oh!

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.980
Well...

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.100
The screen won't let me leave.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.300
Ok. So I guess I have to beat these guys up.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.080
Ok. That's kind of cool.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.640
You get to hit people in the crotch?

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.680
Maybe this game won't be so bad after all.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.620
Yea! Take that you mousy nads!

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.940
Oh my God! I will never get tired of this!

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.500
Oh my God... I am so tired of this!

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.740
These characters take forever to kill!

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.300
And they move around so much that they're hard even to hit!

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.060
Wait. His head fell off! Ok, That must mean I'm close, right?

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.580
Thank God! I don't think I could've taken much more of this!

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.200
Oh my God!!! I can't take much more of this!

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.260
Ok, alright, I got one in the corner now.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.760
This ought to make things go faster.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.020
Come on!

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.320
Die!!!

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.320
Die, god damn it!!!

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.100
Die!!!

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.660
Oh, thank god!

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.600
Now I have to get this asshole, right?

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.860
God, I hope he goes down a lot faster than the other guy.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.920
Oh, sweet buttery JESUS!

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.420
This is like a test in psychological torture!

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.460
Just DIE!

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.240
DIE!

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.420
DIE!!! (x8)

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.180
HA HA!!!

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.980
I beat him!

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.260
I actually beat him!

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.780
THERE IS A GO-...

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.620
A time limit?

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.800
There's a time limit?

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.180
I can eat my way through a WALL,

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.500
Faster than I can defeat these assholes!

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.980
And there's a TIME... LIMIT!!!???

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.300
All right. So, in case you missed it...

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.040
It took me a total of 35 hits

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.940
to take down just one of these guys!

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.720
35 hits!

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.520
Why are you even trying to hit them? They're barely touching you!

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.060
All they do is stand there and act like they're posing for GQ or something.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.560
Ok. Let's try this again.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.060
Maybe there's something I'm missing.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.360
I'll be the girl this time...

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.640
maybe she's a little faster.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.020
Oh, wha-? She's the exact same speed!

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.620
In fact...

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.620
I think she might even be a little slower!

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.420
You bag of ass!

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.060
Wait a minute. What's that?

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.180
It's a baseball!

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.440
Good God, there's actually weapons in this game!

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.260
Ok. So, pick up the baseball...

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.140
Good...

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.980
And...

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:23.620
Throw it!

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.760
And...

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.400
Throw it!

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.180
THROW IT, YOU BITCH!

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.700
Oh my god!!!

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.160
How do you throw this thing?

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.000
It's not A, B, X, Y...

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.380
It's not even L or R!

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.200
Will Select work?

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.760
No!

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.260
So, what the fuck do I do?

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.080
What, am I supposed to just look at it?

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.000
JESUS CHRIST!

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.380
SOMEBODY HELP ME OUT!

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.920
Wha-? What was that?

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.580
What was that?!

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.140
How the fuck did I do that?!

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.280
Wha- wha- wha-? Is it A and B?

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:48.820
No!

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:49.460
Is it X and Y?

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.960
No!

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:50.580
L and R? No!

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.280
Oh, come on! There's not that many button combinations left!

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.860
Wait a minute. There it is. There it is! I got it!

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:56.840
I finally got it!

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.200
Ok. So, what's the combo?

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.980
L and Y?

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.280
Are you shitting me?

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.720
Who ever heard of a special move that was just L and Y?

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.120
I mean, what's the point?

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.940
Why not just replace it with the kicking button?

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.500
I mean, that's totally useless!

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.240
Well, fuck it. Let's just see how much damage I can do with this thing.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.640
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.500
3 hits?

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.340
I could have killed these guys the whole time with just 3 HITS!?

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.580
This game is a bucket of balls!

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.440
Now I know what you're thinking. Couldn't I technically have checked the instruction book for that?

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.540
Well, I think they're giving the people who bought this game a little too much credit.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.060
Like, that they can read!

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.660
Alright. So, what's the throwing combo?

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:32.560
L and B.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.080
Well, B's the jumping button. So, that's already confusing.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.880
But, let's see if I can knock them out faster.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.160
Come here you little fuck bunnies!

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:39.940
Come here!!

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:41.460
Finally...

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.600
So how many hits does it take to kill them with a weapon?

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.580
Three.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.160
The exact same amount if you just uppercut them.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.560
Well, then what the fuck's the point of having a weapon then?

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.000
I don't know. Who gives a shit.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.580
Let's just move on to the next level.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.120
"House of Glass". Ok, so this should be at least a little bit of fun.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.160
Alright. So, there's a baby dropping some glasses and a guy catching them at the bottom.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:02.840
Ok, well, good luck with that.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.580
I'm going to see where the real adventure is.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.000
I can't leave the screen.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.020
Great. So, I guess this IS the adventure part.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.180
What a fucking load.

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.280
Alright. So, do I catch these things too?

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:15.980
No...

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:16.740
They hurt you.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.280
So, you want to stay away from them.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.440
Do I stop this guy?

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.400
Well, I can't seem to. So, that's not it.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.480
Do I stop the baby?

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.120
Well, I can't reach him or climb up the shelves.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.420
So what the fuck do I do?

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.060
Oh...

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.120
You break the glass?

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.900
Well, how the fuck am I supposed to figure that out?

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.200
Oh great. Now I'm out of time. I really hate that fucking timer.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.540
So, I guess I have to start over and break the glass again. Right?

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:39.960
WHAT?!

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.480
They start me all the way back to the beginning of the fucking game!!??

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.840
SON OF A BITCH!!!

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:53.340
Ok. So, I got to go through all this shit again and make it to the glass shop.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.180
By the way, that's just incredible music isn't it?

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:02.260
I mean, fuck the Mario games and Legend of Zelda for having actual themes and melodies.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.420
All you need is five notes repeated over, and over, and over.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.560
Fucking ingenious.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.080
Ok, here I am again.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.660
And in case you missed it, you have to somehow break the glass without actually touching it.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.360
This is sounding like a goddamn Zen riddle.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.980
I should also point out that you can only punch once while in the air.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.920
So, why is the baby dropping more than one glass at a time?

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.180
It's not like you can hit it.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.140
God, fuck it. Let's just get this over with.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:25.980
Alright. So, I finally beat the glass level.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:26.760
What's next?

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.340
HOLY HELL!!!

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.560
It's the exact same level again!!??

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:49.040
NNNNEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRDDD!!!!

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.160
Ok. So, you go through all this bullshit again...

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.420
Back off, you little dick cheese!

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:54.880
and you get to the next level.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.920
Which is...

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.900
a haunted house.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.860
FFFFFFFun...

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:03.680
Here you have to battle mummies, damn annoying bats, and pictures that blow smoke rings at you.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.860
Why? I don't know. I stopped bringing logic into this long ago.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:10.320
So, not only is this place filled with creepy ghouls and goblins...

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.000
but it's also a fucking maze!

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:14.920
Oh,

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:16.580
That's just great.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:21.440
So, you have to go in and out of these doors in order to get your way out of the house.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:26.540
But this is damn near impossible seeing how every single room looks exactly the same!

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.060
How am I supposed to remember which room I've been in?

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:33.180
There's one part where you're pretty much trapped in this room and you have to find a way out.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.900
There's this black thing here. I guess it's supposed to be a mirror.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.020
Can I do something here?

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.540
Didn't seem to do anything...

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:42.440
There's this weird animated picture of what looks like Spiderman swinging by.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.160
Am I supposed to catch a ride with him?

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.680
Please, Spiderman! Get me out of this hellhole!

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.900
What am I supposed to do?

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.520
The clock is ticking and I have no idea what to do!

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.740
Do you want me to read a book?

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.040
Will that make you happy you little-

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:58.240
How the fuck am I supposed to fig-

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.140
Never mind!

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.640
Let's just get the hell out of here!

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.460
Well, wait a minute...

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:05.780
How come sometimes when I go through a bookcase I end up in a different room than I did before?

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:10.100
Well, apparently, going to the left side of the bookcase drops you off in one room...

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.260
and going to the right side of the bookcase drops you off in another.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.220
THAT'S...

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:14.860
JUST...

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:15.480
IM-

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.480
POSSIBLE!!!

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.080
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT!!!

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.920
If a bookcase opens up, it spins around in a circle.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.460
So, that means that there can only be one room!

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.280
Because if there's a wall separating the two rooms, the bookcase wouldn't open!

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.640
So how can it lead to two separate rooms?

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.160
It can't, Bebe's Kids!

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.100
It just...

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.260
CAN'T!!!

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:39.780
Apparently, there's this weird dildo thing at the top of the screen that slowly changes to red the closer you get to the exit.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:43.700
But so far it's just been blue because I have no idea how to get out of this place.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.140
God, how am I supposed to get out of here? Every room looks exactly the same!

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:47.820
*frustrated sigh*

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:48.920
Uh... Still blue.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.420
Still blue...

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.600
Wait a minute!

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.320
It's changing!

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.300
It's changing color!

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.680
Alright! Let me try over here!

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:56.200
Aw! Blue, damn it!

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.060
And I can't go back in this fucking door!

00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:59.080
Let me try it again!

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.020
Blue...

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:02.460
Blue...!

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:04.960
*gasp*

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.600
It's changing! It's changing!!

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.560
There it goes!

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.900
It's getting darker!

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.680
Oh my god! It's almost red!

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.620
I KNEW IT! I knew I could do it!

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:13.960
I KNEW I COULD PULL IT O-

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.340
THIS IS THE WORST GAME I HAVE EVERY PLAYED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:47.340
IT SUCKS ASS!

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:48.460
IT SUCKS BALLS!

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:49.200
IT JUST...

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.380
SUCKS!

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:51.560
Well...

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.900
If you think this is going to get rid of me Angry Video Game Nerd, you are much mistaken.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.700
Sure, I will need years of psychological therapy to recover from this,

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.500
but that doesn't mean you've heard the last of me!

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.440
All I can say, Angry Video Game nerd, is...

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.220
Fuck this game!

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:05.900
And fuck you for making me play it!

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.000
-He's the Angry Video Game...

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:08.800
OH, SHUT UP!

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.460
-Critic.
