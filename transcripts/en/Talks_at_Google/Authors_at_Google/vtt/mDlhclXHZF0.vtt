BLAKE J. HARRIS:
Where should I stand?

00:00:03.286 --> 00:00:05.200
Anywhere in particular?

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:05.880
All right.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:06.750
Well, thank you very much.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.708
I don't know that it was
the first console war,

00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:11.320
but it was the one that
defined my generation, my life,

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.040
my childhood, and I
think a lot of yours.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.940
So I thought I would
just talk about how

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.150
I got into this project and also
how it has been now developed

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.830
into two film projects and
then open it up to questions

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.370
that you guys would have.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.610
So writing "Console
Wars" was really--

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.440
began with me just wanting
to read "Console Wars."

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.590
I was a Nintendo kid
originally, and I desperately

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.560
wanted-- I was just
telling Michael

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.840
that I desperately wanted
a Super Nintendo because I

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.800
love my Nintendo.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.210
It was pretty much
the only thing

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.390
that kept my brother and
I friends during this time

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.370
period.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.510
And I remember asking my father
for a Super Nintendo in 1991

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.070
for Christmas, and
I distinctly recall

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.745
him saying he wouldn't buy it
for us because he said Nintendo

00:00:58.745 --> 00:01:00.620
would then just come
out with the super duper

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.220
Nintendo and a super
super duper Nintendo.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.280
And I guess he was
right in a sense,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.360
but I just thought
he was being cruel

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.507
at the time since this was
the only thing we wanted.

00:01:10.507 --> 00:01:12.840
But looking back and what
prompted me to write the story

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.162
was that he was basically
talking about a business

00:01:15.162 --> 00:01:17.370
decision that Nintendo had
made not to make the Super

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.670
Nintendo backwardly
compatible with the NES.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.770
And for that reason that
somebody made this decision

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.400
thousands of miles
away, we ended up

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.066
with the Sega Genesis,
which was somehow

00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:29.060
a loophole to my father's logic.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.760
And I became a Sega kid.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.880
And so because I think
Sega Nintendo played

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.540
such a large role
in my childhood,

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.017
and those of us who are
up in the '80s and '90s,

00:01:38.017 --> 00:01:39.600
I wanted to investigate
what was going

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.016
on behind the scenes, what was
going on thousands of miles

00:01:42.016 --> 00:01:45.759
away in these boardrooms
that led to altering my life

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.800
and all these ripples that
changed the video game

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.870
industry.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.960
And so my
investigation into this

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.260
really began 3
and 1/2 years ago,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.780
my brother gave
me a Sega Genesis

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.020
for my birthday, which was
what we had when we were kids

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.210
because it was not a
super duper Nintendo.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.510
And as I was playing the
game, I was overwhelmed

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.860
by the nostalgia and
memories of how fun it was.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.430
And then after this
barrage of nostalgia,

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.771
I thought-- my mind was flooded
with questions about why did I

00:02:13.771 --> 00:02:14.770
end up with the Genesis.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.120
Where did Sega even come from?

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.760
I knew at the time that
Nintendo was the market leader,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.190
but I never realized that they
were so dynamically successful.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.020
I always imagined that it was
a Coke and Pepsi type of thing

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.980
where one had a little
bit more market share,

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.980
but I didn't realize at
the time that Nintendo

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.030
had over 90% of the market and
then Sega came out of nowhere

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.610
and then kind of flamed out.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.160
And so to try to figure out what
happened to Sega, where they

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.390
came from, how they were
able to really break through,

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.180
I went to the Barnes &amp;
Noble on 86th Street.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.210
It's a nice two-story
Barnes &amp; Noble.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.720
And I was looking for the
video game history section,

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.540
and so I was at the
film history section,

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.206
right next to the
music history section,

00:02:52.206 --> 00:02:54.520
and I couldn't find this
video game history section.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.630
And I went to the woman at
the little question mark

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.286
information desk,
and I said, hey,

00:02:59.286 --> 00:03:00.910
where's the video
game history section?

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.642
And she literally laughed at me.

00:03:03.642 --> 00:03:05.600
And she said there's no
such section like that.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.780
And I said all right,
well, how about can

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.738
I just have one of the
books on Sega, Nintendo,

00:03:08.738 --> 00:03:10.430
or the history of video games?

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.810
And not only was there
no history section,

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.310
but they didn't even have a
single book in the entire store

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.620
on the history of video games,
the business of video games.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.161
All they had were
walk-through guides

00:03:19.161 --> 00:03:21.012
to the current video games.

00:03:21.012 --> 00:03:22.720
And I just thought
that was very strange.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.110
At the time, I was a bit of
an outsider to the world.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.235
I had played video games
as a ton when I was a kid,

00:03:27.235 --> 00:03:28.400
but not too much recently.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.240
But I knew it was
a big industry.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.620
And I knew that it was at
least as big as film and music.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.970
And I thought that was really
surprising that for such

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.840
a big industry, such a
fascinating industry,

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.800
one that has such a pop cultural
footprint, that there wasn't

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.380
a book out there that a
mainstream audience, or even

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.660
a very devoted
audience, can buy.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.100
And so I looked on
the internet, and I

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.820
found that there were some books
out there, some smaller print

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.330
books, some out of
print, but the only one

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.060
that really touched
on this topic the way

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.740
that I liked to read
books-- my favorite books

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.001
are "Disney War," "The
Smartest Guys in the Room,"

00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:05.750
books about the behind
the scenes business

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.515
dealings and also just sort
of about startup culture.

00:04:08.515 --> 00:04:10.140
The only one the
really touched on that

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.514
was David Sheff
book "Game Over,"

00:04:11.514 --> 00:04:15.090
which talked about the rise
of Nintendo in the 1980s.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.190
And it was really great.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.120
I never realized that
there was this video game

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.339
crash, this Atari crash
that people called it,

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:25.240
from 1993, where a
glut of bad games

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.630
and competing systems that
didn't work with one another

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.044
really led to what
people thought

00:04:30.044 --> 00:04:31.210
was the end of the industry.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.510
And in hindsight, thinking that
video games were dead in 1993

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.880
seems silly, but I can
understand at the time

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.115
because the personal computer
was rising in popularity.

00:04:40.115 --> 00:04:42.552
And I think there was a
possibility that that would

00:04:42.552 --> 00:04:44.010
have really caught
on, and Nintendo

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.926
wouldn't have been around,
and we never really

00:04:45.926 --> 00:04:48.510
would have had video games in
the capacity we have now, which

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.650
is the extent to what happened
in Europe where Nintendo didn't

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.840
get there until a
little bit later.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.840
But anyway, so I was
reading this Nintendo book,

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.170
and I was enjoying it.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.450
And it got to 19-- the
book was written in 1992,

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.494
and it got to the part where
Sega comes on the scene.

00:05:03.494 --> 00:05:04.910
And I thought, all
right, now it's

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.020
getting really interesting.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.710
Nintendo now has a competitor.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.670
They have 95% of the market.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.710
I know that that changes
the next few years,

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:13.770
and the book ended.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.780
And it said, with the
promise of multimedia

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.850
and this world wide web
in the coming years,

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.517
we'll find out what happens.

00:05:20.517 --> 00:05:22.100
And I wanted to find
out what happens.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.350
And so I had made a
list of those people

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.080
I thought could
help me from Sega.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.880
At the time, I had no writing
credits and no produced

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.510
screenplays so
that it was pretty

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.235
tough to get in touch with
them, but everything really

00:05:36.235 --> 00:05:38.610
changed for me when I got in
touch with Tom Kolinsky, who

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.930
was the president of Sega of
America from 1990 to 1996,

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.250
which up until that point,
I realized was probably

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.490
the interesting
time I felt like.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.810
And everything I was reading,
though limited, it kind of went

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.800
from A to C. There was this
rise of Nintendo in the 1980s

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.810
and resurrecting the
video game industry,

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.229
and then there was somehow
Nintendo had a decline,

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:01.020
and Sony entered the
market, and everything

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.080
got very different
and much more modern.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.780
There was this time
period, this point B

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.750
where something
happened with Sega.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.180
They somehow give Nintendo
a run for their money

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.835
and then somehow disappeared.

00:06:10.835 --> 00:06:12.710
And so I got in touch
with Tom, and then that

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.990
was really when
things crystallized.

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.000
It added a human
face to the story,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.370
and coming at this
as an outsider,

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.840
it was really helpful to
see it through his eyes.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.856
I also quickly realized
that Tom Kalinske,

00:06:26.856 --> 00:06:28.730
more than any other
adult besides my parents,

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.500
was probably most
responsible for my childhood.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.190
Before I asked him
naturally, hey Tom,

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.040
what did you do before
you got to Sega?

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.560
And he said, well,
after college,

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.800
I was at J. Walter
Thompson ad agency.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.310
My job there was to take
existing product lines

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.224
and figure out new uses
for them, new branding.

00:06:48.224 --> 00:06:49.890
And so they had adult
vitamins, and they

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:52.075
created children's vitamins,
and they licensed them

00:06:52.075 --> 00:06:52.950
with the Flintstones.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:56.030
And they created Flinstone's
chewable vitamins.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.840
And I was like, huh, that was
all I ever wanted as a kid.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.270
And then after that,
he went on to Mattel,

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.330
and he joined
right after Barbie.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:05.710
The Barbie line--
the Barbie doll

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.890
had had their first down year.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:11.010
And the founder and
CEO, Ruth Handler,

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.330
said Tom, what do you
think about Barbie?

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.567
The analysts are
saying her run is over.

00:07:15.567 --> 00:07:16.900
Should we focus on other things?

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.320
And he said, no that's the
stupidest thing I ever heard.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.604
Barbie can be
anything to any girl.

00:07:22.604 --> 00:07:24.020
She put him in
charge of the line,

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.250
and he resurrected that
doll and turned her

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.000
into a billion dollar
a year industry

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.842
by segmenting the
market and coming up

00:07:29.842 --> 00:07:32.300
with various different Barbies,
for various different price

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.560
points, like Doctor
Barbie, Space Barbie,

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.050
and also working with Ken and
giving him some screen time.

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:41.460
And then after that, he
just had a string of hits

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.060
at Mattel, my favorite
being the Popples toy,

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.430
which for some reason
I really enjoyed.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:49.220
And then he was asked to do for
boys what Barbie did for girls,

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.605
and he helped develop He-Man
Masters of the Universe.

00:07:52.605 --> 00:07:54.480
And then after that he
went to Matchbox cars.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.672
And just hearing hit after
hit, I was just like,

00:07:56.672 --> 00:07:58.963
oh my god, I should have been
much more nervous meeting

00:07:58.963 --> 00:08:00.890
with this guy.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:02.406
And prior to
speaking with him, I

00:08:02.406 --> 00:08:04.780
knew very little because there
was very little out there.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:08.716
And I googled him, and
I saw he had a Wikipedia

00:08:08.716 --> 00:08:09.840
page that was pretty short.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.260
But that was just
what got me thinking

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.250
about how there was all these
great people behind the scenes

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.870
that really changed the
video game industry, not just

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.280
affecting our lives back
then, but also transforming it

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.470
from a series of fad
like childish play things

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.080
to big business.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.790
And it shocked me that nobody
had really written about it,

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:30.650
and I decided that I
want to write about it.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.590
And so after speaking
with Tom, my first step

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.487
was to just compile my thoughts.

00:08:35.487 --> 00:08:37.070
Actually, my greatest
resource was one

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.319
that I had made so much fun
of until that point, which

00:08:39.319 --> 00:08:40.690
is LinkedIn.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.159
I used to think that it was very
silly and Facebook for work,

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:45.880
but I just typed
in Sega Nintendo,

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.520
and I saw thousands
of people who

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.770
were there at these companies.

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:51.470
And it was a numbers game,
about 10% responded to me,

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:52.770
and I built up my network.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:55.040
And I put together
this treatment.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:58.150
There was about 25
pages that started

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:01.170
to sum up why Sega had been
able to compete with Nintendo

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.710
and to get to know the men
and women behind the scenes

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.050
at these counsel wars.

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:07.990
And this was the
baseline for what

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:09.970
would become my book proposal.

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:14.007
And while writing about--
particularly about Sega,

00:09:14.007 --> 00:09:16.590
and learning about how they were
able to compete with Nintendo

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.940
and some of their clever,
creative marketing strategies,

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.110
which I liken a lot to
"Moneyball", just a smaller

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:25.710
competitor with 1/10 of
the budget, using creative

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:30.950
means to compete with the
big giant of Nintendo.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.260
I felt like I started to
employ these strategies,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.634
and I noticed that one of the
things that Sega did really

00:09:35.634 --> 00:09:41.060
well was to align themselves
with celebrities that

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:44.450
were hip and cool and got
their message out there.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.180
And I thought that
there would be nobody

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.260
better to help get the
story of "Console Wars"

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.180
out there than Seth Rogen.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.800
And so I asked my agent
if he could send over

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.520
my treatment to Seth.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.530
I thought there was
no chance at all

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:59.640
that he would possibly
respond, but he did,

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.887
and he really liked it.

00:10:00.887 --> 00:10:02.720
And I went out to go
meet with Seth and Evan

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.650
in January of 2012.

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:07.470
And we talked about
our experiences.

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:09.300
And Seth and Evan,
they're writing,

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.657
directing business partners.

00:10:10.657 --> 00:10:12.365
And the best part
about that is that they

00:10:12.365 --> 00:10:14.022
were childhood
friends, so everything

00:10:14.022 --> 00:10:15.730
we were talking about
resonated with them

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:20.090
and brought back memories, just
as it had been doing for me.

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:23.380
And we ended up deciding that
they would produce the feature

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.970
film version based on my book,
which I still had yet to write.

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:28.730
I hadn't even yet to
write up a book proposal.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.060
And so I had a lot of pressure.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.120
And then also, they were going
to produce a documentary.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.940
And so having them in our
corner, and then eventually

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.120
having Scott [INAUDIBLE]
in our corner as well,

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.750
was really the best compliment
I could have possibly received

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:45.380
beside from the fact
that it was just

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.680
really wonderful to have them.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.900
Meanwhile, at that
point, I still

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.420
had not been very successful
in the writing world,

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:55.100
and I remember meeting with
Seth and Evan on a Thursday,

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.750
and then Monday I was back in
my day job trading commodities.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:00.260
And I felt like
there is something

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.301
wrong with this picture
that is just met my hero,

00:11:02.301 --> 00:11:04.450
and here I am back
trading commodities.

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:06.940
But it ended up
working out really

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.409
well how much time I had.

00:11:09.409 --> 00:11:11.700
I ended up spending three
years researching and writing

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:12.760
this project.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.412
And although at
any point, I would

00:11:14.412 --> 00:11:15.870
have loved to have
just left my job

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:18.930
and had this book in stores,
having that extra time really

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:21.259
helped me build relationships
with these people,

00:11:21.259 --> 00:11:23.050
specifically in the
case of Nintendo, which

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:27.230
is a very interesting and very
secretive, closed off company.

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:28.670
Having that extra
time was really

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:32.270
useful to try to push
down those barriers

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:34.880
and using whatever leverage
I picked up along the way

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.860
to get them to speak with me.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:43.570
But anyway, the one thing that
I always found surprising,

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:45.487
going back to how
strange it was to me

00:11:45.487 --> 00:11:47.320
that there was no video
game history section

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:51.340
and there were so few video
game books, even when I had Seth

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.930
and Evan and Scott onboard
doing this feature film

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:56.630
and also doing this documentary,
when the book proposal went

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:59.440
out, it went out
to 24 publishers.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.140
And 21 of them
passed, and the reason

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:04.160
was video game books don't sell.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.916
And I thought that was
very odd because there

00:12:06.916 --> 00:12:08.290
had been so few
video game books,

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:10.580
and that was the reason I
wanted to write this book.

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.910
But HarperCollins saw
the potential in it

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:17.230
and saw it as that "Moneyball",
accidental billionaire,

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.130
social network type of story.

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:22.090
And I sold the book
proposal to them,

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:25.780
and I got to quit my commodity
job and work on this full time.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:30.010
And I spent all of
2013 writing the book

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:32.850
and also directing
the documentary.

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:36.240
And as I mentioned
earlier, one of the things

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.320
I didn't realize at all was
how successful Nintendo was.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.950
I knew that they were
the market leader,

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:44.930
but I didn't realize that
they had 95% of the market

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.720
and that they had done
that by really just

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.280
controlling everything.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.080
Hearing it mostly from the
Sega prospective at first

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:55.220
caused me to see Nintendo
as the villain of the story,

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:58.180
or at least the Goliath in
this David and Goliath tale.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:02.540
But a turning point for me
was likening them to Apple

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.530
and just seeing their
obsession with having a closed

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:07.310
system, a closed
network, and controlling

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:08.602
every aspect of the experience.

00:13:08.602 --> 00:13:11.018
And I could understand why
that rubs people the wrong way,

00:13:11.018 --> 00:13:13.100
and I could also understand
why some people would

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.410
sympathize with that.

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:19.020
I got to hear about
everything from Sega,

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.480
and some of my favorite
stories from there,

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.860
in terms of the
"Moneyball" strategies,

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.580
was the one that really
hooked me and got

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.950
me early on in my first
conversation with Tom

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:32.560
was Nintendo was so
dominant that they accounted

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:37.130
for about 25% of revenues
at retailers in 1989.

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:40.990
In 1989, actually, of the
top 30 toys, 25 of them

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:43.200
were Nintendo or Nintendo
related products.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:47.850
And they just really had such
a stranglehold on this industry

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:50.920
to the point where the suggested
retail price was not just

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:51.620
a suggestion.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:55.980
And that led to antitrust
lawsuits in 1991.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.950
But Sega, they had
what they thought

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:01.900
was a superior system, which
was the 16-bit Genesis that

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:03.890
was out before
Nintendo had the Super

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:07.070
Famicom or the 16-bit
Super Nintendo.

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.180
And so they went
to Walmart, which

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.460
was one of the important
retailers at the time,

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.520
and they pitched
the Sega Genesis

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:14.790
to the electronics merchant.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.750
And he thought, this
is a great system.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.960
I could see people enjoying
this and buying this.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.030
And so Tom thought,
all right, great.

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:22.690
We'll give you an order form.

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:25.500
And he said, no.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:28.180
They did not want to
carry Genesis products

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.340
for fear of upsetting Nintendo.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:35.560
Nintendo was so strict,
and also so reactionary,

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.380
that if people ever
changed the price

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:41.390
or if people did things they
didn't enjoy, they would--

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:43.350
shipments would
mysteriously vanish

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:45.610
and they wouldn't get
their full orders.

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:48.230
And so Sega knew that this
is what they were up against,

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:52.300
and they used some sort
of grassroots campaign.

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.440
Tom and Shinobu Toyoda,
his right-hand man,

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.490
were leaving
Bentonville, Arkansas

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:59.680
after another bad meeting
that went along these lines.

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.050
And they were in
the cab, and they

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:06.150
saw that there was a
retail space, a big mall

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:09.440
across the street from Walmart's
headquarters in Bentonville.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.620
And they went inside.

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:12.514
They asked to take
a look at the space.

00:15:12.514 --> 00:15:14.680
They ended up buying the
space, and they turned this

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.670
into a Genesis store
where people can come in

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:19.200
for free, across the street
from Walmart headquarters,

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.280
play Genesis.

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.152
They didn't sell the
Genesis, so this way,

00:15:22.152 --> 00:15:24.110
everyone that went in
there and liked it, would

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:27.060
go into the flagship Walmart and
say, hey, can I get a Genesis,

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:28.630
and they would be told no.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:31.844
And eventually, this got
so bad, with not only that,

00:15:31.844 --> 00:15:33.510
but they bought every
billboard in town.

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:37.700
They bought seat warmers at the
college football games there,

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.659
and eventually the Walmart
electronics merchant

00:15:39.659 --> 00:15:41.533
called Tom and said, we
raise the white flag.

00:15:41.533 --> 00:15:42.630
My bosses are killing me.

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:44.600
Just please get
rid of that store.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.510
We'll carry the Genesis.

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:47.920
And so it was a
lot of strategies

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.720
like that that really
got me into this book

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.215
because those are just
universal business stories.

00:15:53.215 --> 00:15:55.090
And as I mentioned
earlier, my favorite books

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:58.870
are ones about the tech industry
and about startup culture

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:00.920
and about how
underdogs can compete

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:04.190
with people like Nintendo.

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:07.500
And there's was a lot of
stories I found along the way,

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:11.470
but I'd love to answer questions
that you guys might have.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:16.040
I think that might be a
better way to discuss this.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.720
Anybody have any questions?

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.710
Well, how about,
before we do that,

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:23.260
a show of hands of who
was on team Nintendo

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.370
and who was on team
Sega back in the day.

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:26.600
Who here had a Genesis?

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:34.270
And what about a Super Nintendo?

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:36.490
It's evenly split.

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:39.720
And who here got beat up on the
schoolyard fighting this out?

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:44.110
All right, so any questions
that you guys might have?

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:47.870
Hey.

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:50.230
AUDIENCE: So currently
they're having

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:53.630
a bit of trouble
currently against things

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:57.580
like Xbox and PlayStation
3, 4, whatever.

00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.959
Are you seeing any
parallel now that

00:16:59.959 --> 00:17:02.000
is happening between--
that happened between Sega

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.270
and Nintendo that is
happening currently

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:06.089
with current consoles.

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:07.880
BLAKE J. HARRIS: Absolutely.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.254
The book came out about a month
ago, and most of the times

00:17:11.254 --> 00:17:13.660
that I've been able to
speak with people about it,

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:16.900
they inevitably ask, what do you
think about Nintendo nowadays?

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.640
They're a distant
third in the market.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:24.520
And though the book really
focuses on 1990 to 1996,

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.770
from the NES to the Sega
Saturn, Nintendo 64,

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:30.350
you really learn about
Nintendo and the blueprint

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:32.290
of the company and
just their and strategy

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:33.790
And it's not
surprising at all to me

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:35.890
that they're in the position
that they are today.

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:37.465
The last section
of the book, which

00:17:37.465 --> 00:17:39.090
is broken into five
sections, is called

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:40.330
the tortoise and the hare.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:43.370
And I think that Nintendo,
during this time,

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:47.600
really was very much the
tortoise, just not reacting

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.830
to Sega for a while, very
much to their detriment.

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:52.420
And then in the
end, particularly

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.570
because of Donkey Kong
Country, and because they

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:57.070
stuck with the Super
Nintendo while Sega got more

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:59.680
into hardware and
32X and the Sega CD,

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.120
Nintendo ended up winning
with the extension of the life

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.720
cycle.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.331
But think about the parable
of the tortoise and the hare.

00:18:07.331 --> 00:18:09.580
It's really just a matter
of where the finish line is.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:11.730
If the finish line
had been in 1993,

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:14.220
you would have said they are
idiotic not to react and not

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:15.740
to change what they were doing.

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.990
And I think that's a little
bit of the case right now.

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:20.550
I was at E3 last week,
and Nintendo showcased

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:23.020
a lot of great new games, so
maybe they'll turn it around.

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:26.130
But if the finish line was
right now, they failed.

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:29.640
And that shows their
failure to adapt.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.950
They still make
games for families

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:37.160
and for small children,
and I had an opportunity

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.115
to meet with their
current president,

00:18:40.115 --> 00:18:43.680
and I asked him about-- one of
the best things Nintendo has,

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.930
their greatest assets is
there IP, all those great IPs.

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:49.490
And I said, you guys
make great games.

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:52.900
I have a Wii U. There's no doubt
that Mario Kart 8 is fantastic.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.310
But also I'm 31 years old now.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:59.420
I grew up with Mario
and Zelda and Kirby.

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:02.480
And as much as you're still
appealing to young kids,

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.004
there's also those
of us who grew up

00:19:04.004 --> 00:19:05.670
that would maybe like
to see you do more

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:06.961
with the IP that appeals to us.

00:19:06.961 --> 00:19:11.520
Maybe TV shows, movies,
things with a little bit

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:15.400
more adult themes that
don't need to be killing

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.690
and gory stuff, but I
think Nintendo has really

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:20.810
dropped the ball
in that capacity,

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:25.450
and that's why you see them so
far behind Sony and Microsoft.

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:29.390
And the one thing that I
really saw with Nintendo

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:33.280
throughout this processes
was they were so not

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.470
into the marketing of the
games, and they really

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:37.990
focused on product development.

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:40.900
And as consumers, for the most
part, that's a good thing.

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:45.130
But it becomes a
bad thing when I

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:47.920
want to play the Wii with
friends and nobody has it

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.572
because Nintendo
doesn't really know

00:19:50.572 --> 00:19:51.780
what they're doing with this.

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.196
It comes with a
tablet, the Wii U.

00:19:53.196 --> 00:19:54.670
I don't really understand why.

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:58.120
I think that in a lot of my
stories about playing consoles,

00:19:58.120 --> 00:19:59.930
it was always we,
me and my brother,

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:02.430
and if there was only one tablet
between the two of us, that

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:04.040
would have gone very poorly.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.140
So those are the
marketing decisions

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:09.019
that I think Nintendo
just seems to shrug off

00:20:09.019 --> 00:20:11.310
and say, we don't care about
that we as long as we have

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:14.380
good games, that's
really hurt them.

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:18.770
And back then, losing in
the counsel wars, at least

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:21.874
at first, wasn't the
worst thing in the world

00:20:21.874 --> 00:20:23.790
because they had a war
chest of money saved up

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:25.600
from their Nintendo success.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:29.080
And making games at that
time cost about $1 million,

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.140
maybe $2 million,
whereas nowadays it

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:33.064
can cost tens of
millions of dollars,

00:20:33.064 --> 00:20:34.230
not to mention the hardware.

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:37.170
So falling behind is
not such a simple fixes

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:38.030
as it was back then.

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:42.910
AUDIENCE: So slightly
unfair question

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:44.876
about a different--
"Game Over," again

00:20:44.876 --> 00:20:47.000
because I've read that book
but not read your book.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.010
But you brought it up.

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.070
So apparently, Nintendo
back in the day

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:52.030
wouldn't let you
lower the price.

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:53.740
I never understood
why Nintendo cared.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.270
Like, I'm Nintendo,
and I sell you

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.840
a bunch of video
games for $30 a piece,

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.310
and you want to
capitalize yourself

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:01.710
by selling it for $32,
rather than the suggested

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:03.260
price of $40 or $50.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.914
What skin off
Nintendo's back is that?

00:21:05.914 --> 00:21:07.330
I never understood
why they cared.

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:08.590
They clearly did care.

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:11.300
Was it just
irrational or did they

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.750
have some reason behind it?

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:18.047
BLAKE J. HARRIS: From
the Nintendo mindset,

00:21:18.047 --> 00:21:20.130
there was a sense that
they were doing God's work,

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:22.070
but they also thought
that to do that work,

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:27.300
it was to absolutely control
the quantities of things.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:30.610
In their mind, they saw the
Atari crash, the video game

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:33.930
crash, resulting from not
just a glut of bad products,

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:36.730
but just a glut of too many
products, of too many choices.

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:39.560
And even Mr. Arakawa,
Minoru Arakawa,

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.805
their president, when
people would say, oh,

00:21:41.805 --> 00:21:44.180
Zelda is doing great in Japan,
why don't we bring it over

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:44.770
here?

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:48.000
He would say, no, I want
only this one game to really

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.990
be played by people at one time.

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:51.599
So even in that
situation where it

00:21:51.599 --> 00:21:53.140
seemed like what do
you have to lose,

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:55.190
you are not really
cannibalizing yourself here,

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.530
you're bring in other
game, they really

00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:00.920
wanted to dictate every aspect
of the consumer experience.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.150
And sometimes, it was
to their detriment.

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:07.450
So I understand--
they sued Galoob,

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:09.230
who were the makers
of the Game Genie,

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:12.270
because they felt like that
altered their copyright.

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:15.680
And the Game Genie was
video game steroids

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:20.440
to help you cheat to get the
higher levels and extra lives.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.150
So I understand that
Nintendo believing

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:24.233
that that changed the
integrity of their products.

00:22:24.233 --> 00:22:26.650
I can understand them
entering litigation there.

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:29.410
But what I never understood
was they went after Blockbuster

00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:32.480
and mom and pop video stores
for renting out their games.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.360
And to me that seemed
like another situation

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:38.129
where, if they wanted the best
experience for their consumers,

00:22:38.129 --> 00:22:40.170
having the chance to play
the games before-- Back

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:42.230
then you'd spend $50,
and without the internet,

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:44.930
it was just based on
the back of the box.

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:46.770
That seemed like
why would they be

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:51.900
so vigilant about
trying to control that.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.990
So I wish I had a better
answer for you other than

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:57.680
that they just seemed very
obsessed with controlling

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:01.900
everything and do everything
on their own terms.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:02.400
Hey.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.066
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:23:03.066 --> 00:23:04.890
To keep it on
Nintendo, you talked

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:07.996
about how they're a very--
tend to be closed off company

00:23:07.996 --> 00:23:08.870
and not like to talk.

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:11.960
Did you find in your
process that it was easier

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:15.190
to talk to maybe former Nintendo
employees rather than people

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:18.210
who are still there and had
been there back in the day?

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:22.310
BLAKE J. HARRIS: Yeah, that's
a really good question, one,

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:24.890
because there's so few
former Nintendo employees.

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:28.430
Sega was based in
Redwood Shores and prior

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:30.280
to that was in
South San Francisco.

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:34.150
And so they really
were in Silicon Valley

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:37.040
or just in the area where
a lot of tech was going on.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:41.100
And also that
mentality where it was

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:43.040
understandable to go
into and out of a company

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.690
and to do something for
a short amount of time

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:46.620
and come out, whereas
Nintendo was really

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.850
much more like the traditional
Japanese company where once you

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:52.740
signed up there and decide
you were going to be there,

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:55.490
you were there for
the rest of your life.

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:57.980
So speaking with
people from Nintendo,

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:01.220
I felt like they
were all lifers.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:04.020
About 25% of the people I wanted
to speak with were still there.

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:06.790
But even the 75% had all
left in the past five years

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:09.360
and were all very
protective of the company.

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.490
And I think because the
premise of my project

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:16.510
was Sega Nintendo, that was
like a dreaded word, Sega,

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:19.755
and it just brought
back bad memories.

00:24:19.755 --> 00:24:21.961
It was really hard to
speak with them at first,

00:24:21.961 --> 00:24:23.460
and that was where
it ended up being

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:26.060
very positive that the
project took three years.

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.590
Howard Lincoln was the
senior vice president

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:30.060
of Nintendo of America.

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:32.660
He went on to become
the chairman in 1994

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:36.080
after the president of NCL,
the parent company of Nintendo,

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.250
thought that his son-in-law
was doing a bad job

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:41.030
and put Howard in
charge for what

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:43.520
he thought was failure
with the Super Nintendo.

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.690
And I contacted Howard
three years ago.

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:47.190
I actually contacted
the secretary,

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:49.392
and she said, sorry,
Howard's busy.

00:24:49.392 --> 00:24:50.600
Contacted a few months later.

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:51.370
Sorry, Howard's busy.

00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:53.020
I contacted Howard directly
because I figured out

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:54.728
the email structure,
and she said, please

00:24:54.728 --> 00:24:56.860
don't contact Howard directly.

00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:59.110
And so I kept trying
to contact them

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:02.610
because not only was I just
curious what he would have

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:05.824
to say, but I also thought that
it was unfair as a journalist

00:25:05.824 --> 00:25:07.240
to get most of the
story from Sega

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:11.200
even though the story was
becoming more about Sega.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:16.580
And that was where having a book
sold and having Seth on board

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:19.170
put me in a good spot because
eventually, in early 2013,

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:22.050
I said I know that I'm not
supposed to contact Howard

00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:25.990
directly, but there's going
to be two movies and a book.

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:30.740
And Howard, and many others, are
featured a lot in this story.

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:32.950
And up to this point,
it's almost exclusively

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:35.290
from his competitors
prospective.

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:37.710
I think that if he's OK
with that, I'm OK with that.

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:39.270
But he might want to rectify it.

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:42.532
And even in that situation
where his secretary

00:25:42.532 --> 00:25:43.990
wrote back and
said, oh OK, I think

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:46.560
we should really get
Howard in on this now.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:50.070
So they decided like this
seemed like a good idea.

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:52.790
They put me in touch with
GolinHarris, they're ad agency,

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:54.590
and I told them
about my project.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:59.330
And that was in March of 2013,
it took them 2 and 1/2 months

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:01.214
to get back to me,
and they said I

00:26:01.214 --> 00:26:02.630
was approved to
speak with Howard.

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:04.963
And I was really excited, and
I contacted all the people

00:26:04.963 --> 00:26:06.890
from Nintendo of
America to let them

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:10.470
know because that was implicit
approval from Nintendo

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:12.440
of America because
Howard is currently

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.914
the CEO of the Mariners,
which Nintendo owns.

00:26:14.914 --> 00:26:16.330
So they were like,
all right, now,

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:17.913
I feel better about
speaking with you.

00:26:17.913 --> 00:26:19.300
I'll speak with you on camera.

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.110
And then two days
later, GolinHarris

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:24.290
told me, oh, actually your
status is back to pending,

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:26.880
with no explanation.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.340
And then everyone that I had
told from Nintendo America

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.173
thought I was lying to
them when I told them

00:26:31.173 --> 00:26:32.909
I had approval from Howard.

00:26:32.909 --> 00:26:34.450
And eventually got
to the point where

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:38.080
I was going out there
to film, last year,

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:41.510
six people, not including Howard
Lincoln, Nintendo of America

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:45.560
called all them, reminded them
about their NDA agreements,

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:49.770
did as much as they could to
get them to not speak with me.

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:51.470
But luckily, a few
of them did feel

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:54.650
like not only did they had
built a relationship with me,

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:58.022
but also that like guys if
we don't get in on this,

00:26:58.022 --> 00:26:59.230
they're going to railroad us.

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:02.420
We're not going to get to
tell our side of the story.

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:05.850
And that went well, and then
eventually I got a call,

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:08.120
and they said OK you
can speak with Howard.

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:12.960
But I had to-- yeah, so from
my perspective, that is also

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.460
indicative of where
Nintendo-- of why

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:17.330
they are where they are today.

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:19.580
Not that I-- I think
that they should

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:22.360
have said three years ago,
OK, this random writer

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:25.360
with no credits, we should make
the time to speak with him.

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.980
But it was just that every
step along the process

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:31.050
felt like it was 10 times
harder than it needed to be.

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:32.970
And in the end, all I
was really trying to do

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:35.860
was to tell their story,
and the more information

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:38.194
I had, especially in the
sense that I was writing it

00:27:38.194 --> 00:27:40.360
where I wanted it to be as
collaborative as possible

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.470
and share the chapters
as I was going,

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:43.970
I felt like it could
only help them.

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:48.250
And I felt like they were
just hurting themselves.

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:51.620
Though I think that, in the
past year, they've-- actually,

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:53.230
the found-- not the founder.

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:56.150
The previous head of
Nintendo who was there

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:58.980
for several decades, Hiroshi
Yamauchi, passed away,

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:02.480
and I think that things
are changing a little bit.

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.070
And that was my
experience with Nintendo.

00:28:08.798 --> 00:28:09.900
Hey, sorry.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.680
AUDIENCE: Hi, so if
you'll forgive me

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:13.960
for geeking up for a second.

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:14.600
BLAKE J. HARRIS:
That's all right.

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.558
AUDIENCE: A couple of
related points, something

00:28:16.558 --> 00:28:18.680
I find interesting
about Nintendo's history

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:23.050
is both the gimmicks
and all the accessories

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:25.130
and the diversification
of their product lines.

00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:28.600
So there's things like the
Virtual Boy in the 3DS.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:34.745
And the product lines, like I
said, the Game Boy especially,

00:28:34.745 --> 00:28:36.620
there's the original,
and there's the pocket,

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:37.690
and there's the
color, and there's

00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:40.220
the Advance, and the Advance
SP, and the Advanced Micro,

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:44.110
and the DS and the DSI,
and the 3DS and the 3DS XL,

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:47.090
and all of the crazy
accessories, like the mouse

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:49.347
for the Super Nintendo and
The Super Scope, so many

00:28:49.347 --> 00:28:51.680
more things including a huge
list that never made it out

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.219
of Japan.

00:28:52.219 --> 00:28:54.260
So that's one of things
I find really interesting

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:55.301
about Nintendo's history.

00:28:55.301 --> 00:28:57.900
I wonder if you have any
ideas or comments there

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.010
or if that factors
into your book at all.

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:01.300
BLAKE J. HARRIS: It does.

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:02.650
Well, two things come to mind.

00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:04.770
One is what was always
really interesting to me

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:08.210
in the "Console Wars," these
big great 16-bit machines

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:10.140
metaphorically fighting
against one another.

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:12.130
For Nintendo, what really
helped them sustain,

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:15.040
other than the profits that
they had gained from the '80s,

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.340
was the Game Boy.

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:19.600
That was the revenue stream
that always kept them going.

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.620
I think the game gear
was at least cooler.

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:22.980
It had color.

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:23.920
I had one.

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:26.500
That was what I thought
made me cool back then.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.960
But the battery
life was terrible.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.500
The games weren't as good.

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.841
And that was what
kept Nintendo afloat.

00:29:32.841 --> 00:29:35.090
The one thing I always really
respected about Nintendo

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:37.980
with the peripherals,
even including disasters

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:43.140
like Virtual Boy, they never
let that-- I guess just

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:45.640
because they weren't so heavily
emphasized on the marketing,

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.420
they never really let that
change their narrative.

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:50.820
They were there to give
you the console experience,

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:53.520
and if you wanted, you would
get these other things,

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.334
whereas I think Sega
did a little bit more

00:29:55.334 --> 00:29:57.000
of throwing them in
your face and trying

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
to make them much
more aspirational.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.390
And particularly in the case
of the Virtual Boy, which

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:03.770
I think most people would
agree was a terrible product

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:08.820
or at least not one they really
should have put both feet into,

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:11.950
the people that I spoke with
from Nintendo of America said,

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:13.520
we knew we had a dog.

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:17.550
And they were pretty blunt
about that with the retailers.

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:19.810
So it did come out and
there were commercials,

00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:23.484
but they didn't really
throw it out there

00:30:23.484 --> 00:30:25.650
and put a lot of money
behind it the same way that's

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:28.470
Saga did with the 32X, which
was another product that people

00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:32.390
didn't really enjoy and
felt like created baggage

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:35.730
and was showed distrust between
Sega and their consumers.

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:39.110
So I think it speaks to
Nintendo always trying

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:40.810
to innovate even
though they can be

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:43.940
a little stiff and rigid in
certain areas of the company.

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.540
They also had a
knitting machine.

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:50.012
They're willing to try things,
and that is pretty impressive.

00:30:50.012 --> 00:30:52.220
The one other thing I liked,
that is not in the book,

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:58.190
was they did a online
lottery in Minnesota in 1991.

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:00.210
And so they were
willing to try things.

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:02.860
But I think in the
end, Nintendo has

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:04.510
built a trust with
their consumers

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:06.140
that they're not
going to really push

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:07.680
for things that
aren't worth buying,

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.930
and I think that counts for
a lot for a company that's

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:12.510
been around as long as
they have and has done

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:14.910
the same sort of
thing over and over.

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:17.420
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:19.420
BLAKE J. HARRIS: Thank you.

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:21.470
AUDIENCE: So how
much of the structure

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:23.920
of the console
industry today do you

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.630
think was shaped by console
wars between Nintendo and Sega.

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:29.350
So like things like, when we
think about the four to seven

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:32.220
year of the console life cycle
and first party versus third

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:35.850
party games and subsidized or
at least break even hardware,

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:39.180
is that all stuff that is
inevitable or is that defined

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:39.722
in this era ?

00:31:39.722 --> 00:31:42.055
BLAKE J. HARRIS: I mean,
personally, I think a lot of it

00:31:42.055 --> 00:31:43.630
was defined in this era.

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:45.630
Since we don't have the
experiment of not having

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:47.254
the war, we don't
really know for sure.

00:31:47.254 --> 00:31:50.500
But the most important
thing, I think,

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.990
that also seems like
a no duh in hindsight,

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:57.020
is just that there was two
competitors in the market,

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.020
and they were both
very profitable.

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:01.690
Up until that point, I think
Atari have been very profitable

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:04.540
in the '70s, and then
Mattel and Coleco came along

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:06.920
and that ruined the
balance of power

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.390
and led to the industry, at
least from one perspective,

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:10.940
to spiral out of control.

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:13.440
And there was a sense that the
console industry could really

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.800
only sustain one
company, and maybe it

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.770
would be Sega,
Nintendo would fail,

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:20.940
but the fact that both of
them were able to succeed,

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:23.870
and then even Sony came into
the ring and also found success.

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:26.600
I think that alone is
pretty pivotal in terms

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:29.000
of giving the
confidence eventually

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.740
for Sony and Microsoft to
enter and for both of them

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:34.040
to be successful.

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:37.720
And then one thing
that even speaks

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:40.920
to what Nintendo does today is
they are focused on children

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:45.500
and that family friendly
type of product.

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:48.700
Back then, the games-- I
remember buying most of them

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:52.650
at Toys R Us and KB Toys, and
it was really a toy product.

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:56.650
And I think that what Sega
did, which was primarily

00:32:56.650 --> 00:32:59.340
from financial necessity at
first in terms of just zigging

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:00.950
wherever Nintendo
zagged, they went

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:03.860
after adults and teens and
a different demographic,

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:06.580
and they turned it more
into consumer electronic

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:08.470
and into a bigger business.

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:13.000
And so I think there was a
big tectonic shift of what

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.980
console business could be
through what Sega was doing

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:19.037
through-- who they
were advertising to.

00:33:19.037 --> 00:33:21.120
I learned you just see
throughout the book there's

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.900
a lot of innovations just
in terms of the first street

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:25.530
date for a video game.

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:28.410
Nowadays, that
seems commonplace,

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:31.840
but back then it was like
we'll get it to these retailers

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.630
whenever we get it to them,
then we'll get it to these guys.

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:37.972
And not only was that a
problem for just not being

00:33:37.972 --> 00:33:39.680
able to look forward
to like oh this game

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:43.840
comes out on September 17,
but Sega did such a great job

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:47.980
of Hollywoodizing the
industry and building up

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:51.130
the months of hype
leading up to that date.

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:54.560
So I think there was a lot of
changes during that period,

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.630
mostly from the marketing
standpoint of Sega

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:59.160
and then also just from
the infrastructure.

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:03.260
One of the climaxes of the
book is the Senate subcommittee

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:06.120
hearing in December of 1993,
where Joseph Lieberman brought

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:07.977
Sega Nintendo down
to Washington to talk

00:34:07.977 --> 00:34:09.810
about how violent these
games were becoming,

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:12.780
which maybe looking back
don't seem that violent.

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:15.730
But it was Mortal Kombat and a
game called Night Trap, which

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:19.350
was a terrible game
that was actually

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:20.830
invented seven years earlier.

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:23.179
And it was just silly to
me that it was involved.

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:26.300
But the resolution to
these subcommittee hearings

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:29.210
was that Sega Nintendo had
to put down their swords

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:31.679
and work together.

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:33.179
The only way that
they would get out

00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:35.659
of the government taking control
and regulating the industry

00:34:35.659 --> 00:34:37.784
and basically just controlling
what went in and out

00:34:37.784 --> 00:34:40.000
and hurting both these
companies in the long run

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.969
was to get them to sit
at a table together,

00:34:41.969 --> 00:34:43.420
and it was fun in the
book to actually write

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:45.628
about that meeting where
they had to sit at the table

00:34:45.628 --> 00:34:46.540
together.

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:50.520
And they just hated any idea
that the other one came up with

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.130
just for the sake
of-- in the end,

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:54.171
they came up with a rating
system that was almost

00:34:54.171 --> 00:34:56.377
identical to Sega's
rating system,

00:34:56.377 --> 00:34:58.460
but Nintendo wouldn't have
adopted that right away

00:34:58.460 --> 00:34:59.460
because it was Sega's.

00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:01.782
So they had to work together.

00:35:01.782 --> 00:35:03.740
And so long story short,
what they came up with

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:06.780
was the ESRB, the
Ratings Board, they also

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:09.980
came up with the
trade association,

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:12.114
which puts on the E3
trade show each year

00:35:12.114 --> 00:35:13.280
for the video game industry.

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.910
Up until that point, all
of the big presentations

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:18.780
and the big news and the only
time that actually the Sega

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:21.280
Nintendo people would interact
in person was at the consumer

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:24.020
electronic shows in
Chicago and Vegas.

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:25.670
And now they had their own show.

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:28.730
And as much as my book is
the story of these characters

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:31.220
these pioneers as much
as it is about Sega

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:33.610
and how they're able to use
these underdog strategies,

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:36.620
it really is just about the
maturation industry during that

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:39.850
five year stretch to go from
Nintendo controlling it all

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:42.680
and selling their toys-- selling
their games in toy stores,

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.150
to having the first
E3 show and having

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:46.570
that we've arrived moment.

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.910
AUDIENCE: So I seem to remember
hearing a story about how,

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:56.320
at one point, Nintendo
basically had the opportunity

00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:00.279
to buy like what became the
PlayStation at some point,

00:36:00.279 --> 00:36:02.320
and I wonder if you had
any just comments on that

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:03.530
from your research.

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:04.840
BLAKE J. HARRIS: Sure.

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:08.520
So there was a point
when I was writing

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:11.700
the book-- I'd say early
on my biggest inspirations

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:14.240
were "Moneyball" and
Ben Mezrich's Accidental

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.070
Billionaires.

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:17.520
But I was speaking with a
guy named Olaf Olafsson, who

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.081
was at Sony during
that time period,

00:36:19.081 --> 00:36:20.830
and he has probably
the coolest name ever,

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:25.010
but he also was in charge of
Sony publishing entertainment,

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:27.930
which back then, Sony
was a third party.

00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:30.860
They made games mostly through
their company ImageSoft

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:32.520
that were for Nintendo.

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:34.850
And I was asking him
about sort of seeing it

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:38.000
from that perspective
before eventually creating

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.760
the PlayStation
and launching that.

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:42.360
And he said to me,
very explicitly,

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.900
I met with Howard Lincoln and
the other guys at Nintendo,

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:47.130
and they treated us like
slaves on a plantation.

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:50.489
I was like, wow, that's
pretty charged language there.

00:36:50.489 --> 00:36:51.030
Are you sure?

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:52.430
He's like, yeah,
it was terrible.

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:53.513
They dictated their terms.

00:36:53.513 --> 00:36:55.740
They treated us like slaves.

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:57.770
And so those two business
books I had mentioned

00:36:57.770 --> 00:36:59.500
had been my inspiration
up that point,

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:02.330
and I felt like after
that meeting with Olaf,

00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:05.030
I started really seeing
this as Game of Thrones,

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:06.900
that it was these
rival companies,

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:08.690
each feeling like
they were destined

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:13.050
to rise to the top or at
least deserve certain things

00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:16.890
or were being slighted
in certain ways.

00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:19.730
And so in the
particular case of Sony,

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:22.770
their story which lurks
throughout this narrative

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:25.470
and is like the third party
that you don't even realize

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:29.690
is going to be entering
the race, is in a-- 1991

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:32.400
at the summer consumer
electronics show,

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.890
Sony and Nintendo were
supposed to announce

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:37.200
that they had-- that
Sony had made a CD

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.830
attachment for
the Super Nintendo

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:40.830
that would be like the
equivalent of the Sega CD

00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:42.630
but for the Nintendo.

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:46.669
And on May 31, 1991, Olaf
made a presentation that

00:37:46.669 --> 00:37:48.210
was not heavily
attended because Sony

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:50.070
was a small player
at the time and said,

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:53.060
I'm pleased to announce
that Nintendo and Sony will

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:54.040
be making this device.

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:56.820
And then the next day, Nintendo
had their presentation.

00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:58.770
And this was much
more heavily attended,

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:00.550
and Howard Lincoln said,
we're pleased to announce

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:01.500
that we're doing
a CD attachment.

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:02.600
And Olaf was like, yeah.

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.780
And then he said that it's
going to be with Philips.

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:09.720
And so they very
publicly slighted Sony.

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.610
That also speaks
to a lot of what

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:12.860
Nintendo did during this time.

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:15.890
It's not always-- most of life
I don't think is what you say,

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:17.124
but how you say it.

00:38:17.124 --> 00:38:19.290
And they didn't always have
the best bedside manner,

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:21.650
or they at least wanted
to put their foot down

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:22.910
when they could.

00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:25.540
And so they went out of
their way to embarrass Sony

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:28.050
and not work with Sony
during that time period

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:30.370
to have what would've been
the Nintendo PlayStation

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:32.960
or some early iteration of that.

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:38.350
And what I always loved about
Sega was everything about them,

00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:41.740
in those early years, was just
a lemons to lemonade strategy.

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:43.850
And Tom Kalinske saw
that and thought,

00:38:43.850 --> 00:38:47.280
all right, well I
hate Nintendo too.

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.890
Let's talk.

00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:52.250
And so they met-- Tom
met with Olaf Olafsson,

00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:53.960
and they developed a
close relationship.

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:58.450
And they ended up-- they were
releasing their own Sega CD

00:38:58.450 --> 00:39:03.070
system, and they did not have
the necessary software, just

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:05.300
in terms of quantity
to get it out there,

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:07.802
and they said to Sony, you guys
are having a lot of trouble,

00:39:07.802 --> 00:39:09.260
Nintendo not
approving your titles,

00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:10.840
not letting you make
as many as you want,

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.465
which is not giving
you the opportunity

00:39:12.465 --> 00:39:15.319
to recoup your investment.

00:39:15.319 --> 00:39:17.860
Why don't you make as many games
as you want for the Sega CD?

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:19.520
We'll be partners in this.

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:22.240
We'll even have our guys
teach you how to make games

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:25.040
because one thing that I didn't
realize really early on or it

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:27.540
just didn't occur to me was
Sega Nintendo did have a lineage

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:30.980
in the arcade market whereas
Sony didn't, and Microsoft,

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:31.490
too, didn't.

00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:34.640
So they're even more outsiders
into the console world.

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:37.050
And so Sega and Sony
worked closely together.

00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:39.470
They actually--
when Sega officially

00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:41.750
launched the Sega CD, they
had a press conference

00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:44.830
in New York and Olaf
was there by their side,

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:47.640
like it was very much
almost like a joint venture.

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:49.520
And from that
point, that had gone

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:51.890
so well that Sega
of America and Tom

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:55.990
wanted to create the next
generation console together

00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:58.410
and continue to team
up against Nintendo.

00:39:58.410 --> 00:40:01.780
And they had produced--
for six months,

00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:05.110
Sega and Sony worked
in conjunction

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:08.360
to make what would have
been the Sega PlayStation.

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.560
And something that I
think we have done better

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:15.840
than the Sega Saturn, but Tom
brought this to Sega Japan,

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:20.140
and they rejected the idea, and
they broke up the partnership.

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:25.160
And that was what was really
fun for me with this project.

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:28.109
Going in, I assumed that the
battle between Sega Nintendo--

00:40:28.109 --> 00:40:30.650
that the most interesting story
the most interesting conflict

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:31.860
in the book would
be Sega Nintendo.

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:33.776
But it turned out to
really be Sega of America

00:40:33.776 --> 00:40:36.430
and Sega Japan and these
cultural differences

00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:41.240
that really, I think, resulted
in the failure of the company.

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:43.295
As much as we all
think Sega Nintendo

00:40:43.295 --> 00:40:44.990
and it brings us back
to a certain time

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:47.670
or it at least reminds
us of a corporate battle,

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:49.790
that was not the case in Japan.

00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:53.600
Over here, Sega did go from 5%
of the market to 55% or 60%.

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:56.080
In Japan, they never
really had more than 15%

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.410
or 20% on the market.

00:40:57.410 --> 00:40:59.827
So they had the same exact
products, the same exact games,

00:40:59.827 --> 00:41:01.451
but over there they
were not successful

00:41:01.451 --> 00:41:02.510
and over here they were.

00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:05.170
And that created enormous
friction between America

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:08.320
and Japan, not just of
the cultural confusion

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.944
of that nature, but these were
the people-- for the most part,

00:41:10.944 --> 00:41:12.360
they were making
all the hardware,

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:14.359
and they're making the
majority of the software,

00:41:14.359 --> 00:41:16.690
and they were watching
their subsidiary succeed.

00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:22.010
And they're dictatorial
leader Hayao Nakayama who's

00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:24.320
known to walk around with a
golf club and whack things

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.640
and was a very
intimidating force,

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:29.430
would say to them, why are
you guys not as successful

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:30.700
as they are in America?

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:32.390
And those a lot of reasons why.

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:35.660
I think some of it is just
their risk appetite, which

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:38.540
was much more limited
than those in America.

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:43.120
But another thing is the
laws against monopolies

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.040
and monopolistic
practices in Japan

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:47.630
are much easier than
they are over here,

00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:50.390
and Nintendo had much
more stranglehold.

00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:54.820
But the book
presents that dynamic

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:58.194
and says that as a result of
that conflict, that civil war,

00:41:58.194 --> 00:41:59.860
going on during this
console war, that's

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:02.180
the reason that Sony ended
up going on their own,

00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:06.090
and Sega ended up with a
failed hardware system.

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:09.650
And I guess Sony is laughing all
the way to the bank in the end.

00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:13.280
And it was sad to
read all about that.

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:18.490
And for me, because of
this conflict with Japan

00:42:18.490 --> 00:42:22.520
and because things didn't
end up rosy for Sega,

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:24.740
hearing that from Tom Kalinske
and Al Nilson, and all

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:27.240
the other employees, I was at
first immediately a little bit

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:30.566
skeptical about the role that
Japan had played at Sega.

00:42:30.566 --> 00:42:32.190
I thought you know
there's a little bit

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:34.035
of revisionist history
or them blaming

00:42:34.035 --> 00:42:36.160
all the failures on Japan
and taking credit for all

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:39.305
the successes, and that's
possibly true to some extent.

00:42:39.305 --> 00:42:40.680
But in the middle
of the project,

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.330
I got hired by
Sega to go to Japan

00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:45.800
and shoot some short
documentaries for them.

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.720
And I was hired
by Sega of America

00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:49.590
to go interview developers
from Sega Japan,

00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:51.950
and I saw firsthand
that, to this day,

00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:55.300
the conflict between
both sides is terrible.

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:59.689
Everything that Sega of America
asked for, Sega of Japan

00:42:59.689 --> 00:43:00.480
wouldn't give them.

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:03.400
And it was always done in
a passive aggressive way.

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:06.820
And it was sad, and I guess that
also lent a lot of credibility

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:08.650
to me for what I
was hearing even

00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:12.070
though it was 20 years later.

00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:14.570
AUDIENCE: So I think in the
modern era of video games,

00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:18.700
a lot of developers gain
a lot of prominence.

00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:23.220
And they become super
celebrities in their own right.

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:26.315
I just had-- I haven't
read the full book yet,

00:43:26.315 --> 00:43:29.350
but I was wondering if you'd--
if it was that also true back

00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:29.850
then.

00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:31.433
Were there like super
star developers?

00:43:31.433 --> 00:43:33.600
Obviously, the whole
game media industry

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:35.190
wasn't as developed
so maybe they

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:40.092
weren't as prominent
in the game development

00:43:40.092 --> 00:43:41.050
environment or culture.

00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:42.070
But were they there?

00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:43.820
Were there like a few
superstar developers

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:45.548
that were doing that?

00:43:45.548 --> 00:43:46.464
BLAKE J. HARRIS: Yeah.

00:43:46.464 --> 00:43:46.550
No, that's a good question

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:49.008
AUDIENCE: Also, how did Sega
court them if they were there?

00:43:49.008 --> 00:43:50.842
How did they get them
to join the dark side?

00:43:50.842 --> 00:43:52.258
BLAKE J. HARRIS:
There were maybe,

00:43:52.258 --> 00:43:54.280
within the company, the
superstar developers.

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:57.242
But even when those
internally were aware,

00:43:57.242 --> 00:43:58.450
they weren't treated as such.

00:43:58.450 --> 00:44:01.690
They were treated just
like any other employee.

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:04.820
I mean particularly Shigeru
Miyamoto at Nintendo

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:09.120
and Yuji Naka at Sega, both
responsible for Mario and Sonic

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.600
respectively and a
bunch of other games,

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:13.472
were like the golden
geese at each company.

00:44:13.472 --> 00:44:15.180
They were popping out
these great titles,

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:18.770
but they were not
treated very well there.

00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:23.640
They did not, even early on,
get their names in the credits.

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.410
And actually, one
thing I never realized

00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:28.030
was that after Sonic one--
after the first Sonic

00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:31.600
game came out and was enormously
successful, Yuji Naka,

00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:33.510
because he was upset
about the lack of credit

00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:35.860
and the lack of respect
that he and his team

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:37.790
had gotten-- they
weren't even allowed

00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:41.980
to put their names in the
credits-- that they quit,

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:43.180
or he quit Sega.

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:47.610
And it took Shinobu Toyoda,
from Sega of America,

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:51.221
going over there and bringing
him to Sega of America

00:44:51.221 --> 00:44:53.470
where he worked at what they
called the Sega Technical

00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:56.080
Institute, which was supposed
to be a fusion of East and West.

00:44:56.080 --> 00:45:00.590
And they actually made
Sonic 2 in America.

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:03.372
And I felt like, in terms of
this cultural conflict, that

00:45:03.372 --> 00:45:05.080
was the high-point
for this relationship.

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:06.820
That was my favorite
game back then,

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:09.770
and I think also
showed what was best

00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:11.250
for both sides of the company.

00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:14.430
But it wasn't really
until, I think, Sony

00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:19.760
entered the picture, and until
games became a little bit more

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:23.244
sophisticated and
CD-based that developers

00:45:23.244 --> 00:45:24.660
got the respect
that they were due

00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:26.826
and were treated like the
rock stars that they were.

00:45:26.826 --> 00:45:28.310
I mean my book,
for the most part,

00:45:28.310 --> 00:45:31.110
focuses on the business
side and the executive side.

00:45:31.110 --> 00:45:33.040
And they deserve all
the credit in the world,

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.289
but, at the end of the day,
what they were selling,

00:45:35.289 --> 00:45:37.830
the underlying products, were
being made by these developers.

00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:40.246
They were the ones creating
the content, creating the IPs.

00:45:40.246 --> 00:45:43.270
And I think historically they
haven't been treated very well.

00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:48.200
And even nowadays, at those
big companies, particularly

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:50.700
the Japanese companies, I still
think that they don't really

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:51.866
get the respect they're due.

00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:56.650
AUDIENCE: Sega and
Sony are really--

00:45:56.650 --> 00:45:59.040
I mean Sega and Nintendo are
really friendly right now.

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:03.060
Sonics and Smash Brothers
and the winter Olympics game,

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:04.990
is that weird for
people working there?

00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:07.010
Like, are they upset?

00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:07.970
BLAKE J. HARRIS: Yeah.

00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:11.509
I mean for me, I remember
my seven-year-old cousin

00:46:11.509 --> 00:46:13.550
I was telling about the
project I was working on.

00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:14.633
I said, do you know Sonic?

00:46:14.633 --> 00:46:16.850
And he said, oh yeah,
he's friends with Mario.

00:46:16.850 --> 00:46:20.590
And I was like no,
he hates Mario!

00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:22.560
So it's weird for me.

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:26.250
But also, one of the best-- one
of the most fun parts for me,

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:28.370
as a writer and filmmaker
throughout all of this,

00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:30.560
is that speaking with
people from Sega Nintendo,

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:32.570
they still hate the other one.

00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:36.140
It wasn't like-- I initially
pitched it as a Magic Johnson

00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:38.200
and Larry Bird, like two
tough competitors that

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:39.510
pushed each other
to another level,

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:41.009
but put their arms
around each other

00:46:41.009 --> 00:46:43.780
at the end, that was
not the case here.

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:45.930
Because they both dislike
one another so much

00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:48.010
and still don't have
any kind things to say,

00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:49.627
they hate the idea.

00:46:49.627 --> 00:46:51.960
It's blasphemous that Sonic
and Mario would be together.

00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:59.610
I hate seeing it though I guess
it makes sense because Nintendo

00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:03.617
really has planted a flag in
what Sega used to paint them

00:47:03.617 --> 00:47:06.200
to be, which was that they were
the uncool company or at least

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:08.480
the one that was focused
on kid friendly products.

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:11.410
And Sonic really still is
that kid friendly product

00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:14.460
the my seven-year-old cousin
would know, so it's weird to me

00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:16.460
that they work together,
But I think it actually

00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:17.650
makes a lot of sense
from a business

00:47:17.650 --> 00:47:18.691
standpoint at this point.

00:47:21.474 --> 00:47:22.140
HOST: All right.

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:26.410
Let's just give Blake a great
round of applause for coming.

00:47:28.405 --> 00:47:29.530
BLAKE J. HARRIS: Thank you.

00:47:32.745 --> 00:47:34.540
HOST: And there are
copies of his book

00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:36.080
available from
McNally Booksellers

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:37.790
at a subsidized
price so if you're

00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:40.420
interested in that please
go and purchase them I'm

00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:43.507
sure Blake would be happy to
field any individual questions.

00:47:43.507 --> 00:47:45.590
BLAKE J. HARRIS: Yeah, I'm
happy to sign any books

00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:48.530
or I'm happy to
answer any questions.

00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:51.200
I really do love this topic, not
just because I grew up with it,

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:52.700
but I found it so fascinating.

00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:55.920
I felt like even if this is
about rival tissue companies,

00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:58.750
it would have been
90% as interesting.

00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:01.000
And I still continue to
do interviews and speak

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.100
with people and try to learn
more, even though at this point

00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:04.830
I mean maybe it'll be
in the paperback version

00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:06.330
or maybe it'll be
in something else,

00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:08.197
but I just find it
personally interesting.

00:48:08.197 --> 00:48:09.530
So feel free to ask me anything.

00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:10.740
I love talking about it.

00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:11.960
Thanks so much guys.

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:14.010
I really appreciate it.
