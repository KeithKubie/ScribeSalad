00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.144
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is very exciting, Lauren. Now, before we go to the next event, Susan said

00:00:04.144 --> 00:00:07.762
that this was an absolute threshold test. Does that have anything to do with

00:00:07.762 --> 00:00:09.885
the difference threshold test we saw earlier?

00:00:09.885 --> 00:00:13.770
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's a good question, Andy. It's related. Do you remember with the difference

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.046
threshold, we were looking at how much stimulus needed to change in order to

00:00:17.046 --> 00:00:18.630
detect it.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.276
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right. The contestants could detect a difference between like 100 and 105

00:00:22.276 --> 00:00:26.264
grams. But not necessarily 100 and 101.

00:00:26.264 --> 00:00:29.697
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Exactly. Well, with an absolute threashhold, we're looking to see how much of

00:00:29.697 --> 00:00:32.665
the stimulus is needed to be detected at all.

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:36.294
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay, I think I see. So, we're answering different questions. For example,

00:00:36.294 --> 00:00:39.075
what's the quietest sound that a human can hear.

00:00:39.075 --> 00:00:43.622
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Exactly. In this event we're measuring pitch. We want to see what the highest

00:00:43.622 --> 00:00:48.556
pitch a human can hear is. We're looking at the limits of human perception.

00:00:48.556 --> 00:00:51.980
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's really exciting. Now, oh, it looks like they've actually already begun.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:52.849
Let's go to the event.
