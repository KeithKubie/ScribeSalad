00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:04.410
The average burglar, will spend 8-12 minutes
rooting through your personal items looking

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.559
for anything of value. So for this project,
I’m going to show you how to turn an old

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:13.239
jar of salad dressing, into an inconspicuous
secret safe. That’s completely hidden in plain sight.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.679
Start this project with a jar of miracle whip,
and a can of ivory colored spray paint. While

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.449
you’re at it you might want to pick up a
cheap tin of cat food as well, and you’ll

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.560
see what that’s for in just a minute.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.170
Now all we’re really after here is the plastic
jar, and the lid. But rather than dumping

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.599
all the salad dressing in the garbage, just
scoop it into another container so you can

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.680
still use it later if you want.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.430
Scrub the inside of the jar clean with soap
and water, and make sure it’s dried thoroughly,

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.960
because that’s the only way our spray paint
is going to stick.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.480
I’m using an ivory colored spray paint that’s
made for painting plastics, and you can see

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.850
this is the kind that has the paint and primer
in one.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.500
Shake the paint for about a minute, then carefully
spritz the inside of the jar and give it a

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.800
very light coating. You might want to wrap
the container with something like a paper

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.110
lunch bag, and tape it around the neck, to
make sure the outside of the jar doesn’t

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.070
get covered in paint.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.890
It’s a good idea to spray very thin coatings
one at a time, so the paint doesn’t run.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.909
Take your time and do it right, and the end
result will be a lot more convincing.

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.409
Now if you’re like me and you don’t have
the patience to wait 20 minutes between coatings,

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.780
try using a hairdryer to blow a little warm
air around for about 30 seconds at a time.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.679
This speeds up the curing process dramatically.
But be careful, because if it gets too hot,

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:18.939
it can warp your container.

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:23.320
After only 5 minutes, I sprayed and dried
5 different coatings. And you can already

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.460
see just how genuine, our decoy jar is starting
to look. In fact, if we set two jars side

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.039
by side, you can barely tell which one’s
real, and which one isn’t.

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:34.479
Now to help protect the fresh paint from getting
scratched up, I picked up a sheet of sticky

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.560
back foam from the craft store for $0.89.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.170
I cut out a circle the same size as the bottom,
and a rectangle that matches the sides. And

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.359
after pressing them into place, you can see
it protects the paint, and helps cushion whatever we place inside.

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:49.100
Now you could stop here, and simply load up
your jar with whatever stash you’re trying

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.409
to hide, and tuck it away somewhere in the
fridge. It’s as easy as that, because the

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.499
last place anyone will look for something
valuable, is in a jar of salad dressing.

00:01:56.499 --> 00:02:00.599
But if you want to take it one step further,
we can go to the next level, by adding a false bottom.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.729
Grab a cheap tin of cat food and bust it open.
This one was only $0.69 at a local grocery

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.640
store, and it’s definately worth the money,
for the added layer of protection.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.300
Use the cat food any way you want, but save
the can, and make sure you clean it, until it shines.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.080
Now watch how perfectly, this can fits into
the top of the jar. It’s like it was meant

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.720
to be, and the lip at the top even prevents
the can from falling through as well.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.920
I tried wrapping 3 layers of electrical tape
around the can near the top. And you can see

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.880
this simple modification, makes it so the
can locks firmly into place, and won’t fall out.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.050
Just test the lid to make sure it screws back
on, and your deceptive miracle safe is just about done.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.830
Now if you find you’re having a hard time
screwing the cap on, it’s probably because

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.810
your tin of cat food curves up slightly at
the top, and won’t push all the way down.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.840
You can address that challenge by grinding
the top of the jar down around 1/4”. This

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.380
will compensate for the extra space, and get
the screw threads, close enough for the lid

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.310
to get a good bite on the jar.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.310
To finish up, simply fill the can with some
of the Miracle Whip you took out of the jar

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.050
earlier. And when you push the can back into
place, take a good look at your creation.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.980
If you get the impression your jar is completely
full of salad dressing, then you’re finished.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.170
Go ahead and load up your jar with whatever
it is you want hidden, then cover it up with

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.380
the creamy dressing, to conceal your treasure
inside. You’ve just made yourself a miracle

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.460
safe, that could be used for treasure hunting,
geo-caching or anything else you’d want to use it for.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.630
Now for ultimate security, try blending your
jar in with all your other condiments, and

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.890
if you can, hide it way at the back so it’s
even harder to get to, and stays out of sight

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.400
and out of mind. Chances are, no one’s ever
going to open it anyway, even if they’re living in the house with you.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.500
By the way, if you’re still paranoid that
someone’s going to figure out 
your little secret, try going one step further

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.880
by pouring a little plaster of paris into the
bottom of 
the jar. This will make the jar feel heavy

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.240
and full, so the weight won’t give it away
if they pick it up.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.020
Well now you know how to transform a simple
jar of salad dressing, into a covert miracle

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.150
safe. That puts the odds in your favor, by
modestly keeping your valuables hidden, in plain sight.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.020
Well that’s it for now. If you like this
project perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
