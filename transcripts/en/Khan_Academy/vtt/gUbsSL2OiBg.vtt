00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:01.870
- [Instructor] We're
now going to talk about

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:03.015
the beginnings of one
of the most important

00:00:03.015 --> 00:00:04.695
religions in human history.

00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:06.824
And, even today, the
largest religion on Earth.

00:00:06.824 --> 00:00:08.790
And that, of course, is Christianity.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.575
And the central figure in
Christianity is Jesus Christ.

00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:16.563
And the term Christ is given to him.

00:00:16.563 --> 00:00:20.329
It is Greek for savior, for messiah.

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:22.539
Because his early followers view him as

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.035
the prophesized messiah,
savior, for the Jewish people.

00:00:27.035 --> 00:00:28.915
And his followers today view him as

00:00:28.915 --> 00:00:32.884
the savior, the messiah,
for all humankind.

00:00:32.884 --> 00:00:35.380
So, you have over two billion Christians

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.222
who view him central to their faith.

00:00:37.222 --> 00:00:39.518
Who view him as their god.

00:00:39.518 --> 00:00:40.583
But, above and beyond that, you also have

00:00:40.583 --> 00:00:43.368
over a billion Muslims who view him

00:00:43.368 --> 00:00:45.825
as a significant prophet.

00:00:45.825 --> 00:00:47.424
Now, just to get some context

00:00:47.424 --> 00:00:49.469
on the life and times of Jesus,

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.416
most of the accounts we have of him

00:00:52.416 --> 00:00:54.260
come from the first four books

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.959
of the New Testament of the Bible

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:59.209
called the Gospel of
Matthew, Gospel of Mark,

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:01.296
Gospel of Luke, Gospel of John.

00:01:01.296 --> 00:01:03.300
Sometimes it's the Gospel According to

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.370
Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.254
And the term gospel today often

00:01:08.254 --> 00:01:11.940
refers to the idea of the life
and teaching of Jesus Christ.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.087
So, you could view it
as the life and teaching

00:01:13.087 --> 00:01:14.807
of Jesus Christ according to Matthew,

00:01:14.807 --> 00:01:17.999
according to Mark, according
to Luke, according to John.

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:22.166
But it really comes from
old English for good news.

00:01:24.794 --> 00:01:27.045
And there is a related term, evangel.

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:29.296
You might have heard of
evangelical or evangelize.

00:01:29.296 --> 00:01:32.080
Also referring to good news.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.190
Now, the reason why it
was considered good news

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.419
is his message....

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:39.981
We're gonna have some examples
of it in a few minutes.

00:01:39.981 --> 00:01:41.990
Really talks about this idea that

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.405
the poor have the kingdom
of heaven waiting for them.

00:01:44.405 --> 00:01:46.251
That there's this forgiving God

00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:49.848
that you can have a close connection with.

00:01:49.848 --> 00:01:50.681
And for a lot of people...

00:01:50.681 --> 00:01:53.246
Remember, this was in the
time of the Roman Empire.

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:55.252
Most people were downtrodden.

00:01:55.252 --> 00:01:56.235
There was slavery.

00:01:56.235 --> 00:01:57.585
People who were poor.

00:01:57.585 --> 00:01:58.978
And this idea that even the poor

00:01:58.978 --> 00:02:00.736
could go to the kingdom of heaven

00:02:00.736 --> 00:02:03.358
and, in some ways, have
better access to it

00:02:03.358 --> 00:02:05.200
than the rich and the powerful

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.760
was good news to a lot of people.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.727
Now, it's worth noting that these gospels

00:02:10.727 --> 00:02:13.678
were written several decades after,

00:02:13.678 --> 00:02:14.864
depending on what you view,

00:02:14.864 --> 00:02:17.604
the death and/or ascension of Jesus Christ

00:02:17.604 --> 00:02:19.405
according to Christian belief.

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:23.784
As you can see, Jesus was born
slightly before the year one.

00:02:23.784 --> 00:02:25.624
Most historians put his birth at around

00:02:25.624 --> 00:02:29.270
four to six BCE, Before the Common Era.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.171
And they put his death around

00:02:30.171 --> 00:02:33.402
30 to 33 CE, in the Common Era.

00:02:33.402 --> 00:02:35.409
You could also use the original terms,

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:39.507
Before Christ and Anno Dominei,
In the Year of Our Lord.

00:02:39.507 --> 00:02:41.920
Our modern calendar system really uses

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.156
the original view of the birth of Jesus

00:02:45.156 --> 00:02:48.884
as where we start Anno
Dominei versus Before Christ

00:02:48.884 --> 00:02:52.611
or the Common Era versus
Before the Common Era.

00:02:52.611 --> 00:02:54.288
Now, it's interesting
that it turns out that

00:02:54.288 --> 00:02:57.455
Jesus was likely born slightly before.

00:02:57.455 --> 00:03:01.622
Slightly before the original
view on the birth of Christ.

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:06.872
Now, his birth would have
been right around the time...

00:03:06.872 --> 00:03:09.411
Or it would have been under
the reign of Emperor Augustus,

00:03:09.411 --> 00:03:11.989
as we talk about in other videos.

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:12.848
And his death would have been

00:03:12.848 --> 00:03:15.917
under the reign of Emperor Tiberius.

00:03:15.917 --> 00:03:19.932
And these Gospels of Mark,
Matthew, Luke, and John.

00:03:19.932 --> 00:03:21.815
These are written during really hard times

00:03:21.815 --> 00:03:25.785
for the Jewish people and
for the early Christians.

00:03:25.785 --> 00:03:27.464
You have the Jewish Rebellion

00:03:27.464 --> 00:03:31.065
where the Second Temple
is destroyed by Rome.

00:03:31.065 --> 00:03:34.788
You have the significant
Christian persecution,

00:03:34.788 --> 00:03:36.878
especially by folks like Emperor Nero

00:03:36.878 --> 00:03:39.742
where he blames the fire
in Rome on Christians

00:03:39.742 --> 00:03:42.977
and he just, essentially,
just kills them for fun.

00:03:42.977 --> 00:03:47.069
Really just to purge
them, to persecute them.

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.199
And, just to understand where
all of this takes place,

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:51.489
the life and times of Jesus takes place,

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.575
it is in the Roman Empire.

00:03:53.575 --> 00:03:56.152
We're on the eastern edge of it

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:58.115
at the eastern Mediterranean
right over here.

00:03:58.115 --> 00:03:59.916
This would be modern day Israel

00:03:59.916 --> 00:04:02.084
and Palestine for the most part.

00:04:02.084 --> 00:04:05.104
This is a zoomed in version.

00:04:05.104 --> 00:04:07.687
And Jesus is born in Bethlehem.

00:04:08.955 --> 00:04:09.815
And this is a scene.

00:04:09.815 --> 00:04:11.616
I'm gonna show you a lot of paintings.

00:04:11.616 --> 00:04:13.171
As you can imagine, he's a figure

00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:15.789
that has inspired a lot of paintings.

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:17.671
This is a figure of the three magi

00:04:17.671 --> 00:04:21.481
visiting and giving their
gifts to the infant Jesus.

00:04:21.481 --> 00:04:24.794
Magi, famously the Zoroastrian priests,

00:04:24.794 --> 00:04:27.737
coming from Persia to visit Jesus,

00:04:27.737 --> 00:04:30.032
according to biblical accounts.

00:04:30.032 --> 00:04:32.078
And he is raised in Nazareth.

00:04:32.078 --> 00:04:33.756
And that's why he's oftentimes

00:04:33.756 --> 00:04:36.506
referred to as Jesus of Nazareth.

00:04:38.057 --> 00:04:42.520
And the gospels don't talk
a lot about his early life.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.490
They start to talk a lot about his life

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.804
once he hits his late 20's or early 30's.

00:04:49.804 --> 00:04:51.851
And the first really significant account

00:04:51.851 --> 00:04:55.288
after his famous birth to the virgin Mary.

00:04:55.288 --> 00:05:00.075
His purported father,
Joseph, was Mary's husband,

00:05:00.075 --> 00:05:03.471
but the Holy Ghost or God
was the actual father,

00:05:03.471 --> 00:05:05.191
making this a virgin birth.

00:05:05.191 --> 00:05:08.309
But, after that, the
first significant event

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:11.541
is really his baptism by John the Baptist.

00:05:11.541 --> 00:05:13.955
John the Baptist was another preacher,

00:05:13.955 --> 00:05:15.799
prophetic figure of that time.

00:05:15.799 --> 00:05:16.740
A significant one.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.459
He had a lot of followers.

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:21.771
And he as baptizing people
in the Jordan River,

00:05:21.771 --> 00:05:22.754
right in that region.

00:05:22.754 --> 00:05:25.047
This is the Jordan River right over here.

00:05:25.047 --> 00:05:26.529
And this is a depiction of the

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:30.196
famous baptism of Jesus
by John the Baptist.

00:05:31.106 --> 00:05:33.766
And, famously, John the Baptist said,

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:35.322
"No, you should be baptizing me."

00:05:35.322 --> 00:05:37.653
But then after Jesus said,
"No, no, you baptize me."

00:05:37.653 --> 00:05:39.780
And, after, Jesus was baptized.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.934
Famously the sun shines on Jesus

00:05:42.934 --> 00:05:45.433
and God speaks that "This is my son."

00:05:45.433 --> 00:05:48.873
According to, once
again, biblical accounts.

00:05:48.873 --> 00:05:52.146
And John the Baptist, shortly after that,

00:05:52.146 --> 00:05:54.805
gets arrested by King Herod of Galilee.

00:05:54.805 --> 00:05:57.594
Remember, Galilee is
the home region of Jesus

00:05:57.594 --> 00:06:01.761
where he will eventually
do most of his preaching.

00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:05.497
And, after that, Jesus starts to really

00:06:05.497 --> 00:06:08.732
go full into effect in his ministry.

00:06:08.732 --> 00:06:10.124
And, while he's doing that,

00:06:10.124 --> 00:06:12.496
he's performing all of these miracles.

00:06:12.496 --> 00:06:14.910
He's healing people,
turning water into wine,

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.106
walking on water, bringing
people back from the dead.

00:06:18.106 --> 00:06:20.726
And this is, of course,
according to biblical accounts.

00:06:20.726 --> 00:06:22.896
You can decide if you
believe these or not.

00:06:22.896 --> 00:06:24.367
And he does most of that in Galilee.

00:06:24.367 --> 00:06:28.013
And, eventually, he makes
his way down to Jerusalem

00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:30.016
to meet his fate.

00:06:30.016 --> 00:06:31.489
He tells, according to the Gospels,

00:06:31.489 --> 00:06:33.410
his followers, his disciples....

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.498
And there's 12 in particular
that are called out,

00:06:35.498 --> 00:06:37.055
but he has many, many more than that.

00:06:37.055 --> 00:06:40.986
That "Look, I am going
to meet my fate there,

00:06:40.986 --> 00:06:43.809
but I'm doing it willingly."

00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:46.180
But, more than his
miracles, it's interesting

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.980
to look at some of what he preached.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.192
And this might give you a
little bit of a sense why

00:06:50.192 --> 00:06:53.708
many people would have
called this good news.

00:06:53.708 --> 00:06:56.531
So, this is from the Gospel of Matthew

00:06:56.531 --> 00:06:59.614
that I'm gonna quote right over here.

00:07:00.665 --> 00:07:04.832
And this first part comes
from his Sermon of the Mount.

00:07:05.709 --> 00:07:07.108
He goes to the top of a mountain

00:07:07.108 --> 00:07:09.250
and he gives this sermon.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.838
"Blessed are the poor in spirit:

00:07:10.838 --> 00:07:12.516
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."

00:07:12.516 --> 00:07:15.135
"Blessed are the meek: for
they shall inherit the earth."

00:07:15.135 --> 00:07:17.670
"Blessed are the merciful:
for they shall obtain mercy."

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:18.775
"Blessed are the pure in heart:

00:07:18.775 --> 00:07:20.373
for they shall see God."

00:07:20.373 --> 00:07:21.559
"Blessed are the peacemakers:

00:07:21.559 --> 00:07:23.851
for they shall be called sons of God."

00:07:23.851 --> 00:07:26.224
So, all of that, if you're a peasant,

00:07:26.224 --> 00:07:28.390
if you're someone with not a lot,

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:29.290
you're downtrodden, hard life.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.336
You're like, "Look, blessed
are the poor in spirit:

00:07:31.336 --> 00:07:33.095
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."

00:07:33.095 --> 00:07:35.101
you could view this as good news.

00:07:35.101 --> 00:07:36.617
"Ye have heard that it was said

00:07:36.617 --> 00:07:39.076
an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,

00:07:39.076 --> 00:07:41.936
but I say unto you, resist
not him that is evil.

00:07:41.936 --> 00:07:44.634
But whosoever smiteth
thee on thy right cheek,

00:07:44.634 --> 00:07:47.171
turn to him the other also."

00:07:47.171 --> 00:07:48.317
Even in modern times,
this is not an easy way...

00:07:48.317 --> 00:07:51.385
This is not an easy way to live.

00:07:51.385 --> 00:07:52.610
Someone who's doing something to you,

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.001
don't try to seek revenge.

00:07:54.001 --> 00:07:55.474
And this is a very different tone

00:07:55.474 --> 00:07:58.465
than a lot of what you might
get in the Old Testament.

00:07:58.465 --> 00:08:00.285
"Ye have heard that it was said,

00:08:00.285 --> 00:08:03.764
thou shalt love thy neighbor
and hate thine enemy,

00:08:03.764 --> 00:08:06.219
but I say unto you love your enemies

00:08:06.219 --> 00:08:08.224
and pray for them that persecute you."

00:08:08.224 --> 00:08:10.390
Once again, not an easy thing to do.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:12.431
Even in modern terms, you can view this as

00:08:12.431 --> 00:08:14.839
a very forward, very advanced way

00:08:14.839 --> 00:08:17.336
of thinking about the world.

00:08:17.336 --> 00:08:22.040
He also, beyond this idea of
embracing even your enemies

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.965
and not seeking revenge and that the poor

00:08:23.965 --> 00:08:26.871
have access to this kingdom of heaven,

00:08:26.871 --> 00:08:28.753
he really also liked to
take it to the hypocrites,

00:08:28.753 --> 00:08:31.579
especially those who viewed themselves

00:08:31.579 --> 00:08:33.505
as the bearers of the religion.

00:08:33.505 --> 00:08:35.098
In particular, he picks on the Pharisees,

00:08:35.098 --> 00:08:37.307
which was a sect of Jews at the time

00:08:37.307 --> 00:08:39.190
who viewed themselves very ritualistic.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.602
Remember, Jesus, himself,
is a Jewish preacher.

00:08:41.602 --> 00:08:42.748
He's a Jewish teacher.

00:08:42.748 --> 00:08:45.980
He is viewed as a rabbi himself.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.296
"And when ye pray, ye shall
not be as the hypocrites.

00:08:49.296 --> 00:08:51.180
For they love to stand and pray

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.185
in the synagogues and in
the corners of the street

00:08:53.185 --> 00:08:54.655
that they may be seen of men."

00:08:54.655 --> 00:08:57.032
So, these hypocrites, they
pray just so other people

00:08:57.032 --> 00:08:59.013
can see how religious they are.

00:08:59.013 --> 00:09:02.251
"Verily, I say unto you, they
have received their reward."

00:09:02.251 --> 00:09:04.542
They've already gotten the
credit from people for praying.

00:09:04.542 --> 00:09:08.472
"But thou, when thou prayest,
enter into thine inner chamber

00:09:08.472 --> 00:09:10.805
and, having shut thy
door, pray to thy Father

00:09:10.805 --> 00:09:13.873
who is in secret, and thy
Father, who seeth in secret

00:09:13.873 --> 00:09:14.706
shall recompense thee."

00:09:14.706 --> 00:09:16.083
So, don't make a big
deal about your prayer.

00:09:16.083 --> 00:09:18.253
Do it in private and then have this

00:09:18.253 --> 00:09:21.485
personal connection with God.

00:09:21.485 --> 00:09:23.583
Now, it's worth noting that,
even though he preached a lot

00:09:23.583 --> 00:09:27.588
about the kingdom of heaven for the poor,

00:09:27.588 --> 00:09:30.332
prayer is a private thing,

00:09:30.332 --> 00:09:32.952
that you shouldn't try to seek revenge,

00:09:32.952 --> 00:09:36.511
you should be very
conciliatory to your enemies,

00:09:36.511 --> 00:09:38.967
he did take a strong stance
on what he was preaching.

00:09:38.967 --> 00:09:41.097
He did say, "Look, you gotta be with me

00:09:41.097 --> 00:09:43.594
if you want to enter into
this kingdom of heaven."

00:09:43.594 --> 00:09:44.741
He took some strong stances.

00:09:44.741 --> 00:09:46.377
This isn't gonna be an easy thing

00:09:46.377 --> 00:09:48.502
and this is gonna cause a lot of tension.

00:09:48.502 --> 00:09:50.795
This is one quote that
you could view that way.

00:09:50.795 --> 00:09:53.170
Once again, from the Gospel of Matthew,

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:56.490
"Think not that I came
to send peace on earth.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:59.437
I came not to send peace, but a sword.

00:09:59.437 --> 00:10:02.749
For I came to set a man at
variance against his father

00:10:02.749 --> 00:10:04.631
and the daughter against her mother."

00:10:04.631 --> 00:10:05.815
I would interpret this as saying this is

00:10:05.815 --> 00:10:08.189
gonna cause a lot of divisiveness.

00:10:08.189 --> 00:10:10.071
"And the daughter-in-law
against her mother-in-law.

00:10:10.071 --> 00:10:13.798
And a man's foes shall be
they of his own household.

00:10:13.798 --> 00:10:15.890
He that loveth father
and mother more than me

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.158
is not worthy of me.

00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:19.362
And he that loveth son
or daughter more than me

00:10:19.362 --> 00:10:20.589
is not worthy of me.

00:10:20.589 --> 00:10:24.679
And he that doth not take
his cross and follow after me

00:10:24.679 --> 00:10:26.312
is not worthy of me.

00:10:26.312 --> 00:10:28.197
He that findeth his life shall lose it

00:10:28.197 --> 00:10:31.263
and he that loseth his life
for my sake shall find it."

00:10:31.263 --> 00:10:33.145
So, he takes a pretty strong stance.

00:10:33.145 --> 00:10:35.438
"Look, you really need to follow me.

00:10:35.438 --> 00:10:36.829
But, if you follow me, there's some

00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:40.555
very good things that
are waiting for you."

00:10:40.555 --> 00:10:42.318
But, eventually, he does make his way...

00:10:42.318 --> 00:10:43.587
He tells his...

00:10:43.587 --> 00:10:45.226
There's other....

00:10:45.226 --> 00:10:46.414
These miracles he's performing.

00:10:46.414 --> 00:10:48.789
This is the famous
Transfiguration of Christ

00:10:48.789 --> 00:10:51.080
where he makes it
apparent to his followers.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.085
He kind of becomes luminescent

00:10:53.085 --> 00:10:56.483
and he becomes apparent to
his followers, his disciples,

00:10:56.483 --> 00:10:59.150
that he truly is the son of God.

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:01.967
And then, he makes his way...

00:11:01.967 --> 00:11:04.218
This is the year, depending on whether

00:11:04.218 --> 00:11:07.659
you think it's 30, 31, 32, 33 CE.

00:11:07.659 --> 00:11:10.358
He makes his way to
Jerusalem to meet his fate.

00:11:10.358 --> 00:11:12.652
He's already prophesized to his followers

00:11:12.652 --> 00:11:13.921
that this is gonna be a tough fate.

00:11:13.921 --> 00:11:16.828
That he's gonna die there.

00:11:16.828 --> 00:11:19.651
And this is a very important
week in Christianity.

00:11:19.651 --> 00:11:22.401
It's referred to as Passion Week.

00:11:23.294 --> 00:11:25.502
And the term passion has
a different connotation.

00:11:25.502 --> 00:11:28.367
It really means the suffering of Christ.

00:11:28.367 --> 00:11:29.512
This is the week that he suffers.

00:11:29.512 --> 00:11:30.944
This is the week that he gets crucified

00:11:30.944 --> 00:11:32.621
and then resurrected.

00:11:32.621 --> 00:11:34.545
So, he goes to Jerusalem on Sunday.

00:11:34.545 --> 00:11:36.226
This is around the time of Passover.

00:11:36.226 --> 00:11:40.033
Very important religious
period for the Jewish people.

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:44.041
And he comes to Jerusalem near Passover.

00:11:44.041 --> 00:11:48.208
That Sunday that he comes is
now celebrated as Palm Sunday.

00:11:49.362 --> 00:11:51.780
This is imagery of it where he's coming

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.377
and some people are
greeting him to Jerusalem

00:11:53.377 --> 00:11:54.278
as kind of a king.

00:11:54.278 --> 00:11:56.975
They're laying down these
palms before his path.

00:11:56.975 --> 00:11:59.351
Then, this is the famous where he goes to

00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:01.561
the main temple at Jerusalem

00:12:01.561 --> 00:12:03.976
and he cleanses it of the moneychangers.

00:12:03.976 --> 00:12:06.064
He's like, "Hey, by doing
these money transactions here,

00:12:06.064 --> 00:12:08.438
you are defiling the temple."

00:12:08.438 --> 00:12:10.364
Then, on Thursday of that week,

00:12:10.364 --> 00:12:12.778
he has the famous Last Supper.

00:12:12.778 --> 00:12:16.246
Some people believe this
is the Passover seder.

00:12:16.246 --> 00:12:18.016
Most historians don't think it is.

00:12:18.016 --> 00:12:20.554
But he's meeting with his 12 disciples.

00:12:20.554 --> 00:12:22.437
And he's saying, "One of
you's going to betray me."

00:12:22.437 --> 00:12:24.643
And it's Judas Iscariot who does.

00:12:24.643 --> 00:12:27.476
And he goes to the religious court

00:12:28.451 --> 00:12:29.803
and he says, "Hey, I have this guy

00:12:29.803 --> 00:12:31.194
who you guys don't like."

00:12:31.194 --> 00:12:32.504
Remember, this whole time that Jesus

00:12:32.504 --> 00:12:35.619
is doing his ministry, he's sticking it...

00:12:35.619 --> 00:12:38.361
In a lot of ways, he's
calling out these Pharisees

00:12:38.361 --> 00:12:41.269
and these religious
officials as hypocrites.

00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:42.909
He's getting all of these followers.

00:12:42.909 --> 00:12:44.421
A lot of these traditionalists are saying,

00:12:44.421 --> 00:12:45.607
"This guy's blaspheming.

00:12:45.607 --> 00:12:47.490
He's saying he's the son of God.

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:48.473
He's saying all of these things.

00:12:48.473 --> 00:12:51.541
He's doing these miracles on the Sabbath,

00:12:51.541 --> 00:12:53.793
when you're not supposed
to be doing anything."

00:12:53.793 --> 00:12:56.901
And so, Judas Iscariot
goes to the Sanhedrin

00:12:56.901 --> 00:12:58.169
and says, "Hey, I have this guy.

00:12:58.169 --> 00:12:59.232
Come and get him."

00:12:59.232 --> 00:13:00.870
And they get Jesus and this is the famous

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:03.489
trial of Jesus by the Sanhedrin.

00:13:03.489 --> 00:13:06.024
And they say, "Hey, you've
been saying all these things.

00:13:06.024 --> 00:13:07.620
We think you're blaspheming."

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.501
And Jesus stays silent for the most part.

00:13:09.501 --> 00:13:10.975
So, they deem him guilty

00:13:10.975 --> 00:13:12.446
and they hand him over to

00:13:12.446 --> 00:13:14.658
the Roman governor Pontius Pilate.

00:13:14.658 --> 00:13:15.641
And they say, "Hey, look, this guy's

00:13:15.641 --> 00:13:17.526
trying to create an
insurrection against Rome."

00:13:17.526 --> 00:13:19.859
Which the Romans take very seriously.

00:13:19.859 --> 00:13:22.518
And, in the Bible, they have him

00:13:22.518 --> 00:13:25.098
seeming somewhat reluctantly saying,

00:13:25.098 --> 00:13:27.144
"Oh, okay, do we really need to do this?"

00:13:27.144 --> 00:13:29.065
But then he says, "Alright, if that's

00:13:29.065 --> 00:13:30.085
the way you all want it."

00:13:30.085 --> 00:13:32.825
And so, the Romans crucify Jesus.

00:13:32.825 --> 00:13:36.141
And this is what is now
viewed as Good Friday,

00:13:36.141 --> 00:13:38.224
The crucifixion of Jesus.

00:13:39.083 --> 00:13:40.801
And then, on Sunday,
and this was predicted

00:13:40.801 --> 00:13:44.852
by Jesus to his followers,
he is resurrected.

00:13:44.852 --> 00:13:48.206
He leaves the tomb where he was.

00:13:48.206 --> 00:13:49.600
And this is a very important week.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.910
You have Palm Sunday.

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:52.260
You have Good Friday.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.397
And then, you have the resurrection.

00:13:54.397 --> 00:13:56.977
And then, another very, very
important event to Christians

00:13:56.977 --> 00:13:59.558
is 40 days after the resurrection.

00:13:59.558 --> 00:14:01.357
So, after 40 days...

00:14:01.357 --> 00:14:03.488
Over that 40 days after the resurrection,

00:14:03.488 --> 00:14:04.839
he's seen by his followers.

00:14:04.839 --> 00:14:06.189
He's seen by many people.

00:14:06.189 --> 00:14:07.541
He continues to preach.

00:14:07.541 --> 00:14:09.013
And then, you have the ascension

00:14:09.013 --> 00:14:12.370
where he goes to the kingdom of heaven.

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:14.197
Now, I'm gonna leave you with a quote

00:14:14.197 --> 00:14:16.786
by a famous Christian historian.

00:14:16.786 --> 00:14:18.958
And it's a fascinating one.

00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.144
And it's very clear,

00:14:20.144 --> 00:14:22.025
because we just talked
about the crucifixion

00:14:22.025 --> 00:14:23.869
and you see a cross at every church.

00:14:23.869 --> 00:14:25.875
"Christianity is the only major religion

00:14:25.875 --> 00:14:30.213
to have as its central event
the humiliation of its God."

00:14:30.213 --> 00:14:32.342
That's Doctor Bruce Shelley.

00:14:32.342 --> 00:14:33.816
And whether you believe in Christianity

00:14:33.816 --> 00:14:35.493
or you don't believe.

00:14:35.493 --> 00:14:36.721
Whether you're an atheist.

00:14:36.721 --> 00:14:39.588
Whether you believe in
the miracles or you don't.

00:14:39.588 --> 00:14:41.146
It's worth pointing out that

00:14:41.146 --> 00:14:43.271
Christianity has grown from this religion

00:14:43.271 --> 00:14:47.852
that started around this
preacher in Galilee and Judea

00:14:47.852 --> 00:14:50.635
and now has over two billion adherents.

00:14:50.635 --> 00:14:52.643
And what was it about this religion

00:14:52.643 --> 00:14:55.874
and its central event being
the humiliation of its God

00:14:55.874 --> 00:14:57.303
that made it so appealing to many,

00:14:57.303 --> 00:14:59.102
especially in that early Roman Empire,

00:14:59.102 --> 00:15:02.497
both to Jews and to non-Jews, to Gentiles,

00:15:02.497 --> 00:15:06.164
and has made it such a
significant religion?
