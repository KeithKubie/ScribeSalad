00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840
don't get me wrong it's good but I think
 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.080
don't get me wrong it's good but I think
because the rest of the film was so

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090
because the rest of the film was so
 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.720

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730
strong and I was so invested I wanted a
 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.939
strong and I was so invested I wanted a
little bit more of a rivalry there now

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:07.949
little bit more of a rivalry there now
 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:10.069

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079
you do care but not as much you do a
 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.530

rivalry between someone like Batman and
 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.379

the Joker or Superman and Lex Luthor and
 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.149
the Joker or Superman and Lex Luthor and
I know those are different kind of

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:17.159
I know those are different kind of
 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:19.039
I know those are different kind of
relationships but those also made the

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049
relationships but those also made the
 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.379
relationships but those also made the
film's feel so much bigger and I wanted

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389
film's feel so much bigger and I wanted
 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.210
film's feel so much bigger and I wanted
this to feel as big as possible because

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220
this to feel as big as possible because
 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.339
this to feel as big as possible because

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349
hey it kind of got on the right step
 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.920

this could be one of the great big grand
comic-book movies but I think because

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360
comic-book movies but I think because
 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.060
comic-book movies but I think because
the relationship can't be delved with

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.680
the relationship can't be delved with
too much because of all the are things

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690

again it's a super big nitpick
 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.550

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.770
as possible this is taking the idea of a
superhero and developing him even more

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780
