00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.138
All right, so
based on what we just talked through,

00:00:02.138 --> 00:00:05.750
weight 0's going to keep going
up after each of these updates.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.010
And in fact,
if you just plunk it through,

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.210
it's not particularly complicated that
after these first six updates at this

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.270
point weight 0 is about 10.4.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.270
And now, we're going to finally do this
this last update of state 7 going back

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.550
to itself.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.740
&gt;&gt; So
let's work through that update here.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.210
&gt;&gt; Okay, well,
that should be pretty easy.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.820
We just do what we did before,
we substitute in everything.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.430
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.750
&gt;&gt; So let's see, alpha's still 0.1.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.171
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; R is still 0.

00:00:34.171 --> 00:00:36.565
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Gamma is still 0.9.

00:00:36.565 --> 00:00:37.099
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:42.859
&gt;&gt; The value of 7 is, 7 times 10.4 plus,

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:45.817
I guess, still 1-
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:45.817 --> 00:00:49.693
&gt;&gt; Which is 2.8, so 73.8.

00:00:49.693 --> 00:00:50.680
&gt;&gt; I'll take that.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.740
&gt;&gt; Minus the value of S, where we just
came from, which we just said was 73.8.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we're making a transition
from state 7 back to state 7.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.337
And so the value of S and
the value of S prime are the same.

00:01:03.337 --> 00:01:07.824
&gt;&gt; Right, and
then it's just the feature.

00:01:07.824 --> 00:01:09.170
&gt;&gt; Which is?
&gt;&gt; Which is seven.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.772
&gt;&gt; Seven.
&gt;&gt; And

00:01:09.772 --> 00:01:13.014
that's equal to some kind of math thing.

00:01:13.014 --> 00:01:13.940
That's not that hard.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.881
It's minus 0.738 times 7.

00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:20.431
&gt;&gt; Negative 5.166.

00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:21.185
&gt;&gt; If you say so.

00:01:21.185 --> 00:01:23.270
&gt;&gt; All right, so
that's kind of good news, right?

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.230
because this weight 0,
which had been getting pumped up and

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.650
up and up and
up is going to come back down a bit.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.920
And, in fact, now-
&gt;&gt; False.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.620
That's not good because w0 went up
a lot more than you're about to take

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.470
it back down.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.450
&gt;&gt; Well, sure, yeah.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.845
So weight 0, after all these updates
have happened, the weight is 5.234.

00:01:41.845 --> 00:01:43.514
It started off at 1, recall,

00:01:43.514 --> 00:01:46.480
and now it has actually blown
up quite substantially.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.380
So this last update does help,
but it doesn't help enough.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.040
Is that what you're getting at?

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and in fact, that's going to
keep happening because it didn't

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.310
matter that we started at one input.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.750
But there's nothing magical about one.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.892
The point is, it's going to keep getting
bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger,

00:02:03.892 --> 00:02:08.663
and that's actually true for
w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, and w7.

00:02:08.663 --> 00:02:12.291
&gt;&gt; Right, so if we finish this sequence
of updates and we go and do it again,

00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:15.190
this weight 0 is going to
get pumped up even more.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.220
Weights 1 through 6 are also
going to get pumped up.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.140
Weight 7 is going down, but not enough
to make up for the rest of everybody.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.820
So yeah, so this is bad, right?

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.570
So we just keep doing these
updates over and over again, and

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.120
we'd want them to converge.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.840
We want them to kind of get to
the right numbers, and instead,

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.170
we're just spiraling out of control.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.710
&gt;&gt; So,
they're going to converge to infinity.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.580
&gt;&gt; I think that's kind of
the definition of not converging.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.300
Well, it's one kind of not converging,
right?

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.060
It's diverging.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.930
&gt;&gt; Well, that's depressing.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so even in this,
what would otherwise be

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.170
a very well behaved example, doing what
is clearly the right thing in terms

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.500
of doing these weight updates
actually is not the right thing.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.370
So yeah, so bad things happen.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.320
&gt;&gt; So I think I can convince
myself just by staring at it that

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.260
if we happen to set all
the weights to start off as 0,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.520
they won't ever move, and
the right thing will happen.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.530
&gt;&gt; Should we check that?

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.790
&gt;&gt; Sure, let's give it a quick check.
