This one great thing
about Google Web Toolkit

00:00:01.934 --> 00:00:03.767
is that it allows us
to develop our web client

00:00:03.767 --> 00:00:05.467
in a statically typed
language.

00:00:05.467 --> 00:00:06.534
We have a lot of tools

00:00:06.534 --> 00:00:08.067
that help us to do
static analysis.

00:00:08.067 --> 00:00:09.901
And they, you know,
find bugs

00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:11.667
before we even run
the compiler.

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:13.467
It's still pretty difficult

00:00:13.467 --> 00:00:16.100
to debug a web client
in the web browser.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.634
And so the more bugs
we can find

00:00:17.634 --> 00:00:18.901
before we get
to that point,

00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:20.767
the better off we are.

00:00:20.767 --> 00:00:23.267
Another thing that's great
is sharing the same language

00:00:23.267 --> 00:00:24.868
between the client
and the server.

00:00:24.868 --> 00:00:26.200
We do other parts
of our project

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.367
where we actually
have to translate

00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:28.667
between Java and ActionScript,

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:30.100
and it's cumbersome

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.601
and the source
of a lot of bugs.

00:00:31.601 --> 00:00:33.701
And not having to do that
with the web client

00:00:33.701 --> 00:00:35.400
is a huge bonus.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.367
One problem that we face
is how to make

00:00:37.367 --> 00:00:39.734
our Ajax application
web indexable.

00:00:39.734 --> 00:00:42.033
Right now it looks like a sort
of big pile of Java script

00:00:42.033 --> 00:00:44.901
to everyone--
or to the web search engines.

00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:47.067
And that's not
very useful.

00:00:47.067 --> 00:00:49.267
Most people do some sort
of hacky work around

00:00:49.267 --> 00:00:51.033
where they generate,
like, a second copy

00:00:51.033 --> 00:00:52.534
of their whole website

00:00:52.534 --> 00:00:54.400
that looks good
to a search engine.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.701
But that's
a whole lot of work

00:00:55.701 --> 00:00:57.801
and a big pain in the neck
to maintain.

00:00:57.801 --> 00:00:59.334
And it would be really great

00:00:59.334 --> 00:01:01.834
if GWT could help
to solve this problem.
