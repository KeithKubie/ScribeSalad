1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,240
The Joe Rogan experience thing.
You want to get really nuts? Yes.

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:08,090
It's time to leave. Time to
leave. What? This planet. Oh boy.

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:12,770
Listen, we can leave this plant. I've
got something right here. No, no, no.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:18,900
Take you to another planet right
now. He's joking. Federal agents. Ah,

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,570
let me, let me give you my
argument. Where are we going? Well,

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,910
we don't know that we can leave
this planet. I love this planet.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,850
I love this plant. I have a good time
here. This is my favorite planet.

8
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,270
Mine too. I know. But
here's the real reason that

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,380
we started a clock around 1953,

10
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:43,830
which is when we had the explosion at
bikini and the first hydrogen bomb.

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,000
And um, when we figured
out the double helix,

12
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,920
and I call this the twin nuclei
problem, and it began in 1953, 1953,

13
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:56,440
we started a clock. It was also
the height of the McCarthy era.

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,050
We do not have the wisdom
to be able to fuse nuclei.

15
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,110
We don't have the wisdom to be
able to investigate the cell.

16
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,250
It's too much power.

17
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,110
Okay.

18
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,860
So our wisdom may have increased
slightly. Maybe it didn't,

19
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,200
I don't know that our power is now godly.

20
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,700
So our biological intelligence,

21
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:22,930
what our minds are capable of has not it,

22
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,400
it's been surpassed by our intellectual
achievements in terms of our,

23
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,180
our, our technological innovation,
these things which while complicated,

24
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,133
um,

25
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,130
succumb to our intellects, right? Right.

26
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,860
Like they're much simpler
than we ever imagined.

27
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,350
To be able to create something
that normally happens in
the sun on an Island in

28
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:53,850
the Pacific or to be able to rewrite
a cell the way Craig Venter did,

29
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,570
you know, synthetic biology, we are now

30
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,360
gods, but for the wisdom,

31
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,060
and that's a great quote. We are now gods,

32
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:10,770
but for the wisdom should be like
meme pictures. You can picture.

33
00:02:10,771 --> 00:02:15,240
You are now God, let's keep that
going to the ones right now I know.

34
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,610
Let's not focus. Okay. Sorry. Okay.

35
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,600
So that started this clock and the world's
most serious human beings should be

36
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:27,150
working on the twin nuclei problem.

37
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:30,660
What do we do with new godlike
powers given our history of conflict,

38
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,580
our history of envy, our
history of madness, right?

39
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:37,830
Because we succumb
regularly. We are, you know,

40
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,210
I was born 20 years after the end of
world war II and we all know what really

41
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:44,340
happened there. I mean, we're nuts.

42
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,810
We're absolutely not capable of
this level of responsibility.

43
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,330
And so the question that we have is,

44
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,620
do we believe that we have a longterm
solution in terms of increasing our

45
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:58,260
wisdom? We should definitely try it.

46
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:02,020
Everybody believes that should
work on that problem. But,

47
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,430
um, if we don't think that we
have the wisdom to live like this,

48
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,360
we don't know how much time we have
left, but it's probably not hundreds.

49
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:14,230
It's probably maybe a few hundred years
tops because sooner or later you're

50
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:19,120
going to have Putin like
Trump, like people. I mean,

51
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:23,170
I'm sorry. I would have a very deep
antipathy towards Donald Trump. Um,

52
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,300
he's not temperamentally fit to have the
secrets of theoretical physics at his

53
00:03:30,301 --> 00:03:32,550
fingertips. It just isn't.

54
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,540
And it's imperative to me that he not be
elected in 2020 and that the democratic

55
00:03:39,481 --> 00:03:43,710
party wake up and get rid of its crazy
fringe so that we can buy some time.

56
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,200
And it's nice if Elon
thinks we can go to Mars,

57
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,060
maybe that will allow a small number of
us to diversify in case we do something

58
00:03:51,061 --> 00:03:52,110
really dumbed at the planet.

59
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,550
But if human beings are to continue
and we are to continue evolving,

60
00:03:56,551 --> 00:04:00,480
we need to spread out and there are
three rocks that are inhabitable.

61
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,390
There's the earth, there's
the moon, and there's Mars.

62
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:08,490
The moon has nothing in there. Mars is
pretty uninteresting to be in blunt.

63
00:04:08,491 --> 00:04:11,280
I know that it's beautiful that we send
back these pictures and we've got this

64
00:04:11,281 --> 00:04:14,760
one gorgeous planet that we are
clearly not smart enough to Stuart.

65
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,980
We're still having idiotic
climate change debates.

66
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,730
I mean even if even if climate science
is somewhat junk of [inaudible],

67
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,750
we should still be taking climate super
seriously because we don't know what

68
00:04:24,751 --> 00:04:25,111
we're doing.

69
00:04:25,111 --> 00:04:28,860
It's such a complicated nonlinear system
and we're not even capable of focusing.

70
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:29,300
You know,

71
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,850
we're like two seconds later I'll be
watching the Kardashians for sure.

72
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,540
So what is the answer?
Well, in my opinion,

73
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:41,010
we got to increase the number of
possible places we can go beyond three

74
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,660
to say nothing of space stations.
Because that's not realistic. Now,

75
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,210
none of these things make sense.

76
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,950
So the first place that you have to get
to is we're really deeply screwed and

77
00:04:51,951 --> 00:04:56,210
not because of apocalyptic cult,
like reasons just because of science,

78
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,700
just because of 1953.

79
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:05,550
So the only opportunity is if we can break
the Einsteinian speed limit so far as

80
00:05:05,551 --> 00:05:09,930
I know, or we can upload into Silicon
or we can reboot from tardigrades.

81
00:05:09,931 --> 00:05:11,280
Like none of these answers are good.

82
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:14,803
So

83
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:20,270
what I've been toying
with since I was 19 was

84
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,600
what is the theory beyond Einstein?

85
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,810
And that's the thing that I've been
most uncomfortable talking about. Um,

86
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,280
although I've been talking about it more.

87
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:36,370
I gave these lectures in 2013 and in may
of 2013 in Oxford and I was appalled by

88
00:05:37,491 --> 00:05:41,480
the way in which the world's
physics community responded. I mean,

89
00:05:41,481 --> 00:05:45,230
I was very scared. I'm
not a physicist. Um,

90
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,290
I don't claim to be, but I,

91
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,440
I felt like I tried to present what I
hoped was a path forward given that the

92
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:58,020
field was completely
stalled out. And this is it.

93
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,010
Physics and biology let us
into the Valley of death

94
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:07,250
and it's now time to try to get
out and [inaudible] go ahead.

95
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,570
No, please pick you up.

96
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,820
So what is my responsibility
in terms of the portal?

97
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,753
Um,

98
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,580
what I'm going to try to do with this
podcast is gained the courage to share

99
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:26,190
whatever ideas I've had, um,

100
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,000
about breaking the speed limit

101
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,970
in the form of,

102
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:38,400
I don't think I have the wisdom
to figure out what it means,

103
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:43,610
but at least I have a hope of trying to
write the fundamental rules to figure

104
00:06:45,751 --> 00:06:48,870
out our source code. And that
was that, that was the plan,

105
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,950
which is what is this place? What
is the source code for reality.

106
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,540
Now, what was the response?

107
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,680
Did the physics to the physicists from
the physicist that you found Pauling?

108
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,080
Well, there were two articles
that appeared in the guardian,

109
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,690
a newspaper or website that, um,

110
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:14,790
talked breathlessly about what I had
done or what I might have done to call

111
00:07:15,371 --> 00:07:16,960
attention to the lectures
that I was giving.

112
00:07:16,961 --> 00:07:21,760
So this is where the special somone
lectures by Richard Dawkins successor,

113
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,733
Marcus de Soto,

114
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:29,220
who is a colleague of mine from way
back who found me in New York city,

115
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:34,570
I think in 2011 2012 or
something like that, working on

116
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,840
this theory, I called geometric unity

117
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,130
and I was very uncomfortable.

118
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,430
I hadn't really told anybody that I was
working on this theory for all these

119
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,970
years because it's a crazy, you know,

120
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,590
there's certain stories that
you find in theoretical physics,

121
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:55,250
which is kind of the precursor
to madness where you know,

122
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,850
somebody thinks that they've solved, uh,

123
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,280
some big problem and they're
working in secret, you know,

124
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,700
the sort of what happened with Andrew
Weil's and Fermat's last theorem,

125
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:07,870
which was a really interesting story
because his first proof of Fermat's last

126
00:08:07,871 --> 00:08:09,550
theorem w I think was unfixable.

127
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,870
So he announced a proof that he had
solved like this most famous problem in

128
00:08:13,871 --> 00:08:16,000
mathematics and he didn't have it proof.

129
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:21,170
And then bizarrely he was under such
pressure that he found another proof and

130
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,100
actually pulled it off. So it's
like, you know, hats off to him.

131
00:08:24,101 --> 00:08:24,881
It's one of the crazy story,

132
00:08:24,881 --> 00:08:28,120
but he was working in secret for seven
years and nobody knew what he was doing.

133
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,540
So sometimes these stories work out.

134
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:35,650
But he was a professor at Princeton and
very highly regarded and he had sort of

135
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:41,330
husband seven years worth of work to
pretend that he was releasing papers when

136
00:08:41,411 --> 00:08:44,770
he was actually secretly doing this thing
that would have made him a mad man in

137
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:45,604
some sense.

138
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:51,040
And so this is what I was trying to
do is I was not able to work on these

139
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,780
issues, uh,

140
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,770
in the string theory community because
the strength theory community was

141
00:08:55,771 --> 00:08:59,160
possessed of this belief that they
had found the answer back in the 80s.

142
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,160
In 1984 they had what they
thought was a revolution.

143
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,970
And the math community
doesn't think in these terms.

144
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:10,320
Like both of these are very conservative
communities historically and very

145
00:09:10,321 --> 00:09:14,640
focused on following the leadership
of the top people unless there's a

146
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:15,474
revolution.

147
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:20,880
And so I started working on a different
idea to unify the two branches of

148
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:23,550
physics that appear to be in compatible.

149
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:27,090
That was different than the string
theory idea in different than the loop

150
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:28,780
quantum gravity idea or any of the hazard.

151
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,660
Then your main motivation was to do this,

152
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:34,470
to try to figure out a more advanced
version of space travel. Well,

153
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,580
it wasn't space travel. It was,
we need the source code like it's,

154
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,900
it might be safer to go
further once you've unlocked,

155
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,300
once you've unlocked nuclear fusion,

156
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,270
you're pretty much just as
screwed as you need to be.

157
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:54,030
So then the issue is, okay,
we know that we're pretty,

158
00:09:54,031 --> 00:09:59,031
I'm pretty sure that Einstein's theory
is not final because you get these

159
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:04,350
singularities, which I don't
associate with ultimate equations.

160
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:08,100
So the black hole singularity called
the Schwartz Chilson singularity,

161
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:13,410
or the initial singularity that we
associate with the big bang, um,

162
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:18,710
and like the Friedman Robertson Walker
space times are signs to me that these

163
00:10:18,931 --> 00:10:20,040
equations are incomplete.

164
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:24,540
But the big problem with Einstein is
that Einstein's work was so fundamental

165
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:30,120
that it's like you can't get in
under the ground floor of Einstein.

166
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,260
You begin a physics seminar and you're
already immediately in his world you say,

167
00:10:34,261 --> 00:10:38,880
let X be a spacetime manifold.
Boom, you're already in relativity.

168
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,360
So it's almost impossible to figure out
a way to get in at a deeper level of

169
00:10:45,121 --> 00:10:46,770
physics than Einstein's theory.

170
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,460
And we know that we have to recover
Einstein's theory because that's been

171
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:54,660
proven, uh, you know, to work
in all sorts of situations.

172
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,870
Then the same thing with quantum field
through, which is why I talked about,

173
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,780
you know, the anomalous
magnetic moment of the electron.

174
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,980
So my idea was that only since the 1970s
have we known that particle theory was

175
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:12,180
based on geometry. We knew that
Einstein's theory, I think,

176
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,360
use geometry to develop his theory was
the language of relativity called Romani

177
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:18,204
and geometry.

178
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:23,690
But many years later we found out that
bores sort of quantum and plunks quantum

179
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,870
in ninth plan's upon him as well, was
based on a different geometry of this Chi.

180
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:33,610
Charles Eris monk was an Alsatian geometer
who had worked with carton and that

181
00:11:34,981 --> 00:11:39,981
geometry was figured out at Stony
Brook in New York by Jim Simons,

182
00:11:41,971 --> 00:11:46,470
who became the world's greatest
hedge fund manager and CN yang,

183
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:50,610
who's arguably number one or number two
greatest living theoretical physicists.

184
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:51,450
He's now in his nineties.

185
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:56,320
And they figured out that the secret
language of particle theory was also

186
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:57,970
geometry, but a different geometry.

187
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:03,640
And so geometric unity is simply the idea
that it's not a fight between Einstein

188
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:07,510
and Bohr. It's the two parents

189
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,620
remonde on whose work, uh,

190
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:17,660
Einstein based a relativity and Charles
Eris man with this gauge theoretic stuff

191
00:12:17,891 --> 00:12:20,980
that we did in the time before this, uh,

192
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:25,120
which in fact empowers a particle theory.

193
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:32,100
And so when do those two geometries unify
two different geometric theories and,

194
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,980
well, I've found that in general, they
don't unify in a way that you want.

195
00:12:35,981 --> 00:12:40,981
You don't have the ability
to do Einsteinian tensor
analysis where you compress

196
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:45,640
something called the remonde curvature
tensor and the gauge stuff where you do

197
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:50,641
this gauge symmetry that we were talking
about because gauge symmetry ruins the

198
00:12:50,951 --> 00:12:54,280
ability to compress the Einstein
tensor. Nevermind what that means.

199
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,610
But in one or two rare circumstances,

200
00:12:57,611 --> 00:13:02,050
you can actually combine
the two geometries. And
that's where I think we are.

201
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,840
And so partially what the part purpose
of the portal podcast is, is to use,

202
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,370
um, you know, I'll just sort of
tear the mask off a little bit.

203
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,960
We've been talking about lots of
interesting things about social justice,

204
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,420
about um, mathematics,

205
00:13:19,421 --> 00:13:24,421
about wonder about psychedelics and
trying to be decent human beings to each

206
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:26,650
other and to set an example.

207
00:13:26,651 --> 00:13:29,200
And I think it's been partially a
success and partially a failure.

208
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,120
But what I'm trying to do is to gain the
courage to talk about what these ideas

209
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:39,340
are. And the worst comes to worst is,

210
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:44,780
is that I wasted a lot of my life on a
crazy theory that turned out not to be

211
00:13:45,011 --> 00:13:46,870
true. What was the response though?

212
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:50,710
Like how did the physicist
react and what was, what was

213
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,650
disappointing about it?

214
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:58,750
So the articles in gendered
a, an immune reaction.

215
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,590
Immune. Yeah, it's an
immune response. Okay, okay.

216
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:06,340
So somebody giving a lecture and now
how many times have we heard before the

217
00:14:06,341 --> 00:14:09,850
next Einstein, yada, yada, yada,
yada. And I totally understand this.

218
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,360
That's a reasonable reaction. Like
Sean Carroll had this reaction.

219
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,280
He referred to me as a backyard.

220
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:20,080
Einstein and his wife him twice
today. Yeah. He's on my mind.

221
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,480
And his wife, uh,

222
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,770
wrote this amazing article in scientific
American called dear guardian,

223
00:14:26,771 --> 00:14:30,400
you've been played now
she's not a physicist,

224
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,520
but she has access to Sean's
brain and she writes on physics.

225
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,470
And then there was this whole thing
where the new scientist said, okay,

226
00:14:38,471 --> 00:14:41,740
this guy claimed to give this
lecture in the physics department,

227
00:14:41,741 --> 00:14:44,580
but he hasn't written a paper and
he didn't tell the physicists.

228
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:48,020
So it was a sneak attack. Well,
of course that wasn't true there.

229
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,070
There was announcement of the talk. Um,

230
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:55,320
I stayed in England and I
give the talk once more, uh,

231
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:59,390
and then a final time a week
later. And by that point,

232
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,160
all sorts of people from Cambridge
and Oxford came to the tacos.

233
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:05,990
It was a worldwide topic of
discussion. What the hell is going on?

234
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:10,940
And I gave a two hour
talk. Consider that nobody,

235
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:15,180
nobody outside of theoretical physics
gives talks on physics, isn't it?

236
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,570
It's like North Korea. They
don't get many visitors. Right.

237
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:21,920
To the extent that they get visitors,
they do get visitors from mathematics.

238
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:22,491
But in general,

239
00:15:22,491 --> 00:15:25,130
mathematicians don't take an
interest in the real physical world.

240
00:15:25,131 --> 00:15:26,120
And to be blunt about it,

241
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:29,780
I don't think that the string theorists
are very focused on the real physical

242
00:15:29,781 --> 00:15:33,280
world either. They'd been playing
with toy models for you know,

243
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,570
nearly 40 years.

244
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:41,270
So a lot of it was playing
out in the press. Um,

245
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,230
and the new scientists had to retract.
They said no, what we wrote wasn't true.

246
00:15:45,231 --> 00:15:48,260
They did publicize the
talk and then there was uh,

247
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,320
an article he sent a reporter to the final
talk that I gave and the reporter did

248
00:15:54,891 --> 00:15:55,880
not know any physics.

249
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:59,810
So I spent the morning with this person
teaching him what the Dereck equation

250
00:15:59,811 --> 00:16:01,340
was like. A very fundamental thing.

251
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,040
And the question came up
in the talk about is your,

252
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,410
is your model anomaly
free? And my model is,

253
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,950
has a property called
[inaudible] [inaudible],

254
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:16,490
which is the difference
between S left, right?

255
00:16:16,491 --> 00:16:19,340
Asymmetric models are called
chiral and left, right?

256
00:16:19,341 --> 00:16:23,060
Symmetric models are called a non chiral.

257
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,130
So my model is non chiral,

258
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,790
but the chiral nature of the universe
is supposed to emerge from it.

259
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,510
And I was asked questions that didn't
seem to make sense, which is you,

260
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,390
you can't have a chiral
anomaly and a non chiral model.

261
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,170
And the person that the reporter picked
up on this and didn't really get it.

262
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:43,730
So there was like a flurry
of activity with a big WTF.

263
00:16:43,731 --> 00:16:48,260
And if you ask me, by the time
I gave the second lecture,

264
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:51,980
people weren't laughing. Um,
it was a serious lecture.

265
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,770
People heard that it was
in an, it was in the light.

266
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,880
It wasn't like somebody come up with
their own language in their own, um,

267
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,400
you know, written in crayon in
some indecipherable thing. It was,

268
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,800
it was written in the normal language,
but I hadn't written a paper.

269
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:11,300
And papers are very much the
stock and trade of that community.

270
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:16,340
So I would say that the, the
community settled on a rubric,

271
00:17:16,341 --> 00:17:20,810
which is paper or it didn't happen.
In other words, put up or shut up,

272
00:17:20,811 --> 00:17:25,070
give us a paper. Oh, I
had written something. Um,

273
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,190
but because my trajectory through this,

274
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,440
through math and physics was very unusual.

275
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:36,200
I have a very low trust of the
academic community. I support them.

276
00:17:36,201 --> 00:17:37,840
As you can tell, you know,

277
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:41,630
I'm extolling the virtues of science,

278
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:47,230
but I was subjected to a situation
in graduate school where I had a,

279
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:51,120
I'm probably the only person you've ever
met with a PhD who was not allowed to

280
00:17:51,121 --> 00:17:55,620
attend his own thesis
defense. Why is that?

281
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:00,180
I don't know. What was
your thesis? It was on, um,

282
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:05,010
the self dual equations not being as
peculiar to dimension four as was claimed.

283
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,753
But

284
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,670
I had a situation in which
the thesis when I had,

285
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:15,140
when I had entered grad school was
something that you would present to the

286
00:18:15,141 --> 00:18:19,370
world. And by the time I was, uh,

287
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,300
trying to leave,

288
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:25,520
it was a closed door affair where the
department would appoint the person for

289
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,850
you. And I was in the unusual position
of not having a thesis advisor.

290
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,890
So there's some very fraught
story. One thing you'll find is,

291
00:18:32,891 --> 00:18:37,891
is that graduate school for some subclass
of people becomes an extremely fraught

292
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,260
experience where the
power of a department,

293
00:18:42,261 --> 00:18:47,261
not to grant you a degree or not to
help you get a job or to expel you,

294
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:54,500
um, becomes very contentious.
Right? And that was the situation.

295
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:57,800
So I got into a very contentious situation
that there was no explanation of why

296
00:18:57,801 --> 00:19:02,390
it was so contentious. We can talk
about it on, on another podcast, but,

297
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,150
um, I was in a very low
trust situation with, um,

298
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,730
with Harvard and with
the standard community.

299
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:15,790
And so when work that I had done
that was rejected for my thesis,

300
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:20,740
uh, was discovered by others in 1994, um,

301
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,870
and revolutionized
topological gauge theory,

302
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:29,560
I became very sort of sullen and angry
and withdrawn because my department knew

303
00:19:30,471 --> 00:19:35,240
that I had put forward the same
equations that became revolutionary in

304
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:38,810
mathematical gauge theory. Did
you revisit it with them? Um,

305
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,410
there was a seminar where a guy
named David [inaudible], uh,

306
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:47,360
Y very much admire the person
who had been my advisor.

307
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,450
I don't want to name names, had, uh,

308
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:55,420
given a seminar saying all of gauge
theory has been revolutionized.

309
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:59,960
Old Gates' theory is dead. Then
there is a new gauge theory and

310
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,513
um,

311
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,140
David caused on who I will name,

312
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,413
uh, [inaudible]

313
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,250
said I was in the back center row.

314
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,530
I think I was picking my nose
actually. And, um, he said,

315
00:20:16,531 --> 00:20:19,290
didn't we have a student who told
us to look at these equations?

316
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,610
And suddenly the whole room
turned around and looked at me.

317
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:26,700
I think this is in room five Oh
seven of the Harvard science center.

318
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,900
And it's just like, you
know, try to imagine you're,

319
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:33,420
you're an anonymous person in a lecture
and suddenly everyone is staring at you

320
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,550
in your fingers in your nose. And, um,

321
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,230
that was the moment.

322
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,930
And I, and I think I mumbled
something, um, just to get out of it.

323
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:48,310
But I was angry. I was angry that
they'd taken away my, I would, you know,

324
00:20:48,311 --> 00:20:52,240
better, better not to give me
a PhD better just to say, look,

325
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:56,080
we're going to go short. You
screw off, you don't get a PhD.

326
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,620
And then if I end up doing
something, screw you. You know,

327
00:20:59,621 --> 00:21:02,500
that would have been a
better outcome. So instead,

328
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:07,510
I got a PhD through a very torturous
situation and I came to give up on

329
00:21:09,011 --> 00:21:13,480
academics. I don't think that they're
a fair system. I don't think that, uh,

330
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:14,410
it's open-minded.

331
00:21:14,411 --> 00:21:18,520
I don't think that they welcome all
sorts of different belief structures,

332
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:24,310
um, which are capable of producing
innovations. So, you know, from my money,

333
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,020
I've been very vocal about this.

334
00:21:26,021 --> 00:21:30,640
I've written articles and edged title
work and I've said theoretical physics has

335
00:21:30,641 --> 00:21:34,110
stalled and you've been claiming
that you're going to ship strength,

336
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:37,480
strength theory, and since
1984 will, where is it?

337
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:43,510
And it's always, you
know, and years away. Now,

338
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:48,511
what was the premise of Sean Carroll's
wife's article that they got played?

339
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,860
Well, Jamie, can you bring it up?

340
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:58,100
I had broken the rules. The rules. Yeah.

341
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,440
You're supposed to submit a paper.
The paper is supposed to be reviewed.

342
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,300
It's supposed to appear in a journal.

343
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,820
You're not supposed to be
doing this from mathematics.

344
00:22:06,821 --> 00:22:10,120
You don't have training as
a physicist. This is a hoax,

345
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:16,070
but it's on a hose. Whoa. I don't know.
I mean, if it is a hoax, it's on me.

346
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:19,870
Clearly not a hoax. You're not
hoaxing anyone. I'm not trying to,

347
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,860
I don't understand that well,
because the actual attack. Okay.

348
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:28,030
Imagine that you're the, you're
the Princeton physics department.

349
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:32,770
You probably have a cork board on the
wall called the crank, the crank board,

350
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,400
and every week somebody
writes to you and says,

351
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,650
I figured out puppy perpetual motion.
I have a laser transport device.

352
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:46,800
Right? And so everybody is
concerned and frightened that their,

353
00:22:46,801 --> 00:22:50,590
their time is going to be
wasted right by lunatics.

354
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:57,330
Now I both fit the lunatic profile and
don't fit the lunatic profile on the

355
00:22:59,021 --> 00:23:02,350
lunatic side. I'm outside of
the system, haven't kept up.

356
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,510
I not particularly
mathematically minded. I mean,

357
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:10,940
in fact I'm sort of a B math student
from high school, so it's kind of,

358
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:16,220
I'm the only person I know with my
profile with a PhD in math and on the non

359
00:23:17,591 --> 00:23:19,300
lunatic side. I mean, look,

360
00:23:19,301 --> 00:23:23,080
you've been listening to my crazy ideas
for a while and they're all over the

361
00:23:23,081 --> 00:23:26,340
world. I have lots of heterodox
ideas. I don't think that I,

362
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:29,730
that they're taken as being insane.
And I don't think this is insane.

363
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:33,970
It's been looked at by enough people to
say we will until you actually write it

364
00:23:33,971 --> 00:23:38,200
down very cleanly. And clearly we
can't fully evaluate, but it's a,

365
00:23:38,201 --> 00:23:41,400
it's a gamble. And the worst
thing that can happen is,

366
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:46,280
is that I have something that looks like
a final theory that turns out not to

367
00:23:46,281 --> 00:23:50,390
be, are you gonna write it out?
It's already mostly written up.

368
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:55,610
I'm in a different phase. I felt
that I got rolled in an alley.

369
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:59,540
So here's, here's the big,
here's the big reveal. Okay.

370
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,470
It's gonna be a lot harder to
roll me. I can roll myself.

371
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,070
I can screw this thing
up just fine by myself.

372
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:12,470
But the opportunity to take me into a
quiet corner and make something disappear

373
00:24:12,471 --> 00:24:15,020
or to hand the credit to somebody else
is going to be a lot harder to do.

374
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,670
Is that going to happen? Did you find it?

375
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,290
Do your guardian you've been played?

376
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:25,640
I love when they use like
contemporary salon. Sketchy.

377
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:30,290
It's so good. So bitchy. Yeah. You
love say bitchy when it's a girl.

378
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,960
What girl writes it? Um, I don't,
I don't care. I think, I mean,

379
00:24:35,961 --> 00:24:37,730
look, it's only like the future of,

380
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:42,410
of a number of people been
privately asking me about
the recent guardian article

381
00:24:42,411 --> 00:24:46,550
and accompanying op ed by Oxford
mathematician, Marcos du Sautoy.

382
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:50,270
How'd he say it? So to Marcus
DeSoto, DeSoto toy gushing over,

383
00:24:50,271 --> 00:24:52,250
suppose supposedly revolutionary.

384
00:24:52,251 --> 00:24:56,900
You knew unified theory of physics by
a man who officially left academia 20

385
00:24:56,901 --> 00:24:57,380
years ago,

386
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:02,380
or as I've taken to calling it the Eric
Weinstein's amazing new theory that

387
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:04,280
solves everything.

388
00:25:04,281 --> 00:25:08,930
Puzzling conundrum in theoretical physics
only he hasn't written and actual,

389
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:11,210
all these are capital letters.
That's why I'm saying it this way,

390
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:13,940
the letters and actual paper yet.

391
00:25:13,941 --> 00:25:18,830
So physicists can't check all those
hard mathematical details, but trust us,

392
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:23,780
it's going to be awesome. Wow. That's
super bitchy at him. Wow. Yeah.

393
00:25:23,781 --> 00:25:27,260
I can say that. I can say whatever
the fuck I want. A ham with a period.

394
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:32,570
First. A couple of caveats. I've
met Weinstein. He's a nice guy.

395
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:38,030
He's wicked smart. This is a stupid
article cause you know better.

396
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:42,820
Well, it's just the way it's written.
It's just, it's a catty yeah,

397
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:46,460
it's for clear clearly. Yeah. Okay.

398
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:51,440
But we could go deep. She's playing,
she's playing enforcer. Yes.

399
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:53,840
You broke the rules. Yes. We
know why you broke the rules.

400
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:56,510
There's fame and fortune for you
in, I think that's what it is. Yeah.

401
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:00,050
Well or you're delusional or what's
her motivation for writing this article

402
00:26:00,051 --> 00:26:03,210
though? That's what's weird. Well,
she, she's a physics look, she,

403
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:08,000
she comes from, um, I think she's
approached protege of Casey Cole,

404
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:12,850
the great physics writer from who's
not a physicist in her defense. Yeah.

405
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:17,940
Do you feel that she felt this honestly
and that this was problematic and in her

406
00:26:20,151 --> 00:26:24,140
eyes that you were entering into this
field that you had not written a paper and

407
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:27,980
you had left academia 20 years ago
and that she was like, well, listen,

408
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,750
this is all nonsense. Okay,

409
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:32,570
I'm going to put a stop to this nonsense
and I'm going to do it with sort of

410
00:26:32,571 --> 00:26:37,490
contemporary language and, and slang.
I don't like the bitchiness but it's,

411
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:40,490
I understand the motivation.
[inaudible] look,

412
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:45,120
I think the bitchiness is to make the
article more entertaining and more,

413
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:49,920
um, it's part of the horrible part
of her style as a writer. Okay.

414
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,590
Now I actually met her as she says, and I,

415
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,400
I had a very high and
positive impression of her.

416
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:59,280
So why do you think she wrote this
without discussing it? You know, look,

417
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:03,090
Sean is also one of these people
who's trying to enforce the rules.

418
00:27:03,091 --> 00:27:07,140
He didn't have the easiest time. I
think he didn't get tenure at Cal tech.

419
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,270
He's kind of a stickler for reality.

420
00:27:09,271 --> 00:27:13,560
He's on the one hand
talking total nonsense about
Boltzmann brains and thought

421
00:27:13,561 --> 00:27:17,040
experiments, which is what I
associate with desperation physics.

422
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:20,190
On the other hand, he's
kind of this rigorous, um,

423
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:24,510
rationalist thinker who's in,
you know, a prominent atheist.

424
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:28,520
So he's a complicated guy.
He's a great explainer. Uh,

425
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:32,040
he's got his own sort of economic
incentives that he's one of the very few

426
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:36,780
people who sort of a voice, a physics
to the world and they, you know,

427
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:38,520
operate in some sense as a couple.

428
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:43,430
And there's a richness to
this. Like, you know, my,

429
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,150
my point isn't to run them
down or to boost them up.

430
00:27:48,151 --> 00:27:51,000
It's just people are
playing at their roles.

431
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,680
Whenever anyone has a sentence
that consists of one word
and that word is a ham.

432
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,220
Yeah, it's, I did not enjoy that
article by him. Well, but look,

433
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:06,450
yeah, but she's trying to throw me a
bone. He's wicked smart. He's a nice guy,

434
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:09,390
buddies, but he's
delusional. He's delusional.

435
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,960
And to the extent that I've
been delusional before,

436
00:28:12,961 --> 00:28:16,500
I'm about the only person in the U S
who's against high skilled immigration

437
00:28:16,501 --> 00:28:19,110
because people think, why should we
keep out the best in the brightest?

438
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,830
And it's complicated story. Before
the financial crisis, I was saying,

439
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:25,920
mortgage backed securities may
blow up the world. People are like,

440
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:29,250
are you kidding? It's the great
moderation. We've banished volatility.

441
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:35,050
People have a chance to know me now.
They know that I can get way out there.

442
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,740
I said this at the beginning. I
get way out there. Yeah, okay.

443
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:42,730
I think Elon Musk Musk is totally
wrong about going to Mars.

444
00:28:42,731 --> 00:28:46,740
Mars is not going to save us and maybe
going to the stars isn't gonna same as

445
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:49,150
maybe the AI will follow
us there, yada, yada, yada,

446
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,580
but I'm not going to take this lying down.

447
00:28:51,581 --> 00:28:56,350
We're in a desperate situation and if
you're not trying, here's the, here's the,

448
00:28:56,351 --> 00:28:57,520
here's the clear thing.

449
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:01,150
We know what nuclear weapons
look like in the fusion here.

450
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,340
If we are trying to get off this planet
before people are unleashing gene drives

451
00:29:06,341 --> 00:29:07,780
and you know,

452
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,500
weaponized anthrax and who knows what
the hell people are going to get up to as

453
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:15,910
the power of biology and the power of
physics keeps going in the power of

454
00:29:15,911 --> 00:29:16,744
information.

455
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,353
All right.

456
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:23,890
At least I'm trying. I think I'm
doing a damn sight better than trying,

457
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,050
but assume that I failed completely.

458
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:33,390
How crazy is it that we're not trying to
take arm or arms against our new sea of

459
00:29:33,791 --> 00:29:38,330
troubles? It's time to rush the cockpit.

460
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,150
We've got to get Trump out of office.

461
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:45,100
We've got to restore sanity to our
sensemaking. We need newspapers,

462
00:29:45,101 --> 00:29:46,180
we need fact checkers.

463
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,260
We did what is particularly problematic
about Trump being in office.

464
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:55,300
That man has nuclear capabilities and
I have zero confidence in his decision

465
00:29:55,301 --> 00:29:59,680
making and people imagine that I'm a
Trump supporter after I've called him an

466
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:02,440
existential risk, you know, and my,

467
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,190
my boss and good friend Peter teal
was a supporter of Trump in the last

468
00:30:06,191 --> 00:30:10,390
election. I'm taking a huge risk
and how much I love this guy,

469
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:13,210
Peter teal and how much he loves me. Uh,

470
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:19,030
because I'm putting the employer employee
relationship at risk. And people say,

471
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,860
okay, you're just a Peter teal tool. Well,

472
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,150
nobody's gonna take that kind of risk
unless they have real faith in their

473
00:30:25,151 --> 00:30:26,440
friend. And I work for a friend,

474
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:31,000
I mean a real friend person who doesn't
cut and run when trouble starts.

475
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:34,990
And I totally disagree with Peter. Uh,

476
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,750
I have come to understand that Trump,

477
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,870
I thought people would understand the
Trump danger and that the democratic party

478
00:30:43,871 --> 00:30:46,210
would reevaluate their
situation, but they didn't.

479
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,940
They tripled and quadrupled
down. And that is alarming.

480
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,140
And so that's something I very much got
wrong about Trump is that even Trump

481
00:30:53,141 --> 00:30:56,590
wasn't enough of a message
to let people know.

482
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:00,670
But Trump cannot have
the nuclear codes. Um,

483
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,280
because he's not as skilled
or regular enough player.

484
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,660
He's going to accomplish a lot.

485
00:31:04,661 --> 00:31:07,840
One of the things I said before the
election is he might be the best and worst

486
00:31:07,841 --> 00:31:08,674
of presidents.

487
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:12,910
He might get us a new North Korea deal
because they're going to look at him and

488
00:31:12,911 --> 00:31:15,760
say, this guy is nuts. Who
knows what he would do.

489
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,820
But we, we,

490
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:23,560
the technical community created this
problem and we're abdicating our

491
00:31:23,561 --> 00:31:27,850
responsibility by worrying about our
egos, by worrying about our reputations.

492
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:28,990
I am abdicating.

493
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:33,250
I should've turned this theory over to
the theoretical physics community years

494
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:33,251
ago.

495
00:31:33,251 --> 00:31:36,940
Even if they screwed me over and I'm too
petty and egotistical to want to give

496
00:31:36,941 --> 00:31:41,140
up on it, I watched them take credit
for things that weren't, you know,

497
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:43,630
an assigned credit. I don't
like the way they work.

498
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:48,610
I have the theoretical physics community
is our most important community in the

499
00:31:48,611 --> 00:31:53,611
world and it is also a very unpleasant
community and we need to fund them and we

500
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:57,790
need to let them play. They're
dangerous boys for the most part.

501
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:02,440
There are women, but in general,
they're very unpleasant men. Um,

502
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,380
they have been somewhat cowed.

503
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,590
They are not the same Cowboys they used
to be because they'd been failing for 40

504
00:32:08,591 --> 00:32:12,100
years. I should be sharing stuff.
I should be writing things down.

505
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,600
I have not had the courage to do it.

506
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,140
And if I really have the
courage of my convictions,

507
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:21,250
I should share this and see
what happens. But one thing is,

508
00:32:21,251 --> 00:32:23,900
I don't know if it could be weaponized.
Assume it's right. You know,

509
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:27,730
I have at this decision tree, so it's
wrong. I've got egg on my face. It's okay.

510
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:31,270
I'll be okay. I worry much
more about if it's right.

511
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,850
The two things that can
go wrong, if it's right,

512
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:38,320
is one that could be weaponized
before it becomes useful, and two,

513
00:32:38,321 --> 00:32:41,780
is that there's solution than it may
be. We actually are stuck in this place.

514
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:45,620
We never get to go to the stars. We
can look at exoplanets and dream,

515
00:32:45,621 --> 00:32:46,454
but we're stuck here.

516
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:51,660
[inaudible].
