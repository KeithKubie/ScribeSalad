00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.770
Let's say we have the same path
that we had in the last video.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.710
Draw my y-axis,
that is my x-axis.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.630
Let's say the path looks
like this, it looks

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.570
something like this.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.080
It's the same one we
had in the last video.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.270
Might not look exactly like
it, let me see what I

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.430
did in the last video.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.330
It looked like that in the
last video, but close enough.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.270
Let's say we're dealing
with the exact same

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.450
curve as the last video.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.840
We could call that curve c.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.850
Now last video, we dealt with
a vector field that only had

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.240
vectors in the i direction.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.590
Let's build with another vector
field that only has vectors in

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.680
j direction, or the
vertical direction.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.810
So let's say that q, the vector
field q of xy, say it's equal

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:54.430
to capital Q of xy times j, and
we are going to concern

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.120
ourselves we're going to
concern ourselves with though

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:09.310
closed line integral around the
path c of q dot dr. And

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.760
we've seen it already.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:20.240
dr can be rewritten as dx
times i, plus dy times j.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.940
So if we were to take the dot
product of these two, this

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.300
line integral is going to
be the exact same thing.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.830
This is going to be the same
thing as the closed line

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.090
integral over c of q dot dr.
Well, Q only has a j-component.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.830
So if you take [? its ?]

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.780
0i, so 0 times dxs is 0,
and then you're going

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.190
to have Q xy times dy.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.810
They had no i-component, so
this is just going to be Q,

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:51.780
I'll switch to that same color
again, Q of x and y times dy.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.900
That's the dot product.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.960
There was no i-component,
that's why we lose the dx.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.030
Now let's see if there's any
way that we can solve this line

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.710
integral without having to
resort to a third parameter, t.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.780
Just like we did in
the last video.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.875
Actually, it will be almost
identical, we're just dealing

00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:08.080
with y's now instead of x's.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.920
So what we can do is, we
could say, well, what's our

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.070
minimum y and our maximum y?

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.120
So our minimum y, let's
say it's right here.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.840
The minimum y,
let's call that a.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.906
Let's say our maximum y that we
attain is right over there.

00:02:22.906 --> 00:02:24.880
Let's call that b.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.960
Oh, and just like in the last,
I forgot to tell you the

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.250
direction of the curve.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.270
But this is the same path as
last time, so we're going in a

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.070
counterclockwise direction.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.500
The exact same curve,
exact same path.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.180
So we're going in
that direction.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.160
Now in the last video, we broke
it up into two functions of

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.600
x's, two y's as a
function of x.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.920
Now we want to deal with y's.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.530
Let's break it up into
two functions of y.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.560
So if we break this path into
two paths, those are kind of

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.720
our extreme points, let's call
this past right here, let's

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.110
call that path right there,
let's call that y, let's call

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.930
that x of-- so here, along this
path, x is equal to-- or I

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.350
could just write path
2, or a call it c2.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.956
We could say it's,

00:03:18.956 --> 00:03:22.210
x is equal to x2 of y.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.550
That's that path.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.250
And then the first path, or
it doesn't have to be the

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.740
first path, depending
where you start.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.670
You can start anywhere.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.410
Let's say this one in magenta.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.050
We'll call that path 1, and we
could say, that that's defined

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.480
as x is equal to x1 of y.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.395
It's a little confusing when
you have x as a function of y,

00:03:39.395 --> 00:03:41.290
but it's really completely
analogous to what we

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.470
did in the last video.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.630
We're literally just
swapping x's and y.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.140
We're now expressing x as
a function of y, instead

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.870
of y as a function of x.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.560
So we have these two curves.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.680
You can imagine just flipping
it, and we're doing the exact

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.460
same thing that we did in
the last videos, just

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.820
now in terms of y.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.610
But if you look at it this way,
this line integral can be

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:07.590
rewritten as being equal to
the integral, let's

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.650
just do c2 first.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.380
This is the integral
from b to a.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.860
We start at b, and we go to a.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.290
This is, we're coming back
from a high y to a low y.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:30.240
The integral from b to a of
Q of-- in that gray color.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.430
Q of, instead of having an x
there, we know along this curve

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.650
right here, x is equal to, we
want everything in terms of y.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.210
So here, x is equal to x2 of y.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:47.800
So Q of x2 of y, x2 of y comma
y, maybe I'm using too many

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.680
colors here, but I think
you get the idea.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.045
dy.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.580
So this is the part of the
line integral, just over

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.800
this left hand curve.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.940
And then we're going to add to
that the line integral, or

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.980
really just a regular integral
now, from y is equal to a to y

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:18.325
is equal to b of Q of, instead
of x being equal to x2, now x

00:05:18.325 --> 00:05:21.170
is equal to x1 of y, it's equal
to this curve, this

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:22.780
other function.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:33.060
So x1 of y, x1 of y comma y,
dy, and we can do exactly what

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.900
we did in the previous video.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.370
Instead of, we don't like the
larger number on the bottom, so

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.760
let's swap these two around.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.870
So if you swap these two, if
you make this into an a, and

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.800
this into a b, that makes it
the negative of the integral,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.200
when you swap the two,
change the direction.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.150
This is exactly what we did in
the last video, so hopefully

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.000
it's nothing too fancy.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.490
But now that we have the same
boundaries of integration,

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.690
these two definite integrals,
we can just write them as

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.280
one definite integral.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.470
So this is going to be equal
to the integral from a to b.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.450
And I'll write this one
first, since it's positive.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.370
Of, I'll write in this one.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:18.500
Q of x1 of y comma
y, minus this one.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.730
Right?

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:19.710
We have the minus sign here.

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:28.590
Minus q of x2 of y and y dy.

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.540
Let me do that in
that neutral color.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.590
dy, that's multiplied by
all of these things.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.060
I distributed out the dy,
I think you get the idea.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.930
This is identical to what
we did in the last video.

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.810
And this could be rewritten as,
this is equal to the integral

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:49.120
from a to b of, and inside of
the integral, we're evaluating

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:57.490
the function of Q of xy from
the boundaries, the upper

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:02.880
boundary, where, the upper
boundary is going to be from x

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.696
is equal to x1 of y, and
the lower boundary is

00:07:08.696 --> 00:07:11.560
x is equal to x2 of y.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:11.970
Right?

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.950
All the x's we substituted with
that, and then we get some

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:18.490
expression, and then from that,
we subtract this with x

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.650
substituted as x2 of y.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.110
That's exactly what we did, and
just like I said in last video,

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.160
we're going kind of the reverse
direction that we normally

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:24.990
go in definite integrals.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.640
We normally get to this,
and then the next

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:27.580
step is, we get this.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.210
But now we're going in the
reverse direction, but it's

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:30.420
all the same difference.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.860
And all of that times dy.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.740
And just like we saw in the
last video, this, let me do it

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.870
in orange, this expression
right here, actually let me

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.590
draw that dy a little
further out so it doesn't

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:45.460
get all congested.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.830
Let me do the dy out here.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:56.100
This expression, this entire
expression, is the same exact

00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:07.410
thing as the integral from x is
equal to, I can just write it

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:11.280
here, let me write it
in the same colors.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:27.450
x2 of y to x1 of y to x1
of y the partial of Q

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:31.760
with respect to x dx.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:36.020
I want to make it very clear.

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.620
This is, at least in my
mind, the first part,

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:39.680
a little confusing.

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.620
But if you just saw an integral
like this, this is the

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:42.680
inside of a double integral.

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:43.390
And it is.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.250
The outside is what we
saw there, the integral

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:50.380
from a to b, dy.

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.280
But if you just saw this in a
double integral, what you would

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.620
do is you would take the
antiderivative of this, the

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.640
antiderivative of this
with respect to x, the

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.430
antiderivative of the partial
of Q with respect to x with

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:04.510
respect to x, is going
to be just Q of xy.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:07.120
And since it's a definite
integral, you would evaluate it

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.850
at x1 of y, and then subtract
from that, this function

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.370
evaluated x2 of y, which
is exactly what we did.

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.220
So hopefully you
appreciate that.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.520
And then we got our result,
which is very similar

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.410
to the last result.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:24.220
What does this double
integral represent?

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:28.390
It represents, well, anything,
if you have any double integral

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:31.970
that goes from-- if you
imagine, this is some function,

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:33.640
let me draw it in
three dimensions.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.430
This is really almost a
review of what we did

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:36.360
in the last video.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:42.240
If that's the y-axis, that's
our x-axis, that's our z-axis.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.720
This is some function of x
and y, so some surface you

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.595
can imagine on xy plane.

00:09:48.595 --> 00:09:50.750
It's some surface.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:56.160
So we could call that the
partial of q with respect to x.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.260
And what this double integral
is, this is essentially

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.490
defining a region, and you can
kind of view this dx times

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:05.550
dy as kind of a small
differential of area.

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:09.690
So the region under question,
the boundary points, are from y

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:14.460
going from, y goes from, at the
bottom, it goes from x2 of y,

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.130
which we saw was a curve that
looks something like this.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.620
That's the lower y, and over
here, if we draw it in two

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.600
dimensions, this was
the lower y-curve.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:27.730
The upper y-curve is x1 of y,
so the upper y-curve looks

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:29.210
something like that.

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:32.570
The upper y-curve goes
something like that.

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:35.510
So x varies from the lower
y-curve to the upper

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:36.650
y-curve, right?

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:38.540
That's what we're
doing right here.

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:42.180
And then y varies from a to b.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.340
And so this is essentially
saying, let's take the double

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:51.020
integral over this region
right here of this function.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.950
So it's essentially the volume,
if this is the ceiling,

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:56.300
and this boundary is
essentially the wall.

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:57.680
It's the volume of that room.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.750
And I don't know what it
would look like when

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:00.140
it comes up here.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.840
But you can kind of imagine
something like that.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.990
It would be the volume of that.

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:04.690
So that's what we're taking.

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:07.490
This is the identical result
we got in the last video.

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.060
And this is a
pretty neat thing.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:13.600
So all of a sudden, this
vector, that-- and Q of xy, I

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.060
didn't draw it out like I did
the last time, Q of xy

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:16.630
only has [? things ?]

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:19.475
in the j-direction, so it only
has, if I were to draw its

00:11:19.475 --> 00:11:21.920
vector field, the vectors
only go up and down.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.650
They have no horizontal
component to them.

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:32.270
But we saw, when you start with
a vector field like this, you

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:35.810
take the line integral around
this closed loop, and I'll

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:39.000
rewrite it right here, you take
this line integral around this

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.200
closed loop of q dot dr, which
is equal to the integral around

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:49.560
the closed loop of Q of xy dy.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.240
We just figured out that that's
equivalent to the double

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:58.490
integral over the region.

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:00.660
This is the region.

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:00.920
Right?

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.380
That's exactly what
we're doing over here.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.950
If I just gave you the region,
you'd have to define it, you'd

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:07.116
say, well, x is going from,
this is going from this

00:12:07.116 --> 00:12:09.780
function to that function, and
y is going from a to b, and you

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.310
might want to review the double
integral videos, if

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:11.970
that confuses you.

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.270
So we're taking the double
integral over the region of the

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:20.370
partial of Q with respect to x,
d-- well, you could write dx

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:23.490
dy, or you can even right
a little da, right?

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:26.110
The differential of area,
right, that we can imagine

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:28.670
as a da, which is the
same thing as a dx dy.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:31.390
And if we combine that with the
last video, and this is kind of

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:35.030
the neat bringing it all
together part, the result of

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:36.760
the last video was this.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.940
That if I had a function that's
defined completely in terms of

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.270
x, we had this, right here.

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.090
We had that result.

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:46.280
Actually, let me copy and paste
both of these to a nice clean

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:51.100
part of my whiteboard,
and then we can do the

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.030
exciting conclusion.

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:57.170
Let me copy and paste that.

00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.300
So that's what we got
in the last video.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:03.200
And this video, we
got this result.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.080
I'll just copy and paste
that part right there.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:12.140
You might already predict
where this is going.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:13.490
And then let me
paste it over here.

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:16.240
This is the result
from this video.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.390
Now let's think about an
arbitrary vector field but is

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:27.160
defined as, I'll do that in
pink, let's say F is a vector

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:32.780
field defined over the xy
plane, and F is equal to P

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:39.920
of xy i plus Q of xy j.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:43.520
You can almost imagine F being
the addition of our vector

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.040
fields, P and Q, that we did
in the last two videos.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.550
Q was this video, and we did
P in the video before that.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:53.570
But this is really any
arbitrary vector field.

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:56.710
And let's say we want to take
the vector field, or sorry, the

00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:00.680
line integral of this vector
field, along some path.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.730
It could be the same one
we've done, which has been

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:03.870
a very arbitrary one.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:05.440
It's really any arbitrary path.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.620
So let me draw some
arbitrary path over here.

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:13.010
Let's say, that is my arbitrary
path, my arbitrary curve.

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:17.610
Let's say it goes in that
counterclockwise direction,

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:18.530
just like that.

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:22.830
And I'm interested in what the
line integral, the closed line

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:27.570
integral, around that
path of F dot dr is.

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:29.810
And we've seen it
multiple times.

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:36.700
dr is equal to dx i
plus dy times j.

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:40.740
So this line integral can be
rewritten as, this is equal

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:44.390
to the line integral
around the path c.

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:48.990
F dot dr, that's going to be
this term times dx, so that's

00:14:48.990 --> 00:15:00.090
p of xy times dx plus this
term, Q of xy times dy.

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:04.250
And this whole thing,
essentially this is the same

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:11.470
thing as the line integral of
p of xy dx, plus the line

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:16.660
integral of Q of xy dy.

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:17.750
Now what are these things?

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.180
This is what we figured out in
the first video, this is what

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.160
we figured out just
now in this video.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.190
This thing right here is
the exact same thing

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:26.510
as that over there.

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:35.270
So this is going to be equal to
the double integral over this

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:41.310
region right here, of the minus
partial of P with respect to y.

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:48.550
Instead of a dy dx, we
could say just over the

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:50.750
differential of area.

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:53.870
And then plus this
one, this result.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:54.120
Q.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.930
This thing right here is
exactly what we just proved,

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.480
is exactly what we just
showed in this video.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.380
So that's plus, I'll leave it
up there, maybe I'll do it in

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:06.760
the yellow, plus the double
integral over the same region

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:11.220
of the partial of Q
with respect to x.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:15.090
da, where that's just dy
dx, or dx dy, you can

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:15.950
switch the order, it's

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:18.010
the differential of area.

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:20.130
And now, we can add
these two integrals.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:21.070
What do we get?

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:23.220
So this is equal to, and
this is kind of our

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:25.680
big, grand conclusion.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.130
Maybe magenta is
called for here.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:31.720
The double integral over the
region of, I'll write this one

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.230
first because it's positive,
that one's negative, of the

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:42.390
partial of Q with respect to x,
minus the partial of p with

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:48.360
respect to y, d, the
differential of area.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.960
This is our big takeaway.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.670
This is our big takeaway.

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.700
Let me write it here.

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:59.620
The line integral of the closed
loop of F dot dr is equal to

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:02.420
the double integral
of this expression.

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.720
And it's something,
just remember.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.545
We're taking the function that
was associated with the

00:17:07.545 --> 00:17:09.540
x-component, or the
i-component, we're taking the

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.880
partial with respect to y.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.610
And the function that was
associated with the

00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:16.530
y-component, we're taking the
partial with respect to x.

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:18.580
And that first one, we're
taking the negative of.

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:19.910
That's a good way
to remember it.

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:23.140
But this result right here,
this is, maybe I should

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:30.730
write it in green, this
is Green's Theorem.

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:38.080
And it's a neat way to relate a
line integral of a vector field

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.770
that has these partial
derivatives, assuming it has

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:44.460
these partial derivatives, to
the region, to a double

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:45.330
integral of the region.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.680
Now, and this is a little bit
of a side note, we've seen in

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:56.980
several videos before, we've
learned that if F is

00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:02.780
conservative, which means it's
the gradient of some function,

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:06.280
that it's path-independent,
that the closed integral around

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.550
any path is equal to 0.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:10.980
And that's still true.

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:14.720
So that tells us that if F is
conservative, this thing right

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.560
here must be equal to 0.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.070
That's the only way that you're
always going to enforce that

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:23.350
this whole integral is going to
be equal, is going to be equal

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:25.970
to 0 over any, any, any region.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:27.270
I'm sure you could think
of situations where they

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:29.880
cancel each other out, but
really over any region.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.700
That's the only way that
this is going to be true.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.880
That these two things are
going to be equal to 0.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:38.220
So then you could say, partial
of Q with respect to x, minus

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:42.370
the partial of P with respect
to y, has to be equal to 0, or

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:44.970
these two things have
to equal each other.

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:45.300
Or.

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:47.370
This is kind of a corollary
to Green's Theorem.

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:49.900
Kind of a low-hanging fruit
you could have figured out.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.010
The partial of Q with respect
to x is equal to the partial

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:56.920
of P with respect to y.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.070
And when you study exact
equations in differential

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.460
equations, you'll
see this a lot more.

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:04.140
And actually, well, I won't go
into too much, but conservative

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:07.330
fields, you're actually, the
differential form of what you

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:10.500
see in the line integrals, if
it's conservative, it would

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.450
be an exact equation.

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:12.610
But we're not going to
go into that too much.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:15.330
But hopefully you might see the
parallels if you've already run

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:17.790
into exact equations in
differential equations.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:20.980
But this is the big takeaway,
and let's maybe do some

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:25.780
examples using this takeaway
in the next video.
