ISABELLE OLSSON: Thank you for
coming to listen to the panel

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.020
about atoms and bits.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.620
We're a bunch of industrial
designers up here.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.460
First we have Mike Simonian.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.875
He's an award winning designer.

00:00:18.875 --> 00:00:22.850
He's on Forbes' 100
Most Creative list.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.140
And he's working at
Google X and trying

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.049
to envision successful designs
that have huge business impact.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.830
Then we have lovely
Victoria Slaker,

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:41.030
and she was one of the
founders of Ammunition Design,

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.940
and the design team
over there, and has

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.440
been a part of designing some
of the most successful consumer

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.300
electronics products
on the market today.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.400
Then we have Michael
Ditullo, and he's

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.100
the Chief Creative
Officer at Sonic--

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.350
MICHAEL DITULLO: Sound United.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.050
ISABELLE OLSSON: Sound
United, I'm sorry.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.500
And he's been wearing a
lot of different hats,

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.730
doing everything from
ethnographic research

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.890
to marketing and design.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.950
Then we have Maaike
Evers, and she

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.220
is also working at Google
X, and is leading design

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.520
from the very early stages
that have a huge impact.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.810
And she also co-founded
Mike and Maaike.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.500
And then we have Josh
Morenstein, an old friend

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.200
of mine, and he's
co-founded and is

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.720
partner of Branch
Design, a young design

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.200
studio in San Francisco.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.510
And he's been working on
a bunch of really, really

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.850
successful products
on the market.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.640
And then last but
not least, we have

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.460
Mitch, Mitchell-- good friend
of mine, too-- Heinrich.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.490
He is a senior
designer, but also

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.350
the founder of Design
Kitchen at Google X.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.440
And he is very
excited about going

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.690
back to being designer
as prototypers,

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.180
as manufacturers, and
really understanding

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.360
how things can be
made beautifully.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.980
So to start with, to
kick off this panel,

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.680
I asked the panel to
think about, and design

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.830
a product that represents
the future of design.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.700
And also something
that incorporates

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.420
hardware and software
in an interesting way.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.775
So let's start with Mike.

00:02:34.775 --> 00:02:37.450
You chose the Tesla.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.620
How come?

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.690
MIKE SIMONIAN: So the reason
I think the Tesla represents

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.080
the future of hardware and
software integration, two

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.950
reasons.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.180
One is the ability
to receive updates

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.160
in a really significant way that
I actually consider to almost

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.680
be over the air
hardware updates.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.920
An example is that
the vehicle recently

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.290
didn't have to be recalled
because of an issue.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.130
They actually just
did a software update

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.340
and it changed the
characteristics of the vehicle

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.160
in a way that avoided
an entire recall.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.020
Another example is the way
that the vehicle's ride height

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.310
can be adjusted.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.580
They, over the air, can
just change the ride height

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.500
of all of their vehicles
at a certain speed

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.700
to adjust the vehicle's
performance instantly.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.220
The other approach
I think they've

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.080
taken that I think
is really interesting

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.455
and relates probably to a lot
of these the products here,

00:03:38.455 --> 00:03:40.870
is the ability to learn.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.840
I think that's something that
our products in the future

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.180
are really becoming more
and more like humans.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.810
And they're able to learn.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.110
An example in the Tesla is you
can change the ride height.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.820
If you go on to a
certain driveway,

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.270
you can adjust the ride height.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.100
And the next day if
you do the same thing,

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.160
eventually it
learns that you want

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.160
the ride to change the
height right there so you

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.243
don't scrape the driveway.

00:04:05.243 --> 00:04:06.789
And it will just do
it automatically.

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:08.580
ISABELLE OLSSON: So
I'm curious, whose role

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.780
is it to envision
an idea like that?

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.250
Is it an industrial designer,
user experience designer?

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.170
How do you come up with
something like this?

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.170
MIKE SIMONIAN: I think
the only way that happens

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.300
is when people step
outside of their roles,

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.590
because in traditional
product development,

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.240
everything is so siloed that
these ideas don't necessarily

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.200
come up unless you're thinking
about the whole system.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.120
And so I think it's everybody
on the project's ability

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:41.160
to just get their hands in
the other people's business,

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.956
and come up with these ideas.

00:04:44.956 --> 00:04:47.660
ISABELLE OLSSON: So it's
interesting, Victoria,

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.676
you chose kind of an old idea.

00:04:51.676 --> 00:04:55.124
A little bit of a difference
from Mike's example.

00:04:55.124 --> 00:04:56.790
VICTORIA SLAKER: Yeah,
it's a little bit

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.302
of a tongue in cheek example.

00:04:59.302 --> 00:05:01.260
This is the Phantom
Doormen, and it's something

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.150
that we take for granted a lot.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.800
It was actually done in
the '30s by George Devol.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.892
And I chose it because
it represents two trends,

00:05:11.892 --> 00:05:13.350
and they're both
around simplicity.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.450
One is this idea of
having the software,

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.810
having that sort of interaction.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.600
Sometimes I feel like if we
didn't have these doors built

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.060
in the '30s, actually, if
we were to do it today,

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.020
there would be this expectation
of having to bring out

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.010
your phone to
actually open a door.

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.160
So the first part
of it is really

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.165
about simplicity
of the interaction

00:05:35.165 --> 00:05:38.150
that we're seeing
really happening a lot.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.180
And then the other
one is this idea

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.430
of very, very basic objects,
going back and revisiting

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.250
things that we thought
were already done,

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.970
and starting to look
at them with what

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.700
we can do incorporating
software to make them better,

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.740
to have them do more things.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.970
An example of that, that
we've done in house,

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:03.130
is a little product called
Leeo, two e's, one o.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.780
And it was kind of
an interesting take.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.880
We'll talk about the
Nest in a little bit,

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.490
but what this
client did was say,

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.690
well everybody has all
of these smoke detectors

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.350
right now in their homes.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.830
How can we make them smarter
with a very simple device?

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.496
And what they did was they said,
well, we'll take a night light,

00:06:23.496 --> 00:06:25.000
and we'll just have it listen.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.950
And it will listen,
and you can go out,

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.937
and it's sitting at home
saying, yeah, yeah, you go out.

00:06:29.937 --> 00:06:32.020
I'll just hang out here
and if anything goes wrong

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.420
I'll let you know.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.960
And it's such a
simple, simple act,

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.870
but it basically
suddenly makes a product

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.560
that you really took for
granted much more clever.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.140
And so that's just, for
me, it's about the idea

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.060
of simple interactions, not
a lot of onus on the user.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.070
You can walk up to a door or you
can just walk out of your house

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.600
and not have to think twice.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.000
And then the other one
is very simple objects

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.244
becoming smarter.

00:06:57.244 --> 00:06:59.410
ISABELLE OLSSON: So that's
a really great transition

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.440
to your project,
which congratulations,

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.990
has just launched.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.130
Yeah, tell us about it.

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:07.880
MICHAEL DITULLO: Well,
to riff off of what

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.240
Victoria said, so this is
a collection of speakers

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.530
that my company just launched
that are all Wi-Fi connected.

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:18.500
An average American home has
three to five speakers in it.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.200
And once all those speakers
are Wi-Fi connected,

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.940
there's a lot of different
things you can do.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.120
But to do that you have
to be thinking of those

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.440
use cases at the very first
stages of the hardware, right?

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.255
It's like you're basically
building a smart home,

00:07:33.255 --> 00:07:35.380
but you're building a smart
home kind of LEGO brick

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.360
by LEGO brick.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.710
We have to make sure those
bricks will all interconnect

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.800
at some point, whether it's
with a Leeo, or with a Nest.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.030
And if you're not
thinking that way,

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.130
you'll have these
kind of orphan things

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:49.320
that are in the home that
are smart and yet dumb

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.060
at the same time.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:54.090
And so I think that's a really
interesting part of hardware

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:56.770
development, is we're
predicting where

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.960
we think the software
is going to go

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.100
but at a much earlier timeline.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.940
And then, eventually, we're
manufacturing those products.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.100
They're on a boat from
Asia and the software

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.560
is still being developed.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.480
And the products come into a
warehouse in the United States

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.450
and they all get
updated, and then

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:14.674
they get shipped to retail.

00:08:14.674 --> 00:08:16.340
And they land in
people's homes and then

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.200
they get updated again.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.300
So where the
software you can keep

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.720
iterating on and
improving, you have

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.170
to build the hardware
to be flexible enough

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:27.590
to be able to do that
from the very onset.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.480
So it's been an
interesting challenge

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.299
to reinvent these traditional
products that we take

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:36.190
for granted and bring them
into this larger ecosystem.

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:37.940
ISABELLE OLSSON: So
talking about products

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.419
that we take for granted and
then has not, in the past, been

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:44.710
thought through, the Nest
came along and revolutionized

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:46.760
the thermostat.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.960
Maaike, what do
you think about it?

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.562
MAAIKE EVERS: Thank you all
for taking all my words out

00:08:51.562 --> 00:08:52.062
of my mouth.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.620
But maybe I'd like
to add one more thing

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:02.277
to why I chose this particular
product as an example of where

00:09:02.277 --> 00:09:03.360
the future is going to go.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.910
I think this is an excellent
example where Tony Fadell had

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:11.600
a very strong vision,
and was able to corral

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.650
a group of very different--
from different backgrounds--

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:21.030
engineers, hardware engineers,
software engineers, EE, design,

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:26.710
web design, app design,
packaging, marketing.

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:30.110
Everything was so
well orchestrated

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:31.800
to come to this moment.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.890
And that such a
difficult thing to do

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:35.650
considering all the
different timelines,

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:36.820
the different backgrounds.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:41.240
How do you keep that greater
goal, the greater vision

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:45.230
intact through that
difficult process?

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:48.040
Yeah, it's, to me,
a great example

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:52.190
of a well curated
hardware experience that

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:56.760
lives throughout all the
little bits and feelings

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.690
that you get from
different touch points

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:00.650
that we have with this product.

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:03.750
ISABELLE OLSSON: So do you
think the role of the designer

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.960
in the future is to
wear all these hats?

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:10.520
Or is all that is required a
strong leader in this case?

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.890
MAAIKE EVERS: Well,
I actually don't

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:16.460
know how this was
conceived by Tony,

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.190
or how strong of
a message he had.

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:21.180
If any of you know,
I'd love to hear it.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:24.460
But maybe it's a very
strong personality

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.450
that has a really
great idea and vision,

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:30.260
and knows exactly where
this is going to land.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.040
Maybe it is just
the right people

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.240
coming together and crafting
that story together.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.760
I think designers,
hardware designers

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.090
have to start always really
early because hardware

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:42.750
takes so long.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:46.040
So sometimes these
bits of the DNA

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.130
of where this product
is going to end up

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:52.070
are starting at hardware
thinking, or the first concept

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.540
phase of thinking.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.300
So sometimes we do
take on that role.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.900
But it gets infused with
many great talented people,

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:05.334
the hardware engineers,
software engineers, everybody.

00:11:05.334 --> 00:11:07.250
But yeah, so I'd love
to hear if anybody knows

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:11.050
how this particular product
was developed so well.

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:13.320
But I've seen it done both ways.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.660
Sometimes it's a very
strong vision, up front,

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.090
that you get to work with.

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:20.410
Sometimes it's
working with people

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:23.440
to get to that magic idea.

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:28.470
ISABELLE OLSSON: Josh,
and you chose an example

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:33.370
that I think some of us have
a love hate relationship to.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:36.150
The 3D printing machine.

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:37.640
JOSHUA MORENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.300
Well, first, I would
qualify it by saying,

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:44.012
I didn't choose this
particular product

00:11:44.012 --> 00:11:45.720
that you're seeing
here because I thought

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.240
it was the epitome
of 3D printing,

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.390
or whether it's good or
bad industrial designer

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:53.900
or interaction design.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.370
But what they seem
to be talking about--

00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:00.530
because it's on Kickstarter
I haven't seen it in person--

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:04.750
is a level of
accessibility that I

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:08.990
don't see in a lot of other
products of this sort.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:11.624
They sell MakerBot at
Home Depot, and the thing

00:12:11.624 --> 00:12:13.540
that we talk about in
our studio all the time,

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:18.330
because we have a couple
of different 3D printers

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.030
in the office, and it's
running constantly.

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:23.930
Because for us it's all about
getting stuff in our hands.

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:27.866
About moving from paper, or
sketches, or digital format

00:12:27.866 --> 00:12:29.240
to having something
in our hands.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:33.230
Because ultimately, most
of what we do in the studio

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:36.075
is around that
physical experience.

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:41.480
But my dad goes to Home Depot.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.710
And my dad could buy
a Maker Bot and he

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:46.070
wouldn't know what
to do with it.

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:49.750
But he's got little measuring
tape suspenders, and a pencil

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.720
protector, and he has no
idea how to work in 3D CAD.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:57.750
And these guys, at least, are
talking about the first stages

00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:07.050
of bringing that limitation
of getting it from your sketch

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:10.700
into the real world.

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.010
I think it's pretty rudimentary.

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:16.510
You could make a label
for your fridge right now,

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:18.140
or maybe you could
do flat jewelry,

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:21.540
which isn't that interesting.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:25.940
Maybe ultimately I think
it will run out of energy.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:28.160
But I think it's a first start.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:37.190
The downside, for me, is that
it puts the design tool that

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:41.220
has been that limitation, it
puts it into everybody's hand.

00:13:43.825 --> 00:13:45.450
I had a bunch of
different ideas that I

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:49.290
was going to-- when Isabelle
asked this somewhat difficult,

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:51.780
borderline annoying question
because I couldn't come up

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.960
with anything.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.037
Everything kind of had
a good and a bad side.

00:13:56.037 --> 00:13:57.870
I was like, god, I'm
such a negative person.

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:01.760
But the bad side
of this is that it

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.900
puts design and the making of
objects into anybody's hands.

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:09.560
And the question I
was asking myself was,

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.930
should it be in anybody's hands?

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:14.080
I think most of us, if
not all of us are trained,

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.265
and we have an expertise.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:22.530
There's a permanence
in objects when

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:27.030
it comes to industrial
design that has implications,

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:30.530
cultural implications, certainly
ecological implications.

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:33.820
And so my thought was, if
we can all make things,

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.230
should we all be making things?

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:37.250
Should we be prototyping stuff?

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:37.750
Yes.

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.169
Should we be producing stuff?

00:14:39.169 --> 00:14:39.710
I don't know.

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:43.630
I'm not allowed to fly an
airplane with passengers on it,

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:46.380
so should anybody be allowed
to just go out and make

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:49.280
objects and mass produce things?

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.260
So that was sort of the
balance I was thinking.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.967
So it is a good and bad side
of the future of design.

00:14:54.967 --> 00:14:57.050
MICHAEL DITULLO: Can I
riff off that for a second?

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:57.840
ISABELLE OLSSON: Yeah.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.423
MICHAEL DITULLO: Because we were
talking backstage about this,

00:15:00.423 --> 00:15:03.000
and I think it's interesting
because everybody in this room

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.580
has the ability to write
a novel on the thing

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:07.030
that you're typing on.

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.450
And I haven't written
any novels yet.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.730
And so just because
you have a tool

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:13.287
doesn't mean you will use it.

00:15:13.287 --> 00:15:14.370
MAAIKE EVERS: In that way.

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:16.450
MICHAEL DITULLO: Or you might
try to start writing that novel

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:18.033
and be like, you
know, I suck at this.

00:15:18.033 --> 00:15:20.070
I'm going to go to the
store and buy a novel.

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:22.680
And you might try to design
something and 3D print it,

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.181
and you might like,
yeah, you know what?

00:15:25.181 --> 00:15:25.680
No.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:26.290
JOSHUA MORENSTEIN:
Yeah, that's true.

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:28.610
MAAIKE EVERS: I mean, I see
it more as owning a drill.

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:29.910
Everybody should have a drill.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:32.930
Everybody should be able
to fix their own stuff.

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:36.160
And this is another
version of that.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.860
Everybody should be able
to make things for whatever

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.520
reasons that they need
to have it around.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.192
MITCH HEINRICH: I
also think that you

00:15:43.192 --> 00:15:45.150
would think that it would
actually just elevate

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.525
good design, because people
would realize that it's hard.

00:15:47.525 --> 00:15:49.204
Once this tool is in
everybody's hands,

00:15:49.204 --> 00:15:51.120
and they realize that
they're unable to create

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.500
that iPhone on their 3D
printer, and that they

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.000
can't hit that
level of fidelity,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.450
and that level of polish.

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:58.570
That they realize, OK.

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:01.307
It actually puts you in a
better light as a designer.

00:16:01.307 --> 00:16:02.640
JOSHUA MORENSTEIN: You're right.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:05.780
This is going to
make me look amazing.

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.906
ISABELLE OLSSON: So Mitch,
you like to build stuff.

00:16:07.906 --> 00:16:08.780
MITCH HEINRICH: I do.

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:11.280
ISABELLE OLSSON: And you
chose sort of a building.

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.430
MITCH HEINRICH: I did.

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:15.250
So I took a little bit
of a different tack

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:16.567
on this question.

00:16:16.567 --> 00:16:18.650
I was thinking about it,
and actually a good segue

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:19.780
from Josh.

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.280
I was thinking about it more
from a professional standpoint.

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.010
And it's actually
more about the tools

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:26.440
that designers are getting,
software tools, that

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.170
are allowing us to
do our job in more

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:29.960
interesting and better ways.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:33.990
So this particular
structure is in Germany,

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:36.560
and it was designed
by algorithm,

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.070
and it was fabricated
with CNC robotics.

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:43.610
It's an unsupported structure,
and it fits together

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:44.430
like a puzzle.

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:47.549
So the idea is that
each individual piece

00:16:47.549 --> 00:16:49.090
is different from
all the other ones.

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:51.160
They have these
interlocking sections.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.730
And it's an
unsupported structure,

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:57.660
so there's actually no
columns or supports inside.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:03.390
And I guess it's about 20
feet by 60 feet, or something

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:05.200
like that, so pretty big.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:09.890
The volume of the thing compared
to the actual structure,

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:12.400
is actually more
impressive than an egg.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.250
So if you think about the shell
of an egg, this is about half

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:17.282
as thin for the same size.

00:17:17.282 --> 00:17:18.990
And that just wouldn't
really be possible

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:22.180
if it were a person doing
that design by hand.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:25.470
So the algorithm figured out
how to puzzle these things

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:27.990
together, and how to
make it work just so.

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:29.982
And I feel like
moving in the future,

00:17:29.982 --> 00:17:31.940
designers are going to
have more of these tools

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:32.960
at their disposal.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:36.100
And complexity kind
of comes for free.

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:38.940
And so it's going to open
some interesting doors for how

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.299
we produce things
in the real world.

00:17:41.299 --> 00:17:43.590
ISABELLE OLSSON: This reminds
me of an interesting take

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:45.260
on sustainability.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.370
You're creating something
extremely complex

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:51.040
but so lightweight
and so efficient.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.540
How do we think about
that with the new tools

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:56.670
that we have, with 3D
printing, but also having

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:59.500
to create things a
lot faster, perhaps

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:03.030
fueled by how fast software
design development happens.

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:04.892
What's your take on that, Mike?

00:18:04.892 --> 00:18:06.350
MIKE SIMONIAN: I
think that there's

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:10.430
a little bit of a challenge
there because especially

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:13.200
if we're talking about
technology products

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.865
with accelerating change.

00:18:15.865 --> 00:18:17.490
If you think about
Moore's law, and you

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:21.440
think about how quickly
things need to be updated

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.340
and how quickly we
have an opportunity

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.050
to update things to
be better and better,

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:30.630
we're going to be producing
more and more products that

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:33.280
will get outdated
faster and faster.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:37.970
And so that goes right up
against sustainability,

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:40.160
in terms of waste.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.020
And I don't have
an answer there.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:48.150
One approach could be to accept
an object's impermanence, which

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:51.560
could be totally an about face
for where we are now, where we

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:54.500
celebrate how
precious objects are.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.740
Maybe in order to
accept that they're

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:58.450
going to be outdated
really fast, maybe

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:02.120
they should be made out of
materials and processes that

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.950
are made to biodegrade.

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:08.400
Just like a milk carton is not
made out of milled aluminum,

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.680
because you're going to throw
it out when the milk is gone.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.970
Maybe that's how we should
treat our technology products.

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:16.470
ISABELLE OLSSON:
In your experience,

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:18.095
Victoria, do you
think that's something

00:19:18.095 --> 00:19:19.250
that customers will accept?

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:23.310
We've been spoiled with these
polished, beautiful pieces

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:24.690
of metal, objects.

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:28.860
And do you think in the
future people will accept

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:33.340
having a phone made out
of milk carton material?

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:35.090
VICTORIA SLAKER: I
don't know, we actually

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:38.360
might have to mandate that one.

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:41.310
I do think there is
a lot of positives

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:43.940
to the idea of the acceleration.

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:47.950
If you combine the two issues
of, you can have a 3D printer,

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:51.500
or you're changing
the materials.

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:54.700
I think people will accept it
if there's a clear cut benefit.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.610
So you could say,
there's the dark side,

00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:01.530
like you're going to 3D
produce a lot of crap.

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:03.530
But you could also say,
well, it might actually

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:05.030
be more efficient
in a lot of ways.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:06.530
You could have,
instead of everybody

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:09.590
having to put out a small,
medium, and large of a product,

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:12.950
if you're making it at home,
you have an infinite sizing.

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:14.810
You can make it
exactly what you want,

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:17.350
and maybe there will be
less waste because of that.

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:19.700
And that's a benefit.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:23.890
In terms of whether
or not people are

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:25.870
going to accept the
timelines of hardware,

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:27.245
I think there is
an expectation--

00:20:27.245 --> 00:20:29.060
and we talked
about a backstage--

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:32.310
of the merciless
crowds, once they

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:33.890
put their money
into Kickstarter,

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:36.510
they're like, where
the hell's my product?

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:38.630
There's some
education that's going

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:40.210
to have to happen I think.

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:43.820
But there's no doubt that
the direction of the hardware

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:47.195
and software design its just
faster and faster for good

00:20:47.195 --> 00:20:48.350
and for bad.

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:50.810
ISABELLE OLSSON: So
talking about speed,

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:52.710
we have representatives
of people

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:57.540
who are in-house
designers in startups,

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:01.250
and from consultancy background.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:04.355
Where can you actually get
the most done as a designer?

00:21:06.957 --> 00:21:07.790
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:10.020
VICTORIA SLAKER:
Consultancy all the way.

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.353
JOSHUA MORENSTEIN: I'm with you.

00:21:11.353 --> 00:21:13.522
Consultancy, amazing.

00:21:13.522 --> 00:21:15.480
MAAIKE EVERS: I wish I
had a different opinion,

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.620
but it is true.

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:20.172
You can get more
done as a consultant.

00:21:20.172 --> 00:21:22.840
And you do a lot
more variety of work.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:28.020
And creatively it's
more interesting.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:33.550
However, I do feel that as
a designer in an in-house,

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:35.490
there's so much to be done.

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:39.780
Even though it's hard and you're
pushing a boulder up the hill,

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:42.360
there is so much to be
done in corporations.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:47.230
So I feel like there
is a reason for us

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:53.980
to migrate into that spot
and help them elevate design,

00:21:53.980 --> 00:22:01.990
but also just sort of infiltrate
with ideas and with examples

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:06.125
to show how it can actually
be really delightful.

00:22:06.125 --> 00:22:07.500
MICHAEL DITULLO:
Just to riff off

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.660
of that, like Mike
and Maaike, I've

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:12.530
worked out at
consultancies like Frog,

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:15.380
and I've worked in-house
at companies like Nike.

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:17.170
And both have their
advantages, they're

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:18.450
just a really different.

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:20.240
And I think it depends
on the organization

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:23.210
that you're interacting with.

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:25.250
What I love about
being in-house,

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:28.270
now again, like I liked at
Nike, was having the opportunity

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:31.210
to be a complete
evangelist for design.

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:33.350
And being able to talk
to the board of directors

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:36.390
and say, this is our vision,
this is where we're going,

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:38.484
we need you to believe.

00:22:38.484 --> 00:22:39.900
Sometimes you have
the opportunity

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.358
to do that as a
consultant as well.

00:22:41.358 --> 00:22:43.180
Like I know, Victoria,
you guys interact

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:45.360
a lot with the C suite,
and we talked about that.

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:49.600
And I think it's less about
in-house or consulting

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.660
and more about, at
what level are you

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:54.080
engaging with the organization?

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.940
So can you get up to the
top, and not only talk

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:01.380
to the decision makers,
but be a decision maker.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:06.550
And in the role I have now,
it's both a great luxury

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:08.350
and a great risk.

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:11.680
Because it's also nobody's
fault but your own.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.810
And some people
thrive off of that

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:15.364
and some people it's terrifying.

00:23:15.364 --> 00:23:17.030
MITCH HEINRICH: So
I'm going to riff off

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:19.500
of that for a second, because I
come from a startup background

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:20.510
before joining Google.

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:23.460
And I think, actually, startups
are the best of everything

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.396
in that perspective because
your only limitations are

00:23:26.396 --> 00:23:27.770
how much time you
want to put in.

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:32.570
You're owning the full stack,
you're able to do everything.

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:35.112
And budgets can be a
limitation, and just how much

00:23:35.112 --> 00:23:37.070
effort you want to put
into it is a limitation.

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:39.330
But in terms of your
ability to execute

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:42.350
on your creative vision, it's
so fulfilling because you just

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:44.731
go for it, and no one
is going to tell you no.

00:23:44.731 --> 00:23:46.980
VICTORIA SLAKER: And I think
that's why, maybe, you're

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:50.130
seeing more
consultancies partnering.

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:53.900
Like truly partnering in terms
of taking equity with a startup

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:57.320
because we really
appreciate the idea

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.820
that we're wholly invested.

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.120
And it is no holds
barred, you really

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.290
are having a common goal.

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:07.720
And there's not somebody saying,
OK, well, your initial proposal

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.360
was for $100,000, and
you're at $97,000,

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.620
and we've got to let you go.

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:16.685
So it's really changed in the
last, probably, 5, 10 years,

00:24:16.685 --> 00:24:18.040
it's changed the dynamic.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.540
And we have some of the
benefits of both worlds that way

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:22.500
within some of
the consultancies.

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.458
I mean, Josh, you guys
are [INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:24:24.458 --> 00:24:28.750
JOSHUA MORENSTEIN: Yeah, my
dad was an industrial designer,

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:32.870
but he went to-- he was
like 1964, I don't know,

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:34.850
they designed drill
presses or something.

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:39.690
And garden shears.

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:45.000
But the role that he
played was so back room.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.580
There was no exposure
to any of the-- I mean,

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:51.160
they still did visionary stuff.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.679
They did beautiful drawings
and had beautiful ideas,

00:24:53.679 --> 00:24:56.095
and there were amazing products
that came out of that era,

00:24:56.095 --> 00:24:57.980
and eras before that,
and eras since then.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:02.430
But the role that
the designer played--

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:05.100
or the industrial designer
in this case played--

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:09.920
was more utilitarian
than visionary.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:14.180
At least that was
where they were

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:15.780
plugged in to the hierarchy.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.375
And I think now it's
very much the case,

00:25:18.375 --> 00:25:20.250
and I think we're all
saying the same things.

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:23.140
Whether it's about being
in a startup or in-house,

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:29.010
I think culturally,
designers are

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:30.880
at the very beginning
of the process.

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.690
And in the most
successful projects,

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:35.510
they're there at the very, very
end when something comes off

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:37.070
of the line, whatever
that line is.

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:40.660
Whether it's a
manufacturing aspect,

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:43.050
or whether it's
launching an app,

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:45.190
or some other form of software.

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:49.570
So I think that's what it
boils down is our involvement,

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:55.480
and how many times we're allowed
to touch within the process.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.480
ISABELLE OLSSON: So
thinking about the evolution

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:01.750
of the designer, and you
are all design leaders,

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:02.900
you have your own teams.

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:07.050
How should we build
teams for the future?

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:09.310
Is it brand and design?

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:11.590
Is it graphic design?

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:14.180
There's a lot of talk about
how software and hardware

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:16.210
design need to integrate better.

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:22.371
How do you build the ideal
fool proof team for the future?

00:26:22.371 --> 00:26:22.870
Mike.

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:25.140
MIKE SIMONIAN: Wow.

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:27.890
I actually think it really
depends on the product.

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:30.440
And I think we need to
really pay attention

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:33.180
to where products are going.

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:36.370
And I kind of see-- if
you break down a product

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:40.840
historically, products always
had some sort of interface--

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:45.440
and whether that's a series
of buttons or a knob--

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.890
and there was the
user and the product.

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:50.540
And now there's sort of
three levels of intelligence

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:52.150
that have to go into a product.

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:54.160
There's the user
facing part, there's

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:57.340
the intelligence that the
product has inside of it,

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:58.870
and how it learns.

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:01.080
And then there's
the backside where

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:05.770
there's the over the air
updates, and the company that

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:08.100
makes it, their
side of the product.

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:12.260
So in terms of building a
team to develop products,

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:15.630
I think if we're talking
about products of the future,

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:18.360
I think you're going to need
people that can represent

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.730
all of those aspects
of the product,

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:22.675
and design systems,
not products.

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:30.410
MAAIKE EVERS: But just, I think,
as just purely design, how

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:35.464
to create the best culture
for design to live.

00:27:35.464 --> 00:27:36.880
I really feel
there's a little bit

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:41.730
of a-- it needs to be
cultivated in a little bit

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:44.140
of a separate entity.

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:46.310
It tends to be
culturally so different

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:50.380
from the technical staff,
and the business staff,

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:54.710
that they almost need a
little bit of a safe haven

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:58.840
to be protected and to let them
be a little odd, and different,

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:04.390
and creative, and have stuff
up, and be messy and be

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:06.935
a little rough, and
let that not confuse

00:28:06.935 --> 00:28:07.935
the rest of the company.

00:28:07.935 --> 00:28:13.120
So I think there is a need
for a slight separation,

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:18.370
or like a cultivation where
design can do its best,

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:22.090
and can actually bring its
best, and incubate it's best.

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:24.600
ISABELLE OLSSON: Josh, you
just built a new studio,

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:28.302
how are you thinking
about this topic?

00:28:28.302 --> 00:28:29.760
JOSHUA MORENSTEIN:
Well, we kind of

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:33.570
build as we go a little bit
because it's a new studio.

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:35.620
We're a little bit
more bootstrap.

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:40.830
But in the past year
and a half, the team's

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:44.630
grown from being just my
partner, Nick, and myself

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:48.205
sitting around, thinking, OK,
now what are we going to do?

00:28:48.205 --> 00:28:50.330
Then, of course, the first
folks that we brought in

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:51.590
were industrial designers.

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:55.130
But now we have traditional
graphic design and branding,

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:58.780
and interaction.

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:03.390
When we work on programs--
all of our programs

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:05.870
require some sort of
mechanical engineering.

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:09.890
We, instead of bringing
people like that in-house,

00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:11.600
we partner with folks
because we think

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.620
that it's better to have
other specialists, people

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:17.342
who bring different culture in.

00:29:17.342 --> 00:29:19.050
And I don't know,
we'll see what happens.

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:26.670
At the last studio I
ran, we had more work.

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:29.840
And as the work kept coming
in, we kept building.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.840
But ultimately, it
was really about being

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.462
very curatorial about the
types of people we brought in.

00:29:34.462 --> 00:29:35.920
They had to be
passionate, they had

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.540
to be excited about the work.

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:41.710
And they had to have
taste and experiences.

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:43.356
And not just design
experiences, they

00:29:43.356 --> 00:29:47.370
had to have life
experiences because that's

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:49.200
selfishly what gets me excited.

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.260
And that's what got
me excited about doing

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.132
the programs and
[INTERPOSING VOICES].

00:29:53.132 --> 00:29:55.790
ISABELLE OLSSON: Talking
about experience,

00:29:55.790 --> 00:30:00.100
what is it that interaction
designers, and software

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:03.780
engineers can learn from the
process of industrial design

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:07.000
and hardware development?

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.590
JOSHUA MORENSTEIN: Well, I'm
not going to tell you guys,

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:10.750
but I can tell you.

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:15.890
But the thing that I think
is very, very distinctive

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:18.180
about product design
or industrial design

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:24.110
tangible product is the
permanence that it has.

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:28.720
We create something, and it
takes a certain amount of time.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.660
It's very difficult to compress
it anymore than it has so far.

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.840
Maybe 3D printers
will change this.

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:38.550
But in nine months to a
year, something comes out

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:41.100
and it's mass produced,
and there's no changing it,

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:44.870
or it's very, very, very
difficult to change it.

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:48.780
So I think having an
understanding of that.

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.140
And I would say, conversely,
a better understanding

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:57.150
from industrial design of
how the digital side happens,

00:30:57.150 --> 00:30:59.920
because that's often
changing at the last minute,

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:03.560
and, in the case of Tesla,
could be changed on the fly.

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:06.470
I think that that's the dynamic
that creates something really

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:10.302
interesting, is
that organic nature.

00:31:10.302 --> 00:31:11.760
MICHAEL DITULLO:
It's so different.

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:15.590
I mean think of a
pair of Chuck Taylors.

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:18.190
They were designed
100 years ago.

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:19.810
They still sell
two billion dollars

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:23.070
worth of that shoe every year.

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:24.980
What piece of software
is going to be

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:28.140
used in 100 years that's
being made right now?

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:31.220
And so it's such a
different discipline,

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:35.220
but yet there's like a riffing,
and a natural friction that

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:37.540
hopefully is going to
make both of our work

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:43.075
better as our things integrate
more and more and more.

00:31:43.075 --> 00:31:44.450
ISABELLE OLSSON:
Mike, is there's

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:47.160
something you've learned from
software engineers and software

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:50.200
development that you felt
affected your process

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.052
in a positive way?

00:31:52.052 --> 00:31:55.440
MIKE SIMONIAN: Yeah, I think
the initial reaction I had,

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.210
working with a lot of
software engineers,

00:31:57.210 --> 00:32:03.170
was disbelief at how
they're willing to wait

00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:06.760
until improvement
happens naturally.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:11.710
It's sort of like the hockey
stick mentality of development.

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:14.760
That really surprised me,
because industrial design,

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.660
you have the reverse.

00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:19.770
You have to establish a
lot up front because you're

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:21.600
about to invest in
tooling, and you

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:25.430
have to have everything
all staged and ready to go.

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:27.330
And then you spend
a lot of time just

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:30.460
making sure that it
achieves that vision.

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:32.090
And I think there's
a balance there,

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:35.670
because I've seen a lot
of software development

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:41.440
where the end result,
features get piled on,

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.440
and it's not really predictable.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.600
And then at the end,
if they're really good,

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.819
you can get it all together and
ship a really great product.

00:32:48.819 --> 00:32:50.610
But I think you could
have a balance there,

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:53.290
where you have a little
bit more vision up front,

00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:56.730
and make some really
strong commitments,

00:32:56.730 --> 00:33:02.090
but then don't-- the downfall
for hardware is you don't have

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:04.750
the ability to improve
at the last minute.

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:07.820
And I think that's where a lot
of magic happens in software.

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.780
Where you're like,
OK, let's try this.

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:15.037
And let's change things right
before it's ready to go out.

00:33:15.037 --> 00:33:17.120
ISABELLE OLSSON: So I can
it work better together,

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:20.470
hardware and software,
and atoms and bits,

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:24.320
and kind of coming together
a little bit better.

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.160
Anybody?

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.994
JOSHUA MORENSTEIN: Maaike?

00:33:27.994 --> 00:33:29.660
MAAIKE EVERS: I think
I said it earlier.

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:33.620
I think it's all about having
a good vision to start with.

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:35.310
So if that's there.

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:38.240
And if it's not there,
it needs to be created.

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:41.210
So you have to get a great
synergy between people

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:43.186
to build it.

00:33:43.186 --> 00:33:44.900
ISABELLE OLSSON: But
how do you do that?

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:46.810
MAAIKE EVERS: How
do you do that.

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:48.420
Trust.

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:53.400
Developing a lot of trust, and
great respect for teammates.

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:57.580
And building up on their
strengths to get to

00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:02.687
carve out that best nugget
that everything holds on to.

00:34:02.687 --> 00:34:04.520
MITCH HEINRICH: To tie
two of your questions

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.990
together, Isabelle, I think
the team building aspect

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:10.030
and what you look for also
ties into this question.

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:12.679
My approach has been to
build teams of hybrids, so

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:15.540
people who can speak
multiple languages, hardware

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:16.360
and the software.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:19.639
I think that being able
to connect with your peers

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:22.020
on that same level, and to be
able to speak intelligently

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:24.989
about what they have
on their plate as well

00:34:24.989 --> 00:34:29.500
as your specific craft is
super important to maintaining

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:31.840
product fidelity, and
achieving a vision.

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:38.960
ISABELLE OLSSON:
What's your advice?

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.710
MICHAEL DITULLO: I think
that the key for us

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:43.270
is to just have one team.

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:46.360
To not have a hardware team,
and to not have a software team.

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:49.760
But to have one team that's
bonded to a single vision,

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.510
and working together,
and software people

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:53.870
involved really early on.

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:55.610
Like giving feedback
to the hardware.

00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:57.910
And hardware people
involved all the way

00:34:57.910 --> 00:35:00.520
to the last software
launch, giving feedback

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:01.340
on the software.

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:05.470
And we have the distinctions
in the disciplines on the team,

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:06.980
but it's one team.

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:10.930
And I think that's, to me,
that the best way to do it.

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:14.020
MIKE SIMONIAN: Going back to the
idea of hardware and software

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:16.750
interaction, and
how they influence

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:22.060
each other, especially when you
project forward into the future

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:27.870
and you think about all of the
traditions of building objects.

00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:30.560
I think they're all
going to get redefined.

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.700
And I think the hardware
development process

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:38.430
is going to look
closer to the software.

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:41.630
It's going to look more
like software development.

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:45.060
And I think that's a
really a big opportunity

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:49.940
for both industrial designers
and interaction designers.

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:53.760
As we both admit that
we're creating experiences.

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:57.490
And I think I see a lot
of interaction designers

00:35:57.490 --> 00:36:00.520
that are super interested
in industrial design,

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.050
especially more and more lately.

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:06.540
And I think that
interaction is going

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.550
to not be relegated
to the screen

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:12.630
as it has been in the past.

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:17.380
I just love to look forward
to that mixing more and more

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:20.787
as hardware processes
become more flexible.

00:36:20.787 --> 00:36:22.870
ISABELLE OLSSON: Please
come and get us afterwards

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:24.500
if you have any
questions one on one.

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:27.430
And hopefully you have
a great rest of the day.

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:29.380
Thank you so much.
