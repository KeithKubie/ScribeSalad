00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.030
Congratulations on finishing lesson one.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.080
In the next lesson,

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.430
we will learn how to add a lot of different visual items to our app.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.120
These include buttons and images.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.450
We will discuss how to place these buttons at a precise location on the phone.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.680
We will also figure out how to show and

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.680
hide some text fields based on user input.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.200
While doing all of this, we will learn about a design pattern called NVC.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.040
This is used to make apps.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.920
See you in the next lesson.
