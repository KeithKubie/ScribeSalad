00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.230
Hormones! Those things that make
teenagers moody and miserable,

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.740
and they cause growth spurts
and acne, and they can make

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.970
a perfectly normal student totally
obsessed with his algebra teacher.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.000
Not that I have any real,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.780
boots-on-the-ground
experience with that last one.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.239
But all that mayhem is just
the handiwork of your sex hormones.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.009
The fact is that there
are more than 50 different kinds

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:21.849
of hormones coursing
through you right now,

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.220
and all multicellular organisms
produce one kind or another.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.880
For instance, hormones regulate
the process of metamorphosis

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.039
in insects, and they're what
stimulate plants to grow

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.210
and fruits to ripen.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.100
In animals, the network that
makes and releases hormones,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.160
your endocrine system,
is one of the two ways,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.579
along with the nervous system,
that important information

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.120
is communicated from one
part of your body to another.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.809
Right now, your endocrine
system is spraying hormones

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.109
into your bloodstream that
are doing all kinds of things

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:49.059
all over your body:
giving instructions to other glands,

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.350
regulating the levels of salt,
sugar and water in your blood,

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.489
telling your heart to beat faster,

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.120
and, yes, they're partly
responsible for that daydream

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.739
you may or may not be having
about Taylor Lautner right now.

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:59.760
But keep your eye on the prize here!

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.760
We're doing science! Pay attention!

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.180
The endocrine system and the
nervous systems both carry

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.340
information around the body,
but while the nervous system

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.869
carries information really
quickly and the responses

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.950
are usually short-lived,
endocrine responses take a while

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.469
to get going, but their effects
can last for hours or even weeks.

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:27.280
The word hormone comes from the
Greek for "to arouse activity,"

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.189
and they're secreted
by endocrine glands,

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.469
the series of organs
that also manufacture them.

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:34.520
In addition to endocrine glands,
you also have exocrine glands

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.680
like salivary glands
and sweat glands,

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.890
and as you can tell by the name,
they send stuff outside the body,

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.380
whereas endocrines
keep the "-crines,"

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.640
which is Greek for "secretions," in.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.700
And your glands are all
over the freakin' place:

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.810
Some of the heaviest hitters
are in your brain,

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.600
but you also have them in your
throat, right over your kidneys,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.090
right below your stomach, and of
course in your baby-making areas.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.100
All glands have blood vessels
coming from them so that hormones

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.280
that they release can get
into the bloodstream fast.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.090
And many of your hormones
circulate through your whole body,

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.770
only binding to the
cells that have the right

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.259
receptor proteins that fit them.

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.940
But there are some
hormone-driven messaging systems

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.180
that are more localized.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.830
For instance, paracrine signaling
releases hormone molecules

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.110
that degrade really quickly
and are only received

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.840
within a small region in the body.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.210
Example: testosterone, manufactured
by the testes, tells the testes

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.830
how many sperm they need to
be making right this second.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.380
And to see hormones work
on an even smaller scale,

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.120
get a load of autocrine signaling,

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.280
which sends chemical
messages within a cell,

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.000
or from one cell to the
adjacent cell, at most.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.580
This is what happens in your
immune system when a single T-cell

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.690
realizes it needs to
start cloning itself

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.040
so it can fight off a virus.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.240
Your cells receive hormones
through signal receptors,

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.400
but how and where a
hormone binds to its receptor

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.150
depends on what kind
of hormone it is.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.890
There are three different types:
steroids, which do a lot more

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.910
than make your muscles big and
get you all angry and stuff.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.290
Steroids are derived from cholesterol

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.000
and there's a bunch of
different types of them.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.640
There are peptides, which are
just chains of amino acids.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.190
And monoamines, which are based
on a single amino acid.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.980
The only really important thing we
need to keep straight about these

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.790
is that peptide and amine
hormones are water-soluble

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.670
and don't dissolve in lipids.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.650
And since cell membranes
are made of lipids,

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.720
those hormones can't
pass into a cell.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.040
Instead, they bind with receptors

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.930
that are on the surface of the cell.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.250
But steroids are lipid-soluble,
so they're able to penetrate

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.980
the membrane and bind with
receptors in the cell's nucleus.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.190
Using these methods, the endocrine
system sends out all kinds

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.620
of important chemical bulletins,
many of which start up in the brain,

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.100
in a tiny gland about
the size of a pea.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.100
The pituitary gland.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.640
The pituitary gland,
it's the master gland,

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.380
the Napoleon of the endocrine system.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.200
Except that Napoleon actually
wasn't very small, that's a myth,

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.770
but you get what I'm saying.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.910
The pituitary gland makes
hormones that instruct

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.020
other glands to make other hormones,

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.370
and those hormones actually
get the real leg work done.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.930
The pituitary is connected
to the hypothalamus,

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.680
the part of the brain
that acts as a liaison

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.040
between the nervous system
and the endocrine system.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.620
So a big part of its job is to
tell your glands what to do based on

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.960
information it gets from your
senses and other nerve functions.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.900
For example, breastfeeding women
will start releasing milk

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.320
when their baby starts crying.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.510
Sensory information,
in this case auditory,

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.000
comes to the hypothalamus from
the nervous system telling it

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.620
that there's a little snuggle of
baby nearby that might be hungry.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.370
This causes the hypothalamus
to nudge the pituitary gland,

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.060
which in turn releases hormones that

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.680
stimulate milk production
and secretion. Pretty cool!

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.549
The pituitary gland sits directly
underneath the hypothalamus and

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.620
has 2 lobes, which are actually two
different glands fused together.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.840
The posterior pituitary is an
extension of the hypothalamus and it

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.150
secretes two hormones that are
actually made by the hypothalamus.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.860
On of them is oxytocin, which
stimulates contraction of the uterus

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.349
during childbirth and
helps with breastfeeding,

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:40.110
but it probably also has a role
in things like social recognition,

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.569
pair bonding, orgasms, and anxiety.
Which is interesting and weird.

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:47.419
And the other hormone secreted by
the posterior pituitary is

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.669
antidiuretic hormone, which tells
the kidneys to retain water.

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.789
The anterior pituitary on the
other hand both manufactures

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:57.009
and secretes a
whole battery of hormones

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:00.139
and one of the places these
hormones end up is the thyroid.

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.020
The thyroid regulates your
metabolism, your appetite,

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.650
muscle function, blood pressure,
heart rate, among other things,

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.879
and the way it interacts with
the pituitary is a good example

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:10.939
of a negative feedback loop, a method
of communication that's common

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:13.979
all over the body, and especially
in the endocrine system.

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:17.080
Basically, the pituitary is
like the thyroid's thermostat.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.819
It can read how much thyroid
hormone is in your bloodstream,

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:21.830
and when its levels are low,
it spits out a tiny bit

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.960
of thyroid-stimulating hormone,
or TSH, which travels to the thyroid.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.099
The thyroid, in turn,
secretes thyroid hormone

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:29.879
which boosts our metabolism.

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:31.999
And that increase in
metabolism tells the pituitary

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:33.530
to stop sending out TSH.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.129
So the effect of the
pituitary's secretion is a signal

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:38.919
to secrete less of it,
and that's the negative feedback.

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:40.719
Other glands that are
controlled by His Royal Highness

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:43.159
the Pituitary Gland
include adrenal glands.

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:45.599
These guys sit right on top of
the kidneys and are in charge

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:48.439
of making hormones that help the
kidneys maintain the level of salt

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:50.979
and water in your
body, but they also,

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:52.860
you may have heard,
respond to stress.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.050
Wanna see how it works?

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.050
Well, let's say you're walking
down the street minding

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.020
your own business and you get
hit in the face by an angry duck.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.639
Let's say that this
is unusual for you,

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:02.249
and you don't know what's going on,

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:04.180
just that you're being
attacked by something.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.680
As soon as the sympathetic
nervous system senses

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.789
that something potentially
dangerous is happening,

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:10.639
the hypothalamus tells the
pituitary gland to secrete

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:14.300
adrenocorticotropic hormone,
or ACTH for those of us

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.419
who don't have all freakin' day.

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:17.979
This stimulates the adrenal
glands to make epinephrine,

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:19.590
also known as adrenaline.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.020
Now, the epinephrine in your
bloodstream will tell a bunch of

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.099
different organs to do a bunch
of different things, all at once:

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:27.319
cut off blood supply to your
digestive system, send a bunch

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:30.340
of blood to your lungs and muscles,
and speed up your heart rate.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.560
All to help you on your quest
to vanquish this dastardly drake.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.949
Unlike pretty much every other
muscle contraction in your body,

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:38.499
your heart is controlled
by the endocrine system,

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:40.229
as well as your nervous system!

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:42.409
You may have noticed
that after a scare,

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:44.659
your heart races for a
couple of minutes afterwards?

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:47.319
That's because the epinephrine
is still in your bloodstream,

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:49.199
telling your heart
to race like crazy,

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:51.969
even after you're no longer
in mortal danger or whatever.

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:54.689
Alright, I know you're wondering when
we're going to get to the gonads.

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:59.400
But let me warm you up first
with the function of your pancreas.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.300
Super sexy gland,
the biggest in the body.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.499
I've mentioned a couple of times
that glands regulate the balance

00:07:03.499 --> 00:07:05.449
of solutes in your blood:

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:06.789
This is one of the most
important things that the

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:10.430
endocrine system does, and no one
does it better than your pancreas.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.699
Because its job is to regulate the
levels of glucose in your blood,

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:16.639
and since glucose is
what makes cellular respiration,

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:19.620
and therefore, your life,
possible, this is important.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.449
When the concentration
of blood glucose rises,

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:24.169
say after you eat a
couple of Ho Ho's,

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:26.659
the pancreas secretes
insulin into the blood.

00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:28.009
The insulin then
travels around your body

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:31.330
and stimulates pretty much every
type of body cell to absorb glucose.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.960
Liver and muscle cells convert
the glucose to glycogen for storage,

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.550
and other cells
in the connective tissue

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.710
called adipose cells
convert the glucose into fat.

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:40.569
But if your blood sugar is too low,

00:07:40.569 --> 00:07:42.020
your pancreas has got
your back there, too.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.680
Say you're in a pushup
contest with, Christian Bale.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.509
You're going to lose,
but you're going to try.

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:50.210
And trying, is going to
require quite a lot of energy.

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.050
Your friendly pancreas will
release another hormone, glucagon,

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.219
which stimulates the liver
and muscles to start the process

00:07:55.219 --> 00:07:58.749
that breaks up the glycogen
and fat to release the glucose,

00:07:58.749 --> 00:08:01.599
so that you can lose
to Christian Bale.

00:08:01.599 --> 00:08:03.409
But you know, losing to
Christian Bale is better

00:08:03.409 --> 00:08:05.009
than winning against most people.

00:08:05.009 --> 00:08:07.930
Alright, so now that
we're back to muscular men,

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:11.969
let's get back to everybody's
favorite topic. The gonads!

00:08:11.969 --> 00:08:15.439
Sex glands come in
two different flav-

00:08:15.439 --> 00:08:16.360
That's not the right word.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.379
Flavors? That's bad.

00:08:17.379 --> 00:08:19.400
Ok. Whatever.
We're just going to go with it.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.689
There's the testes and
there's the ovaries.

00:08:21.689 --> 00:08:24.360
They get instructions from the
pituitary gland to make sex hormones.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.900
The testes make androgens, the main
one of these being testosterone,

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.039
which helps with sperm-making,
among other things.

00:08:30.039 --> 00:08:32.880
Ovaries make estrogens and
progestins which stimulate the growth

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.470
of the uterine lining
and some other stuff.

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:36.800
Like what other stuff?

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.940
Well, you might think that your
biological sex is determined

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.979
by the parts that you have.
But that's only kind of true.

00:08:42.979 --> 00:08:45.480
It turns out that why we're
either male or female

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.720
has a lot to do with hormones.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:53.200
Someone get me a chair.
so I can tell you how we know that.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:09:00.060
Back in the 1940's French
embryologist Alfred Jost was studying

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.300
sex differentiation in bunnies
because that's what you do

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:07.120
when you're a French embryologist
in the 1940's, apparently.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.740
He wondered whether the
hormones secreted by the gonads

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.370
during embryonic development
had anything to do with whether

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:16.140
a bunny embryo turned out
to be a boy or a girl.

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.670
So he very carefully,
very, very carefully,

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:20.180
and this is a little disturbing,

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.850
removed bunny embryos
from their mother,

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:24.870
and then, also very carefully,

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.980
removed the part that would
become the ovaries or the testes

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:32.160
from the bunny embryos,
and then, also very carefully,

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.220
he put the embryos back
in the mama rabbit.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.570
What Jost found after the
bunnies were born was that

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.930
the ones that he performed the
surgery on turned out to be girls.

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:43.190
So, in the absence of gonads,
and therefore hormones

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:46.120
that specifically instructed
the development of testes

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.110
and the growth of a peepee
and a deep bunny voice,

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:51.700
he discovered that
the default setting

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.620
for mammalian embryos
is Make it Female.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:58.010
So, sex hormones are hard at
work even during fetal development

00:09:58.010 --> 00:09:59.650
to make us who we are.

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:01.670
But they're SUPER hard at
work during puberty,

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:04.730
when the pituitary gland puts
the gonads on red alert,

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:07.960
in boys telling the testes to
make a whole lot of androgens

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.160
like testosterone that lower the
voice, make a bunch of hair,

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.790
increase muscle and bone mass,

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:16.080
and encourage people to do stupid
stunts and post them on Youtube.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.290
In girls, estrogens, the most
important one being estradiol

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:22.320
and progestins, like progesterone,
kick off the process

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.220
of menstruation and breast growth
and all that good stuff,

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.770
largely helping the female body get
ready to grow and nurse a baby.

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:30.700
But what we still don't
understand very well is

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.650
how sex hormones affect our emotions.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:35.890
We do know that, for instance,
that estrogen is required

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:38.840
for the manufacture of serotonin,
the neurotransmitter that gives us

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.890
a sense of calm and well-being.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.030
So when estrogen levels
drop quickly during

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:45.440
a woman's menstrual cycle,
it can make her feel off kilter.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.140
But the effects of sex hormones,
not just on our bodies,

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.770
but our minds remains
a significant mystery.

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:53.970
Which is good, because I
don't want to even go there.

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:56.040
