00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.810
visuals I was very impressed with the
way this film looked and yes there is

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820
way this film looked and yes there is
 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.280
way this film looked and yes there is
definitely an aspect of this film where

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290
definitely an aspect of this film where
 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.290
definitely an aspect of this film where
you think I've seen all this before but

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300
you think I've seen all this before but
 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.790
you think I've seen all this before but
you can't really escape that when you're

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800
you can't really escape that when you're
 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.710
you can't really escape that when you're
making a horror remake it's just going

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720
making a horror remake it's just going
 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.840
making a horror remake it's just going
to happen you're going to have things

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850
to happen you're going to have things
 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.760
to happen you're going to have things
that you're going to expect fans will go

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770
that you're going to expect fans will go
 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.590
that you're going to expect fans will go
into this movie to see an updated

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600
into this movie to see an updated
 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.440
into this movie to see an updated
version of what they love and for them

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450
version of what they love and for them
 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.090
version of what they love and for them
they will probably really enjoy this

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100
they will probably really enjoy this
 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.040
they will probably really enjoy this
movie and I found myself enjoying the

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050
movie and I found myself enjoying the
 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.360
movie and I found myself enjoying the
film too despite the fact that I'm not

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370
film too despite the fact that I'm not
 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.390
film too despite the fact that I'm not
really a big fan of gore gore gore I

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400
really a big fan of gore gore gore I
 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.800
really a big fan of gore gore gore I
know that fans will definitely

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810
know that fans will definitely
 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.300
know that fans will definitely
appreciate it and it wasn't like a

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310
appreciate it and it wasn't like a
 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.160
appreciate it and it wasn't like a
hindrance on the movie because it's

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170
hindrance on the movie because it's
 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.780
hindrance on the movie because it's
something that I know that they were

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790
something that I know that they were
 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.310
something that I know that they were
really going for one of the things I was

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320
really going for one of the things I was
 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.990
really going for one of the things I was
very impressed with in this film was the

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000
very impressed with in this film was the
 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.060
very impressed with in this film was the
practical effects there's barely any CGI

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070
practical effects there's barely any CGI
 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.010
practical effects there's barely any CGI
at all and for that reason the film felt

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020
at all and for that reason the film felt
 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.660
at all and for that reason the film felt
a lot more intense and more brutal and

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670
a lot more intense and more brutal and
 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.520
a lot more intense and more brutal and
more realistic it's like in the original

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530
more realistic it's like in the original
 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.780
more realistic it's like in the original
film they just had a whole bunch of

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790
film they just had a whole bunch of
 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.240
film they just had a whole bunch of
practical prop make up stuff and they

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250
practical prop make up stuff and they
 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.800
practical prop make up stuff and they
did the same thing in this one obviously

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810
did the same thing in this one obviously
 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.090
did the same thing in this one obviously
they had a better budget and more

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100
they had a better budget and more
 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.890
they had a better budget and more
updated materials and for that reason

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900
updated materials and for that reason
 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.020
updated materials and for that reason
stuff looks more real than it did in the

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030
stuff looks more real than it did in the
 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.610
stuff looks more real than it did in the
original film I just like that they

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620
original film I just like that they
 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.110
original film I just like that they
didn't do a cop-out and make everything

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120
didn't do a cop-out and make everything
 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.120
didn't do a cop-out and make everything
all CGI and everything they did a really

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130
all CGI and everything they did a really
 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.040
all CGI and everything they did a really
good job with that there isn't some CGI

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050
good job with that there isn't some CGI
 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.199
good job with that there isn't some CGI
thing crawling up the ceiling and doing

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209
thing crawling up the ceiling and doing
 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.150
thing crawling up the ceiling and doing
weird flips or anything it's basically

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160
weird flips or anything it's basically
 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.520
weird flips or anything it's basically
like 95 percent practical and for that

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530
like 95 percent practical and for that
 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.890
like 95 percent practical and for that
reason I was very impressed the score

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900
reason I was very impressed the score
 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.300
reason I was very impressed the score
for the movie is also pretty good as

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310
for the movie is also pretty good as
 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.100
for the movie is also pretty good as
well the whole film has a good

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110
well the whole film has a good
 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.050
well the whole film has a good
production to it it sounds great it

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060
production to it it sounds great it
 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.710
production to it it sounds great it
looks great

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720
looks great
 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.970
looks great
now the problems with the film are

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980
now the problems with the film are
 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.890
now the problems with the film are
basically problems that most horror

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900
basically problems that most horror
 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.409
basically problems that most horror
films have extremely weak

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419
films have extremely weak
 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.460
films have extremely weak
characterizations really stupid

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470
characterizations really stupid
 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.170
characterizations really stupid
characters that you don't really care

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180
characters that you don't really care
 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.430
characters that you don't really care
that

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440
that
 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.890
that
much about aside from the lead girl and

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900
much about aside from the lead girl and
 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.660
much about aside from the lead girl and
possibly the lead guy but there's a

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670
possibly the lead guy but there's a
 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.490
possibly the lead guy but there's a
blonde in this film that you honestly

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500
blonde in this film that you honestly
 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.470
blonde in this film that you honestly
don't I don't even know what her name

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480
don't I don't even know what her name
 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.730
don't I don't even know what her name
was like she was apparently the

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740
was like she was apparently the
 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.320
was like she was apparently the
girlfriend of the main character or the

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330
girlfriend of the main character or the
 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.730
girlfriend of the main character or the
main guy but you don't really know a

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740
main guy but you don't really know a
 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.620
main guy but you don't really know a
thing about her and that's essentially a

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630
thing about her and that's essentially a
 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.600
thing about her and that's essentially a
thing with most horror films that most

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610
thing with most horror films that most
 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.340
thing with most horror films that most
people on the screen are there to be

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350
people on the screen are there to be
 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.080
people on the screen are there to be
killed in some sort of horrific way I

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090
killed in some sort of horrific way I
 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.430
killed in some sort of horrific way I
would have liked the characterizations

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440
would have liked the characterizations
 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.870
would have liked the characterizations
to be a little more strong but I

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880
to be a little more strong but I
 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.850
to be a little more strong but I
wouldn't say that it hurt the film in a

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860
wouldn't say that it hurt the film in a
 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.680
wouldn't say that it hurt the film in a
drastic way I think that people who go

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690
drastic way I think that people who go
 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.450
drastic way I think that people who go
into this movie who want to see

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460
into this movie who want to see
 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.740
into this movie who want to see
something that treats the source

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750
something that treats the source
 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.600
something that treats the source
material with respect who want to see a

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610
material with respect who want to see a
 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.520
material with respect who want to see a
well-made remake that actually treats

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530
well-made remake that actually treats
 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.470
well-made remake that actually treats
the original with care they will be

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.210
