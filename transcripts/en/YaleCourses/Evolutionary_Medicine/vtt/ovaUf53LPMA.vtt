1
00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:02.050
Like pathogens.

2
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.680
Cancer cells evolve ways of evading or suppressing the immune system.

3
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:09.671
In fact,

4
00:00:09.671 --> 00:00:14.671
the immune system is quite effective at suppressing most abnormal cell growth.

5
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.520
And so cancers almost by definition consists of that tiny fraction of abnormal

6
00:00:22.541 --> 00:00:26.290
cells that have managed to evade or suppress the immune system.

7
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.420
Cancer cells have the same genotype as the other cells in the body,

8
00:00:31.421 --> 00:00:33.220
so they are modified self.

9
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.730
That means that the pose a special problem for the immune system,

10
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.410
which is not supposed to attack self.

11
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.780
The immune system has many mechanisms that will ensure that it doesn't.

12
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.900
The tech self immune responses to cancer are an attack on self cells that have

13
00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:54.610
pathological characteristics.
They have inappropriate metabolism,

14
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.400
inappropriate growth,
or inappropriate movement.

15
00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.883
<v 1>Okay.</v>

16
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.590
<v 0>The immune system consists of set of s of sets of cells,</v>

17
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.760
each that have specific functions that are coordinated by multiple signals,

18
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.410
whose meaning is interpreted by specific sets of receptors.

19
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.670
So that is the enemy of the cancer cell.

20
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.460
Cancer's evade that enemy.

21
00:01:19.461 --> 00:01:22.730
They evade the immune responses by disrupting those cells,

22
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.860
those signals and those receptors.

23
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.370
Those are the same options that are used by pathogens.

24
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.120
So to begin,
most tumors are eliminated,
some survive,

25
00:01:35.121 --> 00:01:39.050
but are kept under control and a few escape.
But progress to cancer

26
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.410
elimination is done by recognizing and killing.

27
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.790
And that's done by both DNA and by the adaptive immune system.

28
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.730
Some cancers escape elimination but remained small because there are kept under

29
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:56.910
immune pressure.
They're not clinically detectable.

30
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.990
We can each contain many such precancerous growth.

31
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.900
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

32
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.450
<v 0>escape and progression to cancer results.</v>

33
00:02:05.451 --> 00:02:09.050
When the immune system is either inhibited or no longer effective due to

34
00:02:09.051 --> 00:02:12.500
mutations in cancer cells that are altering their properties.

35
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.430
So how does cancer deal with one major enemy?
The NK,
the natural killer cells,

36
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.570
they're part of the innate immune system.
They can react to pathogens,

37
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.160
pathogens into tumors quickly with or without priming.
By antibodies.

38
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.600
They have a repertoire of receptors that insurer insures self tolerance while

39
00:02:34.601 --> 00:02:37.600
allowing reactions to pathogens and the cancer cells.

40
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.180
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

41
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.590
<v 0>Nk cells are this a major problem for cancer cells because they are activated</v>

42
00:02:43.591 --> 00:02:47.790
when triggered by signals from distressed or transformed cells and they then

43
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:48.624
kill them.

44
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.210
So here we see some of their biological functions here,

45
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.140
a healthy cell,

46
00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.170
and if it has DNA damage or is being by mutations into a tumor,

47
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.790
or if it has an internal cytoplasmic bacterial infection,

48
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.290
then it becomes a stress target cell.
So it changes shape

49
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.680
and a natural killer cell can then cause cell lysis and it can coat this cell.

50
00:03:22.081 --> 00:03:24.510
If the cell was,
has been coated with antibodies,

51
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.990
it will signal to macrophages and does he sells and they can then eliminate the

52
00:03:30.781 --> 00:03:34.470
distress target cell.
It can also present antigen.

53
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.270
The natural killer cell can present antigen to a dendritic cell,

54
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.830
which then can go into a standard dendritic t-cell recruitment cycle and that

55
00:03:43.831 --> 00:03:47.340
will lead to the recruitment of t cells that will eliminate the stress target

56
00:03:47.341 --> 00:03:48.174
cells.

57
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.870
So in case cells are involved in eliminating stress cells that are either killed

58
00:03:56.011 --> 00:04:00.780
directly by lysis or indirectly by activating t cells and macrophages,

59
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:03.630
the natural killer cells,

60
00:04:03.631 --> 00:04:07.890
the NK cells need to integrate a number of signals to determine how they're

61
00:04:07.891 --> 00:04:11.880
going to respond.
They have activating uh,

62
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:17.210
signals and then there are also signals that suppress them and they have

63
00:04:17.701 --> 00:04:18.990
receptors for both sides.

64
00:04:18.991 --> 00:04:23.991
So it's a balance of plus and minus and these are MHC receptors.

65
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.090
Okay.
So it,
there are activating and inhibiting receptors.

66
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.380
They natural killer cells attack cells that are downregulating MHC one and they

67
00:04:37.381 --> 00:04:39.840
attack cells that are expressing stress signals.

68
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.330
So it is a balance of a number of different kinds of signals coming into

69
00:04:45.331 --> 00:04:50.331
receptors on natural killer cells that result in there attacking and killing.

70
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.910
How can this auto immune response be subverted by a cancer cell?

71
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.390
<v 1>Okay.</v>

72
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.700
<v 0>There are certain t reg cells,</v>

73
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.760
the CD four plus and CD 25 plus t regs that suppress autoimmune responses.

74
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.420
So they inhibit immune cells that would attack self,

75
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:15.890
that would attack cancer.

76
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:22.420
Tumor cells secrete a cytokine to or growth factor Beta that converts these t

77
00:05:23.661 --> 00:05:24.494
regs

78
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.650
<v 1>okay.</v>

79
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.890
<v 0>From plus minus and the plus plus</v>

80
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.190
leads us convert a population of immune cells.

81
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.720
They would otherwise mediate attacks on them into cells that are ineffective,

82
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.510
thereby evading immune surveillance.

83
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.880
Neutralizing tour growth factor,

84
00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:49.300
Beta derived from tumor cells blocked this conversion.

85
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:55.140
And that essentially meant that the immune system remained capable of attacking

86
00:05:56.561 --> 00:05:57.394
the cancer.

87
00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.340
Tumors can also modify their metabolism in ways that suppress cytotoxic or

88
00:06:06.761 --> 00:06:11.761
antigen presenting cells so they can modify their metabolism so that they can

89
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.610
interfere with the defense mechanisms being deployed against them.

90
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:24.280
They deal with low oxygen by operating upregulating glycolysis.

91
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.880
This lowers the Ph in the tumor microenvironment.

92
00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:33.270
So you should think that of of both oxygen becoming scarce and the environment

93
00:06:34.211 --> 00:06:35.740
becoming more acidic,

94
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:42.850
tumor cells are then directly competing for glucose with glycolytic immune
cells.

95
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.610
So they're taking away the food from the immune cells.

96
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.670
The lowered Ph interferes with the maturation and activation of cytotoxic t

97
00:06:51.671 --> 00:06:53.890
cells and antigen presenting cells.

98
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.940
So they are slowing the growth and differentiation of the immune system that

99
00:07:00.791 --> 00:07:04.840
would attack them.
So two hallmarks of cancer,

100
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.280
which are altered glucose metabolism and immune suppression may be linked

101
00:07:09.281 --> 00:07:10.114
together.

102
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:12.690
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

103
00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:17.690
<v 0>The upregulation of glycolysis is producing a cascade of effects on the cells of</v>

104
00:07:18.001 --> 00:07:22.470
the adaptive immune system.
So cancer cells are increasing,

105
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.150
their glycolytic pathway is causing ph to drop.

106
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.890
Uh,
it's also inducing angiogenesis.

107
00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.390
The t cells are being down regulated by that

108
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:39.563
<v 1>and</v>

109
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:44.660
<v 0>there are interferon gamma gamma's that are a cytokine produced by both the</v>

110
00:07:44.661 --> 00:07:48.560
natural killer cells and by the cytotoxic t cells.

111
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:54.580
Interferon gamma activates macrophages and modulates the differentiation of t

112
00:07:55.431 --> 00:07:57.560
helper cells and regulatory t cells.

113
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.370
So if the Ph is dropping,

114
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:06.020
then interferon gamma is being suppressed and this process is not occurred.

115
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.090
The hypoxia inducible factors,
the Hii F's

116
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.940
are transcription factors that respond to decreases in oxygen in the
environment.

117
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:22.160
The vascular endothelial growth factor,

118
00:08:22.161 --> 00:08:27.161
that's veg f there is a protein signal that stimulates angiogenesis and the mds

119
00:08:30.411 --> 00:08:35.000
sees in the diagram or myeloid immunosuppressive cells that increase up to 10

120
00:08:35.001 --> 00:08:37.190
fold in cancer patients.

121
00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:43.090
So this is a pathway where simply by altering Ph and suppressing the secretion

122
00:08:47.001 --> 00:08:48.230
of certain factors,

123
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:54.080
cells can be recruited that in fact suppressed immune response,

124
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:58.530
thus protecting cancer cells from attacks on the immune system.
So part of it,

125
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:04.250
part of the defense of cancer against attack by the immune system is simple

126
00:09:05.221 --> 00:09:07.440
changes in the biochemical environment,

127
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.870
in the nutritional environment of the cells.

128
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.393
<v 1>Okay?</v>

129
00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:18.420
<v 0>No tumor cells also down regulate expression of MHC one but they don't down</v>

130
00:09:19.381 --> 00:09:22.660
regulate it too much.
Viruses also do this.

131
00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:28.290
Some downregulation allows them to avoid the adaptive immune response that comes

132
00:09:28.571 --> 00:09:30.220
from cytotoxic t cells.

133
00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:36.210
But continuing to express a low level of MHC one protects them from an attack by

134
00:09:36.371 --> 00:09:37.480
natural killer cells.

135
00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:44.610
These are mechanisms that are quite similar to the ones used by viruses that to

136
00:09:45.011 --> 00:09:46.930
avoid detection and destruction.

137
00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:52.620
So this is convergent evolution that's hit upon both by viruses and by cancer

138
00:09:52.811 --> 00:09:57.160
cells to keep from getting killed by cells in the immune system.

139
00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:03.490
To summarize,
most precancerous growths are detected and destroyed.

140
00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:09.100
Some remain,
but they do not grow and are not detecting.

141
00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:15.960
Those that escape and progress to cancer are the ones that are either suppressed

142
00:10:15.971 --> 00:10:18.310
or that evaded immune immune surveillance.

143
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.990
They can do so with several mechanisms.
They can disable natural killer cells,

144
00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.150
they can subvert the auto immune response.

145
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:33.020
They can modify their metabolism to interfere with the immune response and they

146
00:10:33.331 --> 00:10:38.200
can down regulate the expression of MHC one
plus.

147
00:10:38.201 --> 00:10:41.620
They resembled pathogens in their manipulative ability.
