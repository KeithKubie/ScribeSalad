00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.700
Okay, there's a lot of math and.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:01.730
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.718
&gt;&gt; There's a lot of research behind

00:00:03.718 --> 00:00:06.274
those numbers but the numbers are still the

00:00:06.274 --> 00:00:10.747
numbers and I imagine, you know, it has sort of an anxiety effect on, on an

00:00:10.747 --> 00:00:16.400
individual. Or did you feel anxious or worried and what did you end up doing?

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.270
Did you, did you, did it change anything for you and did you take an action?

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.440
&gt;&gt; Well, I was very anxious and I called my doctor,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:32.220
he was away. I called another doctor and he was away. And I

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.630
called a friend who works at one of those local hospitals and I said this is the

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:45.640
situation, what do you recommend I do? And she gave me the name of a doctor,

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.650
and it was confirmed, by the time I had that information it was confirmed by

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.680
the doctor who had returned. So I went to see a breast oncologist

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.270
and, at a very large medical center

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.580
and at the same time she scheduled me to see a genetic

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.780
counselor. which is recommended, when you, when you get

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.850
this information it's recommended that you speak to someone and see

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.660
someone who understands the genetics so I did see this person in

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.530
the physician and the generic counselor on the same day and she was

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.210
gave me a very thorough exam and a very thorough explanation there was no rush.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.800
And I was advised, to consider, strongly

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:48.365
having my ovaries removed. And to have twice a year breast exam,

00:01:48.365 --> 00:01:54.805
and a one time a year breast MRI,

00:01:54.805 --> 00:02:00.910
and a breast mammogram. And I followed up, I've already followed up

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:07.190
two times. I see her twice a year, and I've had the MRI and breast exam twice.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.509
&gt;&gt; Wow, you took a lot of action.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.020
&gt;&gt; I did.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.060
&gt;&gt; And this was all based on the advice and the the

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.069
I should say the, the medical advice of a genetic counselor and your clinician?

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.042
&gt;&gt; Right. And the genetic council took a history of

00:02:24.042 --> 00:02:29.064
everyone in the family, mother's, mother's, father's,

00:02:29.064 --> 00:02:35.220
grandfather's. And it was interesting

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.205
to, to find out my grand, my maternal grandmother

00:02:40.205 --> 00:02:48.340
died when my mother was five. So we're talking about the 1920s and I was always

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.540
told my grandmother died of stomach cancer and the genetic counts that brought

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.730
up the possibility that she had had ovarian cancer, of course we wouldn't know,

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.230
this was the 1920s. And that was what we, would be heard, that she died

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.390
of stomach cancer but it could have been ovarian cancer.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.570
&gt;&gt; In this process, was it, was it just a personal decision for you or did you

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.010
include family members in, in discussing it and

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.130
trying to figure out what to do as well?

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.310
&gt;&gt; Well, I'll be married 50 years in.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.330
&gt;&gt; Contraulations.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.310
&gt;&gt; 2014. I'm very close with my husband, and he and

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.900
I discussed this, and it just seemed like it was the right thing to do. Of

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.050
course, I read a lot, and I had family

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.020
members who had breast cancer, and ovarian cancer,

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.280
and none of them were BRCA2 or any BRCA

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.690
for that matter. So, it wasn't as if I knew anybody that

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.150
had this, was in this situation.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.350
&gt;&gt; if you had any advice to tell somebody who

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.240
just found out they have a BRCA 1 or BRCA 2

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.580
mutation, is there anything you think it's important for them to

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.150
know or any particular advice or message you would give them?

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.440
&gt;&gt; Well, if someone does inquire and finds out.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.740
I certainly think they should get genetic counselling. And see

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:25.794
a physician who is a specialist, in breast

00:04:25.794 --> 00:04:31.490
oncology. Who is aware of the latest and greatest

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.070
research. we're fortunate to live in an area where

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.030
there are wonderful hospitals and research centers. And so I strongly

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.890
advise people to take action and

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.050
do what's best for them. I know age is a

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.250
factor. If you find out you're in your 20s or 30s

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.020
and you haven't started a family or had children yet, what's

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.040
recommended might be entirely different than what was recommended for me.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.790
&gt;&gt; Great. Carol, thank you so much for being here.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.950
&gt;&gt; Thank you for exploring this topic.
