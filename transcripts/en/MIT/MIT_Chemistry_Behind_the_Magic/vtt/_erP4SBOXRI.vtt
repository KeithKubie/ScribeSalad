00:00:07.045 --> 00:00:08.920
JESSICA HARROP: Hi, I'm
Jessica and today I'm

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.560
going to be talking about
a chemical demonstration I

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.920
like to call elements on fire.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.530
Let's watch as MIT's
Dr. John Dolhun--

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.350
here he is-- creates
a rainbow of colors

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.360
at the Cambridge
Science Festival.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.160
JOHN DOLHUN: So
what I'd like to do

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:32.400
is do a grand finale
by actually burning

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.175
some elements since we're
talking about elements.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:53.800
And we're going to have a little
rondo music to go with this.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.140
So Clifton can go
ahead and do that.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.900
I've got some lithium, some
boron, strontium, sodium,

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.030
and potassium.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.850
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.560
So there should be quite a
broad spectrum of colors here.

00:01:22.657 --> 00:01:25.560
So the boron is a
nice green color.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.616
The lithium is a beautiful red.

00:01:31.616 --> 00:01:35.790
The sodium back
here is a yellow.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.860
We've got a little
bit of strontium which

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.590
is kind of the bluish-red.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.560
I think the blue is
probably the methanol.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.570
And the potassium
is a little bit

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.410
of a violet in with
a yellow color.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.655
Can you see those?

00:02:02.774 --> 00:02:04.190
JESSICA HARROP:
So Dr. Dolhun puts

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.199
salts of five different
elements in watch glasses--

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:16.820
lithium, boron, strontium,
sodium, and potassium.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.210
He also adds a little
methanol to each watch glass.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.640
Then he lights them all
on fire, and they produce

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.580
flames of different colors.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.940
Lithium is red.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.460
Boron is green.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.010
Strontium is a blue-red.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.890
Sodium is yellow.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.620
And potassium is violet
with yellow streaks.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.930
So what's happening?

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.070
Well, the flame heats up
the elements giving them

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.020
more thermal energy.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.170
This excites the electrons from
their ground or lower energy

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.552
state to an excited or
higher energy state.

00:02:48.552 --> 00:02:49.760
This is what that looks like.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.110
Since energy cannot be
created or destroyed,

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.840
any energy that was absorbed by
the atom must be emitted again

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.170
as the electron returns
to the ground state.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.860
This energy is emitted as light.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.825
So why do different elements
have different colored flames?

00:03:21.825 --> 00:03:23.950
Because the difference in
energy between the ground

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.600
state and the excited state
is unique for each element.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.830
And what does energy
have to do with it?

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.210
Well the human eye perceives
photons or light particles

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.270
of different energies
as different colors.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.700
So red light is a lower
energy than yellow, which

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.350
is a lower energy than blue.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.195
Think about it like
a rainbow spectrum.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.330
So energy increases
along the spectrum.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.220
Red is low energy light.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.920
And violet is high energy light.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.490
Going back to our
atoms' energy levels,

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.310
if the difference between the
ground state and the excited

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.510
state is smaller, the light
particle is of lower energy.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.510
And we see that as redder light.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.630
Conversely, if the
energy gap is larger,

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.820
the light particle
is of higher energy.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.000
And we see that as bluer light.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.940
And this is a simplified
picture of what's happening.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.390
Each element has a unique
set of excited states, which

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.890
each leads to a different
pattern of light,

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.069
which we see as red,
green, yellow, et cetera.

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:34.860
[MUSIC PLAYING] Hope
you enjoyed the video,

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.040
and I'll see you next time.
