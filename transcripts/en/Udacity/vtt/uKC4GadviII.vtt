00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.860
&gt;&gt; Now if you promise to stay away from the Leafy Greens like Kale

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.220
or Spinach. I think this dose of Warfarin will be just right for you

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.620
[SOUND].

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:09.280
&gt;&gt; Thanks Doc.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.200
&gt;&gt; No problem.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.122
&gt;&gt; Knowing your Genotype for the VKORC1 or

00:00:12.122 --> 00:00:16.149
CYP2C9 Allele could be really important information to share

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.610
with your doctor. So, he or she can prescribe

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.650
the right dose of Warfarin that maximizes the Efficacy

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.570
and minimizes the Toxicity. Now even if you don't

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.720
know this genetic information beforehand there are ways of

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.220
measuring your reaction to a particular dose of a

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.670
drug like Warfarin after you've started treatment. But wouldn't

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.760
it be nice to know this genetic information in

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.050
advance? So let's see if you can put all

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.320
this knowledge together that we've learned about in this

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.590
lesson and come up with the right prescription. You

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.710
can prove to me that you understand what the right prescription would be if you

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.740
can tell me what combination of the following possibilities could result in

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:59.080
maximum warfarin toxicity. Remember that, warfarin toxicity means too

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:05.140
much warfarin. To help you out I put down here the pathway. Warfarin blocks

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.710
Blood Clotting, if it blocks blood clotting too much it actually causes bleeding

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.190
or hemorrhaging. Its mechanism of action is

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.000
by blocking VKORC1. Which promotes Vitamin K

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.890
recycling. Which leads to blood clotting and

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.670
CYP2C9 metabolizes warfarin. So it effectively inhibits

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.450
the activity of warfarin. For each of

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.280
these three possible categories here. I want you

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.080
to tell me which total combination of

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.550
these three things would result in maximum warfarin

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.440
toxicity? And once you do that I want you to describe for me why you

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.730
think that is. Why the particular combination

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.260
you've selected you think is the right answer.
