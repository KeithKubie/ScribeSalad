00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.810
It is late and I'm sleepy but I
feel strangely motivated to

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.160
do SAT problems, so I will do
SAT problems. So we'll start a

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.860
new test.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.760
This is going to be test 2, and
we're going to start on

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.750
section 3, and that's
on page 459 of the--

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.010
what's that book called?

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.250
The Official SAT Study Guide
by The College Board.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.730
So let's get started.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.880
So the first problem,
problem number 1.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:35.740
It said, if 3b plus 1 is less
than 10, which of the

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.640
following cannot to
be the value of b?

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.410
So which of the following cannot
be the value of b?

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:48.420
And they give a couple of
choices: a, minus 1; b, 0; c,

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.190
1; d, 2; e, 3.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.310
And you could start with choice
a and just keep going

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.120
through all of them and inspect
it really fast. The

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.020
way I would do it is I would
automatically convert this

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.180
equation, subtract one
from both sides.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.900
You say, well, this is the same
thing as 3 times b has to

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.010
be less than 9.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.050
I just subtracted 1 from both
sides of this, right?

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.950
And if you look at these, well
3 times negative 1, that's

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.330
negative 3, that's
less than 9.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.110
3 times 0, that's 0,
that's less than 9.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.670
Let me write that.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.850
3 times negative 1
is negative 3.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.960
3 times 0 is 0.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.480
3 times 1 is 3, 3
times 2 is 6.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.140
These are all less
than 9, right?

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.370
I just substituted each
of these for b.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.720
But 3 times 3, that is actually
equal to 9, right?

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.760
3 times 3 is equal to 9, which
is not less than 9.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.530
So our choice is e.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.170
Number 2, I think I've space
to do it on this without

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.510
having to clear the
chalkboard.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:54.220
It says, 2 to the 4x
is equal to 16.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.460
Whenever you see one of these
problems where the variable is

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.700
in the exponent and you have
different bases here, the

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.810
trick is really just to convert
them to the same base.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.479
So can I write 16
as a power of 2?

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.509
Well sure.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.870
Two to the what power is 16?

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.780
Well, 2 to the squared is 4, 2
to the 3rd power is 8, to the

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.830
4th power is 16, right?

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.840
So we could write this same
equation as 2 to the 4x is

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.790
equal to, another way of writing
16 is 2 to the 4th

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.380
power, right?

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.110
And now, that this should
seem a little bit more

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.370
straightforward.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.130
2 to the 4x is the same thing
as 2 to the 4th, so 4x must

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.390
equal 4, right?

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:44.470
4x must equal 4, so
x is equal to 1.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.410
And that choice exists, so I
feel confident in my answer.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.922
Let's move on.

00:02:51.922 --> 00:02:52.630
I think soon.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.340
I might be coming down
with the flu.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.290
Let's hope not, because that
would limit my ability to turn

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.060
out SAT problems on YouTube.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.310
Number 3.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.920
How much greater is r minus
2 than r plus 5?

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.610
Well, if I wanted to know how
much one number is greater

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.310
than another, if I ask you how
much greater is 10 than 5,

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.230
what do I do?

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.890
Well, I take 10 minus 5
and that's my answer.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.450
So example: 10 minus
5 is 5, so 10 is 5

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.320
greater than 5, right?

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.160
So if I want to know how much
greater than r minus 2 is r

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.550
plus 5, right-- and r plus 5
is going to be the greater

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.370
one-- you just subtract them.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:50.270
So we say r plus 5
minus r minus 2.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.930
So r plus 5 minus r-- I'm just
distributing the negative

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.505
number-- plus 2.

00:03:55.505 --> 00:03:59.040
The r's cancel out, and
you get the answer.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.020
It's 7.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.570
And you really didn't even
have to do it this way,

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.260
because this r could be any
number, and the answer should

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.550
be the same no matter
what r is.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.730
And obviously it worked out
because the r's canceled out.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.410
The easiest thing, let me just
assume that r is 0 because we

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.060
can, because it shouldn't
matter what r is.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:27.890
If r was 0, then the question
is how much greater than

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.970
negative 2 is plus 5, right?

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.440
I just assumed that r was 0.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.540
And then you would do
the same thing.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.950
You would do 5 minus negative
2, which is equal to 7.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.060
And you could draw them on the
number line if you wanted to

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.270
visually approach
this problem.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.480
All right, this next problem
looks visual.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.810
Problem number 4.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.300
OK, so it has a square.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.770
I don't need to draw it fancy,
let me just draw it freehand.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.900
So, it's a box, it
looks like this.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.200
They say that the box
is open at the top.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.745
So that's the bottom
right there.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.630
OK, and they give
measurements.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.690
This end is 4, this end is 3,
and then the height is 2.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.170
And they were to say if we were
to essentially cut the

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.620
sides of this box and flatten
it all out, which of these

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.410
choices are that this
box-- this is a pure

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:41.370
visualization problem.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.530
But to flatten it out,
as I said, you would

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.610
cut you this line.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.070
You'd cut this line.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.380
I'm just imagining
what I would do

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.230
if I had some scissors.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.260
And there's no top to
the box, right?

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.360
And then I would take this side
and I would flatten it

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.980
out that way.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.735
This side, I would flatten
it out that way.

00:05:57.735 --> 00:06:00.880
That back side, I would flatten
it out there, and that

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.740
side, I would flatten
it out there.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.060
So you'd have the base.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:14.435
The base would look like this
where you have 3 would be the

00:06:14.435 --> 00:06:16.120
width, right?

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:22.820
This side corresponds
to this side, right?

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.220
This side would correspond
to this side.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.970
And that would be of length 4.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.300
And then this height 2--
let me draw that.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:40.610
So this flap, which I
draw in brown, would

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:41.860
come out like this.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.890
And this distance right
here would be 2.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:50.810
And then you would have
another-- let's say, the flap

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:51.440
in the back.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.650
Let me draw it in another
color, in a dark purple.

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:02.000
This flap in the back would
come out like this, flat.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.410
It would also have 2 length.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:10.220
And then the other 2 flaps,
like this one, would

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.470
come out like this.

00:07:14.004 --> 00:07:16.130
And of course this has 2 here.

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:18.630
And then finally I have
that flap in the back.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.750
I need to pick a color.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:26.330
This flap in the back would
come out like that, right?

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.900
And I'll shade it in
like I shaded in

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.150
the original picture.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:30.090
And that would also have 2.

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.370
So this is a pure visualization
problem, there's

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.340
not a lot more that I can
do to explain this.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.550
And there's no top
to this box.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:40.220
And we had a bottom.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.030
So this is the choice.

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:46.770
See, if we rotated it around a
little bit, it's choice e.

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.350
Actually rotated it around,
because choice

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:49.580
e looks like this.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:59.780
Choice e looks like this.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.520
I'm not drawing it that
well, but it looks

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.280
something like this.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.120
Where they say that this length
is 4, this length is 2,

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.320
and this length is 3.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:11.500
So they took this and they
essentially rotated it so that

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:16.390
this side becomes this side.

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:19.630
And then this side becomes
that side.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:23.990
So they just rotated
it clockwise a

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:25.550
little over 90 degrees.

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:26.670
And that's how they
got that answer.

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:29.670
So this is a pure visualization
problem.

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:34.020
With that, I have about 90
seconds left in this video, so

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.659
I'll wait to do it in
the next video.

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:37.110
I'll see
