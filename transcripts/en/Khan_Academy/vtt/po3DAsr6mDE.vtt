ROBERT SIEGEL:
From NPR News this

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.314
is "All Things Considered."

00:00:11.314 --> 00:00:14.390
I'm Robert Siegel, and it's time
now for All Tech Considered.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.650
These days, you can
learn just about anything

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.650
from a YouTube video.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.774
SPEAKER 1: First of
all, we want to put

00:00:26.774 --> 00:00:27.960
this bow around his neck.

ROBERT SIEGEL: A
South Carolina man

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.070
teaches us how to tie a bow tie.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.499
His YouTube video has been
viewed more than 650,000 times.

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:38.040
Or maybe you've always wanted
to learn how to play the piano.

thing minor, shall we?

00:00:40.851 --> 00:00:42.856
We take the middle
finger and move it

00:00:42.856 --> 00:00:44.141

ROBERT SIEGEL: Today
on All Tech Considered,

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.656
we're going to
talk with a man who

00:00:47.656 --> 00:00:50.920
is devoting his life to
creating YouTube tutorials.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.420
[PLAYBACK]

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.570
SALMAN KHAN: Welcome
to the presentation

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.090
on multiplying fractions.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.040
Today you'll be very happy
because you'll find out

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.860
that this is one of
the few times where

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.050
multiplying something is
easier than adding it.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.175
And if you don't believe
me let's do some problems.

00:01:04.175 --> 00:01:04.530
[END PLAYBACK]

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.200
ROBERT SIEGEL: That
is Salman Khan.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.650
Not the Salman Khan
who's a Bollywood star.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.300
This is the Salman Khan,
former hedge fund analyst

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.810
turned online tutor.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.830
He has produced more than
1,000 YouTube videos, ranging

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.360
from basic multiplication
of fractions

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.780
to polynomial
approximation of functions.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.200
And he joins us now from
Silicon Valley in California.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.530
Welcome.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:24.160
SALMAN KHAN: Thanks.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.743
ROBERT SIEGEL: Your
channel on YouTube

00:01:25.743 --> 00:01:27.830
is called the "Khan
Academy Channel."

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.170
Why did you decide to
become a tutor online?

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.320
SALMAN KHAN: It happened
fairly organically.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.920
I started remotely tutoring some
of my cousins in New Orleans.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.340
I was working, as you mentioned,
as a hedge fund analyst

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.760
in Boston at the time.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.900
My cousin Nadia
was having trouble

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.574
placing into the
pre-algebra class.

00:01:44.574 --> 00:01:45.990
So I talked to
Nadia a little bit.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.904
And I said, how about you and
me do some remote tutoring

00:01:48.904 --> 00:01:51.320
after I come home from work
and you come home from school.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.984
We'll get a
conference call going,

00:01:52.984 --> 00:01:54.525
and maybe we'll use
Instant Messenger

00:01:54.525 --> 00:01:55.733
or we'll find something else.

00:01:55.733 --> 00:01:57.600
We ended up using Yahoo Doodle.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.890
And word got around
amongst friends and family,

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.274
and I had a little cohort
of about 10 or 15 students.

00:02:02.274 --> 00:02:04.190
And then it just became
difficult logistically

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.770
between my work and
their soccer practice.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.370
And I had to keep tutoring
the same lessons over and over

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.330
again depending on
how old they were,

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.577
so I decided to just record my
lessons but in the same style

00:02:14.577 --> 00:02:16.910
that I was doing with Nadia
that seemed to be effective.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.170
And I started just recording
them and putting them

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.050
on YouTube.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.950
And even your or my
great-great-grandkids

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.760
could learn from
these same videos.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.718
ROBERT SIEGEL: Now, I've
watched a few of them.

00:02:24.718 --> 00:02:27.390
You never appear on
screen, just a mouse

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.220
arrow that draws in different
colors on a black background.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.250
And you narrate.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.840
How are you actually
making these?

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.630
SALMAN KHAN: When
I started, it was

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.880
literallY-- I took
Microsoft Paint, made

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.260
the background black, picked
some florescent colors,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.349
and I used this
shareware-- I think

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:42.890
it was called Screen
Video Recorders,

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.300
it was a $20 piece of
software-- to capture my screen

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.040
and to record my voice
at the same time.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.080
And that would just
produce the videos.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.900
I just did it because
that was, I thought,

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.050
the cheapest and fastest way
to make a decent quality video.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.840
Since then, one of
the viewers actually

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.140
donated a $300 piece
of software called

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.680
Camtasia Recorder for
the screen capture.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.360
And now I use another piece of
shareware called Smooth Draw 2,

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.430
I think it's called.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.700
I use that to draw.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.070
And I just have a little
Wacom graphic pen tablet

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.230
to do the writing.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.060
ROBERT SIEGEL: Now
let's go through some

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.880
of the range of what
you're doing tutorials

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.156
in, in mathematics and
chemistry, biology.

00:03:17.156 --> 00:03:18.780
SALMAN KHAN: Yeah,
in the non-sciences,

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.297
there's obviously a lot
on finance and economics.

00:03:21.297 --> 00:03:23.130
Actually, a lot of that
comes from last year

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.600
during the financial crisis.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.074
In my hedge fund world, I
put all my money in cash

00:03:27.074 --> 00:03:28.990
and I started reading
the Federal Reserve Act.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.606
I read it about 10 times just
to understand all of the levers

00:03:31.606 --> 00:03:33.480
that the Federal Reserve
Chairman could pull.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.560
And I said, well,
what's a better

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.600
use of my time than
whatever I just learned.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.400
Let me make a series
of YouTube videos

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.620
on fractional reserve banking
in the Federal Reserve.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.160
And I don't plan
on limiting myself

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.672
to just the maths
and the sciences

00:03:43.672 --> 00:03:45.130
ROBERT SIEGEL: Now
here's something

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.510
I noticed while
watching a tutorial

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.710
you were giving about stocks.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.620
You were, I think,
making the point

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.830
that a stock that
costs $1 a share

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.440
is not necessarily cheaper than
a stock that costs $10 a share.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.600
As I'm watching
it, a crawl comes

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.890
across the bottom from
Google directing me

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.420
to a website where
I can look over

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.215
the prospectus for
various penny stocks.

00:04:08.215 --> 00:04:10.340
It's an advertisement, and
indeed the advertisement

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.067
is actually based
on a proposition

00:04:13.067 --> 00:04:15.400
that you're shooting down in
the course of the tutorial.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.899
SALMAN KHAN: [LAUGHING]

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:17.850
ROBERT SIEGEL: So
who's advertising?

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.940
How many of your
courses are advertised?

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.470
And how do you feel about
this kind of education

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.180
being underwritten by a sponsor?

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.050
SALMAN KHAN: The advertising
is what YouTube puts up just

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.890
by virtue of it
being on YouTube.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.040
I do share some of the revenue.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.310
It was pushing about $1,500 of
revenue to Khan Academy Inc,

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.937
which is a 501(c)(3)
not-for-profit organization.

00:04:38.937 --> 00:04:40.770
So it's going to the
organization right now.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.779
It's not coming to me as
a salary anyway right now.

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:45.820
ROBERT SIEGEL: Without
the advertising, are you--

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.194
I know you were working for
a hedge fund before-- but are

00:04:48.194 --> 00:04:49.760
you-- is this self-sustaining?

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.270
Can you support this as a
career doing it based on people

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.170
free of charge
looking at videos?

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.950
SALMAN KHAN: Well right now,
it isn't self-sustaining

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:59.910
as of today.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.680
I joke that it's being
funded by the Salman Khan

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.380
Bank Of America
checking account.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.900
My wife has given me a year
to make it self-sustaining,

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.690
although I think she'll give me
a little more leeway than that.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.946
If I get no outside
support, there

00:05:12.946 --> 00:05:14.320
are the donations
that are coming

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.410
in from the viewers themselves.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.600
That's bringing in
about $1,500 a month.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.406
I have these kind of
low-key ads that you

00:05:22.406 --> 00:05:24.030
mentioned that are
just off of YouTube.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.280
If I were to be aggressive
with the advertising, which

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.410
I don't want to do,
I could probably

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.640
generate another few
thousand dollars a month.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.690
And at the rate that the
viewership is growing--

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.390
it's growing at about
15% or 20% per month--

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.450
I'm reasonably confident
that in about a year the site

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.800
itself could pay my rent
and put food on the table.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.860
ROBERT SIEGEL: Are you a faculty
of one at the Khan Academy?

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.300
SALMAN KHAN: I currently am.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.510
There are people who have
come out of the woodworks

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.440
really in the last
two months or so

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.077
to volunteer
translating the videos.

00:05:51.077 --> 00:05:52.660
There's a chemistry
teacher in Uruguay

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.350
who did the first translation.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.000
There's an effort going on
to translate into Arabic,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.450
into Polish, into
Portuguese, into German,

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.180
but right now all
of the content is

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.825
and has been generated by me.

00:06:03.825 --> 00:06:05.980
ROBERT SIEGEL: You come
across in these videos

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.950
as a very natural teacher.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.687
And I wonder, on the way
through MIT and Harvard Business

00:06:11.687 --> 00:06:13.770
School and the hedge fund
trade, did you ever just

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.240
consider becoming a teacher?

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.100
SALMAN KHAN: I actually
was a teacher just

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.955
to make some extra
cash during college.

00:06:18.955 --> 00:06:21.900
I was an MCAT instructor
for the Princeton Review

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.260
for one summer, and
I used to a volunteer

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.450
teaching middle school
kids at the Devotion

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:27.720
School in Brookline.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.570
It's something that
I really enjoy,

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.760
but the economics of
the hedge fund world

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.585
were a little bit better.

00:06:34.585 --> 00:06:36.960
ROBERT SIEGEL: You could have
done a very simple tutorial

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.690
on the difference between
the pay of a hedge fund

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.060
analyst and a teacher.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.560
When you're teaching
online, there's

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.100
not a real-time exchange
with the students,

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.090
and their comments to you
aren't coming back in real time.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:54.760
Do you think that would be
an added virtue of education,

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.205
or does it matter that much?

00:06:56.205 --> 00:06:57.580
SALMAN KHAN: I
think that this is

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.990
an advantage I have over
a traditional teacher,

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.007
just from my limited
experience from teaching live.

00:07:04.007 --> 00:07:05.465
One of the hardest
things is to sit

00:07:05.465 --> 00:07:08.140
in front of a classroom
of 20 to 30 students,

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.569
and maybe five of them are
giving you a nice attentive

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:12.610
expression and the rest
of them have blank faces.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.880
You don't know if they're bored
or they're falling behind.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.255
It makes you insecure and you
don't know what to do next.

00:07:17.255 --> 00:07:19.470
But I go to my computer,
spend 10 minutes,

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.900
explain something as I would
explain it to you or my cousin,

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.770
and then I upload it on YouTube.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.180
The whole process takes
maybe half an hour.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.930
And within an hour of
putting up a video,

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.700
a few hundred people
will watch it.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.540
And I wait for them to give
that YouTube five-star rating

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.240
and put a couple of comments up
saying, oh, this is so great.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.670
I was going to fail this class.

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.961
Now I'm going to pass the
exam tomorrow, whatever else.

00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:43.510
So I wait for that
feedback, and that gives me

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:44.970
the confidence to keep going.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.790
ROBERT SIEGEL: Salman Khan, who

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:49.580

khanacademy.org.

00:07:52.404 --> 00:07:54.070
Thank you very much
for talking with us.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.050

you very much.
