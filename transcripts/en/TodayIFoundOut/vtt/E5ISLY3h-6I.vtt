00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:11.820
Can You Really Bust A Gut From Eating Too
Much At Once

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.519
Although extremely rare, some people actually
have ruptured their stomachs after eating

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:21.089
too much, and, perhaps not surprisingly, many
did not survive.

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:25.710
When a stomach ruptures, the billions of bacteria
that normally live inside the gut flow out

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.600
into the abdominal cavity where they thrive.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.180
The infection that ensues causes acute abdominal
pain, a tensing of the belly muscles, fever,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.480
nausea, bloating and vomiting.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.450
Without treatment with antibiotics, cleaning
of the cavity and repair of the stomach, the

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.800
person dies.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.040
So why wouldn’t the person just vomit if
things got too uncomfortable?

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.220
As Dr. Rachel Vreeman explains, the individuals
often have “unusual eating habits to an

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.550
extent that their bodies’ reflexes no longer
respond as they normally do.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.800
Their bodies’ reflexes have been ignored
or abused for so long that they no longer

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.470
vomit at the appropriate time.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.610
And then once the stomach gets to this extremely
distended point, the stomach muscles are too

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.910
stretched out to be strong enough to vomit
the food out.”

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.750
In one early case, in 1941, a 51-year-old
woman blew out her belly with a “soda bicarbonate

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.620
[think Alka Seltzer] after cocktails and a
heavy dinner.”[1] That meal included meatballs,

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.490
tomatoes, cheese, bread, potatoes, macaroni,
pie and whiskey.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.530
At least one commentator noted that the “gas
from the fizz . . . apparently stretched the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.520
stomach to its breaking point.”

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.070
A similar thing happened to a 71-year-old
woman in 1955.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.300
In 1963, a 40-year-old New York woman, who
had lost 16 pounds in the two months prior

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.710
to bursting by strictly following a 1,000
calorie per day diet, suddenly became ill

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.800
after eating a corned beef sandwich.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.691
The small meal caused her to experience severe
nausea, but she was unable to vomit, and she

00:01:52.691 --> 00:01:55.890
began feeling a sense of impending doom.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.950
Overnight she got worse, and by the next morning,
she was not in her right mind and in severe

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:01.950
belly pain.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.240
She was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital,
but initial x-rays did not show a rupture,

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.099
so she was treated for over a week with intravenous
fluids and suctioning of her stomach.

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.150
After 11 days, her condition had worsened,
and they finally opened her up and discovered

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.629
a long rip, that appeared to have been there
for quite a while.

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.480
The operation was a success and within a month,
she was discharged.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.640
Seeming to afflict women more than men, in
1985 The Lancet reported the death of a 23-year-old

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.370
fashion model from a ruptured stomach.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.480
During her last meal (which they were able
to catalogue during the autopsy), the young

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.980
woman ate a half-pound steak, one pound of
liver, two pounds of kidney, two eggs, one

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.739
cauliflower, 10 peaches, four pears, four
bananas, two apples, two glasses of milk,

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.659
two slices of bread and two pounds each of
grapes, plums and carrots.

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:55.180
It should also come as no surprise that bursting
stomachs appears to be more common among bulimia

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.180
sufferers.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.230
The Weekly World News reported in 1994 that
an autopsy revealed that a 19-year-old model

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.430
Anne-Marie Boules, in a four- to five- hour
period, gorged on 20 pounds of food that consisted

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.499
of an entire fried chicken, a dozen chicken
wings, appetizers, fruit cocktails, two pints

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:17.439
of beer, two large roast beefs, three baked
potatoes, a head of cauliflower with cheese

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:23.489
sauce, a loaf of garlic bread, 8 cookies and
a gallon of ice cream before her stomach ruptured.

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.810
Prior to her binge, the 5’9″ 110lb.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.569
model had kept her figure trim by eating only
fruits and vegetables, but during her last

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.379
meal, she is said to have inhaled the food
so quickly, she apparently swallowed much

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:36.870
of it without even chewing.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.370
Her rupture was sufficiently severe that she
died from internal hemorrhaging within about

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.909
20 minutes.

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:46.950
One of the reason bulimics are more prone
to rupture is that shriveled stomachs are

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.090
more susceptible to tearing.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.779
In fact, at least four former POWs after World
War II ruptured their bellies after eating

00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:55.569
relatively modest meals.

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.129
One of these ingested, over an entire day,
only a quart of coffee, a few potatoes, a

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:03.239
half pound of bread and two quarts of soup.

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.829
On that note, not all ruptures are caused
by overeating – at least not directly.

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:13.699
In 2011, a 25-year-old woman from Coventry
who had a gastric band (the band is placed

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:19.000
around the stomach and tightened to aid with
weight loss) nearly died when the band slipped,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.750
causing a wound that turned septic.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.620
For the first couple of months, she suffered
from heartburn, vomiting and difficulty swallowing,

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.520
but eventually the pain became unbearable.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.120
At the hospital, her surgeons described her
burst belly as “like a jigsaw,” but she

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:51.530
received a transplant and survived.
