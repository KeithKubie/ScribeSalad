00:00:01.416 --> 00:00:03.940
DEENA SHAKIR: And I'm
thrilled to introduce you

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.190
to my good friend Christopher
Schroeder who literally

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.034
just flew in from DC
on the last flight

00:00:08.034 --> 00:00:09.450
before they shut
down the airport.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.120
So big round of
applause to Chris

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.750
for actually making
his way out here.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.040
CHRISTOPHER M.
SCHROEDER: Thank you.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.090
DEENA SHAKIR: Chris and I first
met three or four years ago

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.670
when I was working at
the State Department

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.390
and actually helped put together
the first Presidential Summit

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.620
on Entrepreneurship
in the Middle East.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.710
Chris is a long-time
internet entrepreneur.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.314
The vast majority of his
career up until recently

00:00:31.314 --> 00:00:33.230
has not been spent working
on the Middle East.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:33.560
CHRISTOPHER M. SCHROEDER: No.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.319
DEENA SHAKIR: But I'd love
for him to come and tell us

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:38.610
about his story, what got
him interested in the region,

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.380
and what ultimately proliferated
in this really groundbreaking

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.020
book called "Startup Rising,
The Entrepreneurial Revolution

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.379
Remaking the Middle East."

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.545
It's filled with stories
of incredible entrepreneurs

00:00:48.545 --> 00:00:52.030
who have traversed
trying circumstances

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.310
and represent stories of hope
in the region that really paint

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.990
a different picture than
what we hear in mainstream

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.550
media about what's going on.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.700
Stories of young
women and older men

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.790
all over the Middle
East from North Africa

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.650
to Saudi Arabia who
are really coming up

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.360
with amazing innovations in the
internet space specifically,

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.560
and I think will represent
an entirely new feature

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.520
for the region.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.480
So without further ado, I'd
like to turn it over to Chris.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.550
And I just have some informal
questions to get it going,

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.210
but feel free to talk about
anything that comes to mind.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.520
CHRISTOPHER M.
SCHROEDER: Awesome.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.561
DEENA SHAKIR: To start,
if you could just tell us

00:01:29.561 --> 00:01:31.122
a bit about yourself
and how you got

00:01:31.122 --> 00:01:33.205
interested in entrepreneurship
in the Middle East.

00:01:33.205 --> 00:01:34.770
CHRISTOPHER M.
SCHROEDER: So it's

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.570
wonderful to see all of you.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.611
Thank you for coming out.

00:01:36.611 --> 00:01:39.083
This is a counter narrative
story in many respects,

00:01:39.083 --> 00:01:41.334
and I have to tell you it
doesn't surprise me out here

00:01:41.334 --> 00:01:43.374
that people want to come
hear counter narratives,

00:01:43.374 --> 00:01:44.860
but it's been very
surprising to me

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.820
throughout the
launch of the book

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.337
about how people just can't get
their minds around a hopeful

00:01:48.337 --> 00:01:49.920
narrative in the
Middle East, and I'll

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.860
come back to the distinction
between hopefulness

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.830
and optimism in a moment.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.280
But this is not only a very
hopeful story about the Middle

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.560
East, but it's a
very hopeful story

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.830
about the rest of the world
as I think so many of you

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.060
know in many powerful ways.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.270
Look, I've been an
American-based internet

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.000
entrepreneur consumer facing
internet ad-based businesses

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.151
as an interpreter.

00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:08.525
I ran all the online businesses
for "The Washington Post"

00:02:08.525 --> 00:02:10.699
and "Newsweek" and
"Slate" some years ago.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:12.342
And then broke off
from that and then

00:02:12.342 --> 00:02:14.050
got a bunch of people
together, including

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.981
Mike Moritz of
Sequoia and started

00:02:15.981 --> 00:02:18.230
the social and content
platform on health and wellness

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.275
called Health Central.

00:02:19.275 --> 00:02:21.900
And so we built that out of the
east coast with some operations

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.670
here and around the
country, and sold

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.200
that a year and a half ago.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.930
And that's when I had some time
to go dig into this narrative.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.020
But how I came to it I think
was very accidental because it

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.460
really is a journey
of narrative bias,

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.390
and I think it's one of the
great cautions for all of us

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.140
in business and in
life generally speaking

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.432
about what narrative
animals we really

00:02:40.432 --> 00:02:42.140
are as people, because
we like our story.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.300
Right?

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.920
Now, each one of you
has a story about me.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.960
You have a story about
being in Silicon Valley.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.390
You have a story
about being at Google.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.540
You have a story about
where you're from.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.655
We all have stories.

00:02:49.655 --> 00:02:52.280
And the stories are unbelievably
important because from then we

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.847
can act, from them we can
think about what to do in life.

00:02:54.847 --> 00:02:56.680
But the challenge, of
course, of a narrative

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.250
is if you get
biased by it, you're

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.864
actually missing
obvious things that

00:03:00.864 --> 00:03:02.280
are happening
around you, which is

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.989
how the world can
change a powerful ways.

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.488
And it's particularly surprising
I think even an environment

00:03:06.488 --> 00:03:09.190
like this, where you would never
think you would have narrative

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.070
bias but, in fact, you do.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.750
And the journey for
me narrative bias

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.406
is particularly embarrassing
because in the three

00:03:15.406 --> 00:03:16.780
internet companies
that I've run,

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.379
I have outsourced technology
to pretty much every corner

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.920
of the world.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.420
Right?

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.420
South America, Eastern Europe,
Sri Lanka, India, of course,

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.010
Israel, and I've
traveled probably

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.450
to 85 countries in my life.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.800
So I've been everywhere.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.592
And I could not get
it through my mind

00:03:30.592 --> 00:03:33.050
and through the narrative that
we have in the United States

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.340
about the Middle East that
Mubarak's Egypt at this point

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.170
was kicking up an
ecosystem in technology

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.839
that we've seen everywhere.

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:43.380
And it's particularly surprising
because you guys know better

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.590
than anybody that if there
is, in fact, ubiquitous access

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.460
to broadband technology,
everything changes.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.520
You see everyone, you can
interact with everyone,

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.280
see the way the world works
in very, very powerful ways.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.384
Totally underestimated
is the fact

00:03:56.384 --> 00:03:58.800
that everyone's now essentially
got all of human knowledge

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.810
at their fingertips
essentially for free.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.320
I mean, this is a
universal, and yet

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.860
so strong was my narrative bias
that I couldn't believe it.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.780
I had helped form a group of
American CEOs and Arab CEOs

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.320
shortly after September
11, and as one

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.315
of the members of the
Arab side said recently,

00:04:16.315 --> 00:04:17.940
we're kind of saying
why do we do this?

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:18.648
I can't remember.

00:04:18.648 --> 00:04:20.820
It was 2004, and one
of them said, well,

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.330
we did it to prove to each other
that we're not all assholes.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.570
And in a way it was true.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.440
It was, in fact,
our attempt having

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.020
gotten to meet each other
through another business form

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.700
and having built
a lot of respect

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.260
among each other personally
to realize that we all

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.580
had narrative bias and
at this very crucial time

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.615
after September 11, it
was important to think

00:04:38.615 --> 00:04:39.740
about it in different ways.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:40.906
And so it was a huge agenda.

00:04:40.906 --> 00:04:42.537
We weren't doing
business per se,

00:04:42.537 --> 00:04:44.620
but we would meet in one
city in the United States

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.930
and one city in Europe and
then one city in the region,

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.230
and we would bring to bear
resources and relationships

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.860
we had from business, and
politics, and journalism,

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.230
and the blogosphere, or
whatever and just really to get

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.940
to understand each other better.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.944
2009 or so two really
extraordinary entrepreneurs

00:04:58.944 --> 00:05:00.360
from the Middle
East, one is a man

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.632
named Fadi Ghandour
who you know.

00:05:02.632 --> 00:05:04.437
Fadi was-- he's just amazing.

00:05:04.437 --> 00:05:06.770
I haven't met five people
like him in business anywhere,

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.349
but he was a builder of
Aramex, built it from nothing,

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:11.390
and Aramex is effectively
the FedEx in the Middle

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.120
East and Africa, and he just was
one of the great entrepreneurs

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.630
to do this.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.460
But he then very
soon became and is

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.802
today one of the real
anchors of the ecosystem.

00:05:18.802 --> 00:05:20.260
Someone in TechCrunch
described him

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.852
as the Ron Conway
of the Middle East.

00:05:21.852 --> 00:05:24.310
And so I'm not sure either of
those guys like that analogy,

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.354
but it is what it is.

00:05:25.354 --> 00:05:27.020
In a way, it describes
him a little bit.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.400
The other guy is Arif Naqvi who
is actually Pakistani but has

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.030
spent much time
in the Middle East

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.645
and built now what
is one of the,

00:05:35.645 --> 00:05:38.349
I think the new largest
private equity firms

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:39.890
for emerging growth
markets anywhere.

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.990
It's called Abraaj Capital
earning $10 billion.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.320
Anyway 2009, they
started talking

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.490
about the new
generation taking hold

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.607
of new technology in
very powerful ways.

00:05:48.607 --> 00:05:50.440
And most of us gringos
were just like, yeah,

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.606
that's a cute side show,
but that's not interesting.

00:05:52.606 --> 00:05:54.050
Let's talk about peace process.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.620
Let's talk about it.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.119
Whatever.

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:56.140
And they said, no man.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.306
This is something different.

00:05:57.306 --> 00:05:59.770
It is really, really different,
and they put their moneys

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.260
where their mouth
was in 2010, and they

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.106
had this enormous
gathering in Dubai,

00:06:04.106 --> 00:06:06.105
which is called Celebration
of Entrepreneurship,

00:06:06.105 --> 00:06:08.530
and some of you probably
were even there.

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.020
But it was 2,400 mostly young
people from North Africa

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.420
to Yemen with a waiting
list of another 2,500.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.960
No one wanted to talk
about Obama's Cairo speech.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.940
Nobody wanted to
talk about anything

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.520
other than building
their businesses,

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.652
and using technology in
really interesting ways,

00:06:24.652 --> 00:06:26.610
in ways that you all
would have felt completely

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:27.890
comfortable in it.

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.810
And it was, as
naive as it sounds,

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.550
it was for me kind of my
life and my world view

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.210
has shifted from before that
event and after the event.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.650
Matter of fact, I extended
my trip, and I went to Cairo,

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.550
and I went to Amman,
and I saw more of it

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.820
literally by the
hundreds if not thousands

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.000
and realized that there
was something very big here

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.910
and that it was not just
something that was remarkable

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.535
about the Middle East, that the
United States should understand

00:06:49.535 --> 00:06:51.300
and being in business
should understand.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.280
But really it was pulling
on an enormous string

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.720
about how the world is changing.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.670
DEENA SHAKIR: An
incredible story.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.030
I'm curious if there was a
particular watershed moment

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:02.120
for you in the
various experiences

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.979
that you just described
where you realized

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:06.520
you were impelled
to write this book.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.280
You realized that
there's a story here

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.100
that you can help tell.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.410
CHRISTOPHER M.
SCHROEDER: Well, yeah.

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:11.785
I mean, there were
1,000 stories,

00:07:11.785 --> 00:07:14.500
and the act of just watching
this dynamic in and of itself

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.120
was, I think, so powerful.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.797
But then you have a lot
of these ah-ha moments

00:07:18.797 --> 00:07:21.255
that you pull on themes that
you guys live, I think, day in

00:07:21.255 --> 00:07:21.760
and day out.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.760
So for example, I had this
young guy from Alexandria, Egypt

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.760
who was pitching me an
app development business,

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.930
and I sort of listening
to him and trying

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:30.990
to figure out what
he was talking about.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:32.300
It sounded very familiar to me.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.008
And I looked down on
my iPad and realized

00:07:34.008 --> 00:07:37.040
I downloaded it six months
earlier having no idea that it

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.000
was 30 young people
in Alexandria, Egypt

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.790
who had done it.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.180
No clue because
it didn't matter.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.200
All I knew was it was beautiful,
it worked, and it had become

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.800
then and is now
the largest selling

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.390
paid weather app on Earth.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:50.731
It's like seven million
downloads now, 40% of which

00:07:50.731 --> 00:07:51.730
is in the United States.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.554
They don't have any
operations here.

00:07:53.554 --> 00:07:55.470
So you have that as kind
of one of the stories

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:58.830
of our time about how things
are changing globally.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.930
Probably a third of
the entrepreneurs I met

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:03.620
just look at almost
every infrastructure

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:04.870
problem as a software problem.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:05.369
Right?

00:08:05.369 --> 00:08:06.651
This is the story of our time.

00:08:06.651 --> 00:08:08.650
They're like two fundamental
stories of our time

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:10.460
that I think come
out from this, which

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.700
are powerful in the
Middle East but there's

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:12.741
a much broader than that.

00:08:12.741 --> 00:08:15.490
One is, that we have this
ability now to really view

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.790
almost any problem like
a software problem.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:20.150
And so guys my age
or older will say,

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.180
the traffic sucks
in Cairo, so it's

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.110
going to take a generation
to fix the roads.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.487
And I can tell you I've
seen a dozen ways like apps

00:08:26.487 --> 00:08:28.070
to navigate traffic
to work around it,

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.520
and that kind of stuff.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.304
Education is really
tough in the region.

00:08:32.304 --> 00:08:33.929
The public school
education-- actually,

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:35.280
this was surprising to me.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.942
And forgive me for
seconds for talking

00:08:36.942 --> 00:08:38.900
about the region as a
region because obviously,

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.429
every country is very different.

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:42.580
Culture is very different
in every country and all,

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:43.955
but if you can
bear with me being

00:08:43.955 --> 00:08:45.490
aggregate for a second overall.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:47.420
It's actually stunning
in a per capita basis

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.570
how much is spent in
education in the Middle East

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.640
in public school to
these terrible outcomes.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:56.170
Because classroom size can
average 70 kids are more.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.280
Literacy is terrible
particularly

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.750
in rural parts of
places overall.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:04.300
The testing and the teaching
is incredibly rote learning.

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.020
So it's just memorization driven
into you, but almost none of it

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:08.470
has anything to do
with the 21st century.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.690
Right?

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:10.980
And it's not like hard-core
engineering or mathematics

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:11.900
and all.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.420
I think the best indication I
could give to you to give you

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.450
kind of the sense of
the magnitude of it

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:19.940
is that in Cairo alone
the supplemental education

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.120
business is like $2
to $3 billion a year.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:22.940
All right?

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.040
So what dos that tell you?

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.587
It tells you education
sucks, and it tells you

00:09:26.587 --> 00:09:28.670
that the rich people are
taking care of their own.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:29.410
Right?

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:31.970
So what happens when you look
at the problems as a software

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:32.360
problem?

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.193
As you can imagine
they're now like probably

00:09:34.193 --> 00:09:36.530
20% of the startups
that I've seen

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:39.740
in Egypt in the last
year in some form

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.361
are like a Khan
Academy in Arabic.

00:09:41.361 --> 00:09:41.860
Right?

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.630
And there could be videos
if you have access to video,

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:46.830
but because so many people
have only texting phones,

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:48.790
they're actually coming
up with really interesting

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:50.915
supplementary tools and
games that they're doing it

00:09:50.915 --> 00:09:55.030
in education that way
because you view the world

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:57.014
as a software problem
that can be fixed.

00:09:57.014 --> 00:09:58.930
So you've got these
incredible problem solvers

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:00.270
that just sort of blew
me away in that way.

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.600
You have this idea that
everything can be global

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.700
overnight as a way that
we know, and therefore,

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.810
innovation as well is just
good products and services can

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:09.590
come from different
corners of the world,

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:10.798
and it's a story of our time.

00:10:10.798 --> 00:10:13.670
Because the fact is, as you guys
know and Andreessen wrote it

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:16.810
in the forward of my book,
in the next eight years,

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:19.250
pick your date, there are
going to be five billion-- Eric

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:20.750
talks about it--
they're going to be

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.960
five billion smartphones
on the planet.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.750
And it never ceases to amaze
me how so many people think

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.360
at the end of the day,
still, in this day and age

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.130
that a smartphone is about
like better features,

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.089
or maybe about better
multimedia experience.

00:10:33.089 --> 00:10:34.880
And we all know it is
about better features

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.100
and it is about multimedia,
but that's not the story.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.770
The story is that
five billion people

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.720
are going to walk around-- in
Egypt, the mobile providers-- I

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.970
keep coming back to Egypt,
because the stories come

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:48.070
from there right now, but this
is true in Amman and elsewhere.

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:50.010
Every mobile provider
that I interviewed

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:52.840
for this book told me that
within now two years then

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.160
three years, they'll be
50% or 60% smartphone

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.740
penetration there.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:57.290
Right?

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:59.330
And in the Gulf, by the way,
it's already beyond that.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:00.246
So what are we saying?

00:11:00.246 --> 00:11:02.760
We're saying that half of
humanity, 2/3 of humanity

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.200
are walking around
with supercomputers

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.040
in their pockets,
and that obviously

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.640
means that problem something
changes, innovation changes,

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.354
and people have a very
different hopeful look.

00:11:12.354 --> 00:11:13.770
Because in a lot
of respects, this

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:15.670
is the true definition
of empowerment.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.360
Empowerment is a tossed-around
word in many, many ways,

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:22.179
but when you have the ability
to feel like you're not alone,

00:11:22.179 --> 00:11:24.720
to feel like you're not crazy
in what you're thinking you can

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.260
do, and then you see
someone else like you do it,

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:28.760
that means that
you can do it, then

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.890
it becomes this
flywheel of success.

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:32.440
And that's
psychologically as much

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.989
as technologically
and business wise

00:11:33.989 --> 00:11:35.780
I think what's been
happening in the Middle

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:37.530
East over the last
five years or so.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:40.802
And that to me was just totally
uplifting, and fascinating,

00:11:40.802 --> 00:11:42.760
and I think a story, not
just about the region,

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.863
but about the world.

00:11:43.863 --> 00:11:45.461
DEENA SHAKIR: One
of the things that I

00:11:45.461 --> 00:11:47.960
think is so compelling about
what you've done with this book

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.110
as someone who has spent
almost a decade now working

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:52.110
on promoting entrepreneurship
in the Middle East

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:54.500
is that you've taken it
out of this relegated realm

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:58.520
of development and
sort of aid, which

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.470
is where a lot of
entrepreneurship programs

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:01.365
were focused in.

00:12:01.365 --> 00:12:04.320
And you've elevated it to the
ranks where you have Andreessen

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.480
writing your forward and Ben
Horowitz hosting book events

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.120
and Reid Hoffman
writing a narrative.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:14.040
So if you could speak about
how you see entrepreneurship

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.800
in the Middle East,
not only being good

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.500
for the Middle East but
being good for the world,

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.330
being good for internet,
startups in general,

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.420
being good for investors
based in Silicon Valley

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.540
CHRISTOPHER M. SCHROEDER:
Well, I mean, there's

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.230
a lot of different questions
with different kinds

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:28.063
of approaches to it.

00:12:28.063 --> 00:12:30.430
I mean, if you are
one of the top venture

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:33.050
capitalists in Silicon Valley
and you've got the ability

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:35.120
to effectively see
the best of the best

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.430
deals in this incredible
network of effective talent,

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:38.550
you're going to be focused here.

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.758
And there's a reason why
Andreessen and Horowitz were

00:12:40.758 --> 00:12:43.340
very focused here and Sequoia
and others have expanded

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:46.095
to other places, but still
the lion's share of the focus

00:12:46.095 --> 00:12:47.430
is here because they can.

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:48.870
They can see the
best of the best,

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:50.162
and it is that kind of a thing.

00:12:50.162 --> 00:12:52.411
And in fact, it was actually
kind of interesting to me

00:12:52.411 --> 00:12:54.530
because one of the more
interesting things that I

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:56.010
did when I wrote this
book is I actually

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.885
spent a couple of weeks
out here interviewing

00:12:57.885 --> 00:13:00.460
a lot of my friends, both in
the venture capital industry.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.560
I interviewed some of your
folks here and everywhere else.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:07.020
And the string that I was
pulling on for them was,

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.652
so how is the next
five years going

00:13:08.652 --> 00:13:10.360
to be different than
the last five years?

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.068
I mean, something
different is happening.

00:13:12.068 --> 00:13:13.330
We know this is happening.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:14.810
So how are you
thinking about this?

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:16.880
And they said almost
to a woman and a man,

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.007
almost to a woman and a man,
three things that were similar.

00:13:20.007 --> 00:13:22.090
The first thing that they
said is, look, you know,

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:25.021
if in fact, there's a market
that's big enough for us,

00:13:25.021 --> 00:13:26.270
then we have to pay attention.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:27.830
We may lose a lot
of money in China.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:29.500
And by the way, one of
the unwritten stories

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:31.950
in Silicon Valley is that
they've all lost a lot of money

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:33.142
in China.

00:13:33.142 --> 00:13:34.100
They're not been great.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.180
This is not a well-known
story, but it's true.

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:37.700
No one is really
sort of-- I mean,

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.700
I guess if you were to have
the ability to buy [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:41.480
in $0.10 or whatever,
you'll do just fine.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.560
But I'm just saying that
generally speaking this

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.812
is a tough slog, because
emerging markets are not

00:13:45.812 --> 00:13:46.770
for the faint of heart.

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:48.250
But if the market is
that big and you say,

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:50.490
well, I'm willing to lose
money for a period of time,

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:51.948
and I'll figure
out how to beat it.

00:13:51.948 --> 00:13:52.614
Me, me, me.

00:13:52.614 --> 00:13:54.780
The second thing that people
said, very consistently

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:56.155
is, well look, if
I can outsource

00:13:56.155 --> 00:13:58.232
what I'm doing cheaply,
then I'll do that.

00:13:58.232 --> 00:13:59.190
Why wouldn't I do that?

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:00.529
Me, me, me.

00:14:00.529 --> 00:14:01.070
I'm like, OK.

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.695
That's great, but let me ask you
an interesting question, which

00:14:03.695 --> 00:14:07.262
is if we're dealing now
in a world where we have

00:14:07.262 --> 00:14:09.720
ubiquitous access to software,
where people, in fact, would

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.860
like to be part of their
home and their culture

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:15.260
and they have opportunities
now of entire rising

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.795
middle classes and large
markets of consumers,

00:14:17.795 --> 00:14:20.170
don't you think you need to
think about that differently?

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:22.664
Isn't it possible that
some great innovation

00:14:22.664 --> 00:14:24.080
will come from a
part of the world

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.640
that we don't think about
now in a typical sense?

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.074
And invariably the answer was,
if the talent is that good,

00:14:30.074 --> 00:14:31.490
and the ideas are
that innovative,

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:34.570
and they're that hungry,
they'll come to Silicon Valley.

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:38.250
And so it's a very, very
interesting kind of framework,

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:40.720
and I would suggest
narrative bias even here.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.149
It's not just like
anywhere else where

00:14:43.149 --> 00:14:44.690
I think folks are
going to be saying,

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:47.041
I mean, you've probably seen
this and I can't find it,

00:14:47.041 --> 00:14:48.540
but I was looking
for the other day.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:49.680
But there was a
study that came out

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.179
that said more Indians actually
went back to India than came

00:14:52.179 --> 00:14:55.344
to the United States for the
first time in like 50 years.

00:14:55.344 --> 00:14:56.760
And these guys
when they say to me

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.200
they will come to
Silicon Valley,

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.990
I say, they would love to visit.

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:02.170
They'd love to have
business partnerships here.

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:03.350
Some of them would
like to come here,

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:05.700
but a lot of them, if they
can, would like to stay home,

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.491
and how do you want to
engage in that world

00:15:07.491 --> 00:15:08.520
because now they can.

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.730
And I think it's
an open question.

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:13.210
I haven't seen a
whole lot of answers

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:16.410
to that yet except that
I think like most things,

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:18.034
there's a ripple effect.

00:15:18.034 --> 00:15:19.450
And so all of a
sudden when people

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:21.220
see the impact that
you guys had in Egypt

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.480
or when other people see
that the tech operating

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.840
companies have built a huge
footprint across the Middle

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.230
East-- LinkedIn just
opened up offices there;

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:29.962
Paypal just opened
up offices there--

00:15:29.962 --> 00:15:32.420
when you start to see that,
then you start to say something

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:32.919
may happen.

00:15:32.919 --> 00:15:36.287
Dave McClure, 500
startups, declared

00:15:36.287 --> 00:15:38.620
that the Geeks on the plane
he was going to do this year

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.030
was in the Middle East.

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:40.955
Nobody had any idea.

00:15:40.955 --> 00:15:43.330
They were like, what the hell--
where did that come from?

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.515
And he had a great
time, and he interviewed

00:15:45.515 --> 00:15:47.723
the entrepreneurs who went
and the investors who went

00:15:47.723 --> 00:15:49.260
and they were blown away also.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.640
So I think it's a
timing thing, but it's

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:54.260
a timing thing who has ankle
weights of narrative bias

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.770
even from the
investment community.

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:58.520
DEENA SHAKIR: I couldn't
put the book down

00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:59.800
when I was reading
it, and I think

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.370
what makes it so
compelling is really

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:03.400
the stories of
these entrepreneurs

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.390
that you interviewed.

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:06.080
Can you share with us
some of your favorites

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.170
that really speak to the
diversity of the innovations

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:09.580
and the innovators
in the region?

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:12.990
CHRISTOPHER M. SCHROEDER: So
I hate answering favorites

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:15.970
because even the
businesses that I met

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:17.970
and the entrepreneurs I
met who probably weren't

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:20.860
this fundable first time,
were fundable the second time.

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:23.080
So I mean, that to me,
it's hard to pick them out.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.450
But there are a couple-- I
mean, you touched on this

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:27.920
almost in passing, but this
is a huge counter narrative.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.870
"The Economist"
wrote this summer

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:32.670
and it's hard to prove it,
but I can tell you anecdotally

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:34.040
that I totally agree with it.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.581
But "The Economist"
wrote this summer

00:16:35.581 --> 00:16:38.350
that 25% of the startup
entrepreneurs in the Middle

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:41.600
East are women, total
counter narrative.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.010
And I could tell you that
I was a judge at a startup

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:47.530
competition that MIT puts
on with the local providers,

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:51.070
the enterprise form in
Beirut a year and a half ago.

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:55.580
5,000, 6,000 companies,
15,000, 16,000 entrepreneurs.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.360
That year, 40% of
them were women.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.900
And so this is to me one
of the awesome things,

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:04.670
and I've interviewed the women,
interviewed probably 50 women

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:07.569
for other writing that I did for
"Pandodaily" and for this book,

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:09.544
and it was unbelievably
interesting to see

00:17:09.544 --> 00:17:10.460
their reactions to me.

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:12.990
Because as you can imagine
everyone has their own story.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:14.680
Everyone has their own
experience and everything else,

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.137
but if I had the
bucket it, there

00:17:16.137 --> 00:17:18.220
are two fundamental reactions
I got from the women

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.619
entrepreneurs, and one of them
was like these women getting

00:17:20.619 --> 00:17:22.744
right into my grid, like
she just got into my face,

00:17:22.744 --> 00:17:25.183
and she said, I will not
be in your women's chapter.

00:17:25.183 --> 00:17:26.849
If you're writing a
chapter about women,

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:28.050
you Americans always
want to do this.

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:28.890
I'm not going to do this.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:31.030
I am not a woman entrepreneur,
I'm an entrepreneur.

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:32.613
If you want to talk
about my business,

00:17:32.613 --> 00:17:36.430
I'm happy to talk about my
business, but do not bucket me.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.120
The second reaction-- yeah.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.547
DEENA SHAKIR: That
sounds like May Habib.

00:17:40.547 --> 00:17:43.130
CHRISTOPHER M. SCHROEDER: I'll
name no names, but I will say--

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:43.755
DEENA SHAKIR: I went
to college with her.

00:17:43.755 --> 00:17:46.171
CHRISTOPHER M. SCHROEDER: --but
I'll say you're very good.

00:17:46.171 --> 00:17:47.890
You're very good.

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:49.970
But the second bucket
was something like this,

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:52.110
e-commerce is a huge
opportunity in the Middle East

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:53.390
just to put it in perspective.

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:55.515
It's probably a billion,
billion and a half dollars

00:17:55.515 --> 00:17:56.566
in e-commerce right now.

00:17:56.566 --> 00:17:58.440
The total movement of
goods and not including

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.132
or any of that stuff
is $450 billion.

00:18:01.132 --> 00:18:03.090
Credit cards aren't really
use much online yet.

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:04.924
I mean, this is a
huge opportunity.

00:18:04.924 --> 00:18:07.090
And believe it or not, one
of the real opportunities

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:08.460
there is Saudi
Arabia because that's

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:09.780
where a lot of per
capita wealth is.

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.140
And so everyone is
trying to get there.

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:12.681
So I remember
interviewing this woman

00:18:12.681 --> 00:18:15.304
with a great e-commerce
idea very, very good idea.

00:18:15.304 --> 00:18:16.720
And she said, let
me be real here,

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.010
like I'll give you the same
answer that May Habib gave

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:20.802
or anyone else gave
except for this thing

00:18:20.802 --> 00:18:22.260
that I need to do
business in Saudi

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.014
and I can't drive
when I'm there.

00:18:24.014 --> 00:18:26.180
And other women would talk
about let's be realistic,

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.730
when I got to see a male
venture capitalists,

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:30.180
they don't treat me-- they
want to ask for my husband.

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:32.260
So you get this
whole kind of litany,

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.040
but what was so moving to me
was that in wherever they were

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.460
in that spectrum, there was
one thing that I heard over

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:40.790
and over again from every
entrepreneur, which was, look,

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:42.900
the definition of a
great entrepreneur

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.810
is the ability to
work around stuff

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:46.930
and get around
problems and headaches.

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:48.890
We're better than
that than anybody,

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:51.190
and I thought that was
actually a very compelling kind

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:53.106
of an overview about
where that was happening.

00:18:53.106 --> 00:18:55.560
So that almost is a class
and some of the business

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.790
they were building there
I thought were fantastic.

00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:00.570
Among the problem solvers
there was this great guy--

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.840
forgive me for
picking on Egypt today

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.532
because this really is
a phenomenon everywhere.

00:19:05.532 --> 00:19:06.740
So this is my last Egypt one.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.230
You have to make sure I don't
talk about Egypt anymore.

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:14.650
But who knew that
the largest aquifer

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:18.330
of fresh water on the planet is
under the desert between Egypt

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:20.030
and Libya?

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:20.790
I didn't.

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:22.730
And the only challenge
to getting the waters

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:24.400
is the ability to
pump it affordability.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:28.080
And up until now, medium-sized,
large, and small farmers

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.130
have pumped it by using
diesel fuel, which

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:34.610
is totally subsidize and utterly
unreliable in its delivery.

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:36.000
So if you ever
fly in over Egypt,

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.420
and you're flying
over the Nile Delta,

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.211
you'll see it's
unbelievably lush and green

00:19:39.211 --> 00:19:40.490
and then becomes white.

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:43.150
And yet under that, of course,
are these amounts water,

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:44.900
so it's a matter of
getting it and so on.

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.207
But the diesel was an issue.

00:19:46.207 --> 00:19:47.290
Well, two things happened.

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:51.000
One, in all the political
transition that's going on,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.280
they killed the
subsidy for diesel.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.200
So now the there's
a price parity

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.717
for other forms of energy
to be brought to bear.

00:19:58.717 --> 00:20:00.800
So what happens, an
entrepreneur pops up and says,

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:04.220
I've got a great capability
at a very affordable price

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:07.240
to build solar powered
pumpings farm by farm by farm.

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.390
And he believes
just without a doubt

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:11.420
that he can increase
arable land in Egypt

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:14.770
by 25% over the next decade
just by making these ubiquitous

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:16.520
and easy-to-access an
easy-to-use service.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.470
Problems are very low, cost
ongoing very, very low,

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:21.980
no issues about delivery,
obviously, by definition.

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:26.420
Look, let's say he's off by
90%, that's still a huge impact,

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.460
not only in terms of what
he's developing there

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.750
and a technology that could
be scalable elsewhere,

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:32.410
but in terms of a
country like Egypt

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:35.700
now in such an interesting
period, stuff like that

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.771
just blows away.

00:20:37.771 --> 00:20:38.770
DEENA SHAKIR: Excellent.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:40.560
Well, I want to make sure
we have time for questions

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.018
from the audience,
and otherwise, I

00:20:42.018 --> 00:20:44.346
could chat with you
all day as you know.

00:20:44.346 --> 00:20:48.135
Any questions at this point
from folks in the audience?

00:20:48.135 --> 00:20:49.760
CHRISTOPHER M.
SCHROEDER: I was talking

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.390
about the challenge of rote
learning there as well,

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:54.030
and how do you crack that code?

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:55.591
And it's a very
tough code to crack,

00:20:55.591 --> 00:20:58.090
because this is a story of a
lot of emerging growth markets.

00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:59.548
And what I was
starting to say was,

00:20:59.548 --> 00:21:01.640
we had a young high
school kid from Vietnam

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.186
to stay with us for a
while and what have you.

00:21:04.186 --> 00:21:06.310
Now, our kids are in one
of the top private schools

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:08.934
in Washington, which means it's
one of the top private schools,

00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:09.660
whatever.

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:11.710
He has to repeat the
year when he goes back

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:14.130
to Vietnam because they're
convinced that he can't get

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:17.030
as good an education spending
a year in this school.

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:20.980
And he literally won the
DC, Maryland, Virginia math

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:23.310
competition in like
the first three months.

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:25.704
He's just a brilliant
kids and wonderful guy.

00:21:25.704 --> 00:21:28.120
But I got talking to him one
night and I said, so tell me,

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.710
I mean, this was like--
is this easy for you,

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:31.190
or what do you think about this?

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:31.690
He said, no.

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:33.060
Some of it's very hard.

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:35.410
Some of it like just problem
solving, I could do that.

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:36.250
That's great.

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:38.170
But no, he said it's
really exciting.

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:39.350
So I said, so what
do you find exciting?

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:40.850
I figured you might
be bored, and he

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:42.192
said you're engineering club.

00:21:42.192 --> 00:21:43.650
And I said, well,
what do you mean?

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:45.452
And he said because
you guys tinker.

00:21:45.452 --> 00:21:46.660
And I said, what do you mean?

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:47.660
He said we never tinker.

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:48.870
We never tinker.

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:51.555
He said, I can tell you
stuff about nuclear energy

00:21:51.555 --> 00:21:53.180
that college kids
can't tell you about,

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.040
and I can't apply
it to anything.

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.740
There's no application.

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:59.080
And so the ability to
have a sense of tinkering,

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.040
a sense of application
is something

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.880
which I think is an issue in a
lot of emerging growth markets.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.570
And I would argue may be a
problem in part of the places

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:07.240
here.

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:10.200
So here's another one of the
just unbelievable phenomenon

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:13.434
to watch, and I can't tell
you that this takes care of it

00:22:13.434 --> 00:22:14.100
or what happens.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.540
All I can tell you is it's
unbelievably provocative,

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:19.437
and we couldn't talk about this
if we met five years ago, which

00:22:19.437 --> 00:22:21.770
is the phenomenon that I'm
describing in the Middle East

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:23.240
is utterly bottom up.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.240
Like there's no Lee Kuan
Yew in the Middle East.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.698
I mean, the king
of Jordan has been

00:22:26.698 --> 00:22:29.200
supportive of the
ecosystems sometimes.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.930
Dubai is opening up
interesting things,

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:33.510
but Dubai is very expensive to
live for young entrepreneurs.

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:36.370
And a lot of folks are beginning
to ask interesting questions

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:38.890
now, but this is fundamentally
a bottom-up phenomenon.

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:41.410
This is merely by having
access and by having

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:43.020
some good engineering
from the region

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:46.490
and/or studying the west,
this thing is moving in scale.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:48.700
And so what is happening
now is like there's

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:50.500
an organization some
of you I'm sure went

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.200
to some of their
gatherings called

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.840
ArabNet, which holds one of
the biggest regular gatherings

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.402
of startups in the Arab world.

00:22:57.402 --> 00:22:59.360
But one of the things
they did in the last year

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.401
is they've broken it down
to now a series of very

00:23:01.401 --> 00:23:06.080
small gatherings to help the
C engineers learn from the B's

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:09.250
and the A's to sort of up
the game for everybody there.

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:12.251
And so there's the sense of
autodidact of shared learning

00:23:12.251 --> 00:23:13.750
that's coming in
the physical world,

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:15.790
not just in an online
world, which I think

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:19.860
is one surprisingly scalable
and highly impactful.

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:22.504
Wamda.com, which is
another great institution.

00:23:22.504 --> 00:23:24.420
I'm sort of on the board
of advisors for them,

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:27.515
but they have this series
called mix and mentor, which

00:23:27.515 --> 00:23:29.640
is what they do is, they
get guys like me and women

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.190
like me to join a
gathering of 1,000 people

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:35.407
in small tables talking about
whatever mentoring you want.

00:23:35.407 --> 00:23:37.240
But I can tell you this
is purely anecdotal,

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:40.300
but it gets to your point about
the autodidact aspect of this.

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:44.687
The first mix and mentor
I did was two years ago,

00:23:44.687 --> 00:23:46.520
and pretty much the
young people just wanted

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:47.370
to hear what I had to say.

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:49.104
All the questions
were directed to me,

00:23:49.104 --> 00:23:51.020
and that was kind of the
exchange, one on one,

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:52.060
one on one, one on one.

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:53.660
I went to one six
months ago, and I

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.050
could have been irrelevant.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:57.020
What was inter-- the minute
the first question was asked,

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.603
someone else at the
table answered it,

00:23:58.603 --> 00:24:00.740
and then the table
talked amongst itself.

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:03.770
And it's that sort of
sense of ownership and auto

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:07.000
self-teaching that I think is
going to be the answer to you.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.260
I mean, look, in this hugely
bottom-up world we're facing,

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:13.410
it's not like top down doesn't
matter, like Army's matter.

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:15.350
I mean, stuff matters.

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:18.280
And we've spent no time talking
about the terrible realities,

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.070
which are also present there.

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:22.190
I know entrepreneurs
from both Syria and Egypt

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:23.850
who in the last year died.

00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:27.860
So I mean, this is a very, very
serious confluence of events,

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:31.390
but at the same time
and in parallel,

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:33.640
something is being opened
up and an opportunity

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.889
is available that just
simply wasn't there before.

00:24:35.889 --> 00:24:37.555
And that's where I
think it's happening.

00:24:37.555 --> 00:24:40.021
Now, I hope top-down
educational institutions will

00:24:40.021 --> 00:24:41.770
be able to embrace it
more and maybe it'll

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:42.740
meet somewhere between.

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:43.770
But like that I don't know.

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:45.561
But I do know what
they're doing bottom up.

00:24:45.561 --> 00:24:46.160
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:49.570
Thank you for speaking with
us, and really great story,

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:52.210
and I'm glad that
you're out there trying

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:54.040
to counter sort of
the narrative fallacy

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:56.250
that many folks have
built up in their head.

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:59.135
And I'm also glad that you
recognize in your comments

00:24:59.135 --> 00:25:01.010
the story what's happening
in the Middle East

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:03.177
sounds very similar to
things that are happening

00:25:03.177 --> 00:25:04.510
in pockets throughout the world.

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:07.020
So we were recently
in Medene, and you

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:09.892
know what's happening in Medene
sounds similar in Nairobi.

00:25:09.892 --> 00:25:11.850
It sounds similar to
what's happening in Amman.

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:14.349
So I was hoping maybe you could
talk a little bit about what

00:25:14.349 --> 00:25:18.260
you think this means
specifically to the Middle East

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:22.010
and to the people there, like
what makes this really unique

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:24.804
in the Middle East and
what kinds of impact will

00:25:24.804 --> 00:25:26.220
it have on people
there that might

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:27.750
be different than
the impact but you

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:29.370
might see in Medene or Nairobi?

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:30.870
CHRISTOPHER M.
SCHROEDER: I actually

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:33.190
think that the parallels
are in some respects

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:36.150
the more important thing because
not only are they interesting

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:39.290
and sort of making it clear
that this is a global phenomenon

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:41.290
once you have access
to the capabilities,

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:44.010
but at the same time, there
is this wonderful group called

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:44.957
Endeavour Global.

00:25:44.957 --> 00:25:46.540
Linda Rottenberg is
the founder of it.

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.530
It's the largest
nonprofit that helps

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:50.931
a fast-moving
entrepreneurship, not just

00:25:50.931 --> 00:25:52.930
tech based, by the way,
everywhere in the world.

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:55.050
So I've seen this
across the thing.

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:57.950
And there's this thing that she
calls e to e, emerging market

00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:58.964
to emerging market.

00:25:58.964 --> 00:26:01.130
I think both from a business
opportunity perspective

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:03.456
but also from a psychological
perspective, that

00:26:03.456 --> 00:26:04.830
is more, it says
in my book, when

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:07.055
you get great entrepreneurs
in the same room,

00:26:07.055 --> 00:26:09.180
they're like the same people
anywhere that they go.

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:11.290
And that aha moment,
that understanding

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:12.950
that all of a sudden I can
be in a room from somebody

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:14.470
from Colombia or
whatever and they're all

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:16.428
wrestling very similar
things and going through

00:26:16.428 --> 00:26:17.730
and-- that's huge.

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:20.610
So to me, that's still a
very, very big part of it.

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:23.410
It's always interesting
to see what problems

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:25.800
get solved at scale
in very powerful ways.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.070
Like if we were sitting
here eight years ago

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:29.820
and maybe it's a
surprised to a few of you

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:33.800
today, who would have said that
the number one mobile payment

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.830
country on Earth in
aggregate dollars

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:40.440
is Kenya, that 20%
of their entire GDP

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:44.030
passes through a cash-sharing,
texting capability?

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:46.810
And that's never going to work
here in the United States.

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:48.660
It's probably not going to
work in most parts of Africa.

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.220
Its even hard for it
to work in Middle East,

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:52.960
because there's a better banking
system for all its problems

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.640
as compared to what
Kenya was overall.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.872
But there it happened,
and stop and think

00:26:56.872 --> 00:26:57.830
what I'm talking about.

00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:59.621
All of a sudden, you
can move cash one day,

00:26:59.621 --> 00:27:01.370
and you couldn't move
cash the other day?

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:02.880
Again, a flywheel
multiplier effect

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.290
of that throughout
societies are huge.

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:07.457
And so what you're
seeing in the Middle East

00:27:07.457 --> 00:27:09.540
though it fits patterns
and other emerging markets

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:13.700
is like here you guys we
can call pick whatever

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.450
your favorite company is effect.

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:18.110
But over there, they'll
call it the Maktoob Effect.

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:21.260
And you'll know the Maktoob was
the Yahoo! of the Middle East

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:24.580
that was bought by Yahoo for a
little bit under $200 million.

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:25.300
That was great.

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:26.870
It said you can do this.

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:28.370
It can happen here,
but I think what

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:29.730
was even better
than that was also

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:32.190
you created a bunch of wealthy
younger people, new generation

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:34.060
people, who are now
putting their money back

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:35.126
into the system.

00:27:35.126 --> 00:27:37.500
Out of Maktoob, I can name 10
different entrepreneurs who

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.490
have now spun off other
companies one of which,

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:43.339
souq.com S-O-U-Q-C-O-M.
This will effect the Amazon

00:27:43.339 --> 00:27:44.130
of the Middle East.

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:46.560
This is probably a multi-$100
million company now.

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.650
That flywheel thing
that's happening there

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:51.237
in terms of its
issues and opportunity

00:27:51.237 --> 00:27:52.820
I think within the
Arab world is huge,

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:55.210
because last
observation, unlike say

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:58.470
Turkey, which has an awesome
ecosystem, amazing talent

00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:58.970
there.

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:01.240
It will blow you away,
particularly in Istanbul.

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.864
At the end of the day, if you're
creating a startup in Turkish,

00:28:03.864 --> 00:28:05.250
you're in a very limited market.

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:06.750
And the factors are
many things that

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:10.350
make the different countries,
societies, cultures, towns,

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:12.050
villages differ within
the Middle East,

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:13.140
but they're very active.

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:16.540
I mean, 350 million people with
a shared language, most of whom

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.980
really only speak that
language, which represent,

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:23.420
what is it 7% or 9% of the
total speakers on Earth

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:26.740
where less than 1% of
content online is Arabic.

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:30.480
Those opportunities are
one unbelievably manifest,

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:34.672
and two have a wonderfully
multiplier effect in that way.

00:28:34.672 --> 00:28:38.130
AUDIENCE: I was just wondering
about how people perceive

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:39.890
failure in that
part of the world.

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:42.250
So I think here we look upon
it a little more favorably.

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:45.860
If you fail fast, if you have
a string of failures behind you

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:47.630
and you're looking
for support, people

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:49.550
understand that
you've had experience

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:51.550
and you've learned your
lesson, but maybe not so

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:52.625
much elsewhere.

00:28:52.625 --> 00:28:54.000
CHRISTOPHER M.
SCHROEDER: I don't

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.720
think that there's any question
for all the hypie hubris that

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.990
sometimes comes
with our innovation

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:01.540
here that our willingness
to bounce off of failure

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:03.000
is very powerful,
which, of course,

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.916
which I tell people often
in emerging markets,

00:29:04.916 --> 00:29:07.310
it's not the same thing as
saying that failure doesn't

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:08.960
suck because it's terrible.

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.050
And I think sometimes
we overplay that myth,

00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:12.680
because I think-- I don't know.

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.135
You guys probably know
people around you who failed,

00:29:14.135 --> 00:29:14.940
and you're kind of
like, all right.

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:15.605
Good for them.

00:29:15.605 --> 00:29:18.229
They failed, and other people is
like you don't feel about them

00:29:18.229 --> 00:29:21.010
quite the same way, and
so that's human nature.

00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:22.600
But the fact that
it is in our ethos,

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.160
so that's part of what you
do and you have to move on.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.284
It's huge, and it's one of
the greatest limitations

00:29:26.284 --> 00:29:28.200
I found in Argentina, in Chile.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:31.110
I mean, this is a different
kind of mentality.

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:34.580
But go back to what I said about
when you have ubiquitous access

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.289
to information, and to each
other, and to all information.

00:29:37.289 --> 00:29:39.330
You start to realize if
it's happening everywhere

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:41.538
in the world, I'm not crazy
that maybe this one's not

00:29:41.538 --> 00:29:42.490
working out.

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:45.830
And it has, again, I think this
success breeds success aspect

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:46.330
of it.

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:47.870
So this is purely anecdotal,
but it will give you

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:50.300
a sense of it, because
the fear of failure thing

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:52.229
was really brought
up to me often

00:29:52.229 --> 00:29:54.270
when I first started my
journey going over there.

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:56.030
And in fact, in some
countries, believe it or not,

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:57.810
technically, it's
criminal to fail.

00:29:57.810 --> 00:29:59.910
Like there's no bankruptcy
law, so you literally

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:02.590
could go to jail for not
doing what you've done.

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:04.150
And so there's
structural elements,

00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:06.310
which are not heavily
enforced but they're there,

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:08.520
and that's part of
the psyche as well.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.520
So I mean, these are very,
very profound things.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.670
Anyway it was at
another huge gathering

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:15.640
where the former ICT minister
of Jordan who actually

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.920
had done success in
business in Amman

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.020
and elsewhere overall
spent the time

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:22.830
answer-- I was moderating him,
and he answered a question

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:26.160
just describing his outright
failure in one of his ventures.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:28.920
And I turned to him and
I said to him, Arwon,

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:30.110
I've never seen this happen.

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:30.860
And he said, what?

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:32.410
And I said you've just
been talking openly

00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:34.040
in front of 800
people about failure.

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.130
I said, are your mind?

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:36.340
He said, look, I'm
so tired of this,

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:38.090
and he looked out to the
audience and he said, come on.

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:40.540
How many of you at some
point failed somewhere?

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:42.410
And 2/3 of the hands went up.

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:45.450
So again, bottom up, from
a different perspective.

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:47.730
Parents are very
concerned about their kids

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:51.820
stepping off of what they view
to be a tried and true path.

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.569
There's a tremendous
sensitivity to this still,

00:30:54.569 --> 00:30:56.610
but there's something also
happening in parallel.

00:31:01.846 --> 00:31:04.302
AUDIENCE: So I'm a
Silicon Valley person

00:31:04.302 --> 00:31:06.550
who relocated to South
Africa, and I do work

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:09.200
across sub-Saharan Africa, and
a lot of what you're saying here

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.390
really resonates with me.

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:14.094
One thing that I'm curious
about is at a policy level,

00:31:14.094 --> 00:31:16.260
and you kind of touched on
this a little bit earlier

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:20.680
with the bankruptcy being
illegal in some areas comment.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.850
What are governments doing at a
policy level in the Middle East

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:25.954
to either help entrepreneurs
or hinder them?

00:31:25.954 --> 00:31:28.120
CHRISTOPHER M. SCHROEDER:
The answer is, not enough.

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:29.940
And by the way, this goes to
the United States government

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:30.440
as well.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.340
Deena, I'm sorry.

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:34.731
And the risk when they
start to think about it

00:31:34.731 --> 00:31:36.480
is that they could
actually make it worse.

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:36.980
Right?

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:39.174
I mean, that's always
the kind of off

00:31:39.174 --> 00:31:41.090
that happens when they
get involved with this.

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:44.130
But where I guess I come out
overall is the amount of impact

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:46.210
that they can make
to take friction out

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:49.150
of the ecosystem there to help
the circumstances that you

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:50.160
describe as profound.

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:53.340
So let me give you
obvious example.

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:55.650
E-commerce is I think
an enormous opportunity

00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:56.390
over there.

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:58.670
As someone described to me
trying to simply move goods

00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:01.840
from one country to
another is like Bezos

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:03.910
trying to build
Amazon with 50 States,

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:06.620
with 50 State regulation
bodies, different fees,

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:07.550
different inspectors.

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:08.800
It's crazy.

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:13.440
It's literally sometimes cheaper
to ship something from Jordan

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.060
to the States to Dubai than
across-- not true in Dubai now,

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:18.101
because they're moving
these things pretty quick.

00:32:18.101 --> 00:32:21.140
But there's a huge opportunity
just to ease that code

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:22.240
or to unify that code.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.740
And one of the
things that I learned

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:26.073
is actually there's been some
pretty smart stuff passed,

00:32:26.073 --> 00:32:28.120
but nobody still
pays attention to it.

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.150
So the GCC, the Gulf
countries, which

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:32.267
now include Jordan and
Morocco actually do

00:32:32.267 --> 00:32:34.100
have some very interesting
code about making

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:35.630
it very easy to
trade among them.

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:38.250
That's a wonderful place
to start if that helps.

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:40.600
And so if that
happens, it's great.

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:43.930
The opportunity is
profound and just literally

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:46.140
taking friction out making
the ability to getting

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:49.160
permanent ease it's likes
more basic stuff I think

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:51.340
can have an enormous
effect overall.

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:53.720
I think our government has
a huge opportunity to be

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:56.710
supporting what's going on there
without it being a top-down,

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:59.480
let's-pat-the-entrepreneurs-on-the-head
 kind of thing,

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:02.300
and there is that proclivity
in my city to do that.

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:05.410
And I'll never forget, I think
I helped, you probably did it,

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:08.020
but I helped them get off
of this when they'd show up

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:10.590
at almost every gathering to
talk about the number one US

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:12.450
export is entrepreneurship.

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:14.427
And there's nothing like
talking to societies

00:33:14.427 --> 00:33:16.760
of 10,000 years who've been
entrepreneurs the whole time

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.810
and telling them you gave
them entrepreneurship

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:20.530
to sort of kill the whole thing.

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:22.830
But this is a whole
digression, but I'm

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:24.440
a fanatic on the
immigration issue,

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:27.830
and I'm even a fanatic on H-1B
visas and then just quick visas

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:28.440
overall.

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:31.040
There was a great
entrepreneur that I met,

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.900
wonderful company
and idea who got

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:35.230
recruited not by one but
two Silicon Valley firms

00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:38.456
here to invest in them, and
this was in April of last year.

00:33:38.456 --> 00:33:40.580
So you've got to be here
by the first week of June.

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:42.654
We can't do this one
over Google Hangout.

00:33:42.654 --> 00:33:44.320
You've got to be here,
and we're looking

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.010
at two other companies
in the States,

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:47.614
but we're willing
to talk about this,

00:33:47.614 --> 00:33:49.780
but you've got to go
toe-to-toe if you want to come,

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:50.650
you've got to do that.

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:51.615
And they went down
to our embassy,

00:33:51.615 --> 00:33:52.360
and our embassy said, wow.

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:53.193
That's a great idea.

00:33:53.193 --> 00:33:55.800
Come back in August and
we'll interview you.

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:59.000
And so it's these kinds of
things, which aren't that big,

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.210
aren't that sexy, but
the ramifications of them

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:02.810
are unbelievable.

00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:05.450
AUDIENCE: So I don't know
if it's a perception issue,

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:07.990
but it seems like they're not
a lot of successes coming out

00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:09.850
in the Middle East, like even
like going to the Middle East,

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:12.058
I don't see a lot of successes,
Maktoob obviously, is

00:34:12.058 --> 00:34:13.139
the biggest one.

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:15.100
What do you see are
like the obstacles?

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:16.139
Is it mentorship?

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:18.670
Is it government regulations?

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:23.370
Is it like lack of
technical skills?

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:27.420
Like what is prohibiting like
a lot these entrepreneurs

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:28.795
from moving on to
the next level?

00:34:28.795 --> 00:34:30.795
CHRISTOPHER M. SCHROEDER:
So a couple of things.

00:34:30.795 --> 00:34:33.792
I mean, one, the litany that you
just gave are all challenges.

00:34:33.792 --> 00:34:35.250
Everything you
mentioned are things

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:37.209
that are being worked
on, and history will only

00:34:37.209 --> 00:34:39.333
tell us whether they've
been working on fast enough

00:34:39.333 --> 00:34:41.850
or a bottom-up can move fast
enough to be truly globally

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:42.440
competitive.

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:44.290
And we just talked about
the government aspect of it,

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:45.670
which is clearly part of it.

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:47.380
The second observation
I would make

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:49.630
and I don't totally agree
with what I'm about to say,

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:51.409
but I've been working
my brain around it

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:53.239
in any event which is,
I think sometimes we

00:34:53.239 --> 00:34:56.320
put too much emphasis
around exit as the indicator

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:59.299
of success with an ecosystem,
and I think they do

00:34:59.299 --> 00:35:01.090
matter because they
matter psychologically.

00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:06.820
I mean Turkey had four or five
$200+ million technology exits

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:09.294
of different types within
the last two to three years,

00:35:09.294 --> 00:35:11.710
and there's no question that
helps that though, of course,

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:14.300
that has a spread even outside.

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.606
Turkey and the Arab world
is obviously different,

00:35:16.606 --> 00:35:19.230
but there's still some sense of
connection that it can be done.

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:22.730
And even in the Caucasus and
in parts of the former Soviet

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:25.414
Union, it has a huge
multiplier effect.

00:35:25.414 --> 00:35:26.830
But there's a lot
of stuff that we

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:28.954
don't hear about too, which
is kind of unfortunate.

00:35:28.954 --> 00:35:31.852
So again, Souq.com, I don't
know souq.com's numbers,

00:35:31.852 --> 00:35:33.310
so I'm not revealing
anything here,

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:34.935
but they just raise
a boatload of money

00:35:34.935 --> 00:35:37.926
from a blue chip Western
venture investor,

00:35:37.926 --> 00:35:39.300
and I'm just
telling you my guess

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:40.680
is from what I've
seen of it and I

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:42.888
do know a sense of the volume
of the goods they move.

00:35:42.888 --> 00:35:45.470
This most have been a multi-$100
million quote unquote exit

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:46.880
though it's not an exit,
but this company is going

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:47.730
gangbusters.

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:49.900
Now all of a sudden
lots of people over here

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:52.690
want in souq.com if they can
figure out a way to get there.

00:35:52.690 --> 00:35:54.140
Nobody knows this one.

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:56.040
This one just blew
me away, and when

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.710
I gave it to TechCrunch
and others to write about,

00:35:57.710 --> 00:36:00.085
nobody would take it finally
Kara Swisher let me write it

00:36:00.085 --> 00:36:03.990
up, which is like six
weeks after Mubarak fell,

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:07.040
Intel bought a mobile
engineering company in Cairo

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:09.490
of like 250 engineers
called SySDSoft,

00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:11.684
but no one heard about it.

00:36:11.684 --> 00:36:12.850
I mean, for god's sake, man.

00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:14.400
I mean, this is six
weeks after Mubarak fell

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:15.900
and Intel is doubling
down in Cairo.

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.200
What does that tell you?

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:19.010
And they're actually
lots of those,

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:21.200
but we don't hear about
them I think quite as much.

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:23.210
But to tell you
just to acknowledge

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:25.155
the other side of
it, Maktoob is still

00:36:25.155 --> 00:36:26.780
the one that's still
talked about most,

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:28.425
and that's now three,
four years ago.

00:36:28.425 --> 00:36:29.800
Now, let us also
say that they've

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.740
been busy the last two years.

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:34.742
And I think that if we see
some of this evening out,

00:36:34.742 --> 00:36:36.450
I know a few companies
that could go out.

00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:39.510
The public markets are
not that great yet.

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:41.530
Having said that,
if I were to ask you

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:44.610
what was one of the largest
tech broadly-defined IPOs

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:48.026
in the world this year,
what would you tell me?

00:36:48.026 --> 00:36:49.394
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:49.394 --> 00:36:51.681
CHRISTOPHER M. SCHROEDER:
That will be, that is.

00:36:51.681 --> 00:36:52.180
No.

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:55.400
But this is a company
called Asiacell,

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:58.130
which is the mobile
provider for Iraq.

00:36:58.130 --> 00:37:00.740
and it went public at over,
and now it's over $6 billion

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:01.416
in market count.

00:37:01.416 --> 00:37:04.110
Who the hell in the midst
of all the news that we hear

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:07.490
about Iraq would know that
their largest cell provider,

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:11.296
mobile provider went
public back in March?

00:37:11.296 --> 00:37:13.040
AUDIENCE: Follow up
to Basel's question

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:15.500
about the ecosystem
in terms of, there's

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:19.064
a lot of challenges, of course,
corruption and enablement

00:37:19.064 --> 00:37:20.980
that the government does
to help entrepreneurs

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:22.290
succeed and whatnot.

00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:24.970
But also from what I've seen
in Ramallah for example,

00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:27.830
there's a lot of movements, and
even SADARA Venture Capital now

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:29.440
got money from google.org.

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:32.330
They were hoping to get
a number of companies,

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:34.920
I think three companies a
year and over three years

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.460
they got like two.

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:40.950
And it's been a great
challenge to-- not only

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:44.240
the technical talent is
there, but the attitudes

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.330
of the teams and
the entrepreneurs

00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:47.480
is the biggest challenge.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:50.260
There is a lack of trust.

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:53.660
There is a lot of different
sections in groups,

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:56.090
and people kind of
associate themselves

00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:58.640
with one party over the other.

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:01.620
And that's common whether
at the religious level

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:03.135
or at the village level.

00:38:03.135 --> 00:38:05.510
Like if you look in Palestine,
for example, every village

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:07.449
has its own
association, and you're

00:38:07.449 --> 00:38:08.990
part of this group,
now part of that,

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:12.970
and it's been really challenging
to just get them together

00:38:12.970 --> 00:38:14.710
around a business.

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:17.240
The perception from
Middle Eastern perspective

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:20.530
is, we always have to be
like buddies and brothers

00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:22.300
to be able to do business.

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:25.500
From your perspective, like
how can this be overcome,

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:30.385
and what can be done to improve
and scale that over time?

00:38:30.385 --> 00:38:32.750
CHRISTOPHER M. SCHROEDER:
Well, a couple of reactions,

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:34.833
one, I think it's just
everything you've described

00:38:34.833 --> 00:38:36.260
is totally true and real.

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:37.760
I will tell you,
by the way, you saw

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:39.770
that one of the two companies
is a travel company.

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:40.390
I forget its name.

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.940
Do you remember the name?

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:41.600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:42.540
CHRISTOPHER M. SCHROEDER:
Just got more money.

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:42.760
Yeah.

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:43.770
I'm sorry, that's right.

00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:44.840
They just got more money.

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:45.370
That's good.

00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:48.730
I mean it's not six deals, but
it's two deals, and one of them

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:51.090
at least seems to be doing
pretty well, and also

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:52.911
a very chaotic time with that.

00:38:52.911 --> 00:38:55.160
This idea about being loving
each other and everything

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:57.060
else, I mean, come on, man.

00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:58.115
Look in your backyard.

00:38:58.115 --> 00:39:00.300
I mean, for god's sake,
there's a lot of coopetition

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:02.090
and a lot of
cooperation, and there's

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:03.840
a lot of shared
learning for sure,

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:06.172
but I've got scars
from Microsoft.

00:39:06.172 --> 00:39:07.880
Someone else in this
room must have them.

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:11.880
I mean, this is also part
of dynamics of being in it,

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:14.545
not to in any way say that
the distinctions culturally

00:39:14.545 --> 00:39:16.250
and societally that
you describe are not

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:17.890
a compounding aspect of it.

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:19.250
And I think it's a big question.

00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:20.874
I think we'll have
to see what happens.

00:39:20.874 --> 00:39:23.772
And I could tell you
that if he were here,

00:39:23.772 --> 00:39:24.980
I don't want to talk for him.

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:28.172
He's a remarkable man named
Usama Fayyad, that some of you

00:39:28.172 --> 00:39:30.130
know who was up until
recently has been running

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:32.760
Oasis 500, which is one of
the larger and more successful

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:34.165
incubators out of Jordan.

00:39:34.165 --> 00:39:36.540
And he would tell you that
that's probably his number one

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.165
concern, what you
described, because he

00:39:38.165 --> 00:39:39.974
said getting the
young people in here

00:39:39.974 --> 00:39:42.140
not just working together,
but working hard, working

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:44.050
for long periods
of time, and then

00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:45.840
once they've been
incubated to not have

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:47.805
recidivism to other behaviors.

00:39:47.805 --> 00:39:49.930
He said it's just something
that the only way to do

00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:51.940
is to keep at it, and
at the end of the day,

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:53.606
the more and more
companies have started

00:39:53.606 --> 00:39:55.965
to compete with other companies
that are doing the same.

00:39:55.965 --> 00:39:57.589
Either they're going
to or they're not,

00:39:57.589 --> 00:40:00.049
and we'll just have to
see how that plays out.

00:40:00.049 --> 00:40:01.215
But there's no light switch.

00:40:01.215 --> 00:40:03.940
There's no class
that could be taught

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:05.487
in Khan Academy
that fixes that one.

00:40:05.487 --> 00:40:06.945
I think it's just
a matter of-- you

00:40:06.945 --> 00:40:11.400
know, it I'm no economist,
nor am I a psychiatrist

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:14.160
or psychologist, but I can
tell you having run businesses

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:15.890
and just seeing the
kind of dynamics,

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:19.472
this whole idea of wanting to up
your game because other people

00:40:19.472 --> 00:40:22.055
around you are upping your game
or the number of entrepreneurs

00:40:22.055 --> 00:40:23.646
who told me after
the Arab uprisings

00:40:23.646 --> 00:40:25.520
that this is something
that's bigger than me.

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:26.700
I want to make a
successful company.

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:28.370
I want to make
money, but this is

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:29.680
my life, not my parent's life.

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:30.745
I now have an opportunity
to do something

00:40:30.745 --> 00:40:32.200
they've never done
before, and if I

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.950
do that, I can say
something good about Jordan.

00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:35.283
I can say some about the region.

00:40:35.283 --> 00:40:38.820
I mean, that's all
new dynamic also

00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:40.430
and how much that
counterbalances

00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:43.230
some of the other things that
you've described so well,

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:44.190
I can't tell you.

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:47.635
All I can tell you
is it's different.

00:40:47.635 --> 00:40:49.880
DEENA SHAKIR: So I have a
question for you, one more.

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.880
One of the things that
we've talked about a lot,

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:54.505
and you know that I've worked on
quite a bit before coming here

00:40:54.505 --> 00:40:56.234
is, diaspora entrepreneurship.

00:40:56.234 --> 00:40:58.400
So I'm from Iraq, and there
are a lot of other folks

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:01.240
in this room from places
that they can't go back to.

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:03.732
What role can the
diaspora play in helping

00:41:03.732 --> 00:41:05.690
to be a part of this
movement, and what stories

00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:07.750
do you have to share
about some who have?

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:08.690
CHRISTOPHER M.
SCHROEDER: So you guys

00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:09.898
know this better than anyone.

00:41:09.898 --> 00:41:13.200
Nobody was better at harnessing
the diaspora population

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:17.150
to unbelievable success to the
home country, to the diaspora,

00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:20.330
and to the country, the United
States or at large than TiE

00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:23.100
and the efforts by India,
which is mind blowing what's

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:26.150
been done over the last
25 or 30 years of that.

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:28.860
And thank goodness
that we have TechWadi,

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:31.140
which has been around
for actually a long time

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:34.940
to try to harness the broader
community here as well

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:37.930
as the diaspora
population more broadly,

00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:39.652
and I think with
the Arab uprisings,

00:41:39.652 --> 00:41:41.110
everything sort
of-- we want to see

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:42.359
what things were looking like.

00:41:42.359 --> 00:41:44.640
And now these guys are
hugely back in business

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:45.944
in terms of doing this.

00:41:45.944 --> 00:41:48.110
And I think that there's
an enormous opportunity now

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:48.810
to do it differently.

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:50.830
I mean TiE was about a
lot of physical events

00:41:50.830 --> 00:41:54.040
and physical connections because
that was done 20 years ago.

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:58.070
But the ability to connect
now with diaspora for money,

00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:02.139
for expertise, for market
opening could never be greater.

00:42:02.139 --> 00:42:03.930
And we now have the
tools, the capabilities

00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:06.700
to do it profoundly different
ways I think is well.

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:08.829
So it's not the well tapped yet.

00:42:08.829 --> 00:42:10.620
I think TechWadi is
the best that there is,

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:13.070
and it's in it's earlier
re days of what's

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:15.092
going to be a very big
days for going forward.

00:42:15.092 --> 00:42:17.300
And I think it's one of the
most exciting initiatives

00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:19.400
that they're doing,
not just in terms

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.220
of connecting the
region, which is finding

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:24.100
great entrepreneurs
who are at large,

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:26.502
but this is an enormous,
enormous opportunity

00:42:26.502 --> 00:42:28.710
that I think we'll see much,
much more going forward.

00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:30.543
DEENA SHAKIR: And just
to follow up on that,

00:42:30.543 --> 00:42:32.440
I think one of the untold
stories about Dubai

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:35.580
is the role that it's playing in
this diaspora entrepreneurship

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:37.070
revolution, and
even May Habib who

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:39.319
we talked about who's a
friend of mine and many others

00:42:39.319 --> 00:42:41.670
that you highlighted in
your book, are actually,

00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:42.920
they're certainly not Emirati.

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.980
They may be Arab
Canadian like May

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:46.910
or Arab America like Pam Anneke.

00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:49.409
Can you talk a bit about what
you've experienced in the time

00:42:49.409 --> 00:42:51.582
they spent in Dubai and
what kind of ecosystem

00:42:51.582 --> 00:42:53.165
they're building for
entrepreneurship.

00:42:53.165 --> 00:42:54.770
CHRISTOPHER M. SCHROEDER:
So Dubai is, I mean,

00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:55.480
you guys have been there.

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.021
You know it's an
extraordinary place.

00:42:57.021 --> 00:43:00.050
Whenever anybody has doubt about
can this happen in the Middle

00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:00.550
East?

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:04.160
I tell them just come and
stand in a street in Dubai.

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:05.950
This conference I
described to you before,

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:08.450
Celebration of Entrepreneurship,
was a complete desert

00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:10.310
13 years before I stood there.

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:13.550
I mean, the whole thing
was just it's a mind blow

00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:16.172
that we have this city with
over two million people,

00:43:16.172 --> 00:43:18.630
the vast majority of which are
from everywhere in the world

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:19.504
and it has sprung up.

00:43:19.504 --> 00:43:23.100
It has become this huge working,
functioning place there.

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:26.150
Again, from a pure startup,
ecosystem prospective,

00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:27.920
the good news is the
technology works,

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:30.094
the good news is that
people are supportive of it,

00:43:30.094 --> 00:43:32.260
the good news is that you've
got this incredible hub

00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:34.245
of transportation,
so it's not surprise

00:43:34.245 --> 00:43:36.640
that e-commerce companies
want to be there.

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:38.199
There's a great
media and advertising

00:43:38.199 --> 00:43:39.740
side that's beginning
to build there.

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:40.990
That's all the good news.

00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:43.680
I think the tougher news is
it's just a very special place

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:46.460
to live, and that's
tough on entrepreneurs.

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:48.230
There's not even
like a little area

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:50.697
where you can go that
is like parts of Beirut

00:43:50.697 --> 00:43:52.780
and others where you can
really live affordability

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:54.821
and sort of hunker down
and do what you're doing.

00:43:54.821 --> 00:43:57.050
But I think the ramifications
of it is enormous.

00:43:57.050 --> 00:44:00.090
They're about to build
a second version of it.

00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:04.570
Abu Dhabi is doing some really
interesting things overall.

00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:05.570
It's really interesting.

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:08.115
DEENA SHAKIR: And is
still trying to catch up.

00:44:08.115 --> 00:44:09.990
I think we have one more
question over there.

00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:11.289
I'll just repeat it.

00:44:11.289 --> 00:44:12.830
CHRISTOPHER M.
SCHROEDER: You know, I

00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:13.840
think the answer is yes.

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:14.502
Right?

00:44:14.502 --> 00:44:15.460
I mean, it can be both.

00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:16.600
It doesn't have to be
mutually exclusive.

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:18.590
So Saudi, there's this
very interesting thing.

00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:21.801
A friend of mine sent-- and
stop and think about it.

00:44:21.801 --> 00:44:24.050
Let me give you a down side
and an up side, all right?

00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:26.645
So he just sent me a
photograph of the new invoices.

00:44:26.645 --> 00:44:29.230
I don't know if you saw
this but Saudi passed laws

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:33.160
just like last couple weeks
the said all invoices in Saudi

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:35.760
must be in Arabic, all of them.

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:36.720
Well, OK.

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:39.740
I mean, the French
tried this 10 years ago,

00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:42.750
and it's a statement of
pride, and that's great.

00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:44.490
On the other hand,
the fact of the matter

00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:45.980
is that business now is global.

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:47.150
It's not just one thing.

00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:49.030
And anything that puts
friction in business

00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:51.290
in this amazingly,
globally-competitive world

00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:53.460
needs to be thought of twice.

00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:55.960
But the idea-- and I used to
say this about the French also,

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:57.150
who were trying to put
everything in French

00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:58.900
and you had language
requirements and any content

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:00.660
of any video programming
that was created

00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:03.160
and everything else had to be,
and everything else-- I said,

00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:03.300
look.

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.820
At the end of the day, they're
not mutually exclusive.

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:08.190
If my theory is
correct or better put,

00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:09.620
if what I'm
observing is correct,

00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:12.917
that there is now
just an enormous shift

00:45:12.917 --> 00:45:15.250
to the sort of sense that
bottom up can succeed and take

00:45:15.250 --> 00:45:17.780
care of their own destinies
and build large market that's

00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:20.550
in and of themselves, by
definition, local language,

00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:23.050
culture is going to have
on the positive aspects,

00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:25.340
by the way of culture, not
just the challenging ones--

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:28.270
are going to have enormous
benefit and reinforcement

00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:29.070
within that.

00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:31.704
But with that also
comes this sense, again,

00:45:31.704 --> 00:45:33.120
as I described
before, did you see

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:34.740
the way the rest
of the world works.

00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:37.220
You read what the rest
of the world has written

00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:39.840
and so you need to be
able to engage as well.

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:41.950
And so I guess my
answer is that both

00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:45.070
are wonderful except
when they cause friction.

00:45:45.070 --> 00:45:46.570
And that should be
the thing that's

00:45:46.570 --> 00:45:48.000
thought about as people
think about what they want

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.460
to do and innovate in that part.

00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:52.050
But describing is I did before,
which is an absolute truism,

00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:54.640
to have that many people
who speak only one

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:58.290
language at that scale which
so little is available for them

00:45:58.290 --> 00:46:01.690
in that language, the only
thing that cries out to me

00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:03.051
is opportunity.

00:46:03.051 --> 00:46:04.050
That's just opportunity.

00:46:04.050 --> 00:46:06.375
And by the way, if you
narrow that gap effectively,

00:46:06.375 --> 00:46:07.916
I think the thing
that you're raising

00:46:07.916 --> 00:46:09.029
is going to happen anyway.

00:46:09.029 --> 00:46:10.820
And it doesn't preclude
all the other stuff

00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:13.257
that's happened that's
instantly global as well.

00:46:13.257 --> 00:46:15.500
DEENA SHAKIR: I think
we have time for one

00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:18.500
more quick question, and
then we'll wrap it up.

00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:19.170
Anybody has one?

00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:19.980
CHRISTOPHER M. SCHROEDER:
We went over time.

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:22.572
DEENA SHAKIR: We did,
but Eric's in our time.

00:46:22.572 --> 00:46:23.436
Yes.

00:46:23.436 --> 00:46:25.303
CHRISTOPHER M. SCHROEDER:
So this is I mean,

00:46:25.303 --> 00:46:26.370
it's wonderful that you
finally got to this question.

00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:27.450
As you can imagine
when I'm in New York,

00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:28.699
it's the first question I get.

00:46:28.699 --> 00:46:31.130
DEENA SHAKIR: I'll repeat
the question really quickly.

00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:33.130
So your question is
about the interaction

00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:35.200
between Israeli startups
and Arab startups?

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:37.449
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:37.449 --> 00:46:38.240
DEENA SHAKIR: Yeah.

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:39.650
CHRISTOPHER M. SCHROEDER:
You can speak to this

00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:42.480
more eloquently than I can,
but it was very striking to me

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:45.160
because, again, in a bottom-up
world, the opportunity

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:47.480
for this kind of
engagement is profound.

00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:49.800
And trust me, there's no
where I go in the region

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:52.810
where they're not aware that
arguably the second truly

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:56.030
awesome ecosystem
outside of Silicon Valley

00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:59.331
is arguably Israel versus almost
anywhere else in the States.

00:46:59.331 --> 00:47:01.080
It's an extraordinary
thing where you just

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:01.900
have to give it what it is.

00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:03.620
An engineering
caliber is what it is.

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:06.340
Some very good companies
that are built is what it is.

00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:11.080
I know many, many stories
of startup nation being

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:13.120
converted into
slide presentations

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:15.840
and presented to the
senior most people in many

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:18.720
of these governments to sort of
think about that kind of stuff.

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:22.400
So there's sort of this oddity
that you have this thing there

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:25.130
that could be a resource
and an engagement,

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:29.335
and to your question, very
quietly, very bottom up,

00:47:29.335 --> 00:47:31.220
a new generation
of people are sort

00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:34.290
of doing what they're doing
in kind of interesting ways.

00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:37.400
But one of the things--
I'm only reporting here,

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:43.500
so if I'm off base sharing
a better observation, first

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:45.907
of all, the minute anyone
tries to add politics into this

00:47:45.907 --> 00:47:47.990
to make it into policy
it's like dead in the water

00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:49.320
right then and there.

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:51.710
And secondly, the very
act of the engagement

00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:53.085
starts to raise
political things.

00:47:53.085 --> 00:47:54.670
So I'll never forget
this young man

00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:57.040
who said to me
someone said to him,

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.755
he said there is no
wall in the internet.

00:47:58.755 --> 00:48:00.630
You don't have to worry
about how terrible it

00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:02.130
is across borders
and all the things

00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:05.290
that you've probably experienced
if not seen and read about.

00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:06.790
But there is no
wall on the internet

00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:08.230
to which the other person
responded, well who

00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:08.854
the hell cares.

00:48:08.854 --> 00:48:11.040
There's a wall.

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:12.690
It can't be totally
disaggregated,

00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:15.940
the circumstances there
and the opportunity that

00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:17.480
presents itself.

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:19.410
But the thing that happens
in bottom-up worlds

00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:22.270
and entrepreneurs is that
interesting stuff still

00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:22.770
happens.

00:48:22.770 --> 00:48:24.728
So young people have
often come to me and said,

00:48:24.728 --> 00:48:25.997
so you mean I shouldn't try.

00:48:25.997 --> 00:48:26.830
I'm like, look, man.

00:48:26.830 --> 00:48:27.440
I'm an entrepreneur.

00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:28.250
Try everything.

00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:30.000
I mean try everything.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.650
But there are realities
embedded in that

00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:36.742
which are quite remarkable.

00:48:36.742 --> 00:48:39.116
DEENA SHAKIR: Well, that's a
great note to end on, Chris.

00:48:39.116 --> 00:48:39.250
