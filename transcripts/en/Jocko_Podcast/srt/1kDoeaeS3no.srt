1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,930
I am not Shakespeare,

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:08,160
so I cannot come up with a
Facebook message that will
express how powerful of an

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,480
impact you and echo have had on my life.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,720
My father died when I was 10 and I spent
the next 12 years wasting my physical

5
00:00:15,761 --> 00:00:16,990
and mental gifts.

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,000
You've taught me many of the lessons that
I like to believe my father would have

7
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:24,070
taught me if he were alive.

8
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:30,550
Here's a brief list of my achievements
over the past two years that you deserve

9
00:00:30,551 --> 00:00:35,230
at least partial credit too.
Here we go. Lost 90 pounds.

10
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:39,310
Net weight,
300 from 300 pounds down to two 10.

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,890
Yeah, that's a big difference. Yeah.
People weigh 90 pounds. By the way.

12
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,970
You also hold person. Yeah. Dead lift.

13
00:00:48,971 --> 00:00:52,360
Max went from two 25 to four 55.

14
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,800
Legit bench.
Went from one 85 to three 15

15
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,040
extra legit, uh, started
training. Jujitsu. Boom.

16
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,520
Boom. Yeah. And boxing with friends.

17
00:01:06,521 --> 00:01:09,700
Even though there's nowhere to
train where I currently live,

18
00:01:09,701 --> 00:01:11,890
except for the yoga room at La Fitness.

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,050
You can make it happen in
the yoga room at La Fitness.

20
00:01:14,051 --> 00:01:17,090
Let's get it all in the yoga room
and elevators that talking about

21
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,990
Glenn. I'm like online heart. I think they
did it. I think you'll like they fought.

22
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,510
Anyway. That's a whole
nother thing. Anyway,

23
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:28,040
we spent two years working at an awful
job where I lead from the middle and

24
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:33,041
improve the output of the entire facility
while adding to my own skillset to the

25
00:01:33,501 --> 00:01:36,650
point where I was able to
get a job, get a job. I love.

26
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,763
That's awesome.

27
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,860
That's awesome to be bragging about the
fact that you had an awful job that you

28
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,550
just got after it and, and look what
happened. Guess what the results are.

29
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,300
You get the job that you wanted.

30
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:53,800
Shelby love. Yup. Started at
the new job last Wednesday,

31
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:55,210
so that just happened.
Boom.

32
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,050
Legit NC started taking
class for the next job.

33
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:03,790
I want on a Coursera must be
some kind of an internet thing.

34
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,750
Um, I'm halfway through the data science
certification program. Yeah. Settings.

35
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:14,310
I'm currently 26 and I fully intend to
get after it until the day I die of past

36
00:02:15,161 --> 00:02:18,730
your lessons onto my younger brother
who has lost 50 pounds and swings the

37
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:21,630
Kettlebell. I got him everyday. Dang.

38
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,140
When I lacked the motivation
to do what needs to be done,

39
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:31,270
your words ring the loud in
my ears. Discipline equals
freedom. Thank you so much.

40
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:35,620
Okay, so the, my quit. The
question is, um, you may not,

41
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,650
the reason I included this
preamble of kind of what he's been,

42
00:02:38,651 --> 00:02:42,580
you're going to hear, but as I thought
about how to answer this question, I,

43
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,590
it's good to know what the background
is and what successes he's had.

44
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,430
That's where we kind of threw that in
there cause it's, and, and it's awesome.

45
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,830
It's awesome to hear about a trooper
just getting after it. Dang numbers too.

46
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,090
That's the thing. Yeah. That's the
good thing about like, you know,

47
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,450
somebody you can say, Hey, I'm
getting after it nowadays. Good, good.

48
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,320
But if I'm dead lifting four 55,
this guy's like kind of finding after it,

49
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,360
here's how, here's how my my
results. Awesome. Um, Kay Jocko,

50
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,530
you may not have this issue.

51
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:13,950
How do you avoid feeling discouraged when
you realize how much of your life you

52
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:18,700
wasted when you're not getting after it?
Do you ever worry

53
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,780
that you won't achieve your full
potential because you wasted time?

54
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,110
Well, first of all, like I
said, first and foremost,

55
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,400
congratulations second.
That's just legit.

56
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,190
And to have made that much progress,

57
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:39,100
you're obviously on the path and getting
after it and what you've accomplished

58
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:41,980
is awesome.
Some people never make that transition,

59
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,990
so stay on and keep crushing it.
Now,

60
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,390
as far as discouragement goes from
not having gotten on the path earlier,

61
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:54,180
m w do I feel that way? Would I
feel that way? Negative. Don't know.

62
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,080
Okay. You were a little late getting
in the game, but I'll tell you what,

63
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:03,130
26 years old, is that what we're
talking about? 26 yeah. At 26 years old.

64
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,930
You're young and you're young and
a, but I'll tell you what, even if,

65
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:13,470
even if you are 40 or 50
or 60 or 70 doesn't matter.

66
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,220
You're in the game now and that's,
that's what counts.

67
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:22,810
And all those quote unquote wasted
years, they, they weren't wasted, right?

68
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,210
They're not wasted because you learned.

69
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,300
And specifically what did he learn about?

70
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,180
Learned about what it's
like to be out of shape,

71
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,210
learned about what it's
like to be overweight,

72
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,700
learn about what it's like to be weak.

73
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,820
And the knowledge that you learned about
those things is fuel to make sure that

74
00:04:45,191 --> 00:04:48,670
it never happens again.
Cause you know,

75
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,290
you know what is out there and
do you know how bad it can get.

76
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,910
And in this is the other reason
why it's beneficial that you,

77
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,640
you have a pass that wasn't perfect is
now you can teach other people how to do

78
00:05:08,081 --> 00:05:10,240
it very clearly.
You know,

79
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,180
you can inspire other people to
do a look at what you did. Do you,

80
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,630
what'd you do to your brother? You know?
Right. It's another good example that,

81
00:05:16,631 --> 00:05:20,470
so back in the day before
anybody knew what Jujitsu was,

82
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,920
dairy,
uh,

83
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:28,170
I am the worst person to introduce Jujitsu
to people because when they see me,

84
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:32,190
cause I'm 225 pounds and um,
you know,

85
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,650
a big guy and they think, of course this
guy can choke me. Of course, you know,

86
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:38,980
they, they don't expect anything else.
So when I choked them, they're like,

87
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:40,720
well yeah,
you are really strong.

88
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,730
So the best people to introduce Jujitsu
to people is like Jeff Glover. Yeah.

89
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,930
Right? Who's 150 pounds, the skinny guy.

90
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:55,090
And he comes out and shows
you a big strong guy 27
times in a row. They say, oh,

91
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,010
maybe this stuff works well. It's the
same thing here. People look at me, they

92
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,900
gold jock jock who just hardcore,
no, not just me looking at you.

93
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,400
You're the one that did it.

94
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,370
You went through a much bigger transition
than I've ever gone through in my life.

95
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,473
Yeah.

96
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:13,540
So I say you embrace what you
learned from the weekdays.

97
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:17,810
Let them,

98
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:23,590
let them make you even stronger
and you use your own personal

99
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,890
transformation that you've made in life.

100
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:33,250
Use that to help other people
transform and get on the path as well.

101
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,900
That's where I'm at.
So good.

102
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,530
And there's a lot to be said too for
that. Like, like how he was talking,

103
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,600
this is what I think you mean is

104
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,700
how his brother lost 50 pounds.
Right? So, and that's like a lot,

105
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:53,750
like a lot of times I feel like when
people will do good stuff for themselves

106
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:55,160
and make these big changes,

107
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,170
other people who see there's kind of,
there's two P, I'm sure there's one, two,

108
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:02,180
but there's two kinds of people were,
some will be like,

109
00:07:02,181 --> 00:07:04,910
and they'll just hate and there'll be
just jealous and they'll, you know,

110
00:07:04,911 --> 00:07:08,660
whatever. But the legit people
like in your life are around,

111
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,640
you are going to be like,
Hey, what'd you do? You know?

112
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,340
Even if like even if it's not losing,

113
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,680
even if it's like you're making like
millions of dollars now, they're like, oh,

114
00:07:15,681 --> 00:07:18,470
like what are you doing? You know,
you just sorta changed real quick.

115
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:20,390
Like you're now, you're making millions
out. What'd you do? I want to do,

116
00:07:20,391 --> 00:07:23,360
I want to get on that stuff. Whatever
you're doing. And the workout thing,

117
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:26,960
that's a big one. So if like,
like a lot of times I girls,

118
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,470
they'll lose all this weight and now
they're like super chat there, you know,

119
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:33,380
as attractive as they always want it to
be kind of thing. All the other girls,

120
00:07:33,381 --> 00:07:35,300
what did you do? Oh my gosh.
What'd you do? What'd you do?

121
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,370
And they want to do it too.
It's like,

122
00:07:37,371 --> 00:07:42,371
it's almost like almost like you
can prove to other walk can be done.

123
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:47,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. It's
good shit. Stay on that path, man.

124
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:48,410
That's awesome.
