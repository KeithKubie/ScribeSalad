&gt;&gt; Hi, YouTube. Umm, so I don't really have
a genius idea but I

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.850
think I have two suggestions that -- of what
we need in this world.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.590
One is a new humanistic vision that is not
built around a nationality

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:24.170
an ethnicity, but rather around humanity.
Umm, something that doesn't exclude anyone

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.060
or any group but really is
built around our universal characteristics

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.390
that's share -- that --
that we hold in common.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.950
The second is that I think we need to change
our view, uh, that we are

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.490
really, uh, have to think about how we build
a better world for the

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.920
next generation, one that's better than the
one that was given to us

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.280
and it seems that in the short one world we
often think what we can

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.240
get out of this world rather than making sure
that we are passing on

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.239
something better than what we are inherited.
That's it.
