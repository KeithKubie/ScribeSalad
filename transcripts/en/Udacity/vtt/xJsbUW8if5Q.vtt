00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.785
And what sort of things do you think
in your personality, or maybe in your

00:00:03.785 --> 00:00:07.270
co-founder's personalities, made you
guys so successful at the beginning?

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.100
&gt;&gt; When I look back at that,
I really think it was, I mean it was,

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.930
first of all it was a lot of hard work.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.080
It was a lot of luck, frankly.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.750
I think we worked a lot
on our communication.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.400
But more than anything else, it was
hustle, and it was the willingness and

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.530
the ability to get back
up each time we stumble.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.350
Every entrepreneur goes through
some great highs, hopefully,

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.860
and some real low lows and when
you're working, whether it's alone or

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.900
with somebody else,
the ones who are successful are the ones

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.520
who are able to stand up after
falling over and dust themselves off.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.050
And learn what they needed to from it.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.565
I think what I just talked
about was an example of that.

00:00:44.565 --> 00:00:46.610
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Where you could see actually when you

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.110
looked back at our progress, how we
were learning that lesson the hard way.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.630
Probably took us way to long,
but we learned it.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:53.220
&gt;&gt; And you got there.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.290
&gt;&gt; And we got there.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.770
&gt;&gt; So what sorts of skills do you
think are really important for

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.827
entrepreneur to have at the outset?

00:00:58.827 --> 00:01:00.580
&gt;&gt; I'm going to just pick two things.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.930
The first one is resilience,

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.340
just being able to bounce back after
something doesn't go your way.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.500
You have to get really comfortable
hearing the word no and as a small

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.200
company that nobody knows about
you're going to hear it an awful lot.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.880
And the second one is I think the
willingness to step outside of whatever

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.240
room it is that you're in.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.210
And maybe this is motivated
by the fact that I

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.330
come at this from an engineering
perspective where the easy part and

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.750
the fun part is writing code,
is building something.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.390
But that was never useful to do
that until I had built a real

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.550
understanding of what
the customer wanted.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.020
And that doesn't happen until
you get outside of your room and

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.580
start talking to people.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.380
And so, I think,
developing those two skills is more

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.570
important than anything else,
at the outset.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.440
&gt;&gt; So, what's one thing that you wish
you would have known before getting

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.320
started with Optimizely?

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.440
&gt;&gt; You know, when we started
our entrepreneurial journey,

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.230
we started actually working on
something completely different.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.190
And we built an education platform for
young kids called Carrot Sticks.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.380
Had nothing to do with what
we ended up working on.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.210
I think when I look back at
that time what strikes me is

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.510
how much time we spent working on things
that didn't actually end up mattering.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.530
We spent a lot of time building
things that nobody cared about

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.100
because we didn't spend enough time
getting to know our customers.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.260
And we struggled for a year,
frankly, without salaries,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.420
and that was a pretty difficult time and
I think during that year we had to

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.610
really erase what we thought we
knew about starting companies and

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.530
really learn how to probe and
understand the customers that we were.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.540
trying to serve.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.940
And you can see that in our first
company, Carrot Sticks, it took us about

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.250
six months before we earned
a dollar doing what we were doing.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.800
With our second company, which I won't
even go into, it took about a month and

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.104
a half, so
you can see our learning scale shrunk.

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:54.960
And then with Optimizely we
actually were able to earn money

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.740
on day one before we'd written any code.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.210
And I think that's the signal for, first
of all, the fact that we'd gotten better

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.350
at understanding our customers, but also
for how skeptical we'd gotten of our own

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.550
ideas, and that we weren't even willing
to work on something unless we were able

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.350
to prove that it was something
people wanted enough to pay for.
