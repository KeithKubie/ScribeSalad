00:00:02.215 --> 00:00:06.010
SPEAKER: --to Introduce our
three distinguished speakers

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:06.570
today.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.420
Stefanie Tuder is
a San Francisco

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.060
based editor who's written
for publications including

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.640
goodmorningamerica.com,
"Food Network" magazine,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.730
"Cosmopolitan," Zagat,
and "Time Out New

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.420
York," just to name a few.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.920
She's currently a senior
editor at Eater SF

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.380
and concentrates on Bay Area
food news and dining guides.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.220
Before that, she was the
associate food producer

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.250
at goodmorningamerica.com and
an editor at Zagat's review

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.370
right here at Google-- and
a bunch of other really

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.640
cool things that I'm sure
she will let you know about.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.190
She has also graduated
from the culinary arts

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.390
program at the International
Culinary Center

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.410
in New York City.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.709
So welcome, Stefanie.

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:45.500
JAKE DELL: [CHEERS]

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.280
SPEAKER: Right
next to her-- woo.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.863
JAKE DELL: I thought
we were cheering.

00:00:47.863 --> 00:00:49.870
SPEAKER: Right next to
her-- you get that going.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.480
Right next to her is Jake
Dell, who is the owner and vice

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.440
president of Katz's
Delicatessen,

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.930
an iconic Jewish deli
established in 1888.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.230
He's grown up in the
restaurant industry

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.849
and officially joined
the business in late 2009

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:09.050
and is currently in charge
of all major operations.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.920
So right now, he's working hard
to modernize the 130 year old

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.550
deli system and processes
while continuing

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.470
to maintain the
old-world feel and taste

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.910
for which Katz's is famous.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:21.660
This is exciting.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.550
Most recently, Jake
has expanded shipping

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.070
to include national reach.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.384
Yes, that means us.

00:01:26.384 --> 00:01:27.300
You can get his stuff.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.380
It's good stuff.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.100
And he'll open a
second location soon.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.960
His favorite meal, in
case you're wondering,

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.470
is pastrami on rye,
which he prepares himself

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.494
with a side of latkes
and chocolate egg cream.

00:01:37.494 --> 00:01:39.660
JAKE DELL: I go back and
forth between the egg cream

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.986
and the black cherry soda.

00:01:40.986 --> 00:01:41.750
I don't know.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:42.250
SPEAKER: OK.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.434
STEFANIE TUDER: What's
your condiment of choice?

00:01:43.434 --> 00:01:44.350
JAKE DELL: Mustard.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.660
SPEAKER: Mustard.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.420
EVAN BLOOM: There's no other.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.920
SPEAKER: OK.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.430
And next to him-- Evan, our very
own San Francisco Wise Sons.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.360
So throwing elaborate
dinner parties is not

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.420
something most 12-year-olds
do, but for Evan, this

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.290
was just normal.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.120
He started cooking
younger than most,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.320
eschewing Kraft mac and cheese
for Thai cuisine and baked

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.470
Alaska.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.990
His love of cooking and food
stuck with him through college.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.130
And after studying
architecture and joining

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.660
the corporate world, he
eventually found his passion.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.630
And it's behind the stove.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.070
So he realized his
fondness of food

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.810
had roots in Jewish
soul cooking.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.590
And at Wise Sons, he
recreates classic dishes

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.540
with integrity using
quality ingredients

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.580
while still hitting the
proper nostalgia that

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.880
would make your bubbie proud.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.730
I'm going to hand
it over to Stefanie.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.905
Thank you all for being here.

00:02:32.905 --> 00:02:34.226
STEFANIE TUDER: Hi, guys.

00:02:34.226 --> 00:02:36.018
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.420
So those are awesome
PR written intros.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.295
SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:46.725 --> 00:02:48.600
STEFANIE TUDER: To tell
you a little bit more

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.070
about these two
that wasn't in that,

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.610
Jake was supposed to be a
doctor, but pastrami called.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.050
And it was while he was
applying to med school.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.687
Instead, he wanted to work at
Katz's and just couldn't leave.

00:03:00.687 --> 00:03:02.895
EVAN BLOOM: You really
disappointed your grandmother,

00:03:02.895 --> 00:03:03.420
didn't you?

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.690
STEFANIE TUDER: Yeah.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.814
JAKE DELL: No, no, it's a
different Jewish mother's

00:03:05.814 --> 00:03:06.600
dream.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.410
You just switch the dream.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.180
STEFANIE TUDER: Fair.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.250
And Evan has absolutely
no culinary experience

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.160
and actually started his
career as an architect.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.240
And fun fact--
this building used

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.230
to be Gap, which is
where Evan worked.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.260
And now, we're back
where it all started.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.720
And then Evan, a few
years ago, decided

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.100
that he liked food instead.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.757
Do you guys know La Cocina?

00:03:32.757 --> 00:03:33.590
It's in the mission.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.540
It's a nonprofit.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.880
Yes, lots of fans.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.690
And so Evan volunteered there
and rediscovered his love

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.660
for food and decided
he wanted to make it.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.400
And so he started fooling
around with some recipes.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.230
And now, they are operating
in the mission on 24th Street.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.380
They are in the
Contemporary Jewish Museum.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.800
And they just opened
a bagelry on Fillmore.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.240
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.310
Yeah.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.780
So we have kind of the old
guard of Jewish cuisine

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.300
and the new guard.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.580
Very purist-- pastrami
on rye with mustard.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.496
And then we've got some pastrami
cheese fries to my far right.

00:04:11.496 --> 00:04:12.870
JAKE DELL: Pastrami
cheese fries?

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.320
EVAN BLOOM: But their
sandwich kind of inspired

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.987
everything, so--

00:04:14.987 --> 00:04:16.569
STEFANIE TUDER:
That's the truth, yes.

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:17.624
EVAN BLOOM: It's a nice--

00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:18.500
JAKE DELL: Thank you.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.228
Yeah, we try.

00:04:19.228 --> 00:04:20.519
STEFANIE TUDER: Starting there.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.430
So I mean, Katz's pastrami, for
those of you who haven't been,

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.190
next time you're
in New York, go.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.170
Or ship it here.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.430
It's really iconic.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.590
And to walk into
something like that, how

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.712
do you tackle that and keep it
running day to day what it is?

00:04:39.712 --> 00:04:40.420
JAKE DELL: Right.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:47.380
So we go through roughly 15,000
pounds of pastrami every week.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.300
And every pound we try and make
sure it's exactly the same.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.830
So whether it's the first time
you came in-- or if none of you

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.790
have ever been, that
first experience

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.320
is hopefully the same as
anyone else's first experience,

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.000
whether it was 60 years
ago or a week ago.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.840
So we cure it and smoke it
all in the old-fashioned way.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.800
And it's just about
maintaining that food tradition

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.140
and sticking to the
classics and sticking

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.150
to-- we know what we do.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.145
And hopefully, we try
and keep that going.

00:05:22.145 --> 00:05:24.020
We're a little afraid
of change in some ways.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.561
STEFANIE TUDER: Yes,
they-- for those

00:05:25.561 --> 00:05:28.350
who haven't been-- who
has been, in the room?

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.050
A good number.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.450
So with all of you
raised your hands,

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:31.574
you know about the tickets.

00:05:31.574 --> 00:05:33.251
JAKE DELL: Wait,
Blueberry's been?

00:05:33.251 --> 00:05:33.792
AUDIENCE: No.

00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:34.204
STEFANIE TUDER: No.

00:05:34.204 --> 00:05:34.616
JAKE DELL: OK, alright.

00:05:34.616 --> 00:05:36.657
STEFANIE TUDER: For those
of you who aren't here,

00:05:36.657 --> 00:05:40.260
there is a lovely
Jewish doodle-- poodle?

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.122
EVAN BLOOM: A Jewish Doodle.

00:05:42.122 --> 00:05:43.830
STEFANIE TUDER: Cockapoo
in the audience.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.670
A Jewdle is in the audience.

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:46.810
JAKE DELL: Yeah, kosher.

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.352
STEFANIE TUDER: Kosher Jewdle.

00:05:48.352 --> 00:05:50.060
So you guys know about
the ticket system.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.851
JAKE DELL: I'm not
kosher though, actually,

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:55.710
so no pastrami for Jewdle--
Blueberry, the Jewdle.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.534
That's great.

00:05:57.534 --> 00:05:59.700
STEFANIE TUDER: If you've
been to Katz's, the system

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:00.520
is you walk in.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.400
You get a ticket.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.275
Why don't you tell us
a little more about it?

00:06:03.275 --> 00:06:06.850
JAKE DELL: Yeah, so it
is a very old system that

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.620
leads to a fair number
of problems sometimes.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.520
STEFANIE TUDER: My dad
calls it ticket drama.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.519
JAKE DELL: Ticket drama
is a good way to put it.

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:15.370
Sometimes it becomes
a battle royale.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.330
But ticket drama is a much
nicer way to put that.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.250
So you get your ticket, and
you go around from station

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.527
to station.

00:06:22.527 --> 00:06:23.360
You order your food.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.830
You sit down.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:24.080
You eat.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.121
You pay when you're done.

00:06:25.121 --> 00:06:29.310
Seems simple enough, but people
tend to lose those tickets.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.130
And it's just not something
you see every day,

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.050
but that's part of
the charm, right?

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.250
That's part of what
makes Katz's unique,

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.750
is that you can go and
experience these old

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.080
the ways of doing things.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.890
And whether it's the food, or
whether it's the neon signs,

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.440
or whether it's
people yelling at you,

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.460
or whether it's
the ticket system,

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.550
it's the classic way to do it.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.202
STEFANIE TUDER: You went to
Stern NYU business school.

00:06:57.202 --> 00:06:57.910
JAKE DELL: I did.

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.190
STEFANIE TUDER: I'm sure you
learned some updated processes.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.840
JAKE DELL: So yeah.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:09.270
So I went with the intention--
I knew how we do business.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.080
I grew up around that business
my whole life-- birthday

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.055
parties.

00:07:13.055 --> 00:07:15.157
I had my bar mitzvah
in the store.

00:07:15.157 --> 00:07:16.740
In fact, actually
if you look, there's

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.005
a neon sign that says "Jake's
bar mitzvah" on the side.

00:07:20.005 --> 00:07:22.900
It's my favorite neon sign.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.070
So I grew up-- I knew
how we did business,

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.330
but that doesn't mean that's
how the rest of the world

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.310
does business.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.770
And so went back to
kind of learn and see

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.506
what else was out there and
read case stories about why

00:07:34.506 --> 00:07:36.130
being in a family
business is the worst

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:40.900
idea in the world, and
all these horror stories,

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.790
and took what I could
from that and tried

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:46.870
to apply it to things you
would never see, right?

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:52.340
So the back to house,
boring business

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.410
of restaurant type
things, which we

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:57.640
both hate because
it's the boring stuff.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.770
But you know, you need to
change those sometimes,

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.430
every once in a while.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.260
STEFANIE TUDER:
Ordering, supply.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.050
JAKE DELL: Yeah,
we do, in total,

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:08.629
30,000 pounds of
meat a week when

00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:10.420
you add in the corn
beef, and the hot dogs,

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:13.320
and salamis, all those
other good stuff.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.150
So yeah, things like that.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.650
The ordering process
is important.

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:22.020
Your supply chains, if you
will-- all that fun stuff.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.270
STEFANIE TUDER: So if that's
your least favorite part,

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.060
I would imagine interfacing
with people is among--

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.400
JAKE DELL: No, I hate people.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.260
I'm really shy.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.100
STEFANIE TUDER: You went
into the right business.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.221
JAKE DELL: Yeah.

00:08:31.221 --> 00:08:32.429
No, I love talking to people.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:36.190
That's what makes
it special for me

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:38.909
is the fact that I can go
around from table to table

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:40.690
and talk to customers.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.127
STEFANIE TUDER: Who do
you see on a daily basis?

00:08:43.127 --> 00:08:43.960
JAKE DELL: Everyone.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:48.470
I get regulars from
all over the world.

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:51.350
But I have a couple favorite
regulars always that come in.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:55.860
And usually, they're
old-timey in their ways

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.830
and like to yell at me.

00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:59.122
So that's always fun.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:02.810
But I actually--

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:04.420
STEFANIE TUDER:
Jews are particular.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:04.900
They know what they like.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.140
JAKE DELL: Oh, for sure.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:06.910
Yeah, yeah.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:11.190
Yeah, I'm sure Blueberry
the Jewdle would agree--

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.700
very particular dog there.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.950
So actually, there's one
woman that comes to mind

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:21.200
who's-- she's 94, 95.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.220
And every time she comes in,
she tells me the same story.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.970
And I know the story by heart
because she's told the story

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:28.880
20 times at this point.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.760
But every time, I can't
help it because it's

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.200
such a sweet story about
how when she was a kid,

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.410
she would come with
her three sisters.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:42.450
And they would spend the whole
week making these tchotchkes.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.200
And they would sell
it on Delancey Street.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.520
And then we use whatever
they made for the week

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.270
to buy a sandwich.

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:49.260
And they would split
it four ways, and that

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.880
was her weekly tradition.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.510
And so even though her three
sisters have now passed away,

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.800
she comes back and she just
thinks of their memory.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.710
And she inevitably cries.

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:02.357
And then I cry about it
because she's crying.

00:10:02.357 --> 00:10:03.940
And then it's just
like a whole thing.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.020
STEFANIE TUDER: I mean,
that's a lot to uphold.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.780
Katz's is-- for you, it's
your family business.

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:12.400
But a lot of people consider
it theirs, I would imagine.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.070
JAKE DELL: That's what I love.

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.640
That is 100% my favorite
part of the job,

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.000
is that for everyone who
raised their hand that they've

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.060
been before, you guys
all have your own story.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:27.010
And you all have your own
history with the place.

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:31.220
And my story is
just one of many.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:35.870
I'm lucky enough that my
story started in the womb.

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:39.950
And it's a web, right?

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:41.630
Katz's creates this
web where we're all

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:44.670
connected with this
food tradition that

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.650
is, in some ways,
largely disappearing.

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:49.950
But thanks to Evan and
other people out there,

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:50.860
it's coming back.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:55.520
And there's this love
and just great desire

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.090
to get back to that
food tradition.

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.410
STEFANIE TUDER: Mhm.

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:00.280
Great intro to Evan.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.330
Thank you.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.340
JAKE DELL: I try.

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:06.040
STEFANIE TUDER: So you guys
are kind of the purists.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:10.559
You are what Jews have
been eating for centuries.

00:11:10.559 --> 00:11:13.100
Evan, tell us a little bit about
what Wise Sons does instead.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.160
EVAN BLOOM: Yeah, whereas
Katz's is the institution,

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.510
we're the new kids on the block.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:31.000
We have to balance the nostalgia
that people come in with--

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.320
and they may have gone
to their local deli.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.370
Or a lot of our customers
grew up in New York and went

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:37.280
to Katz's.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:41.020
And they come, and
they have expectations.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.840
And a lot of those
expectations--

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:48.260
you know, part of it is
eating that sandwich.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.890
But a lot of it is also the
story that goes along with it.

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:55.380
So a long time ago-- well, we
haven't been around that long.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:58.040
But in our age a long
time ago, we kind of

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.740
said, all right, there are
these people that they come in.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:02.448
They're going to
complain about the food.

00:12:02.448 --> 00:12:04.550
It's not going to taste
like the sandwich they had

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:06.950
with Uncle Irving on Sundays.

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:09.110
But the fact that
they are coming in

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:12.780
and they're imagining--
they smell the corned beef.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.210
And all of a sudden, they get
brought back to that time.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.350
That brings us satisfaction.

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.310
Because we aren't a
100 year old business,

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:22.982
130 year old business.

00:12:22.982 --> 00:12:25.030
STEFANIE TUDER: Can you
tell people a little bit

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:26.620
about your menu to everyone?

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:27.760
EVAN BLOOM: Sure.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:33.860
So we are a Jewish deli.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.990
We make everything from scratch.

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.722
Basically when we
started, I was in New York

00:12:38.722 --> 00:12:40.180
and I was eating
a Katz's sandwich.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.670
And I said, well, shit.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:43.945
We don't have this
in San Francisco.

00:12:43.945 --> 00:12:45.567
I went to school at Berkeley.

00:12:45.567 --> 00:12:47.650
Came here, worked at
corporate for a couple years.

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:49.314
Hated myself.

00:12:49.314 --> 00:12:50.170
And--

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:51.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:54.220
STEFANIE TUDER: No offense.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:57.190
EVAN BLOOM: I was really unhappy
and started-- my brother was

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:58.879
getting an MBA at the time.

00:12:58.879 --> 00:13:00.920
And he was like, here's
a business plan template.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.350
Keep yourself busy.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:05.580
So I'd been to New York.

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:06.780
I'd eaten the sandwich.

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.290
We were trying to
recreate in our backyard.

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:12.460
And it kind of just
started to gather steam.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.820
And eventually, we opened.

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:16.740
We did a pop-up.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.940
We based our menu
on kind of what

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:22.080
we call the pillars of Jewish
deli-- the pastrami sandwich,

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.731
the pickle, the matzo ball
soup, chocolate babka.

00:13:25.731 --> 00:13:26.230
For us--

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:26.850
JAKE DELL: I hate
all of those things.

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:28.016
EVAN BLOOM: Terrible things.

00:13:28.016 --> 00:13:29.560
I don't eat any of them.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.140
So that's kind of--
we said, OK, we're

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:35.560
going to set out to make great
pastrami, great rye bread.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.130
Because we looked around
and nobody was making it.

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:40.240
So we had to do it ourselves.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:44.094
Keep in mind that making things
from scratch was not-- it

00:13:44.094 --> 00:13:45.010
was not our intention.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:47.093
Our intention was to serve
the best that we could,

00:13:47.093 --> 00:13:49.680
but we couldn't find
the products here.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.640
So we start making the pastrami,
the rye bread, the matzo ball

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.560
soup, the chocolate babka.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.310
And we started writing
the restaurant menu

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:58.470
and realizing that
we wanted to put

00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:59.860
some personal touches on it.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.979
But at the same time, we wanted
to serve the things that were

00:14:02.979 --> 00:14:04.270
the classic Jewish deli dishes.

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:07.400
So in New York, there's a
lot of the new guard as well,

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.200
but they're the new-- the
Mile End, for instance.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.640
And they can put whatever they
want on their menu, right?

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:18.691
Because if you wanted to go get
a matzo brei, or a lox, eggs

00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:20.690
and onions, or these
classic Jewish deli dishes,

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:23.640
you go to how ever many
different places in New York.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:27.230
But here in San Francisco,
there wasn't that.

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:28.660
So we struck a balance.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.580
STEFANIE TUDER: Are you throwing
shade at Sol's and places

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:30.960
like that?

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.010
EVAN BLOOM: San Francisco.

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:32.400
STEFANIE TUDER: OK.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.720
EVAN BLOOM: Sol, great people.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.460
They've been nothing--

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:35.380
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:36.421
EVAN BLOOM: They're gone.

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:39.450
Joe was a great guy.

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:41.129
I mean, we--

00:14:41.129 --> 00:14:43.170
STEFANIE TUDER: Did you
put them out of business?

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:44.045
EVAN BLOOM: No shade.

00:14:44.045 --> 00:14:46.620
No, he was trying to sell
me the business for years.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:47.830
No shade.

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:50.160
We couldn't find
what we imagined--

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.430
my nostalgia, my
partner Leo's nostalgia,

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:55.980
the things that were visceral.

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:58.220
So we put our own touches.

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.360
We have pastrami cheese
fries on the menu.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:04.380
We have a burger that has
like a beet horseradish spread

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:07.560
and we grind pastrami
into the burger patties.

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.740
Instead of serving
bacon, we serve pastrami

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.290
that we treat like bacon.

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:15.230
But we also have all
the classics as well.

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.850
I'm sure at Katz's, you
can't get a vegan Reuben.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:19.130
JAKE DELL: I don't even
know what that means.

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:19.380
EVAN BLOOM: Right?

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:19.880
Exactly.

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:25.620
We do smoked mushrooms
instead of pastrami.

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:28.040
So there are some
touches that are our own.

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.360
But at the end of the day--

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.193
STEFANIE TUDER: I mean,
what choices did you

00:15:31.193 --> 00:15:33.280
have to make Jewish
deli relevant again

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.020
in San Francisco?

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:36.487
I mean, no one--
well, not no one.

00:15:36.487 --> 00:15:38.070
But a lot of people
in New York aren't

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.360
begging for a vegan Reuben.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.780
But I would bet that there
are people here who care.

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:44.120
And so have you run
into that a lot,

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.705
the San Francisco customer?

00:15:45.705 --> 00:15:47.080
EVAN BLOOM: Yeah,
people come in,

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.870
and they're stoked
that they have options.

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:53.157
And we don't have necessarily
the built-in population

00:15:53.157 --> 00:15:54.740
that's going to go
to the deli and get

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.110
a pastrami sandwich everyday.

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:58.490
When we opened Wise
Sons on 24th Street,

00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:59.860
I lived two blocks away.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.360
That's a neighborhood
restaurant.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.867
It doesn't matter-- and I
think at a certain point,

00:16:03.867 --> 00:16:04.450
Katz's is too.

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:05.991
It's a blue-collar
restaurant, right?

00:16:05.991 --> 00:16:06.914
People come in.

00:16:06.914 --> 00:16:07.830
They're not just Jews.

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:09.246
They're not just
looking for deli.

00:16:09.246 --> 00:16:12.110
They may be looking for
breakfast or a hot dog

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:14.570
or whatever it is at
any time of the day.

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:18.260
And I think when we opened,
we were-- and we still are.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.920
We want to be a neighborhood
restaurant before we're just

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.867
like this Jewish deli.

00:16:22.867 --> 00:16:25.200
STEFANIE TUDER: So why not
go the traditional route then

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.510
if you wanted those dishes?

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:33.850
EVAN BLOOM: Well, I think
that's a tough question.

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:37.620
But I think to go the
traditional route,

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:40.420
it's hard to be a new
business and do that.

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.900
We don't have the
history, the roots,

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:45.299
that a lot of these other
old-school places have.

00:16:45.299 --> 00:16:47.590
And again, we don't necessarily
have the community here

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:48.730
to support that.

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:51.590
It's also important to us.

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:56.190
We use high quality
meats and produce.

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:57.780
And we're in the Bay Area.

00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.950
And we want to be kind of
a Jewish deli that serves

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:01.290
the populous of the Bay Area.

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:02.988
My intention was not
to open a New York

00:17:02.988 --> 00:17:03.946
place in San Francisco.

00:17:03.946 --> 00:17:04.779
STEFANIE TUDER: Mhm.

00:17:04.779 --> 00:17:05.810
EVAN BLOOM: Right?

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:06.290
STEFANIE TUDER:
It's true, though.

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:07.740
The history is a
huge part of it.

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:10.270
I mean, Katz's has almost
taken on a life of its own

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:11.127
at this point.

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:16.410
Not to discredit what
you do because it's

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.300
so important to keep
it super high level,

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.069
but how much do you think
is the history of it

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:24.910
and how much do you think
is what you guys are

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.550
doing to move it forward?

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:29.910
JAKE DELL: I would say
that's the majority of it.

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:36.970
I mean, the people don't want
me to make a vegan Reuben.

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:40.550
That's not what
is expected of me.

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:42.670
And in many ways, that's
actually very lucky

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:45.420
that I don't have to
have those same issues

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:48.880
and that I can focus just
on the core of what we do,

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:53.580
what we know how to
do, and not change is

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.130
amazingly lucky in some ways.

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:58.820
Yeah, it's got its
own set of challenges.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:02.840
But in other ways,
it's a lot easier.

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:05.240
Stick to the classics
and give the people what

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.539
they want-- different populous.

00:18:06.539 --> 00:18:07.830
EVAN BLOOM: Different populous.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:09.420
JAKE DELL: Either way, give
the people what they want.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.253
STEFANIE TUDER: But
either way, I mean, even

00:18:11.253 --> 00:18:13.370
your customer base is changing.

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:14.787
The Lower East Side itself is--

00:18:14.787 --> 00:18:15.870
JAKE DELL: Oh, absolutely.

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:19.030
STEFANIE TUDER: My mom grew up
Jewish on the Lower East Side.

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.030
And now, you can't find
many Jewish families

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:22.250
on the Lower East Side.

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:23.240
JAKE DELL: True.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:27.140
Look, that's part of what
makes New York so unique and so

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:30.620
special in its own way, is
that it's constantly changing.

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.537
And you go one day, there's
an Indian restaurant.

00:18:33.537 --> 00:18:35.120
And the next day,
it's an art gallery.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.010
And the day after that,
it's a clothing store.

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:38.301
And you're like, what the hell?

00:18:38.301 --> 00:18:39.033
This was a week.

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:45.350
But for us to be able to stay
the constant while everything

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:47.680
else is changing
around is so important

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:54.420
to me, and to my family, and
to my extended family, and any

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.420
of my customers.

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:59.770
And I do view it
as one big family.

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:04.200
It's the inner Jewish
grandmother in me

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.990
that wants to feed people.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:11.340
And so I want to feed people
what the classics are--

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:12.520
a pastrami sandwich.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.460
That's what I do.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:14.960
STEFANIE TUDER: So
you guys have had

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.390
to make a few changes
to kind of protect that.

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:18.570
JAKE DELL: Yeah, of course.

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:21.970
Over time, there's certain
things you do have to do.

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:27.540
We did add a Reuben onto
the menu 40 years ago.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:28.890
That was a big deal.

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:29.650
STEFANIE TUDER: Congratulations.

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:31.600
JAKE DELL: Yeah, that
was a pretty big change.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.030
STEFANIE TUDER: I'm sure
you remember that well.

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:34.030
JAKE DELL: Yeah, yeah,
it was a big deal.

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:35.740
It was a big whole thing.

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:39.020
And then cheese steak like
10 years ago, that was--

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:39.690
AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:40.440
JAKE DELL: I know.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:40.790
I know.

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:41.662
It was a big deal.

00:19:41.662 --> 00:19:44.482
AUDIENCE: Is that kosher?

00:19:44.482 --> 00:19:45.815
JAKE DELL: Yeah, no, not at all.

00:19:45.815 --> 00:19:47.231
STEFANIE TUDER:
Not for Blueberry.

00:19:47.231 --> 00:19:48.430
JAKE DELL: Sorry, Blueberry.

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:49.710
No food for you.

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:52.330
Yeah, little things
here and there--

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:58.440
we upgraded our cheese
cakes 15 years ago.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.070
So--

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:00.410
STEFANIE TUDER: Customers
are still rocking.

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:01.620
They can't get used to it.

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:03.330
JAKE DELL: There's a couple
that are like, oh, I remember

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:04.538
when Drake's Cakes were here.

00:20:04.538 --> 00:20:07.070
And I'm like, OK, but
Drake's Cakes sucked.

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:08.154
They were horrible.

00:20:08.154 --> 00:20:09.320
No offense to Drake's Cakes.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:09.912
Sorry.

00:20:09.912 --> 00:20:11.620
STEFANIE TUDER: No
offense, but you suck.

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:15.016
JAKE DELL: No, it was just
that specific-- moving on.

00:20:15.016 --> 00:20:17.390
STEFANIE TUDER: Also, you made
some more exciting changes

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:19.520
lately, like an expansion.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.270
JAKE DELL: That is
definite more exciting.

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:26.290
So we are moving into a
small space in Brooklyn

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:27.420
just right over the bridge.

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:32.880
It's the Dekalb
market, which was

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:36.590
an old-- so I don't know if
this crowd's familiar with it.

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:39.820
There was the Albee Square Mall.

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.770
You maybe know that really
horrible Biz Markie song,

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:43.730
"Albee Square Mall."

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:45.429
It was about it too.

00:20:45.429 --> 00:20:47.220
But there's a lot of
history in that space.

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:47.820
STEFANIE TUDER: No, I
think you should sing it.

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:48.403
I don't know if we know it.

00:20:48.403 --> 00:20:49.903
JAKE DELL: I am
definitely-- I don't

00:20:49.903 --> 00:20:52.105
know if I could do justice
to his beautiful voice.

00:20:52.105 --> 00:20:52.980
STEFANIE TUDER: Fair.

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.834
JAKE DELL: We'll
leave it at that.

00:20:54.834 --> 00:20:56.750
For anyone who doesn't
know who Biz Markie is,

00:20:56.750 --> 00:21:00.310
highly recommend
you look him up.

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:02.400
So what were we saying?

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.230
Oh yeah, so--

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:04.350
STEFANIE TUDER: Expansion.

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:07.160
JAKE DELL: Right, expansion.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.061
In some ways, it's actually
a traditional move for us.

00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:12.060
It does seem like new and
changing and all that.

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:16.120
But we're losing touch with a
lot of our existing customer

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:20.719
base with the crowd that
would come in, drive in, park,

00:21:20.719 --> 00:21:22.760
grab a sandwich, jump on
the Williamsburg Bridge,

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.870
and drive home-- that Brooklyn
crowd, that Long Island crowd,

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:28.174
that Queens crowd.

00:21:28.174 --> 00:21:30.590
Because it's getting harder
and harder to park down there.

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:33.690
That neighborhood is crazy.

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:35.910
It's just chaos down there.

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:39.030
And so in some ways, this
is a small takeout only,

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:40.210
grab and go.

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:40.840
Park your car.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:41.340
Get in.

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:43.540
Get a sandwich, and get going.

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:46.460
And so in some ways,
it's not new at all.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.330
It's reconnecting with the old.

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:50.880
And in other ways,
it certainly is new.

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.330
It's a new space.

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:54.390
It's a new operation.

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:55.050
It's Brooklyn.

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:55.660
So yeah.

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.493
STEFANIE TUDER: When
is it supposed to open?

00:21:57.493 --> 00:22:00.306
JAKE DELL: Fall right now
is when it's looking like.

00:22:00.306 --> 00:22:03.639
But it's construction,
so who the hell knows.

00:22:03.639 --> 00:22:05.430
STEFANIE TUDER: Another
big headline lately

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:06.930
was you sold your air rights.

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:07.060
JAKE DELL: Yeah.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:08.300
STEFANIE TUDER: Can you
tell us what that means

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:08.930
and what happened?

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:10.346
JAKE DELL: Sure,
I'll let you know

00:22:10.346 --> 00:22:11.930
once I know what that means.

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:17.450
No, so essentially, we made
it so that no one can ever

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:19.550
build on top of us.

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:23.590
So it gets a little
misleading when

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:25.090
you say sale of air rights.

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:26.470
It's more like a transfer.

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:28.428
STEFANIE TUDER: Well,
you did make $17 million.

00:22:28.428 --> 00:22:31.370
JAKE DELL: So says
the "New York Times."

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:39.170
So the idea was to preserve the
building, and at the same time,

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:43.680
allow us to reconnect in
Brooklyn, and at the same time,

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.910
expand our shipping
operations and really

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:50.240
grow it out so that
hopefully, we could

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.847
ship to all you fine folks.

00:22:51.847 --> 00:22:53.680
STEFANIE TUDER: When
did you start shipping?

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.127
JAKE DELL: World War II.

00:22:56.127 --> 00:22:57.210
STEFANIE TUDER: Literally.

00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:57.940
JAKE DELL: Yeah.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:59.870
Our slogan is, send
a salami to your boy

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:03.380
in the army, which rhymes
if you say properly.

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:05.189
You guys, I'll let
you practice at home.

00:23:05.189 --> 00:23:07.730
[MOCK NEW YORK ACCENT] Send a
salami to your boy in the army.

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:10.290
You have to say
it the right way.

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:12.140
But that was only
salamis, and it was only

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:13.360
to soldiers overseas.

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.940
And then in the early
'90s, we kind of

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:18.040
expanded it a little bit.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:21.230
So our regulars, mostly
in Florida, who said

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:22.770
we really want to
some pastramis--

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:23.480
STEFANIE TUDER: All
those snowbirds, they

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:24.330
need their pastramis.

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:26.330
JAKE DELL: Yeah, they
really want that pastrami.

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:29.579
So we started wrapping it up
in the most inefficient way

00:23:29.579 --> 00:23:30.370
you can imagine it.

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:31.911
It was just like
ice blocks, and just

00:23:31.911 --> 00:23:34.400
like wrapping it and then
throwing in this big box

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.930
and hoping that it got there OK.

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:38.310
And then over time, we kind of--

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:40.454
EVAN BLOOM: They all died.

00:23:40.454 --> 00:23:42.694
Next chapter.

00:23:42.694 --> 00:23:44.211
JAKE DELL: Damn,
that's really dark.

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:50.000
Yeah, then we sort
of expanded it

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.640
and built it out a little bit.

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.950
And now, we just started
offering a two-day shipping

00:23:54.950 --> 00:24:00.670
option as of two
days ago, I think.

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:02.370
And then I'm hoping,
in a couple months,

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:04.890
I can really drop
that shipping price

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:08.110
and do it at a
reasonable price, get you

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:09.310
some pastrami over here.

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:11.340
STEFANIE TUDER: So if I ordered
it, what would it look like?

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:12.960
JAKE DELL: Not that you can't
get pastrami over there.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:13.526
But you know--

00:24:13.526 --> 00:24:13.882
EVAN BLOOM: It's OK.

00:24:13.882 --> 00:24:15.555
JAKE DELL: Maybe you're not
in downtown San Francisco

00:24:15.555 --> 00:24:17.390
and you can't go to him,
so you need somebody

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:18.306
from pastrami from me.

00:24:18.306 --> 00:24:20.440
That's fine.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.415
What does it look like?

00:24:21.415 --> 00:24:23.270
STEFANIE TUDER: Mhm, like If I
were to order it today, in two

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:23.940
days, what am I going to get?

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:24.130
JAKE DELL: Like a
pastrami sandwich.

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:24.860
What do you mean, what
does it look like?

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:26.943
STEFANIE TUDER: But It's
already on the rye bread?

00:24:26.943 --> 00:24:28.430
JAKE DELL: No, so
it's sliced meat,

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:31.640
packaged bread
separate, pickles,

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:34.910
finishes-- all
separate-- mustard.

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:37.505
And just sort of heat
it up a little bit.

00:24:37.505 --> 00:24:38.380
Slop it all together.

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:41.090
Or eat it cold if you're
feeling like an animal.

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:44.850
But I would recommend eating it.

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:47.432
I recommend you make a
nice, beautiful sandwich.

00:24:47.432 --> 00:24:49.390
STEFANIE TUDER: Do you
do delivery in New York?

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:50.430
JAKE DELL: I do.

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:51.722
I do, yeah.

00:24:51.722 --> 00:24:55.200
I cater all over the
city to different events

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.810
and parties and
things like that.

00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:02.556
I think a bike delivery here
would be a little difficult.

00:25:02.556 --> 00:25:03.410
I could work on it.

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:03.850
STEFANIE TUDER: Well,
you guys deliver.

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:05.840
You know how it
works here at Caviar.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.090
EVAN BLOOM: Yeah, well, it's--

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:08.150
JAKE DELL: No, no, I
just meant from New York.

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:09.191
That would be really far.

00:25:09.191 --> 00:25:12.069
STEFANIE TUDER: Yeah, it
would take a little while.

00:25:12.069 --> 00:25:14.110
Have you had a lot of
success with delivery here?

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:15.600
EVAN BLOOM: Absolutely, yeah.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.230
STEFANIE TUDER: How much
of your business is it?

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:18.771
EVAN BLOOM: About
10% of our business

00:25:18.771 --> 00:25:20.417
is delivery in San Francisco.

00:25:20.417 --> 00:25:22.500
A lot of people hung over
on Saturdays and Sundays

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.480
want their brunch
delivered to them.

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:25.490
JAKE DELL: Yeah, I
can't get out of bed.

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:26.120
STEFANIE TUDER:
We've all been there.

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.030
JAKE DELL: Just send
my some food immediate.

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:28.696
EVAN BLOOM: And San
Francisco is so big.

00:25:28.696 --> 00:25:30.954
It's so hard to get around.

00:25:30.954 --> 00:25:33.120
STEFANIE TUDER: Sometimes,
you can't get out of bed.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:33.850
You just can't.

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:35.100
EVAN BLOOM: Hey, I understand.

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:42.520
STEFANIE TUDER: So how do you
feel about someone like Evan

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:47.980
coming in, and-- be honest.

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:50.710
JAKE DELL: Wow, that was-- you
almost caught me on that one.

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:51.805
I hate this guy.

00:25:51.805 --> 00:25:53.160
I hate everything he stands for.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:53.560
That's it.

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:53.810
I'm out of here.

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:55.160
STEFANIE TUDER: That's why
we put you two together.

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:55.670
JAKE DELL: Yeah, that's it.

00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:56.366
Get out of here.

00:25:56.366 --> 00:25:59.172
No, I love it.

00:25:59.172 --> 00:26:00.880
I actually think it's
the best thing that

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.770
can happen in a deli.

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:07.860
And I think what he's
doing is spectacular.

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:12.600
Because when people start to
forget about the deli food

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:18.262
tradition, it hurts the
entire deli business.

00:26:18.262 --> 00:26:19.720
What if you turned
around tomorrow,

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.520
and there were no
Chinese restaurants left?

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.100
You know what I mean?

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.690
And there's one Chinese
restaurant left.

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:24.650
EVAN BLOOM: It's like a
Jewish person's nightmare.

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:26.431
STEFANIE TUDER: Yeah.

00:26:26.431 --> 00:26:28.110
JAKE DELL: No deli
and no Chinese food?

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:28.960
Oh my god.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.950
Yeah, what do we
do on Christmas?

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:35.322
So I think it's great.

00:26:35.322 --> 00:26:37.030
I think it brings it
back to top of mind.

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:40.400
I think it makes people
want these foods.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.810
And maybe when you come to
New York, then you're like,

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:48.040
OK, I had his
crazy vegan thingy.

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:55.860
EVAN BLOOM: We don't
sell that much of that.

00:26:55.860 --> 00:27:00.030
JAKE DELL: I want to see
what the original was.

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:02.460
And I'm happy to
be the original.

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.170
And that's great.

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:05.420
Like, that's who I am.

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:06.690
That's what I do.

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:08.808
And I love it.

00:27:08.808 --> 00:27:11.182
STEFANIE TUDER: I know not
everyone feels that way, Evan.

00:27:11.182 --> 00:27:11.660
EVAN BLOOM: About?

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:12.800
STEFANIE TUDER: About you guys.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:13.390
JAKE DELL: About vegans?

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:14.540
EVAN BLOOM: Oh, yeah.

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:18.337
We have a ton of-- we
call them detractors.

00:27:18.337 --> 00:27:18.920
Yeah, I mean--

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:19.910
JAKE DELL: Well, go
take them out right now.

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:22.290
STEFANIE TUDER: Have you guys
seen "Deli Man," the movie?

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:22.790
No.

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:26.150
OK, so it was a
documentary about this guy

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:28.080
in Houston, Ziggy.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.300
And he has a deli, Ziggy's.

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.040
And it's very
popular down there.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:39.340
And he's super traditional,
very much about not

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:40.830
evolving the Jewish deli.

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:45.570
And I know that Evan has a fun
little interaction with him.

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:47.570
EVAN BLOOM: So this guy
is like-- if you haven't

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:50.420
seen the movie, he's like
exactly what would you

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:53.180
expect a guy that runs
a deli to look like.

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:56.500
And he speaks in Yiddish.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.364
But you know, he's
probably like 50, 45.

00:27:59.364 --> 00:28:01.030
STEFANIE TUDER: Nothing
wrong with that.

00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:04.620
JAKE DELL: He acts a
lot older than he is.

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:05.860
He's like an 80 year old man.

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:09.275
So anyways, we started
the pop-up news spread

00:28:09.275 --> 00:28:11.650
that we were going to open a
restaurant in San Francisco.

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:15.270
And I get a one-liner
email from him.

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:17.620
It was like, no subject.

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:19.730
Hey guys, just so
you know, I might

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:22.650
open in San Francisco, Ziggy.

00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:25.296
And I don't know whether it
was like meant to scare us,

00:28:25.296 --> 00:28:31.151
or that we shouldn't be trying
to do this new school thing.

00:28:31.151 --> 00:28:31.650
But--

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:33.025
STEFANIE TUDER:
And in the movie,

00:28:33.025 --> 00:28:36.300
he explicitly talks
about how he doesn't

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:37.740
approve of what you're doing.

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:40.520
EVAN BLOOM: Yeah, I
mean-- and that's cool.

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:41.431
To each their own.

00:28:45.066 --> 00:28:49.630
We're kind of used
to it, at this point.

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:51.885
And I mean, we own it.

00:28:51.885 --> 00:28:52.760
STEFANIE TUDER: Yeah.

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.327
EVAN BLOOM: I mean,
I'm not Katz's.

00:28:54.327 --> 00:28:55.410
I don't want to be Katz's.

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:56.190
They're awesome.

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:57.870
Their pastrami is
a gold standard.

00:28:57.870 --> 00:28:58.370
But--

00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:00.137
JAKE DELL: Thank you.

00:29:00.137 --> 00:29:01.720
EVAN BLOOM: I don't
want to make that.

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.303
I don't want to
recreate that exactly.

00:29:06.629 --> 00:29:08.170
I don't want to have
a ticket system.

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:09.770
I don't want to be
Russ &amp; Daughters.

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:12.195
JAKE DELL: You definitely
don't want the ticket system.

00:29:12.195 --> 00:29:13.820
EVAN BLOOM: There's
a lot we can learn.

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:15.320
There's a lot of things
that they do really well.

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.530
But you're an institution.

00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:21.100
I'm never-- maybe in 130 years.

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:27.670
Real estate doesn't work like
that anymore, but you know.

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:29.140
We have a long way to go.

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:33.280
And there's no wrong way,
as far as I'm concerned,

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:36.182
to have a deli and to
serve a pastrami sandwich.

00:29:36.182 --> 00:29:38.390
It's just a place for people
to come together and eat

00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:39.348
a certain type of food.

00:29:39.348 --> 00:29:42.040
But I don't think
the formula that

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.360
worked 30 years ago, 40
years ago, 100 years ago,

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:46.610
is necessarily going to work
for a new restaurant now.

00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:49.688
JAKE DELL: Also I-- if I
may jump in real quick.

00:29:49.688 --> 00:29:50.646
STEFANIE TUDER: Please.

00:29:50.646 --> 00:29:53.630
JAKE DELL: With Ziggy,
he and his father

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:57.580
actually came-- in the
same film, he came in

00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:59.385
and we showed him
how we pickle it

00:29:59.385 --> 00:30:02.000
and we showed him the
back room and all that.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.890
And we were teasing him and we
were joking with him about him

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:06.430
being the new kid on the block.

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:09.150
And my father was joking with
him and giving him a hard time.

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:10.280
And I'm a little surprised.

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:13.200
I think maybe he was just giving
you a hard time because I--

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.650
EVAN BLOOM: Totally.

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:18.710
JAKE DELL: I think he does
also agree that delis should--

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:19.900
the more, the merrier.

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:20.650
EVAN BLOOM: Right.

00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:22.983
And you know, we're not opening
next door to each other.

00:30:22.983 --> 00:30:24.120
He's in Houston.

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.640
I'm never going to
Houston, not even to visit.

00:30:29.307 --> 00:30:30.640
Sorry if anybody's from Houston.

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:35.030
JAKE DELL: There's a
fake Katz's in Houston.

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:35.310
STEFANIE TUDER: Really?

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:36.020
JAKE DELL: Yeah.

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:37.050
EVAN BLOOM: Do you guys
have a lot of knock-offs?

00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:39.400
JAKE DELL: He pretends he's
related to us, but he's not.

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:40.900
STEFANIE TUDER: I
mean, the fact is,

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:44.330
though, is that the
Jewish deli is dying.

00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:46.570
And there used to be
thousands of them.

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:50.320
And now there's
maybe 100-- not even.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:53.090
EVAN BLOOM: Well, there's like
a crazy statistic in New York.

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:53.410
I don't know if you--

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:55.360
JAKE DELL: Yeah, David--
have you read his--

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:56.526
EVAN BLOOM: Yeah, of course.

00:30:56.526 --> 00:30:59.685
JAKE DELL: Yeah, I mean David
is like-- he loves to talk--

00:30:59.685 --> 00:31:01.685
EVAN BLOOM: If you haven't
read "Save the Deli,"

00:31:01.685 --> 00:31:04.140
it came out probably
just before we opened.

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:06.000
It's incredible.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.820
This guy, David Sax,
writes about kind

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:10.769
of the history of deli
and where it's going,

00:31:10.769 --> 00:31:12.310
or where it was
going five years ago.

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:13.726
JAKE DELL: Yeah,
he's a character.

00:31:13.726 --> 00:31:16.570
I mean, he really
did his research.

00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:21.010
The first chapter is him cutting
at Katz's, being a cutter,

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:23.970
and his experience with that.

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:26.980
STEFANIE TUDER: How can
you spotlight as a cutter

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:27.590
at Katz's?

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:28.240
JAKE DELL: He was horrible.

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:28.864
He was so bad.

00:31:28.864 --> 00:31:30.530
I loved him, but he
was the worst cutter

00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:31.480
I've ever seen in my life.

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:33.530
EVAN BLOOM: Speaking of
that, can I ask a question?

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:34.430
JAKE DELL: You want
to try cutting?

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:34.765
EVAN BLOOM: Yes.

00:31:34.765 --> 00:31:35.990
Tuesday, I'll be there.

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.800
JAKE DELL: All
right, sounds good.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:37.800
EVAN BLOOM: I can do it.

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:43.702
If you tip, do
you get more meat?

00:31:43.702 --> 00:31:45.590
Is that a real thing?

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:47.200
JAKE DELL: That's the rumor.

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.380
STEFANIE TUDER: My
dad can confirm that.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:51.392
JAKE DELL: OK, so--

00:31:51.392 --> 00:31:52.600
EVAN BLOOM: Do you guys know?

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.058
If you haven't been
to Katz's, it's

00:31:54.058 --> 00:31:55.600
like-- or any time
you read about it,

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.641
it's like, you have to
tip the cutter because you

00:31:57.641 --> 00:32:00.070
get like the better quality
or more meat on your sandwich.

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:01.320
STEFANIE TUDER: Well, you at
least get to sample as you go.

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.800
EVAN BLOOM: People put
a lot of money in there.

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:03.591
JAKE DELL: They do.

00:32:03.591 --> 00:32:04.350
They do.

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:06.410
So I'll say this much.

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:08.839
There not supposed to
necessarily do that.

00:32:08.839 --> 00:32:10.880
STEFANIE TUDER: That's
why you keep the jars out?

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.872
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:19.706
JAKE DELL: Each
cutter's an artist.

00:32:19.706 --> 00:32:21.572
EVAN BLOOM: It's like Subway.

00:32:21.572 --> 00:32:22.530
JAKE DELL: Like Subway.

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:24.780
EVAN BLOOM: They call them
sandwich artists at Subway.

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:25.465
I'm just saying.

00:32:25.465 --> 00:32:27.131
JAKE DELL: Aw, daggers.

00:32:27.131 --> 00:32:27.630
Daggers.

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:28.530
EVAN BLOOM: Come on.

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:30.429
I had to get one in.

00:32:30.429 --> 00:32:32.970
JAKE DELL: That pastrami that
they make, have you tried that?

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:33.595
EVAN BLOOM: No.

00:32:33.595 --> 00:32:34.734
JAKE DELL: Oh, I did.

00:32:34.734 --> 00:32:35.400
I had to try it.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.867
It was like, aw, man.

00:32:37.867 --> 00:32:39.700
No knock on-- actually,
no, knock on Subway.

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.420
That was horrible.

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:43.314
What were we saying?

00:32:43.314 --> 00:32:44.480
STEFANIE TUDER: The tipping.

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.646
EVAN BLOOM: That's one thing
we can agree on, right,

00:32:46.646 --> 00:32:50.060
is that there are so
many sandwich places now

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:51.639
that are serving such like--

00:32:51.639 --> 00:32:52.430
JAKE DELL: Garbage.

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:54.730
EVAN BLOOM: Such garbage,
and meat that's got--

00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:55.896
JAKE DELL: Boar's Head, ugh.

00:32:55.896 --> 00:32:58.410
EVAN BLOOM: --all the stuff
pumped into it, and you know.

00:32:58.410 --> 00:32:59.655
It's pretty brutal.

00:32:59.655 --> 00:33:01.030
JAKE DELL: I think
it's something

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:02.520
that Blueberry would hate.

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:03.270
EVAN BLOOM: Yes.

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:05.020
JAKE DELL: I think we
could agree on that.

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:08.200
STEFANIE TUDER: The
discerning dog over there.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:11.330
So what do you
think you're going

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:15.900
to do to keep Katz's around
for another 130 years?

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:19.321
JAKE DELL: Well, if I'm
alive for the 130 years,

00:33:19.321 --> 00:33:21.489
then god bless medical
technology, first of all.

00:33:21.489 --> 00:33:22.780
STEFANIE TUDER: You never know.

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:25.110
JAKE DELL: And then
we'll actually have proof

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:27.140
that pastrami keeps
you alive for longer,

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:30.800
so well, I'll be golden.

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:32.470
What do I need to do to keep it?

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:35.760
I think just stick
to the classics.

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.706
And I've touched on
this, and I might

00:33:37.706 --> 00:33:38.830
sound like a broken record.

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:42.270
But I think part of
it is-- it's the food.

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:43.210
It's the classics.

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:44.460
It's what we're known for.

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:47.905
It's hopefully the--
you said gold standard,

00:33:47.905 --> 00:33:50.910
and I appreciate that-- that's
what I'm going for, right,

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:52.780
to be the best pastrami
sandwich you've ever

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:56.680
had in your life every
time you come in.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:59.600
And it's also the
nostalgia aspect.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:02.220
It's that sight-- you come in.

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:03.460
It's the neon signs around.

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:04.430
It's the ticket signs.

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:05.840
It's the guys
behind the counter.

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:09.400
It's the smells of,
well, mostly garlic,

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:12.880
but-- and then just the noises.

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:18.320
And then on top of nostalgia,
there's just the atmosphere.

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.540
And I think when you
take those, if you

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:24.979
want to call it the holy
trinity or some sort of other--

00:34:24.979 --> 00:34:25.520
I don't know.

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.733
We could come up with some
stupid, deli-related name.

00:34:27.733 --> 00:34:29.108
STEFANIE TUDER:
We'll brainstrom.

00:34:29.108 --> 00:34:30.580
JAKE DELL: Yeah.

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:32.440
I think as long as
you stick to that,

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:39.900
and we stick to who we are
and focus on making sure

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:43.445
that customers are
happy when they leave,

00:34:43.445 --> 00:34:45.420
hopefully we'll be
around for 130 years.

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:48.412
And I don't know
what more I can do.

00:34:48.412 --> 00:34:50.370
STEFANIE TUDER: Which is
funny, because I mean,

00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:53.050
consistency is certainly
what every restaurant

00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:53.739
needs focus on.

00:34:53.739 --> 00:34:59.490
But you almost have the opposite
task of innovating and--

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:03.670
EVAN BLOOM: Yeah, I
mean, for us, it's

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:07.030
important keep things
fresh and to continue

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:11.692
to make people excited to come
in and eat what we're serving.

00:35:11.692 --> 00:35:13.650
But at the end of the
day, 60% of what we serve

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:15.110
is a pastrami sandwich.

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:19.550
And at the bagel shop,
everybody wants smoked salmon.

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:21.670
People still come in
mostly for the classics.

00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:23.530
It's maybe the
locals, the neighbors,

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:25.780
that want something different
every time they come in.

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:33.671
But we want to build
what you have, right?

00:35:33.671 --> 00:35:35.420
For instance, I got
an e-mail this morning

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:40.190
from somebody who we cater
their son's bris five weeks ago.

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:42.030
And we got a thank you
note from him today

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:43.655
this morning with a
picture of his son.

00:35:43.655 --> 00:35:45.980
It's like, he's a bit
fatter now but we just

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:47.840
wanted to say thank you so much.

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.140
JAKE DELL: I thought you
get a note from the son.

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:49.891
EVAN BLOOM: From the son.

00:35:49.891 --> 00:35:51.099
JAKE DELL: That's impressive.

00:35:51.099 --> 00:35:52.650
EVAN BLOOM: Yeah, yeah.

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:54.550
And you know, and we
can't wait for you

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:55.784
to cater his bar mitzvah.

00:35:55.784 --> 00:35:56.450
JAKE DELL: Nice.

00:35:56.450 --> 00:36:02.880
EVAN BLOOM: And that is exactly
what we're trying to cultivate.

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:07.530
I have memories as a child
going to a specific deli,

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:09.740
and that's forever going
to be my first impression

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:11.300
of Jewish deli food.

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:16.470
And we want to cultivate that
with families in San Francisco,

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:18.880
in the mission, in our
24th Street restaurant.

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:22.390
We're already seeing kids
that came in in their parents'

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:24.935
arms five years ago
are now coming in,

00:36:24.935 --> 00:36:27.765
and they're five years old.

00:36:27.765 --> 00:36:28.265
Surprise.

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:36.120
But we're starting fresh.

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:38.410
So we have to
continue to really try

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:42.750
to cultivate that community
feeling and spirit

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:45.580
and create our own nostalgia
while trying not to be

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:47.000
stuck too much in the past.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.140
I think there's a balance.

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:50.990
We also need to buy
our real estate.

00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:53.115
STEFANIE TUDER: Welcome
to San Francisco.

00:36:53.115 --> 00:36:53.615
Cool.

00:36:53.615 --> 00:36:55.400
Well, love to open
it up to questions

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:56.770
if anyone in the audience has.

00:36:56.770 --> 00:36:58.950
JAKE DELL: This is
the way more fun part.

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:00.450
AUDIENCE: Evan, you
might know this.

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:01.824
But just down the
street, there's

00:37:01.824 --> 00:37:04.400
this place called Eatsa,
which is where you

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:07.120
go order your food off an iPad.

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:08.770
They put your food in a box.

00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:10.440
And there's no
human interaction.

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.160
So there are these
people cooking

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:16.830
food behind a wall of glass
boxes, and then you pick it up.

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:17.340
Given that--

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:18.190
JAKE DELL: I've seen
a bunch of places

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:19.460
like that too in New York.

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:19.895
AUDIENCE: In New York?

00:37:19.895 --> 00:37:20.160
JAKE DELL: Yeah.

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:20.430
AUDIENCE: Really?

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:21.100
EVAN BLOOM: Automats, yeah.

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:21.610
JAKE DELL: Yeah.

00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:22.660
EVAN BLOOM: Coming back.

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:24.826
AUDIENCE: So do you guys
think that's going to work?

00:37:24.826 --> 00:37:27.760
Because they feel like what
makes your places so special

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:31.205
is the tradition, the
history, the people.

00:37:31.205 --> 00:37:32.330
Is there a future for that?

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:33.580
EVAN BLOOM: That's a question.

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:36.978
I mean, sadly, I
think it will work.

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.730
I mean, probably
everybody-- I do it.

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:47.691
Like, how many times have you
gone on Caviar or UberEATS,

00:37:47.691 --> 00:37:51.397
or you get food delivered
by somebody in a brown bag.

00:37:51.397 --> 00:37:52.230
They give it to you.

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:53.855
And you say, thank
you, and you eat it.

00:37:53.855 --> 00:37:57.180
You don't even have
to leave your house.

00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:01.310
I think it's becoming
more of the norm.

00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:03.010
It works for certain
types of food.

00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:05.267
And I think it's
great for sustenance.

00:38:05.267 --> 00:38:07.225
And I really need a salad,
and I need it quick.

00:38:07.225 --> 00:38:09.640
And that's why you go to Eatsa.

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:12.380
And you know, I don't
want to talk to anybody.

00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:16.920
But there's certainly
an element of sadness.

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.640
But that would never work
with something that we did,

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:21.112
because you know--

00:38:21.112 --> 00:38:22.570
JAKE DELL: It fills
a certain role.

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:24.070
I agree 100%.

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:26.480
I think it will be
successful because there

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.260
is a certain need for that.

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:33.454
But it will never fill the role
of a full service restaurant

00:38:33.454 --> 00:38:34.370
and human interaction.

00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:35.203
EVAN BLOOM: Exactly.

00:38:35.203 --> 00:38:39.780
There is a place for
it as long as people

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:42.850
don't want that interaction.

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:44.302
And a lot of times,
people don't.

00:38:44.302 --> 00:38:45.135
JAKE DELL: [LAUGHS].

00:38:45.135 --> 00:38:46.370
EVAN BLOOM: No, that's true.

00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:46.830
JAKE DELL: Yeah.

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:48.430
EVAN BLOOM: I mean, we're all
glued to our phones all day.

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:49.670
JAKE DELL: Yeah, it's true.

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:53.322
It's a miracle we're here
talking to you guys right now.

00:38:53.322 --> 00:38:55.280
Actually, certain people
are live streaming it.

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.530
They're probably just at
home thinking the same thing.

00:38:57.530 --> 00:38:58.350
Like, oh man.

00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:00.766
Now that you've said that, I
don't want to talk to anyone.

00:39:00.766 --> 00:39:02.870
EVAN BLOOM: They've
got pastrami delivered.

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:05.030
AUDIENCE: Jake, just
you talked a little bit

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:06.875
earlier about the ticket drama.

00:39:06.875 --> 00:39:09.200
I would love to
hear a funny story

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:10.400
from the last month or two.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.950
But I also would love to
hear about the genesis

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:15.540
of the commercial
for Samsung Pay.

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:17.132
Because to me, I
thought that was

00:39:17.132 --> 00:39:18.840
one of the funniest
commercials I've ever

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:21.580
seen-- Hannibal Buress
walking into Katz's Deli

00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:24.720
and using Samsung Pay because
it works everywhere, even

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:25.940
at Katz's Deli.

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:29.650
JAKE DELL: Yeah,
so I have a feeling

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:32.330
like you had a bit of drama
in the past with the ticket

00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:32.960
system.

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.569
So I'm sorry.

00:39:34.569 --> 00:39:35.860
AUDIENCE: I'm like a soup nazi.

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:37.881
I walk in, order,
step to the left.

00:39:37.881 --> 00:39:38.880
JAKE DELL: Oh, OK, good.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.270
AUDIENCE: I knew
exactly what to do.

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:40.880
STEFANIE TUDER:
You have it down.

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.400
JAKE DELL: So you're a pro, OK.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.400
Well, I appreciate that.

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:44.488
Thank you.

00:39:44.488 --> 00:39:50.460
So a good story--
I mean, oh my god.

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:53.559
It just usually ends in
someone threatening--

00:39:53.559 --> 00:39:55.600
STEFANIE TUDER: How often
do you invoke your $50?

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:56.391
JAKE DELL: I don't.

00:39:56.391 --> 00:39:58.370
OK, so I threaten
people with the $50

00:39:58.370 --> 00:40:00.300
if you've lost a ticket.

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:04.650
Generally, I try not to
enforce that because I

00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:06.744
want to be a dick.

00:40:06.744 --> 00:40:07.660
Sorry, can I say that?

00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:08.072
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:09.308
STEFANIE TUDER: Please, yeah.

00:40:09.308 --> 00:40:10.812
Anything goes at Google.

00:40:13.497 --> 00:40:14.580
JAKE DELL: I'd rather not.

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:16.038
I'd rather you just
find the ticket

00:40:16.038 --> 00:40:17.660
and we can move
on with our lives.

00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:18.702
It's not that big a deal.

00:40:18.702 --> 00:40:20.493
But every once in while,
you get people who

00:40:20.493 --> 00:40:21.940
just want to make a whole show.

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:24.450
I had one lady who called
the cops on us because she

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:26.920
said we were harassing
her and we were falsely

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:27.680
imprisoning her.

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:29.900
And I'm like, lady,
all I'm asking

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:32.506
is can you just check the table?

00:40:32.506 --> 00:40:33.380
You know what I mean?

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:35.190
It's not that big a deal.

00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:39.778
So it can turn into
a drama sometimes.

00:40:39.778 --> 00:40:41.610
Again, that's a nice
way to put it, right?

00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:45.640
The Samsung Pay commercial
was very interesting.

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:49.470
I got a call from Samsung
in the middle of December,

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:51.769
which is our busiest time.

00:40:51.769 --> 00:40:53.560
And he said, we want
to come in and we want

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:55.630
to film a very large shoot.

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:59.140
And I said, um, no.

00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:00.340
That's not going to happen.

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:00.923
It's too busy.

00:41:00.923 --> 00:41:02.640
And they said, OK.

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:03.930
We'll make it work, you know?

00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:06.320
And I said, well, if
you want to pay, sure.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.260
Yeah, no problem.

00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:13.130
That was all their idea,
all their planning.

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:17.160
All my guys are in the shoot--
except for there's one actor.

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:19.990
If you look closely,
there's a gentleman

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:24.300
who was the lawyer on
"The Wire," if you've ever

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:25.092
watched that show.

00:41:25.092 --> 00:41:26.700
Remember-- yeah.

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:28.497
That's supposed to be me.

00:41:28.497 --> 00:41:30.080
STEFANIE TUDER: Why
weren't you in it?

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:31.079
JAKE DELL: I don't know.

00:41:31.079 --> 00:41:32.390
I wanted my guys to be in it.

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:33.755
And I figured like,
I didn't want to--

00:41:33.755 --> 00:41:34.240
STEFANIE TUDER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.781
JAKE DELL: Because
I do-- well, yeah.

00:41:35.781 --> 00:41:38.736
I'll do other shows
or things like that.

00:41:38.736 --> 00:41:42.320
I was like, let's let--
we'll let them do it and have

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:46.160
some fun with it and really
make it a hell of a experience.

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:49.170
And so the big guy,
that's one of my cutters.

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:50.690
He's a character, for sure.

00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:51.920
All the guys are characters.

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:55.270
And so it was a fun shoot.

00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:56.300
It was a two day shoot.

00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:57.640
Each day was 9 hours.

00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:01.240
And we were open to the
public while it happened.

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:04.860
And it was interesting,
to say the least.

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:06.990
But it worked out great.

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:08.580
And I see it all over the place.

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:10.910
It's fantastic, yeah.

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:11.979
Can't complain.

00:42:11.979 --> 00:42:14.062
AUDIENCE: I wanted to ask
you about the difference

00:42:14.062 --> 00:42:16.060
between the two
Wise Sons locations.

00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:20.152
The museum is, I would
say, fairly traditional.

00:42:20.152 --> 00:42:22.110
You don't have all the
same things on the menu,

00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:22.750
I don't think.

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:26.280
Can you discuss why or if
that's always the plan?

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:30.490
EVAN BLOOM: Well,
our museum location

00:42:30.490 --> 00:42:33.270
is-- it's more of
a sandwich shop.

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:36.100
We're open from 11:00
to 2:00 every day.

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:36.600
You come in.

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:39.590
You get your sandwich,
your salad, or your soup,

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:40.900
and you go.

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:44.290
So part of the reason is because
we don't have a hotline there.

00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:45.290
Well, we have a kitchen.

00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:48.620
We don't have like deep
fryers and griddles

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:51.400
and stuff to do more.

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:54.640
And also, the museum has hours
that they enforce with us.

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.540
We can't open until
11:00, so there's

00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:58.760
no reason to do
eggs and breakfast

00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:00.177
and that kind of thing.

00:43:00.177 --> 00:43:02.510
And then of course, it's the
Contemporary Jewish Museum.

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:04.120
You can imagine that
most of the customers

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:05.578
there are coming
for their pastrami

00:43:05.578 --> 00:43:07.124
and their chopped liver.

00:43:07.124 --> 00:43:10.070
And then yeah, 24
Street's obviously

00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:12.591
got a much bigger menu,
much fuller kitchen.

00:43:12.591 --> 00:43:14.590
AUDIENCE: Well, speaking
of a second shop, Evan,

00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:17.339
do you have any advice for
Jake on opening up a satellite,

00:43:17.339 --> 00:43:18.380
opening up a second shop?

00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:20.430
EVAN BLOOM: Don't do it.

00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:23.384
No, I mean, like you
said, keep it simple.

00:43:23.384 --> 00:43:25.050
You guys have been
doing the same thing.

00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:27.670
And you've been doing it the
same way for a very long time.

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:34.030
So I'd say just make
sure that you set up

00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:36.850
the systems ahead of
time so things are as

00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:39.890
simple as they possibly can be.

00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:44.200
The biggest-- we have
three places in the city.

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:47.670
And getting from place to
place and getting product,

00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:49.970
I can imagine-- you
guys already do that.

00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:53.650
But having the line set
up so you can actually

00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:56.100
get things on time
that you need and not

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:59.370
get the wrong orders
inter-restaurant, that's

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:01.580
the biggest headache
we deal with.

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:03.670
AUDIENCE: We haven't
talked about bagels at all.

00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:05.230
So I'd like to discuss bagels.

00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:05.650
EVAN BLOOM: Do you
guys serve bagels?

00:44:05.650 --> 00:44:06.594
JAKE DELL: Oh, bagels.

00:44:06.594 --> 00:44:07.540
We do serve bagels, yeah.

00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:09.540
AUDIENCE: And even-- oh,
so you do serve bagels.

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:10.612
Do you make them?

00:44:10.612 --> 00:44:12.070
JAKE DELL: No, I
work with a bakery

00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:14.360
that we've worked with
for a very long time,

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:16.610
actually, in Brooklyn.

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:22.770
So I don't have the
space-- I focus on what I--

00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:23.770
EVAN BLOOM: Don't do it.

00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:24.120
JAKE DELL: Yeah.

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:24.820
EVAN BLOOM: Don't do it.

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:26.820
JAKE DELL: Yeah, it's a
whole different headache

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:28.028
when you're talking a bakery.

00:44:28.028 --> 00:44:29.690
And he can definitely
attest to that.

00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:32.556
AUDIENCE: New York bagels
versus San Francisco bagels--

00:44:32.556 --> 00:44:33.430
is there controversy?

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:35.429
JAKE DELL: I haven't tried
San Francisco bagels,

00:44:35.429 --> 00:44:37.320
but I imagine they're horrible.

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:39.482
EVAN BLOOM: They're terrible.

00:44:39.482 --> 00:44:40.940
I'd say the biggest
thing that gets

00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:44.490
me, just quickly, is I hate it
when people call us a New York

00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:44.990
deli.

00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:47.040
I hate when people
compare us to New York.

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:48.070
We're not New York.

00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:50.030
We're not trying to
be a New York deli.

00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:53.420
We're trying to serve
Jewish deli food, which yes,

00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:57.550
has origins in New York, but
we don't want to be that.

00:44:57.550 --> 00:45:00.420
And I also find it hard when
people say, oh well, it's

00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:01.520
a San Francisco bagel.

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:03.519
Because that's basically
just people saying it's

00:45:03.519 --> 00:45:05.430
not a New York bagel.

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:07.020
We just try to
make a good bagel.

00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:08.130
That's all it is.

00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:09.421
STEFANIE TUDER: It's different.

00:45:09.421 --> 00:45:11.060
It's good, but it's
just different.

00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:12.630
EVAN BLOOM: Yeah, because
the streets don't--

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:13.754
JAKE DELL: No, lay in more.

00:45:13.754 --> 00:45:15.527
I know you're holding
back right there.

00:45:15.527 --> 00:45:16.360
You were [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:17.030
STEFANIE TUDER: No, I'm not.

00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:18.150
I love their bagel.

00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:20.710
I've written about my
love for their bagel.

00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:24.580
And it's just like you
encounter all the time.

00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:27.220
It's just not the food of
my youth and my memories,

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:28.790
but that doesn't
mean it's not great.

00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:29.190
EVAN BLOOM: Right.

00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:31.730
AUDIENCE: In a city with
relatively few Jews such as San

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:35.040
Francisco-- you don't
have that problem there.

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:37.360
JAKE DELL: Yeah, we have
a couple Jews in New York.

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.980
STEFANIE TUDER: This is
that entire [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:42.080
JAKE DELL: Jewgle, right here.

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:45.647
AUDIENCE: Wise Sons, it might
be the only time in a week,

00:45:45.647 --> 00:45:47.230
or two weeks, or a
month that somebody

00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:50.130
interacts with Jewish culture
or Jewish American culture.

00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:53.560
And so my question is, do you
ever feel a certain pressure

00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:57.620
to represent Judaism or Jews in
America or anything like that?

00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:59.770
EVAN BLOOM: Yeah, absolutely.

00:45:59.770 --> 00:46:04.010
I would say about 40% of
our customers are Jewish.

00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:06.150
But we looked at it.

00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:08.437
People said, why San Francisco?

00:46:08.437 --> 00:46:09.520
There's not a lot of Jews.

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:11.490
Well, there are a
fair amount of Jews.

00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:13.180
They're just not
the ones that are

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:20.140
going to synagogue every
week or celebrating Shabbat

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:21.630
every Friday.

00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:23.190
But they're out there.

00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:28.090
You wouldn't
believe-- they're OK.

00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:31.630
On Yom Kippur when people are
supposed to-- Jews are fasting,

00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:35.004
we get Jews that come in to
eat because they're just like,

00:46:35.004 --> 00:46:35.920
it's a Jewish holiday.

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:37.132
I should do something Jewish.

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:41.832
People's parents come into town.

00:46:41.832 --> 00:46:43.540
And they're like, oh,
I have to take them

00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:46.602
to the Jewish restaurant to
make good on that, you know?

00:46:46.602 --> 00:46:47.310
And that's great.

00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:48.970
I love being that.

00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:51.740
Because that's what I
wanted before we opened.

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:53.200
I have a strong Jewish identity.

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:55.294
I went to Jewish summer camp.

00:46:55.294 --> 00:46:56.210
I was never religious.

00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:57.370
So it was always cultural.

00:46:57.370 --> 00:46:59.306
It was always about
the food for me.

00:46:59.306 --> 00:47:00.930
So we want to give
those people a place

00:47:00.930 --> 00:47:03.500
to come in and eat and hang out.

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:06.320
AUDIENCE: Do you guys get the
sense that outside of New York,

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:09.600
there's probably a market for
one great deli in every city?

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:12.510
So I'm from LA, Brent's
Deli, and then everything

00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:13.160
else for me.

00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:13.860
EVAN BLOOM: [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:15.518
STEFANIE TUDER:
[INAUDIBLE] I don't now.

00:47:15.518 --> 00:47:16.434
AUDIENCE: No, Brent's.

00:47:16.434 --> 00:47:19.240
JAKE DELL: Yeah, you have
that in a couple of places.

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:21.290
If you're saying, like
anyone from Chicago

00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:23.380
will immediately
say Manny's right?

00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:25.880
Or if you're in Michigan,
they're like, oh,

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:28.450
got to go to Zimmerman's, right?

00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:33.130
In some ways, people have that.

00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:35.170
People have their favorites.

00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:38.320
And I don't know that you can
necessarily compare or compete

00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:41.970
with people's first love.

00:47:41.970 --> 00:47:43.424
So you know.

00:47:43.424 --> 00:47:45.340
EVAN BLOOM: There's
always room for good food.

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:46.640
JAKE DELL: Yeah, exactly.

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:48.380
EVAN BLOOM: Like a Jewish
deli, at the end of the day,

00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:50.530
we're just another-- well,
it's pretty American.

00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:51.550
But we're another ethnic food.

00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:53.508
It's like saying, I want
to go to Chinese food.

00:47:53.508 --> 00:47:55.300
I want to go to get sushi.

00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:57.210
I want to get a
pastrami sandwich.

00:47:57.210 --> 00:47:58.290
So there's room.

00:47:58.290 --> 00:48:01.340
I think what's
interesting is all

00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:05.860
of these bigger industrial
cities that have institutions,

00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:08.940
like you said.

00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:15.095
And I feel like that's a lot
harder to build these days.

00:48:15.095 --> 00:48:16.970
But it's definitely
something we think about.

00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:19.990
AUDIENCE: Are you hoping to
be that for San Francisco?

00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:21.920
EVAN BLOOM: Yes, absolutely.

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:27.520
I think our Instagram handle
is San Francisco's Jewish Deli.

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:30.240
We want to be-- I mean, again,
we don't want to be Katz's.

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:32.240
But when people
think of pastrami

00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:33.850
in San Francisco
or Jewish deli, we

00:48:33.850 --> 00:48:36.260
want to be on people's tongues.

00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:37.632
That's our goal.

00:48:37.632 --> 00:48:39.090
SPEAKER: We have
time for one more.

00:48:39.090 --> 00:48:39.960
JAKE DELL: Tongues, I like that.

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:40.793
EVAN BLOOM: Tongues.

00:48:42.632 --> 00:48:44.840
AUDIENCE: Congrats out on
opening the Fillmore store.

00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:46.050
EVAN BLOOM: Thank you very much.

00:48:46.050 --> 00:48:46.790
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:49.400
In general, I wanted
to hear how it's going.

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:51.519
I'm super excited about
the Fillmore restaurant

00:48:51.519 --> 00:48:53.310
and neighborhood growing,
right, to sort of

00:48:53.310 --> 00:48:56.230
see you guys as one of
the new anchors of that.

00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:58.042
And so thoughts, comments?

00:48:58.042 --> 00:48:58.750
EVAN BLOOM: Yeah.

00:48:58.750 --> 00:49:01.400
So for those of you
that don't know,

00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:05.480
we opened a commissary
and a small bagel shop

00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:08.520
on Fillmore and Geary, across
from State Bird Provisions

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:11.670
if any of you guys
have been there.

00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:15.180
The Fillmore was the Jewish
neighborhood in San Francisco

00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:18.394
probably until like 1940.

00:49:18.394 --> 00:49:19.810
So there's a lot
of history there.

00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:22.637
It's really cool to be
opening a Jewish restaurant

00:49:22.637 --> 00:49:23.512
in that neighborhood.

00:49:26.110 --> 00:49:32.220
You know, I'm not going to lie.

00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:35.397
Weekdays are tough over there.

00:49:35.397 --> 00:49:36.980
There's a good amount
of foot traffic,

00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:38.370
but it's not like
being in, I think,

00:49:38.370 --> 00:49:40.180
some other neighborhoods
in San Francisco.

00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:45.550
I think people ask
why the Filmore?

00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:47.660
It's central location.

00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:49.830
There's a lot of people
coming through there.

00:49:49.830 --> 00:49:53.850
Weekends are insane because
people are nearby in their home

00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:55.320
and they come through.

00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:59.000
But also, it's
continuing to grow.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:49:59.890
For those of you--

00:49:59.890 --> 00:50:00.440
STEFANIE TUDER:
Where's the next one?

00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:01.030
EVAN BLOOM: What was that?

00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:02.820
STEFANIE TUDER:
Where's the next one?

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:04.270
EVAN BLOOM: I don't know.

00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:05.402
I mean, which next one?

00:50:05.402 --> 00:50:07.110
STEFANIE TUDER: That's
a bigger question.

00:50:07.110 --> 00:50:09.151
EVAN BLOOM: But if you've
been to like Divisadero

00:50:09.151 --> 00:50:10.990
and seen how Divisadero
and the corridor's

00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:13.790
beginning to really--
like new restaurants

00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:14.870
are opening every week.

00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:17.080
I think Fillmore is probably
like five to eight years

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:19.840
behind that.

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:22.019
AUDIENCE: What's maybe
going to help that location?

00:50:22.019 --> 00:50:24.060
Like, what's the best in
terms of bringing people

00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:24.880
in on an ongoing basis?

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:27.450
EVAN BLOOM: Come by during the
week and order catering, guys.

00:50:27.450 --> 00:50:28.162
Order catering.

00:50:28.162 --> 00:50:29.620
STEFANIE TUDER:
Guys, the takeaways

00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:33.070
you need from this is
Katz's ships nationwide

00:50:33.070 --> 00:50:35.680
and Wise Sons is on Caviar.

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:36.680
JAKE DELL: There you go.

00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:36.850
EVAN BLOOM: Come by.

00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:37.450
Tell your friends.

00:50:37.450 --> 00:50:37.930
JAKE DELL: That's
the CliffsNotes.

00:50:37.930 --> 00:50:38.260
EVAN BLOOM: Put it on Twitter.

00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:39.175
Put it on Instagram.

00:50:39.175 --> 00:50:41.390
AUDIENCE: It seems like we
needs kids with brisses and bar

00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:42.098
mitzvahs as well.

00:50:42.098 --> 00:50:43.630
EVAN BLOOM: Yeah,
that'll work, too.

00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:45.930
JAKE DELL: Or adults, but
that's a little [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:45.930 --> 00:50:47.910
EVAN BLOOM: But
also, guys, we're

00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:50.650
at ferry building every
Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.

00:50:50.650 --> 00:50:51.770
Come by.

00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:52.440
I'm there a lot.

00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:54.060
Come say hi.

00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:57.064
But just coming in.

00:50:57.064 --> 00:50:58.980
Yeah, people are like,
what can we do for you?

00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:00.020
Just come in and eat.

00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:00.570
That's all.

00:51:00.570 --> 00:51:01.180
Come in.

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:01.690
Eat a little bit.

00:51:01.690 --> 00:51:01.950
JAKE DELL: Yeah, yeah.

00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:03.160
You're so skinny.

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:04.237
Eat.

00:51:04.237 --> 00:51:05.570
Yeah, you're all skin and bones.

00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:06.653
EVAN BLOOM: I'll tell you.

00:51:06.653 --> 00:51:09.910
I'm really excited I'm
going to New York tomorrow.

00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:11.980
And I'm going to go
into Katz's on Tuesday

00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:15.084
and hopefully get that
the official tour.

00:51:15.084 --> 00:51:15.750
JAKE DELL: Yeah.

00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:17.250
EVAN BLOOM: Do I
get to stand behind

00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:18.599
the counter-- not to cut meat.

00:51:18.599 --> 00:51:19.890
I just want to walk back there.

00:51:19.890 --> 00:51:20.530
JAKE DELL: That, we'll see.

00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:21.110
EVAN BLOOM: How
many years do you

00:51:21.110 --> 00:51:22.629
have to train to be a cutter?

00:51:22.629 --> 00:51:24.170
JAKE DELL: So you
start on the floor.

00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:27.450
And then you go to the
French fries and sodas.

00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:28.590
Then you go to the grill.

00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:30.270
Then you go to the back counter.

00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:32.492
And then you can
become a cutter.

00:51:32.492 --> 00:51:33.950
EVAN BLOOM: I don't
think I'm going

00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:35.340
to be able to do that in a day.

00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:37.006
JAKE DELL: I'll give
you a shot, though.

00:51:37.006 --> 00:51:37.870
I'll give you a shot.

00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:38.430
EVAN BLOOM: Sounds good.

00:51:38.430 --> 00:51:38.780
STEFANIE TUDER: Cool.

00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:40.790
Thank you guys so much
for being here today.

00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:41.780
EVAN BLOOM: Yeah,
thank you, guys.

00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:42.050
JAKE DELL: Yeah, thank you.

00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:43.620
EVAN BLOOM: I think we'll hang
out if you guys have questions

00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:43.920
afterwards.

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:44.586
JAKE DELL: Yeah.

00:51:44.586 --> 00:51:46.970
[APPLAUSE]
