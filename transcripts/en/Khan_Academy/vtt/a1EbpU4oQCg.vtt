00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.137
- Which of the following is
equivalent to all of this stuff

00:00:04.137 --> 00:00:04.809
right over here?

00:00:04.809 --> 00:00:08.293
1 over 88 or 1/88th, y to the 100 plus 1

00:00:08.293 --> 00:00:09.848
minus this entire expression,

00:00:09.848 --> 00:00:13.564
1/44th, y to the 100 minus one-half.

00:00:13.564 --> 00:00:15.815
So let me just rewrite it,
this part right over here

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:20.815
this just be 1 over 88 y, let
me make sure it looks clear.

00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:24.382
Y to the 100th power plus 1.

00:00:24.382 --> 00:00:26.170
And then we're gonna subtract all of this,

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.631
so one way to think about it is

00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:32.631
we could distribute this negative
sign, so it's going to be

00:00:36.152 --> 00:00:37.950
negative 1 times all of this business.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.950
So it's gonna be minus 1
over 44 y to the 100th.

00:00:43.941 --> 00:00:46.703
And then a negative, remember
we're gonna distribute it,

00:00:46.703 --> 00:00:51.602
so negative 1 times negative
one-half is going to be plus,

00:00:51.602 --> 00:00:53.716
plus one-half.

00:00:53.716 --> 00:00:56.502
Now let's see what we can
do to further simplify it.

00:00:56.502 --> 00:01:01.502
So this is 1/88th y to the 100,
this is minus or you can say

00:01:01.912 --> 00:01:05.766
negative 1/44th y to the
100th, and so we can add

00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.903
these two terms together.

00:01:07.903 --> 00:01:11.037
This is going to be, we could write this,

00:01:11.037 --> 00:01:16.037
1 over 88 minus 1 over 44 y to the 100th.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.807
And then you have plus 1 plus one-half,

00:01:23.807 --> 00:01:25.456
so that's pretty straightforward.

00:01:25.456 --> 00:01:28.196
So you have plus 1 plus one-half,

00:01:28.196 --> 00:01:32.886
so it's gonna be plus three halves.

00:01:32.886 --> 00:01:34.790
And now we just have to
figure out what this is,

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.790
so 1/88th minus 1/44th, well
the common denominator here

00:01:40.363 --> 00:01:44.658
could be 88, that is the least
common multiple of 44 and 88,

00:01:44.658 --> 00:01:46.655
88 is divisible by 44.

00:01:46.655 --> 00:01:51.089
So if we multiply the
denominator by two, you get 88.

00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:54.202
Multiply the numerator
by two, you get two.

00:01:54.202 --> 00:01:57.545
2/88th is the same thing as 1/44th.

00:01:57.545 --> 00:02:02.305
So this is 1/88 minus 2/88th,
well this is going to give us

00:02:02.305 --> 00:02:05.301
this right over here is going to give us,

00:02:05.301 --> 00:02:10.301
minus or negative 1/88th.

00:02:10.756 --> 00:02:15.494
1/88th minus 2/88th is
going to be negative 1/88th

00:02:15.494 --> 00:02:20.494
y to the 100, y to the
100 plus three-halves,

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:24.526
plus three-halves.

00:02:24.526 --> 00:02:29.526
And that is negative 1/88th y to the 100th

00:02:29.796 --> 00:02:34.796
plus three-halves, this
choice right over here.
