00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.510
Now there are two main features of RNA

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.670
that distinguish it from DNA. The first is

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.420
that RNA uses a different nitrogenous base attached

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.690
to its nucleotides called Uracil or U instead

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.280
of Thymine, T. The second distinguishing feature is

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.790
that RNA is typically single-stranded. Unlike DNA which

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.280
you normally see two strands in a helix

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.240
together with each other. But even though it's single

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.240
stranded, it's still composed of nitrogenous bases, just like the DNA,

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.830
dioxynucleitides are. So this means that RNA also has the ability to base pair.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:44.380
In this case, uracil behaves in RNA like thiamine behaves in DNA.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.540
And so uracil binds with adenine the same way thiamine would bind with adenine.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.840
So hopefully you'll notice that based on the chemistry

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.470
alone, RNA and DNA are very similar. And there

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.250
are just a few differences that distinguish them. Chemically

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.920
speaking, these differences are very important. And again out of

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.020
the scope of this course, you may find out

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.780
later exactly why DNA and RNA are so different,

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.810
and why their functions can vary so much. I

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.760
want you to see if you can tell me which

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.550
one of the following images. Do think best

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.690
represents RNA as it is most likely found in

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.350
the cell. Do you think you'd see a single

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.860
strand of RNA, just as a straight, linear strand,

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.680
all laid out like this first option. Or

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.000
do you think you would see something that looks

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.930
like this, where the single strand has folded back

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.390
on itself, where it appears there may be some

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.900
Base pairing. Whichever answer you end up picking, I'd

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.580
like for you to try and justify your answer

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.120
in the text box here, explaining why you think

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.210
the RNA would look like that inside a cell.
