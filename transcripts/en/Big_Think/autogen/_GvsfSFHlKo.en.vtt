so so aging infrastructure is a huge

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:08.799
so so aging infrastructure is a huge
 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:12.119
so so aging infrastructure is a huge
contributor to high cost and actually

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:12.129
contributor to high cost and actually
 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:14.850
contributor to high cost and actually
poor Public Health in urban areas and

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860
poor Public Health in urban areas and
 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.880
poor Public Health in urban areas and
the way that works is the utility

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890
the way that works is the utility
 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.920
the way that works is the utility
companies they have these power plants

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930
companies they have these power plants
 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.929
companies they have these power plants
normally in kind of rural areas a little

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939
normally in kind of rural areas a little
 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:26.400
normally in kind of rural areas a little
bit further away from the cities and

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410
bit further away from the cities and
 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.799
bit further away from the cities and
then they have these huge transmission

00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:28.809
then they have these huge transmission
 

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:31.319
then they have these huge transmission
lines that they used to transmit the

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:31.329
lines that they used to transmit the
 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:34.920
lines that they used to transmit the
electricity to an urban center and you

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930
electricity to an urban center and you
 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.020
electricity to an urban center and you
actually produce a ton of electricity

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030
actually produce a ton of electricity
 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.420
actually produce a ton of electricity
and kind of lose a pretty significant

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430
and kind of lose a pretty significant
 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.730
and kind of lose a pretty significant
percentage of it as it as it as it as it

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:41.740
percentage of it as it as it as it as it
 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.190
percentage of it as it as it as it as it
moves and and so there's already some

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.200
moves and and so there's already some
 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.080
moves and and so there's already some
costs that everyone is paying for

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090
costs that everyone is paying for
 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.260
costs that everyone is paying for
through kind of older inefficient

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270
through kind of older inefficient
 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.710
through kind of older inefficient
infrastructure because of the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720
infrastructure because of the
 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.360
infrastructure because of the
inefficiency of the transmission lines

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370
inefficiency of the transmission lines
 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.650
inefficiency of the transmission lines
and the the actual age and inefficiency

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660
and the the actual age and inefficiency
 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.870
and the the actual age and inefficiency
of the buildings themselves are also

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880
of the buildings themselves are also
 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.330
of the buildings themselves are also
pretty expensive because they waste

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340
pretty expensive because they waste
 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.399
pretty expensive because they waste
energy right so they're inefficient they

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409
energy right so they're inefficient they
 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.889
energy right so they're inefficient they
over consume electricity per square foot

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899
over consume electricity per square foot
 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:10.710
over consume electricity per square foot
and so and so that's how aging

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720
and so and so that's how aging
 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.870
and so and so that's how aging
infrastructure really contributes to

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880
infrastructure really contributes to
 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.670
infrastructure really contributes to
wasted electricity and wasted

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680
wasted electricity and wasted
 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.410
wasted electricity and wasted
electricity is expensive electricity

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420
electricity is expensive electricity
 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.960
electricity is expensive electricity
I mean we're learning that when you you

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970
I mean we're learning that when you you
 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.480
I mean we're learning that when you you
you green a building when you do energy

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490
you green a building when you do energy
 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.170
you green a building when you do energy
efficiency in a building you're actually

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180
efficiency in a building you're actually
 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.190
efficiency in a building you're actually
lowering the amount of indoor air

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200
lowering the amount of indoor air
 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.750
lowering the amount of indoor air
pollution that gets trapped inside the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760
pollution that gets trapped inside the
 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.430
pollution that gets trapped inside the
building and so we're actually reducing

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440
building and so we're actually reducing
 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.320
building and so we're actually reducing
asthma rates as we green each building

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330
asthma rates as we green each building
 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.180
asthma rates as we green each building
and lots of inner-city communities have

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190
and lots of inner-city communities have
 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.830
and lots of inner-city communities have
lots of pollution the pollution gets

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840
lots of pollution the pollution gets
 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.300
lots of pollution the pollution gets
trapped inside the buildings it drives

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310
trapped inside the buildings it drives
 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.980
trapped inside the buildings it drives
high asthma rates there's lots of

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990
high asthma rates there's lots of
 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.480
high asthma rates there's lots of
families go into the emergency room with

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490
families go into the emergency room with
 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.160
families go into the emergency room with
chronic asthma so it's this huge public

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170
chronic asthma so it's this huge public
 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.310
chronic asthma so it's this huge public
health crisis it's a huge cost and so we

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320
health crisis it's a huge cost and so we
 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.810
health crisis it's a huge cost and so we
know that there's all these benefits to

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820
know that there's all these benefits to
 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.730
know that there's all these benefits to
greening buildings you know President

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740
greening buildings you know President
 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.520
greening buildings you know President
Jimmy Carter put solar panels on the

before I was even born and started a

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960
before I was even born and started a
 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.570
before I was even born and started a
green buildings program called a

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580
green buildings program called a
 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.190
green buildings program called a
weatherization Assistance Program I

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200
weatherization Assistance Program I
 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.649
weatherization Assistance Program I
think in like 1976 and from then to now

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659
think in like 1976 and from then to now
 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.719
think in like 1976 and from then to now
from a policy perspective we've been

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729
from a policy perspective we've been
 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.399
from a policy perspective we've been
trying to figure out how to unlock the

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:08.409
trying to figure out how to unlock the
 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:11.100
trying to figure out how to unlock the
benefits of energy efficiency across

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110
benefits of energy efficiency across
 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.589
benefits of energy efficiency across
America for decades right because we

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599
America for decades right because we
 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.699
America for decades right because we
know that energy efficiency

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709
know that energy efficiency
 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.160
know that energy efficiency
reduce energy costs for building owners

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170
reduce energy costs for building owners
 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.699
reduce energy costs for building owners
it's going to create local jobs it's

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709
it's going to create local jobs it's
 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.490
it's going to create local jobs it's
gonna reduce our dependence and reliance

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500
gonna reduce our dependence and reliance
 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.280
gonna reduce our dependence and reliance
on foreign oil and you know it's just

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290
on foreign oil and you know it's just
 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.050
on foreign oil and you know it's just
gonna be awesome all around for the

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060
gonna be awesome all around for the
 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.789
gonna be awesome all around for the
environment the challenges to greening

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799

the buildings is buildings each building

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489
the buildings is buildings each building
 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.110
the buildings is buildings each building

performance you may have two buildings

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:43.219
performance you may have two buildings
 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:44.860
performance you may have two buildings
that were built at the exact same time

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870
that were built at the exact same time
 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.959
that were built at the exact same time
but the history of maintenance is

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:46.969
but the history of maintenance is
 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:48.699
but the history of maintenance is
totally different the owners have been

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709
totally different the owners have been
 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.619
totally different the owners have been
totally different the ways that the

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629
totally different the ways that the
 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.569
totally different the ways that the
building are used or totally different

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579
building are used or totally different
 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.849
building are used or totally different
and so you have to learn about the

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:54.859
and so you have to learn about the
 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:58.599
and so you have to learn about the
profile of each building before you can

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609
profile of each building before you can
 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.970
profile of each building before you can
make an energy efficiency intervention

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980
make an energy efficiency intervention
 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.869
make an energy efficiency intervention
and the cost of learning the profile of

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879
and the cost of learning the profile of
 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.729
and the cost of learning the profile of
each building is prohibitive it's too

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739
each building is prohibitive it's too
 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.940
each building is prohibitive it's too
expensive and so the cost of analyzing

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950
expensive and so the cost of analyzing
 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:10.990
expensive and so the cost of analyzing
these buildings can be anywhere from

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000
these buildings can be anywhere from
 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.899
these buildings can be anywhere from
five thousand dollars to five hundred

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:13.909
five thousand dollars to five hundred
 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:15.849
five thousand dollars to five hundred
thousand dollars depending on the size

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859
thousand dollars depending on the size
 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.369
thousand dollars depending on the size
of the building and it's it's a

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.379
of the building and it's it's a
 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:20.170
of the building and it's it's a
difficult thing to ask a building owner

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180
difficult thing to ask a building owner
 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.659
difficult thing to ask a building owner
to pay that amount of money to kind of

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:22.669
to pay that amount of money to kind of
 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.899
to pay that amount of money to kind of
figure out what's possible to do in

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:25.909
figure out what's possible to do in
 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:27.460
figure out what's possible to do in
terms of sustainability so that's

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470
terms of sustainability so that's
 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.619
terms of sustainability so that's
problem number one and problem number

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:29.629
problem number one and problem number
 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.830
problem number one and problem number
two is that banks are not comfortable
