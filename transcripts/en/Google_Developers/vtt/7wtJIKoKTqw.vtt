00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.940
Hi, my name is Eren, and
I'm the product manager

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.000
for Webnak, which is a
logistics marketplace

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.140
application in Turkey.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.640
Right now, through Webnak,
we send a push notification

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.220
to all the truck drivers
regarding the shipments.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.950
So let's say if you have
100 shipments per day,

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.380
100 notifications go to
all the truck drivers that

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.370
are registered in our system.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.020
That may be good, or
annoying, for some of them,

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.240
but it will be a problem when
we have 1,000 shipments per day.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.050
To fix that, we try to
come up with an intelligent

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.460
notification system.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.460
We will look at the
location of the truck driver

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.620
plus his or her interests.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.180
If a truck driver is
interested in a city, which

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.110
we see that from
their previous bids,

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.220
we will send the notification
to the truck driver.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.745
Or, if he's close to
the loading place,

00:00:53.745 --> 00:00:55.940
if he's close to
the destination,

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.220
again, it would be important
for the truck driver,

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.860
so we'll still send
the notification.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.950
So these technological
changes helped

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.280
us scale our business
from 100 shipments a day

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.720
to 1,000 shipments per day.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.100
It even-- it will
grow even bigger.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.650
