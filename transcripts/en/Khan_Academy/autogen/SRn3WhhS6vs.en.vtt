00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:04.065
 One factory has machines that produce toys, 

00:00:04.065 --> 00:00:06.642
 which are then packed by factory workers. 

00:00:06.642 --> 00:00:09.986
 One day each machine produced 14 toys, 

00:00:09.986 --> 00:00:12.424
 and every worker packed two toys, 

00:00:12.424 --> 00:00:16.836
 so a total of 40 toys remained unpackaged. 

00:00:16.836 --> 00:00:20.736
 In addition, the number of workers on that day was 8 less 

00:00:20.736 --> 00:00:23.499
 of 7 by the number of machines. 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:26.402
 How many machines and workers did they have there? 

00:00:26.402 --> 00:00:27.586
 I recommend that you pause the video. 

00:00:27.586 --> 00:00:30.117
 This is a nice little task here. 

00:00:30.117 --> 00:00:32.648
 Okay, let's define some variables. 

00:00:32.648 --> 00:00:34.965
 Let M say that M is equal 

00:00:34.965 --> 00:00:38.536
 of the number of machines 

00:00:39.586 --> 00:00:43.451
 and that W equals 

00:00:43.451 --> 00:00:47.723
 of the number of workers. 

00:00:47.723 --> 00:00:49.441
 These labels look good for the variables. 

00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:51.614
 What does the first sentence say to us? 

00:00:51.614 --> 00:00:56.593
 It tells us that each machine produced 14 toys this day. 

00:00:56.593 --> 00:00:59.240
 Once every machine has produced 14 toys, 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.842
 what is the total number of toys, 

00:01:00.842 --> 00:01:02.630
 which were produced? 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.907
 The total number of toys that have been 

00:01:03.907 --> 00:01:07.808
 produced will be the number of toys per machine 

00:01:07.808 --> 00:01:10.292
 by number of machines. 

00:01:10.292 --> 00:01:15.121
 These are 14M produced toys. 

00:01:15.121 --> 00:01:19.946
 They were so produced. 

00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:22.743
 How many toys were packed? 

00:01:22.743 --> 00:01:25.437
 Once every worker has packed two toys, 

00:01:25.437 --> 00:01:28.780
 we are told that each worker has packed two toys, 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.684
 so that the total number that was packaged, 

00:01:30.684 --> 00:01:34.551
 is 2 toys per worker per worker. 

00:01:34.551 --> 00:01:37.598
 This is the number of packed toys. 

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:42.143
 We also know the number of toys that remain, 

00:01:42.143 --> 00:01:45.510
 the total number of unpackaged toys. 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.201
 It is told that they are 40. 

00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:52.290
 Let me write it in neutral color. 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.751
 40, we can look at it 

00:01:55.751 --> 00:01:59.148
 40 as produced, 

00:01:59.148 --> 00:02:04.094
 but unpackaged. 

00:02:04.094 --> 00:02:07.599
 This is the total number of those left unpackaged. 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:10.642
 Okay, how will we link the produced and packaged 

00:02:10.642 --> 00:02:12.452
 with those that are not packaged? 

00:02:12.452 --> 00:02:14.147
 If we take the total number produced 

00:02:14.147 --> 00:02:16.609
 and take out the number that was packed, 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:19.418
 we will have the total number of unpackaged. 

00:02:19.418 --> 00:02:20.254
 So we succeeded 

00:02:20.254 --> 00:02:25.246
 to create a linear relationship between M and W. 

00:02:25.246 --> 00:02:27.939
 Only one equation is not enough to find M and W, 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.518
 but we also have another dependency. 

00:02:29.518 --> 00:02:32.839
 It is also told us that the number of workers 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:35.346
 on that day, 

00:02:35.346 --> 00:02:38.110
 let's say W, I'll write it here. 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.222
 W, the number of workers this day, 

00:02:40.222 --> 00:02:43.543
 was 8 less than 7 on the number of machines. 

00:02:43.543 --> 00:02:47.281
 Or you can say he was equal to 7 in number 

00:02:47.281 --> 00:02:49.788
 machines minus 8. 

00:02:49.788 --> 00:02:52.250
 This will be 8 less than 7 in number 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.620
 of machines. 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.127
 7M minus 8. 

00:02:56.127 --> 00:02:59.286
 We now have two equations with two unknowns. 

00:02:59.286 --> 00:03:00.958
 If things are fine, we can succeed 

00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:04.811
 to find W and M. 

00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:06.600
 There are many ways to do it. 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.452
 Since this equation has already been decided for W, 

00:03:11.452 --> 00:03:13.287
 here we can make a substitution. 

00:03:13.287 --> 00:03:17.211
 We can take this W and substitute it for this W. 

00:03:17.211 --> 00:03:21.292
 In fact, I should say, we can take 7M minus 8 

00:03:21.292 --> 00:03:23.712
 and substitute it for this W, 

00:03:23.712 --> 00:03:26.754
 because M and W, the couple we want to find, 

00:03:26.754 --> 00:03:28.635
 must satisfy both equations. 

00:03:28.635 --> 00:03:30.770
 That's what we'll get 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.046
 14M 

00:03:35.046 --> 00:03:37.988
 minus 2, 

00:03:37.988 --> 00:03:41.643
 on ... 

00:03:41.643 --> 00:03:46.009
 And instead of W 

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:48.280
 I can write 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.085
 7M minus 8 

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:55.837
 and we get that 

00:03:55.837 --> 00:03:58.392
 is equal to 40. 

00:03:58.392 --> 00:04:00.133
 Now a little algebra. 

00:04:00.133 --> 00:04:02.339
 14M and then, let's see ... 

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:04.288
 Now I will write everything in neutral color. 

00:04:04.288 --> 00:04:06.945
 Minus 2 at 7M 

00:04:06.945 --> 00:04:10.035
 is minus 14M 

00:04:10.035 --> 00:04:13.344
 and then minus 2 by minus 8 

00:04:13.344 --> 00:04:16.134
 is plus 16, 

00:04:16.134 --> 00:04:18.987
 and then it will be 40. 

00:04:18.987 --> 00:04:22.515
 14M minus 14M will be just 0 

00:04:22.515 --> 00:04:26.219
 and we stay with 16 is equal to 40. 

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:28.251
 But that will never be true. 

00:04:28.251 --> 00:04:32.267
 16 will never be equal to 40. 

00:04:32.267 --> 00:04:35.380
 No matter what M and W are. 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.446
 Even if M and W are eliminated from this equation, 

00:04:37.446 --> 00:04:39.466
 such a thing is impossible. 

00:04:39.466 --> 00:04:42.484
 It is impossible 

00:04:42.484 --> 00:04:44.341
 16 to be equal to 40 

00:04:44.341 --> 00:04:46.617
 and therefore there are no solutions. 

00:04:46.617 --> 00:04:50.240
 There is no pair M and W, 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.747
 which meets the conditions given to us, 

00:04:52.747 --> 00:04:56.277
 so there is no solution. 

00:04:56.277 --> 00:04:58.622
 No solution. 

00:04:58.622 --> 00:05:01.037
 I will surround it in a small box.
