00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.880
Richard Turpin, better known by his nickname,
Dick, was a legendary highwayman who stalked

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.350
the English countryside.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:21.250
A century or so after his death by hanging
in 1739, Turpin was idealised as a dashing

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.410
rogue or gentleman thief type in a multitude
of supposedly factual stories purportedly

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.150
based on his life.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.640
In reality, he was not exactly dashing, with
a face covered in pox scars.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.911
More importantly, far from being a lovable
rogue, Dick Turpin was kind of, well, a dick

00:00:38.911 --> 00:00:39.911
(see: Why Dick is Short for Richard).

00:00:39.911 --> 00:00:43.510
Further, many of his supposed “feats”
were actually gleaned from the lives of less

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.330
well-known highwaymen, most notable, Swift
Nick Nevison.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.960
Compared to the ruthless Turpin, Nevison was
practically a gentlemen who, while still very

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.891
much a scoundrel compared to more law abiding
citizens, specialized in robbing the rich

00:00:55.891 --> 00:00:56.891
(which makes sense because, well, they have
a lot more money than the poor), rarely used

00:00:56.891 --> 00:00:59.860
violence and was often astonishingly polite
to many he stole from.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:00.890
(See: Swift Nick Nevison and His Remarkable
Dash to Secure an Alibi)

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.890
In contrast, the reality was that Turpin had
no qualms about brutally beating, mutilating,

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.750
raping, or robbing just about anyone, including
the elderly and the infirm.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.250
He once even threatened to roast an old lady
alive if she didn’t tell him and his gang

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.000
where she’d hidden her life savings.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.030
As reported by Read’s Weekly Journal on
February 8, 1735:

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.610
On Saturday night last, about seven o’clock,
five rogues entered the house of the Widow

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.920
Shelley at Loughton in Essex, having pistols
&amp;c. and threatened to murder the old lady,

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.060
if she would not tell them where her money
lay, which she obstinately refusing for some

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.710
time, they threatened to lay her across the
fire, if she did not instantly tell them,

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.710
which she would not do.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.910
But her son being in the room, and threatened
to be murdered, cried out, he would tell them,

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.340
if they would not murder his mother, and did,
whereupon they went upstairs, and took near

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.130
£100, a silver tankard, and other plate,
and all manner of household goods.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.380
They afterwards went into the cellar and drank
several bottles of ale and wine, and broiled

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.380
some meat, ate the relicts of a fillet of
veal &amp;c.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.890
While they were doing this, two of their gang
went to Mr Turkles, a farmer’s, who rents

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.450
one end of the widow’s house, and robbed
him of above £20 and then they all went off,

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.480
taking two of the farmer’s horses, to carry
off their luggage, the horses were found on

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.629
Sunday the following morning in Old Street,
and stayed about three hours in the house.

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:25.120
In another “roasting” incident, they robbed
a 70 year old farmer by the name of Joseph

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.150
Lawrence in Edgware.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.900
Dragging the poor old man around by his nose
with his pants around his ankles, they beat

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.689
him severely on his backside and head, and
then shoved him down to sit bare-butted on

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:37.930
a fire.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.760
While this was happening, other members of
the gang went and raped one of the man’s

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.760
maids.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.620
Over the years though, the “legend” of
Turpin became muddled and rather than being

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.019
painted as the rapist and brutal thief he
was, he became a handsome and lovable ne’er-do-well

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.379
with a heart of gold, being romanticised in
everything from novels to cheesy 1980s TV

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:59.590
shows.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.579
Turpin’s life of serious crime began with
the Gregory Gang, initially made up of Samuel,

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.830
Jeremiah, and Jasper Gregory, along with Joseph
Rose, Mary Brazier, John Jones, Thomas Rowden,

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.230
and John Wheeler.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.760
Turpin appears to have become involved with
the gang thanks to their early days of poaching

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.760
deer and subsequently needing the services
of a butcher to dispose of it.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.139
Turpin later became more directly involved
with the group when they moved from poaching

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:28.319
to robbing dozens of people of their livelihoods.

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.950
Over his years with them, he was complicit
in torture, beatings, rape as well as committing

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.669
at least one murder (a gamekeeper called Thomas
Morris who’d tried to capture Turpin as

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:43.290
he was hiding in Epping forest but was instead
shot by him).

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.170
As a result of all this, the water was getting
hot around Turpin, as members of the famed

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.980
gang were getting snapped up by bounty hunters.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.269
After the murder of Morris, The Gentleman’s
Magazine noted in June of 1737:

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.139
It having been represented to the King, that
Richard Turpin did on Wednesday the 4th of

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:06.450
May last, barbarously murder Thomas Morris,
Servant to Henry Tomson, one of the Keepers

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.340
of Epping-Forest, and commit other notorious
Felonies and Robberies near London, his Majesty

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.120
is pleased to promise his most gracious Pardon
to any of his Accomplices, and a Reward of

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.560
200l. to any Person or Persons that shall
discover him, so as he may be apprehended

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.560
and convicted.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.190
Turpin was born at Thacksted in Essex, is
about Thirty, by Trade a Butcher, about 5

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.780
Feet 9 Inches high, brown Complexion, very
much mark’d with the Small Pox, his Cheek-bones

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.070
broad, his Face thinner towards the Bottom,
his Visage short, pretty upright, and broad

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.010
about the Shoulders.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:45.030
After this, Turpin attempted to hide from
the law by assuming the identity John Palmer

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.950
and absconding from the London area, eventually
finding his way to a small town in Yorkshire

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.820
bordering the river Humber called Brough,
presenting himself as a down-on-his-luck butcher

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.670
who now made a living as a horse trader.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:03.690
turpin2Had he at this point turned himself
into a law-abiding citizen, Turpin likely

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.960
would have gotten away with the countless
nefarious exploits of his youth.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.560
However, old habits die hard and to fund his
new life, Turpin would often travel across

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.100
the river from Yorkshire to nearby Lincolnshire
to steal sheep and horses.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:24.480
However, the event that really sealed Turpin’s
fate is when he shot a man’s cockerel supposedly

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:30.170
after a failed hunt in 1738 resulted in a
frustrated and drunken Turpin deciding to

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.300
take his aggression out on the cock.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.890
In truth, whether Turpin shot the cockerel
to eat or just because he was annoyed isn’t

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.090
really clear from contemporary reports from
the time.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.190
All we know for sure is that the owner of
the cockerel was understandably a little angry

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.340
at Turpin and confronted him for the shooting.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.790
Turpin, rather than profusely apologising
or offering to pay for the animal or something

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:56.790
like that, instead decided it would be best
to threaten to kill those rebuking him; they

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.040
then went straight to the authorities.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.840
After being placed under arrest, the authorities
became deeply suspicious about their town’s

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.720
relatively new resident, since they had no
record of his existence before a year previous

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.770
and there was some suspicion on how exactly
he actually made a living.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.570
Under questioning, Turpin stuck to his story
and claimed he was a down on his luck butcher

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.650
from Lincolnshire called John Palmer, who
now dealt in horse trading.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.630
When the Justices of the Peace questioning
Turpin asked their colleagues in Lincolnshire

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.090
if they’d ever heard of John Palmer, they
replied that they had, as he had spent approximately

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.440
nine months there.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.400
Unfortunately for Turpin, they also noted
that he was suspected of sheep and horse rustling

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.420
and that he’d previous escaped custody when
they tried to question him.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.890
Realising they might be dealing with a greater
crime than they’d initially suspected- killing

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:49.090
a game cock being a relatively minor offence
compared to stealing horses, which was among

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:57.270
the close to 200 capital offences at the time
in England- “Palmer” was transferred to

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:01.460
the dungeons at York Castle on the 16th of
October, 1738.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:06.110
Growing increasingly desperate for character
references that likely would have seen him

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:11.280
walk free (the hard evidence against him was
scant concerning the horse theft), Turpin

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.800
penned a letter to his brother-in-law, Pompr
Rivernall (married to Turpin’s sister, Dorothy),

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.370
in the hopes of getting such references.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.340
Unfortunately for Turpin, Pompr took one look
at the handwriting on the cover of the letter

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:28.400
and refused to pay the postage fee, supposedly
stating, he “had no correspondent at York”.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:33.660
Exactly why Rivernall really refused the letter
is a matter of some debate.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.380
There are some who believe that Rivernall
really didn’t know who the letter was from

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:41.290
or that he was too tight-fisted to fork out
the sixpence necessary to receive it.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:45.430
Others speculate Rivernall knew that the letter
was from Turpin and simply refused to pay

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:50.060
because he was either tired of being associated
with his wife’s brother or scared of getting

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.090
involved in his affairs.

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:56.440
Whatever the reason, the letter ended up being
sent back to the postmaster’s office in

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.350
Saffron Walden, Essex.

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:04.220
As fate would have it, the postmaster in Saffron
Walden was none other than James Smith, the

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:09.220
man who’d taught Turpin to read and write
at the village school some two decades before.

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.860
Smith, supposedly recognising the handwriting
of his most infamous student on the cover,

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.540
paid the postage himself and took the letter
to the local magistrate who gave him permission

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:21.380
to open it to discern its contents, with Smith’s
hope being the contents would confirm his

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:22.380
suspicions.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:26.610
If confirmed, this would entitle Smith to
the 200 pound reward on Turpin’s head, which

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:30.740
is approximately £20,000 (about $27,000)
today.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:35.180
After discovering that, indeed, the letter
did appear to be from Turpin and it had been

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:41.010
sent from York Prison, Smith traveled to York,
fingered Turpin, and collected his reward.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:45.690
Although Turpin was seemingly caught because
of his evidently distinctive handwriting,

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:52.240
no known example of it has survived, meaning
we actually have no real idea how Turpin’s

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.580
former schoolmaster was able to recognise
it after two decades.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:09:01.090
It’s very possible he simply knew the letter
was to the brother-in-law of Dick Turpin,

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:05.150
with Turpin’s whereabouts unknown, and the
letter’s origin was from a place Rivernall

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:06.630
otherwise didn’t have a correspondence.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:10.580
Thus, perhaps he simply suspected the letter
was from Turpin in the first place, with the

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:14.480
writing on the cover perhaps having little
to do with his suspicions, despite what he

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.020
said to the magistrate.

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:20.130
Or maybe Turpin really did have quite distinct
hand-writing, or distinct enough that with

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:22.370
other suspicions Smith was able to put two
and two together.

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:26.502
Whatever the case, though the evidence against
Turpin concerning the horses he allegedly

00:09:26.502 --> 00:09:30.440
stole was scant, now that the locals knew
he was the famed highwaymen, any chance of

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.080
him getting off from lack of evidence went
away and he was tried and convicted on several

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.090
counts of horse theft.

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:39.360
At his trial, Turpin noted that he wasn’t
given enough time to prepare a proper defence

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:44.010
for himself and that he’d been told the
trial would take place in Essex, not York,

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:47.060
and so hadn’t bothered to get witnesses
in his defence to come to York.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:51.970
(At the time in England, suspected criminals
were not given legal counsel or representatives,

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:55.490
and instead, lacking funds to pay for such
council, had to defend themselves, including

00:09:55.490 --> 00:10:01.350
somehow organising witnesses for their defence
all while sitting in prison.)

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:07.440
As for his execution, the city of York didn’t
have an executioner.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:12.220
Instead, it was customary to grant a prisoner
a pardon in return for their services in this

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:13.220
role.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:16.529
As the fates would have it, the executioner
who ended up hanging Turpin just so happened

00:10:16.529 --> 00:10:19.910
to be one of his old partners in crime, Thomas
Hadfield.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:23.820
Rather than go out begging for his life, Turpin
spent some of his ill-gotten funds to purchase

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:28.310
a fine set of clothes to wear to his execution,
as well as hired a group of mourners to follow

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:29.310
him to the gallows.

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:34.460
It was also noted that he “behav’d himself
with amazing assurance [and] bow’d to the

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:36.220
spectators as he passed”.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:40.220
Further, according to an issue of Gentleman’s
Magazine on the day of Turpin’s hanging,

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.970
“Turpin behaved in an undaunted manner;
as he mounted the ladder, feeling his right

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:49.300
leg tremble, he spoke a few words to the topsman,
then threw himself off, and expir’d in five

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.300
minutes.”

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:54.620
And so it was that on April 7, 1739 at the
age of around 32, the infamous highwayman

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.080
Dick Turpin ceased to be.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:21.540
He was laid to rest in the grounds of nearby
St George’s church.
