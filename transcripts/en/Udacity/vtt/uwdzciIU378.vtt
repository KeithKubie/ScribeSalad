And here we go, we already know 95% is 1.96.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We know as you want to increase our confidence,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
we have to go outbound which means a larger value.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So it's 2.58 as the only choice for larger value,

00:00:13.000 --> 09:59:59.000
then it's 1.64 the final choice for the 90% confidence interval.
