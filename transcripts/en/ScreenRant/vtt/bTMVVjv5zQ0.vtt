00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.770
The age of computer effects and digital movie
universes is upon us, but the average moviegoer

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.139
might not realize just how much of the experience
is faked, or modified. With that in mind,

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.700
we're giving another dose of CGI trivia in
the latest edition of Screen Rant's Know Your

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.890
Movies: 20 Movies Scenes Before and After
CGI.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.740
The Revenant
The scene in which Leonardo DiCaprio's character

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.030
is attacked by a bear made headlines fast,
but the whole event seems a lot less frightening

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.670
when you get a look at who played the bear:
along with the blue bodysuit and bear helmet

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.420
to complete the look.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.510
Star Wars: The Force Awakens
George Lucas and his team practically invented

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.461
CGI with the original Star Wars, and there's
no better evidence of how far it's come than

00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:50.580
the newest Episode, relying on a massive amount
of green screened action in almost every scene.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.129
Gravity
Everyone knew that it couldn't have been filmed

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.170
in space, but few would realize that almost
all of Gravity was CGI - the stars only had

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.310
partial suits and a few white boxes to work
with for most of the production.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.040
The Hobbit
Peter Jackson relied on forced perspective

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.820
and camera tricks for the Lord of the Rings
trilogy, but for The Hobbit, it was just green

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.549
screen used to put full-sized humans beside
half-pint Hobbits and dwarves.

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.650
Man of Steel
The physics-bending technology of the planet

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.440
Krypton was obviously the work of CG, but
so was the armor worn by General Zod - a full

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.080
size suit was never even constructed.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.220
Inception
Audiences had enough trouble wrapping their

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.880
brains around dream-stealing, so they never
stopped to wonder how the actors navigated

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.750
the changing space - old fashioned tricks
and CG were the real answer.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.619
Iron Man
Fas might dream of owning an Iron Man suit

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.961
for themselves, but so does Robert Downey,
Jr. - for most of the armored action, it's

00:01:37.961 --> 00:01:41.920
red pyjamas and some mocap sensors, which
take a little bit out of the cool factor.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.080
Life of Pi
The stunning visuals made this adaptation

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.861
unforgettable - that, and the tiger sharing
a single boat with the movie's hero. Even

00:01:48.861 --> 00:01:52.950
more impressive since it was filmed in a pool
with only a stuffed blue bag playing a Bengal

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.210
tiger.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.390
Deadpool
Slicing off limbs and a man made of metal

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.740
are only possible through CG, but even Deadpool's
more lighthearted antics were obviously a

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.500
blast on the set - even if they lacked the
explosions and flight.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.320
Guardians of the Galaxy
Although the walking tree, Groot, was animated

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.000
from scratch, the furriest Guardian was filmed
on set, played by Sean Gunn. Which casts the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.470
movie's sweeter moments in a whole new light.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.099
X-Men: Days of Future Past
Quicksilver's superspeed sequence was the

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.311
standout moment of this time-bending adventure,
but the reality was were very different. It

00:02:22.311 --> 00:02:25.800
looked great on film, which probably made
the days spent blasting the actor with an

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.739
air cannon in front of green screen seem worth
it in the end.

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.940
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
Mutant turtle martial artists could never

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.200
exist in the real world, but the animators
relied on the actor's real performances and

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.080
personalities, using their looks and mannerisms
to make each turtle unique.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.190
Pirates of the Caribbean
Jack Sparrow battled the supernatural in several

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.970
forms, but Davy Jones takes the cake. But
he and his crew are a lot less intimidating

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.720
in their grey bodysuits and smudged make-up.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.599
Planet of the Apes
Andy Serkis stole the show with help from

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.989
computer animators as the ape leader Caesar,
along with an entire cast of human performers

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.550
supplying the foundation for the CG artists
- no matter how different the species might

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.720
be.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.400
Twilight
Not every special effect in the Twlight series

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.180
was successful, but the massive werewolves
were pretty impressive. Until you realize

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.300
that Taylor Lautner played his wolf form on
set, letting his co-star lovingly stroke his

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.849
very-human head. Good luck forgetting that.

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.130
I, Robot
It's easy to overlook the people who create

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.780
CG characters - or even the people who&nbsp;play&nbsp;them.
Will Smith took the spotlight of I, Robot,

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.989
but audiences might not even realize that
Firefly alum Alan Tudyk played the star robot,

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.959
Sonny, on set every day.

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.730
The Empire Strikes Back
Darth Vader slicing off Luke Skywalker's hand

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.590
before revealing he's the boy's father is
one of cinema's greatest moments, but when

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.390
you see the mattresses laid out underneath
the set, it starts to seem a bit less devastating.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.450
Mad Max: Fury Road
George Miller may have delivered the most

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.470
gritty, practical action movie in years, but
fans never realized that most of the actual

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.540
setting was a CG creation. Forget the fact
that even the stunts were mostly pulled off

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.580
when the vehicles weren't moving.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.069
Avatar
Everything aside from the actors was make

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.180
believe in James Cameron's 3D game-changer,
but the motion capture footage reveals just

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.510
how much the Na'vi cast gave the animators
to work with - with Zoe Saldana the best among

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:09.569
them.

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.140
Captain America
It's still staggering to see how well the

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.590
effects team made star Chris Evans seem sickly
small before his super-soldier experiment.

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.780
Filming Evans in each scene, then his small-scale
double Leander Deeny, eventually merging the

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.320
two together. The process is simple enough,
but even today, it's hard to believe they

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.870
pulled it off so perfectly.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.150
