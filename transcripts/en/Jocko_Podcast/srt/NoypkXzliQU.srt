1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,170
Jocko, how do you give feedback to someone
without everyone taking it personal?

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,940
I try to give criticism regarding their
work or actions while not attacking

3
00:00:08,941 --> 00:00:13,680
their character, but unfortunately
many feel that it's personal.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,510
Yeah,
welcome to the world.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,360
People don't like crisen criticism and
I almost put a no one in the world like

6
00:00:26,181 --> 00:00:27,270
skepticism.
Okay,

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,330
so there might be 1e-05% of the world
that's really like open and ready for

8
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:37,380
feedback. Right? But most
people, even when they,

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,340
even when they tell you they want
feedback, they don't want it.

10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,360
They don't want it. Like, let me, let me
give an example. If you echo Charles, yes.

11
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,590
We're like you. You made a video and it
took you an hour. Don't even don't even,

12
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,320
right. You know what I'm saying? Like
you could come to me and say, Hey,

13
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:55,350
what do you think? And I was
like, well, you know, I think
you framed this up wrong.

14
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,300
How w what's your reaction to that?
I mean,

15
00:00:57,301 --> 00:01:01,650
there's no possible way that you're
stoked on that. They're just now, luckily,

16
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,080
you know, we know each other.
You can detach and be like,
all right, let me do. He's,

17
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:07,860
he doesn't, he's not pointing this
out to me for no reason, whatever.

18
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,250
But what I'm saying is even when you're
saying, Hey, what do you think of this?

19
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,770
And I criticize something
that you work so hard on,

20
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,000
there's no one in the world that's happy
about that even when they ask for it.

21
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,120
So you have to flank people.
That's what you have to do.

22
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:25,680
Now he's asking specifically, how do
you do this? So here's some things.

23
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,090
What one of the things that I do when
I want to give someone criticism,

24
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:31,080
I don't give them criticism.

25
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:35,010
What I do is I ask them
questions about whatever it is.

26
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,310
Now this is interesting. I'm not
even talking about pointed questions.

27
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:41,220
I'm not even talking about like hard
questions. I'm Tom. I'm not saying like,

28
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,050
why did you do that? Yeah, I'm talking
about, hey, why did you do it that way?

29
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:49,140
Like there's a big difference
between like, Hey, well
why did you do it that way?

30
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,310
I mean like instead of saying, Hey, echo,
that frame is, doesn't look good. Hey,

31
00:01:53,311 --> 00:01:55,710
why'd you frame that up like that?
Right?

32
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,680
So now I'm getting you to think about
it, right? But I'm not going to say, do,

33
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,810
how are you going to make that work? You
know, I'm going to say, well, hey dude,

34
00:02:04,811 --> 00:02:06,210
do you think are gonna be
able to make that work?

35
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:13,540
If you did something and it doesn't go
well, I'm not going to say, you know,

36
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,240
did you actually think that was a
good idea? Instead, I'm going to say,

37
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:21,940
I said again, it's not pointed
question. I'm going to say, well, hey,

38
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,030
did that unfold the way you
thought it was going to unfold?

39
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,830
And now you're going to get to answer
the question. Now you're going to be the,

40
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:33,330
you're going to be the person that
uncovers the fault. It's going to be you,

41
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:33,751
not me.

42
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:37,920
And that makes it so much more palatable
to everyone when they're able to say,

43
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,900
oh yeah, you know, I saw this over here.

44
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,260
And most of the time the
person knows the truth.

45
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,290
Most of the time the person knows
that that thing's not framed up right.

46
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,400
They know that their
idea wasn't that great.

47
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,930
So you don't need to punch him in the
face with it cause that's actually gonna

48
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,710
make them get defensive. So you flank
them, you ask them the questions,

49
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:57,090
you talk about it, you
discuss the subject. And what
you do is you guide them,

50
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,060
you guide them to a mirror,
you guide them to a mirror.

51
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,930
And then I think you just have a
look in that mirror. You set them up.

52
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:08,260
So they have to look in that mirror so
that they can see the problems themselves.

53
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:11,740
And once they see the problems themselves,
they can start to correct them.

54
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,310
Now sometimes you, sometimes
it's your ego that wants,

55
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:20,230
even once they see the problem themselves,

56
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,020
do people want them to take credit
for showing that? And it's late.

57
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,580
You gotta you gotta check your ego.

58
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,140
You got to make sure that
your ego isn't saying,

59
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:30,070
I want to prove to this person that I
know how to frame this up better than

60
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:33,340
you've got to put that all in check.
You got to just let,

61
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,980
you've got to let them have it.

62
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:42,130
So in it now, are there situations where
you can give really good frank feedback?

63
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:42,964
Yes there is,

64
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,180
but you have to have a good relationship
with that person or really good,

65
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,160
really good relationship with that person.

66
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,880
And then usually one of the best ways to,

67
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,700
to make this happen is that the feedback,

68
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,460
the negative feedback is going both ways.

69
00:03:57,461 --> 00:04:01,420
Meaning I want to get negative feedback
about my performance from that person so

70
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:05,950
that there's some equity in
what's being said amongst us.

71
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:10,030
Right. So I might be low, you
know, I might say, hey echo,

72
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:15,130
hey man, I, you know, I did this, uh,
I answered this core question on Qa.

73
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:17,200
Did you think that was a good
answer? Because I think, you know,

74
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,540
I think could've been better.
And then you say, yeah, you know,

75
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,280
you dragged on and talk
too long and whatever,

76
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:23,950
you give me some critique and then
I go, oh yeah, hey. And by the way,

77
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:25,900
the lighting on that didn't look good.
Right?

78
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:28,210
And so now we have a little mutual
criticism and it's all good.

79
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:30,910
It makes a little bit more palatable
to you cause I made the thing.

80
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,670
And so that's sometimes works.

81
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,700
But what's interesting
is even when you do that,

82
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:40,420
some people just don't even freaking care
and and they even after they just tear

83
00:04:40,421 --> 00:04:45,421
you apart and then you throw a little
little like little nick on their shoulder,

84
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,060
on their arm, you give him a little
nick about something that wasn't great,

85
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,980
they still get from [inaudible].
So you have to be really,

86
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,120
you have to have a really
great relationship with that
person to be able to have

87
00:04:58,121 --> 00:05:02,470
just that straight, straight
feedback. But build the relationships,

88
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,760
ask them questions,
let them find their own fault if you can,

89
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,190
and be their guide.
Let them to provide them to that mirror,

90
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,210
guide them to their faults.

91
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,440
Now of course there are some people
that won't even find their own faults,

92
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:22,600
no matter how you guide them into how
hard you try and twist them to look in the

93
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:23,080
mirror,

94
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,080
you have to let them know you actually
have to come out and say what's going on?

95
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,670
You have to be more direct. Now, luckily,

96
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:36,250
if a person is the type of person
that fails to see their own faults,

97
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,370
they begin to fail, right?
Because they're making mistakes.

98
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:42,310
That's why their faults, right? They're
making mistakes. And when they see that,

99
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,480
oh wait, when you see that and you
see that their project is failing,

100
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:48,340
or you see that there are people
are revolting against them,

101
00:05:48,341 --> 00:05:51,370
or you see that they're missing deadline
after deadline, they know that too.

102
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,390
And then what you're doing is you're
coming to them basically as like a

103
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:59,960
concerned friend that really
wants to help them win.

104
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,190
And,

105
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:06,190
and pointing out some of these obvious
failures that they might not be aware of

106
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:10,880
and you still gotta be gentle about this.
But when you come to them,

107
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:15,500
you can come to them as a friend, as a,
as a person that really wants them to win.

108
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:20,180
And you can come out out of there looking
like the good guy trying to help them

109
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:24,140
get there,
their self back on track.

110
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,990
So those are some of the,

111
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,310
some of the basic strategies that I
used to help people do a little course

112
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:35,540
correction if people need a little
criticism so that they can, uh,

113
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,570
improve their game for themselves,
for the team, et Cetera.

114
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:46,460
Very good,
tough businessman.

115
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,670
My input people are, people aren't,
people aren't people don't like criticism.

116
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,000
Yeah. Here to tell you.
Yeah. They like praise.

117
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:59,120
You know how, and you know the other
side of this coin, if you're a person,

118
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,490
which you are and you don't
like criticism, which you don't,

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,940
if you can open your mind
to the criticism man,

120
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:07,820
you're going to be so you're going to
get so much better about everything that

121
00:07:07,821 --> 00:07:08,390
you do.

122
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:13,220
If you can just listen to people without
getting ego crazy and thinking about

123
00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:17,930
this and just listen, just listen.

124
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:21,470
Nod your head, listen to what they have
to say. They're trying to help you. Right.

125
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:26,150
We assume that they're trying to help us.
Yeah. Well listen to, I know. Oh yeah.

126
00:07:26,151 --> 00:07:27,880
Are there times when they're
not? Absolutely. Yeah.

127
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,560
Cause you can go in with the assumption
that this person just tried to cut me

128
00:07:30,561 --> 00:07:32,650
down. Well then that's not going to
get you anywhere. Yeah. Or if you're,

129
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:33,740
if you make the assumption,
you know what,

130
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,400
I'm going to listen to what this person
has to say. What's wrong with that? Yeah.

131
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,360
Even if it's an assumption and
we're not supposed to assume,

132
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,500
if I assume you're getting a one,

133
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:42,200
I'm gonna assume that echoes giving me
criticism right now because he wants me

134
00:07:42,201 --> 00:07:47,201
to do better and I'm going to take
them as as face value as I can.

135
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,340
Yeah. That he is trying to
help me get better. Boom. Yeah.

136
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,640
And yeah,
that's actually really correct.

137
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:00,980
If you start at that point,
that's your default, right?
That, hey, this is to help.

138
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:05,570
Now I might look at your criticism and
I analyze it from a detached perspective

139
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:05,870
and I got,

140
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,960
I think actually echo is just trying to
drag me in the wrong direction because

141
00:08:08,961 --> 00:08:10,610
he's jealous and I might
get to that point. Yeah.

142
00:08:10,611 --> 00:08:13,040
And it'll be more way more obvious.
It'll be way more often.

143
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:16,020
If you started at that other place
where it's like, okay, it's here,

144
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,810
but if you're just default all,

145
00:08:17,811 --> 00:08:21,200
he just wants to try to look like he knows
a thing or he just wants to, you know,

146
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:24,800
make, if you start out at their place to
be, yeah. You can't even kind of discern,

147
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:29,190
you know, if that really is happening or
not, not the place to let the police do.
