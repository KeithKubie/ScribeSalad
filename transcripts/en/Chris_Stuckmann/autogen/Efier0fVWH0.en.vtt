rate matrix attempt to copy off the

00:06:59.559 --> 00:06:59.569
rate matrix attempt to copy off the
 

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:02.350
rate matrix attempt to copy off the
matrix that's another thing I want to

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360
matrix that's another thing I want to
 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.820
matrix that's another thing I want to
talk about because movie came out in the

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:03.830
talk about because movie came out in the
 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.499
talk about because movie came out in the
year 2000 it's very clear that

00:07:05.499 --> 00:07:05.509
year 2000 it's very clear that
 

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:07.540
year 2000 it's very clear that
filmmakers saw the matrix while making

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.550
filmmakers saw the matrix while making
 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.860
filmmakers saw the matrix while making
this movie and thought we need to rip

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:11.870
this movie and thought we need to rip
 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.309
this movie and thought we need to rip
that off because that's all we have I'll

00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:15.319
that off because that's all we have I'll
 

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:16.659
that off because that's all we have I'll
get to it more but there are so many

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:16.669
get to it more but there are so many
 

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:17.920
get to it more but there are so many
moments in this movie that just look

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:17.930
moments in this movie that just look
 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.179
moments in this movie that just look
like they're tell me to copy off the

00:07:19.179 --> 00:07:19.189
like they're tell me to copy off the
 

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:21.159
like they're tell me to copy off the
matrix especially with a slow motion but

00:07:21.159 --> 00:07:21.169
matrix especially with a slow motion but
 

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:22.719
matrix especially with a slow motion but
the problem is the slow motion is so

00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:22.729
the problem is the slow motion is so
 

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:24.459
the problem is the slow motion is so
poorly done you can tell the not every

00:07:24.459 --> 00:07:24.469
poorly done you can tell the not every
 

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:26.529
poorly done you can tell the not every
scene it's in slow motion was meant to

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:26.539
scene it's in slow motion was meant to
 

00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:28.119
scene it's in slow motion was meant to
be in slow motion when they filmed it

00:07:28.119 --> 00:07:28.129
be in slow motion when they filmed it
 

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:29.740
be in slow motion when they filmed it
because they're not filming it at a

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:29.750
because they're not filming it at a
 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.659
because they're not filming it at a
frame rate that makes slow motion look

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:31.669
frame rate that makes slow motion look
 

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:33.610
frame rate that makes slow motion look
good they're filming it at a normal

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:33.620
good they're filming it at a normal
 

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.439
good they're filming it at a normal
frame rate and then in post trying to

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:35.449
frame rate and then in post trying to
 

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:37.089
frame rate and then in post trying to
slow it down except it looks like

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:37.099
slow it down except it looks like
 

00:07:37.099 --> 00:07:39.010
slow it down except it looks like
garbage because it wasn't filmed at a

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:39.020
garbage because it wasn't filmed at a
 

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.899
garbage because it wasn't filmed at a
frame rate that actually supports slow

00:07:40.899 --> 00:07:40.909
frame rate that actually supports slow
 

00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:42.519
frame rate that actually supports slow
motion so you can actually tell that

00:07:42.519 --> 00:07:42.529
motion so you can actually tell that
 

00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:44.499
motion so you can actually tell that
it's like they were watching the matrix

00:07:44.499 --> 00:07:44.509
it's like they were watching the matrix
 

00:07:44.509 --> 00:07:46.179
it's like they were watching the matrix
while filming Battlefield Earth and

00:07:46.179 --> 00:07:46.189

big thing this is what we need to do and
 

00:07:50.149 --> 00:07:52.059
big thing this is what we need to do and
so they slow mode like everything but it

00:07:52.059 --> 00:07:52.069
so they slow mode like everything but it
 

00:07:52.069 --> 00:07:53.829
