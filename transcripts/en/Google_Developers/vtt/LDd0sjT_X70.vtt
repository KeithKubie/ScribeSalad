[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.222 --> 00:00:07.430
LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome
to "Coffee with a Googler."

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.138
In this episode, I'm
going to be chatting

00:00:09.138 --> 00:00:11.714
with Justin Quimby who's a
PM on the Tango platform.

00:00:11.714 --> 00:00:13.130
If you're not
familiar with Tango,

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.930
it's all about
augmented reality.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.230
And this guy gets to work
with the partners that

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.360
are building really cool, crazy
augmented reality concepts,

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.820
and he's going to come
tell us all about them.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.620
So Justin, you're a Product
Manager here at Google

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.510
working on Tango.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.940
Can you tell us all about it,
and tell us about yourself?

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.824
JUSTIN QUIMBY: I actually joined
the team about a year ago.

00:00:31.824 --> 00:00:33.490
And it's been really
exciting, because I

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.615
worked in the video game
[INAUDIBLE] prior to that.

00:00:35.615 --> 00:00:38.319
I spent 15 years, actually,
making video games.

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:40.860
I worked on Dungeons and Dragons
online and Lord of the Rings

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.735
online at Turbine
back in Boston.

00:00:42.735 --> 00:00:44.725
LAURENCE MORONEY:
I'm not worthy.

00:00:44.725 --> 00:00:46.350
JUSTIN QUIMBY: And
then on top of that,

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.099
actually what brought
me out to California

00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:53.550
was to work at Electronic Arts
on Spore with Will Wright.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.170
Then I did a whole series of
small start-ups, many of them

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.150
buzz worthy wordy and
mobile social HTML 5

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.190
free-to-play games.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.230
But for me, after doing
games for both PC and then

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.560
mobile titles, I
started looking around.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.310
And I said, well, what's next?

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.640
And I started looking at VR.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.700
And I've been a huge fan
of VR ever since the 80s.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.970
And I started thinking
about, well, VR is great.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.780
What about augmented reality.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.830
I had seen little
snippets of what

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.200
Johnny Lee had been working
on in the game development

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.010
community.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.070
And I said, all right,
I want to go work

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.190
at Google with Johnny Lee and
work on the team for Tango.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.680
And so that's led me here
today to be Senior Product

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.450
Manager working
on Tango, helping

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.120
build the third party
developer ecosystem

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.892
for the Tango platform and
Google's larger AR platform.

00:01:44.892 --> 00:01:45.850
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.239
So what's involved in building
the partner ecosystem?

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:49.530
JUSTIN QUIMBY: It's really fun.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.560
You get to go out and
talk to a lot of people.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.590
But part of it is
about explaining

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.350
what is augmented
reality and what is

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.080
smartphone augmented reality.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.770
And also, I get to have the
fun job of telling people, hey,

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.420
it's not just a
theoretical lab project.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.850
It's actually shipping.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.180
So we've got the
Lenovo Phab 2 Pro,

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.060
which is the first Tango-enabled
smartphone, shipping this year.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.600
And it's the first
of many phones

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.766
that are going to be coming
out with the technology.

00:02:14.766 --> 00:02:17.150
And so it's a really
exciting opportunity

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.080
for developers to start
creating apps and games that

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.650
take advantage of all the
additional capabilities

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.250
that Tango brings
to a smartphone.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.790
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And I think it's

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.740
interesting from the
developer perspective,

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.660
because not everybody
has these phones yet.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.760
But if you start
building now, then you

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.515
can get to define the category.

00:02:34.515 --> 00:02:35.890
And when I think
about it, you're

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.402
right, because when App stores
and Play stores first came out,

00:02:39.402 --> 00:02:40.610
there weren't that many apps.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.086
And the first app
that did photo filters

00:02:44.086 --> 00:02:45.960
to enhance your photos--
that kind of thing--

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.200
that got to define a
category, that got to be huge.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.100
And so for developers
now, it's almost like,

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.510
don't blink, or you might
miss the opportunity.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.468
JUSTIN QUIMBY: And the
other thing that's great

00:02:54.468 --> 00:02:58.090
is that there is a burgeoning
set of tools with Unity

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.670
and Unreal and other 3D
engines to enable developers

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.090
to create 3D applications for
Tango-enabled smartphones very,

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.934
very easily.

00:03:08.934 --> 00:03:11.100
So you don't have to build
your own graphics engine.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.183
You don't have to build
your own particle systems.

00:03:13.183 --> 00:03:15.530
You don't have to
build X, Y, and Z.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.350
Think about all the logging
in metric systems, all

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.580
the analytics tools
that we have today.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.210
Those didn't really
exist in a mature form

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.610
when Android first
came on the scene.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.050
And so developers,
at that point,

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.470
were really throwing darts,
trying to figure out what

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.880
features people liked,
what they didn't.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.740
Whereas today,
you can study that

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.580
on day one with their
well-established beta channel

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.260
systems-- all those
mechanisms and tools

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.000
to help build great apps.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.580
And it really is
up to developers.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.650
And here's a present.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.030
Here's a present, developers,
of knowing where your device is

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.740
as it moves through space
and time and the ability

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.170
to put digital objects
in the real world

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.260
and pin them to
the physical world.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.600
What could you do with that?

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.770
Is that putting a miniature
wrestler on the table

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.060
and having him wrestle?

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.990
LAURENCE MORONEY: Has
somebody done that?

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.610
JUSTIN QUIMBY: Oh, yes.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.150
We, in fact, have
a developer, Adi,

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.800
that's making an app Holo,
which is all about taking

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.020
augmented reality photos.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.930
It's all about
taking hollow photos.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.660
Think about the holochess
from "Star Wars"

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.370
where suddenly there's
a table that has

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.870
all these things moving around.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.100
We can start doing that kind
of stuff with Tango today.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.730
The field is wide
open for developers.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:29.950
What is their idea?

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.900
And with Unity Unreal,
it is very quick

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.987
to take an idea from a pure
idea to a working prototype.

00:04:37.987 --> 00:04:39.570
LAURENCE MORONEY:
You must have worked

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.437
with some really cool and
fun and crazy scenarios.

00:04:42.437 --> 00:04:43.520
Can you share any of them?

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.520
JUSTIN QUIMBY: Oh, yeah.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.100
So I think part
of the fun is when

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.340
you can put digital
objects in the real world.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:57.270
Suddenly that means, well, if
I want to take a photo of you--

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.460
you're having a photo here.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.220
That's great.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.990
But what if I can
insert-- suddenly

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.080
I've got 15 little wrestlers
from various sizes,

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.496
all posing behind you.

00:05:06.496 --> 00:05:08.370
Augmented reality means
that not only can you

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.380
insert digital objects
into the real world,

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.180
but you can also replace
objects from the real world

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.420
with digital ones.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.970
So suddenly you could put a
artificial green screen here.

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.050
And so you and I, as opposed
to having coffee here,

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.980
we might be having coffee
at this table on a beach.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:25.980
That sounds pretty good.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.600
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Can we do that?

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.980
Maybe not coffee if
we're on the beach.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.313
JUSTIN QUIMBY: Yes, that's true.

00:05:30.313 --> 00:05:31.350
Margaritas on the beach.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.000
We need to get new mugs, though.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.570
When you have
developers thinking

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.010
about what kind of
crazy stuff could they

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.730
bring from the digital
world into the real world,

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.930
you start thinking about,
well, a picture frame

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.840
doesn't actually have to have
real world information in it.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.280
Now suddenly this picture frame
could have my rolling Twitter

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:50.780
stream.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.940
One of the great
uses-- and I admit

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.340
now, my bias coming from
the games industry--

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.670
is that third person,
God-style interaction

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.500
games are great with Tango,
because you can place

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.710
a digital world on a tabletop
and suddenly interact with it

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.220
in an entirely
different fashion,

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.040
because you're not
constrained to a flat screen.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.970
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
a small flat screen.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:12.810
JUSTIN QUIMBY: And
a small [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.690
Now this becomes
your magic window

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.440
into this digital world
projected into the real one.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.450
And so suddenly now this
could be a cityscape.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:25.034
I could be putting down hundreds
and hundreds of dominoes.

00:06:25.034 --> 00:06:26.450
And I don't know
about you, when I

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.120
was playing with dominoes
when I was a kid,

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.661
there was always a
very small number.

00:06:29.661 --> 00:06:31.020
And we could never have enough.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.520
Now suddenly there's an
unlimited number of dominoes

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.280
you could place.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.840
We've got a developer working
with Mattel on a Hot Wheels

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:37.620
game.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.380
And yeah, it's really cool.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.400
So you can actually
lay out digital track

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.640
and then put your different
cars-- tweak and tune

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.380
your cars-- and have them
racing around the tracks, which

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.890
is something as a kid, I always
had my one little Hot Wheels

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.090
car.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.649
And I tried to
make tracks for it.

00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:55.690
And occasionally my dad--

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:56.490
LAURENCE MORONEY: There
was never enough track.

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:57.580
JUSTIN QUIMBY: It was
never enough track.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.040
My dad would step on the
car and break the axle.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.280
Maybe my dog would knock
over the little ramp

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.910
I'd built out of wooden blocks.

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:07.570
Now suddenly you can do all
of that with digital building

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:08.320
blocks.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.170
LAURENCE MORONEY: And then you
look through this little window

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:11.890
into your augmented
world of Hot Wheels.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:12.650
JUSTIN QUIMBY: Yeah, exactly.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:13.816
LAURENCE MORONEY: Very cool.

00:07:13.816 --> 00:07:15.610
So if I'm to get
started with all this,

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:17.170
what's the best way to
get started for you?

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.794
JUSTIN QUIMBY: The
fastest way is to go

00:07:18.794 --> 00:07:20.902
to developers.google.com/Tango
and there's--

00:07:20.902 --> 00:07:22.360
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Easy to remember.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.390
JUSTIN QUIMBY: Yeah,
easy to remember.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:25.190
And there's all
sorts of information

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.070
there, whether you are a
Unity or Unreal developer

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.570
and you're familiar
with those platforms,

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.940
or even if you're just a
standard Android developer

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.320
and you know Java,
we've got Java SDK.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.910
You can get up and running
in less than a day.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:39.820
We've got tons of
sample applications.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.920
We've got sample code on GitHub.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.100
We've got active
developer forums.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:48.000
And we're really excited to have
new folks come to the platform

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.240
and show us what's
possible, because that's

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.040
one of the things that's
fantastic is that someone

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.430
working on an idea,
in a day or two

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:59.910
can actually turn that
idea-- that can be

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:02.009
the seed of a massive business.

00:08:02.009 --> 00:08:04.300
LAURENCE MORONEY: There's a
whole new set of categories

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.210
out there that we
haven't discovered yet.

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:07.834
JUSTIN QUIMBY: And
it's really exciting

00:08:07.834 --> 00:08:10.420
because developers each have
a different set of problems

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.580
that they personally
experience, their families,

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.370
their communities.

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:18.220
We don't know every problem
that will be solved by Tango.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.840
But we believe, and
I strongly believe,

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:25.560
that it is an amazing technology
to help take your smartphone

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.120
to be a next
generation smartphone.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:32.680
And then what are all the
crazy and awesome applications

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.429
that developers are
going to come up with,

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:35.763
utilizing this technology stack?

00:08:35.763 --> 00:08:37.595
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
if the Tango smartphone

00:08:37.595 --> 00:08:39.030
is the next
generation smartphone,

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:40.390
there's a great
opportunity for us

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:41.700
to be next generation
developers.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:42.409
JUSTIN QUIMBY: Yeah, exactly.

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:43.659
LAURENCE MORONEY: Thanks
so much for coming.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:45.492
JUSTIN QUIMBY: Thanks
so much for having me.

00:08:45.492 --> 00:08:46.610
It's been a ton of fun.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:47.380
LAURENCE MORONEY: Appreciate it.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.740
