00:00:00.119 --> 00:00:04.228
Student Kevin Troy asks, weÃ¢Â€Â™ve seen in this unit

00:00:04.228 --> 00:00:06.386
the use of import time to get access to time the

00:00:06.386 --> 00:00:09.621
clock. Can you talk about the basics of libraries,

00:00:09.621 --> 00:00:11.188
what they are and how they work et cetera?

00:00:11.188 --> 00:00:13.121
Okay, this is good because I donÃ¢Â€Â™t think I

00:00:13.121 --> 00:00:15.549
explained really whatÃ¢Â€Â™s going on when I use that.

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.130
What import does is just bring a library into your

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.242
execution environment, so you can have a

00:00:22.242 --> 00:00:25.043
library that defines different variables, defines

00:00:25.043 --> 00:00:27.376
functions, defines anything that you would define

00:00:27.376 --> 00:00:29.459
in your own Python code and then when you

00:00:29.459 --> 00:00:32.168
import it you get access to all of that but itÃ¢Â€Â™s not

00:00:32.168 --> 00:00:34.366
in your own file. And having libraries is really

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.710
useful. It limits the size of the file that you have

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.009
to deal with, it protects the name space, so if

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:40.682
everything that was defined as part of the

00:00:40.682 --> 00:00:43.210
standard library was always available and you

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.108
didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have to import it, there would be name,

00:00:45.108 --> 00:00:47.435
more names that you have to worry about using

00:00:47.435 --> 00:00:48.765
because they already have some other

00:00:48.765 --> 00:00:50.281
predefined meaning.

00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:52.331
So libraries are really useful. You can make your

00:00:52.331 --> 00:00:54.978
own libraries, weÃ¢Â€Â™re not going to cover that and IÃ¢Â€Â™ll

00:00:54.978 --> 00:00:57.050
see as one-on-one but as you start to build bigger

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.267
programs itÃ¢Â€Â™s really important to think about how

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:01.796
do you structure your program, so you donÃ¢Â€Â™t end

00:01:01.796 --> 00:01:03.936
up with one huge file with lots of code that no one

00:01:03.936 --> 00:01:06.249
can figure out whatÃ¢Â€Â™s going on. So libraries are

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:08.135
very useful way to do that.
