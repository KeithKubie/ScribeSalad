00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.210
After they land a role in a movie, actors
always look for anything they can do to ensure

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.360
they deliver the best performance they can.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.680
Whether it’s physical training, getting
lost in a character’s psyche, or studying

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.710
up on history, there are several methods they
turn to.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.680
But sometimes, it’s as simple as getting
a drink or two.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.040
Some of Hollywood’s biggest films feature
sequences that involve intoxicated thespians.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.800
Here are 10 actors who got drunk to film their
scenes.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.949
Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:37.140
In one of the most talked-about sequences
in 2010, Portman and Kunis did a love scene

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.440
together in the awards contender, Black Swan.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.559
It was new territory for the two actresses,
and they needed a little liquid courage before

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:44.559
filming.

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.050
Director Darren Aronofsky has said that his
stars shared a bottle of tequila to calm their

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.050
nerves.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.530
Kunis has denied this claim, but others on-set
have confirmed alcohol was involved.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.519
In the end, Portman won an Oscar for her performance,
and Kunis received much acclaim, so it seems

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:58.730
like it was worth it.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:00:59.730
Robert Shaw

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.030
Shark hunter Quint is perhaps the most memorable
character in Jaws thanks to his eccentric

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.510
personality and one fantastic monologue he
delivers while on board the Orca.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.840
Quint tells Brody and Hooper the story of
the U.S.S.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:21.190
Indianapolis and the horrifying shark attack
the crew endured.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.070
Shaw thought it would be for the best to shoot
the scene drunk, since it called for the characters

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.210
to be drinking at night.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:33.680
However, he was too inebriated and as a result,
nothing could be used from the takes.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.859
Regretting what transpired, Shaw asked Steven
Spielberg for another try later that night,

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:41.909
and delivered the speech as seen in the film.

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:42.909
Julie Andrews

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.170
Somewhat surprisingly, Andrews admitted that
she was drunk while performing the “Do-Re-Mi”

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.539
sequence in The Sound of Music.

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:51.549
The farmer that owned the land near where
they were filming brewed his own schnapps

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.009
in a barn, which Andrews would frequent when
she practiced her guitar.

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.070
She kept taking shots as the day went on,
and by the time it was ready to film, Andrews

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.450
was fairly hammered.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.689
Not only does this add a whole new layer to
a famous song, it also illustrates the actress’

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.530
supreme talent at her craft.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.700
Watching it, nobody can tell what’s going
on.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.540
Brad Pitt and Edward Norton

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.560
Some off set drinking led to a famous bit
in Fight Club.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.170
During their downtime, Pitt and Norton got
a little drunk and started hitting golf balls

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.420
in an attempt to whack the catering truck.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.760
Director David Fincher began filming them
and gave the two actors some lines to create

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.210
a whole new scene for the movie.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.370
The result was a humorous moment that highlighted
the pair’s chemistry and the character’s

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.830
growing friendship.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.290
It wouldn’t be surprising if alcohol was
used to capture some more of this drama’s

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.130
best scenes, but this is the only reported
instance.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.130
Johnny Depp

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.080
Depp returned to the world of Hunter S. Thompson
in The Rum Diary, and aptly made sure he had

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.230
plenty of alcohol to do the job right.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.050
While filming the movie, Depp and his director
Bruce Robinson kept a bottle of Chivas Regal

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.130
close by.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.740
Apparently, Depp liked to treat himself to
the drink rather liberally, which resulted

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.600
in him being drunk for portions of the finished
product.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.270
Though critics and audiences didn’t take
too kindly to Rum Diary, the consensus was

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.360
that Depp’s performance was typically great,
so it’s safe to say the actor tried his

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.010
best.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.450
Billy Bob Thornton

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.590
Not your usual Christmas movie, Bad Santa
earned itself a passionate following due to

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.280
its extremely vulgar content.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.480
The star of the madness is Thornton as an
alcoholic department store Santa, who clearly

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.660
is not the right fit for the job.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.590
It shouldn’t come as a shock then, that
Thornton has admitted he frequently got drunk

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.210
during principal photography in an attempt
to better portray the character.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.160
His methods worked, and Bad Santa went on
to become a rude and crude holiday classic.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.180
With a sequel on the horizon, it’ll be interesting
to see if Thornton gets hammered for Santa

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.180
again.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.180
Shia LaBeaouf

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.040
The drama Lawless is set during the Prohibition
era and focuses on three brothers running

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.340
a bootlegging business, so alcohol played
a heavy role in the narrative.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.840
It was also a major tool for star Shia LaBeaouf,
who got drunk off of moonshine every day to

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.260
get into character.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.480
Unfortunately, he got very intoxicated, and
his behavior upset his co-stars.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.320
Mia Wasikowska took greatest offense, trying
to quit the movie due to her discomfort.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.340
Maybe someone should have stepped in and told
Shia that there are other ways to act drunk

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.050
than to actually be plastered.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.930
Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.930
Super Mario Bros. is widely considered as
one of the worst films ever made.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.930
That’s an opinion not lost on its two stars,
who quickly realized that the quality was

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.450
not up to par when they were filming.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:30.280
In an effort to make their job more fun, Hoskins
and Leguizamo would drink scotch between takes

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.480
and did some scenes drunk.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.720
One in particular caused harm to Hoskins.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.520
While driving a van, Leguizamo broke too hard
and slammed the door on his co-star’s hand.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.080
As a result, Hoskins had to wear a cast for
portions of production, which is visible in

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.080
the film.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.080
Martin Sheen

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.350
The troubled production of Apocalypse Now
is well documented, and just reading about

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.520
it can stress somebody out.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.210
For the people working on it, it was all kinds
of hell and lead to heavy amounts of drinking.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.810
Star Sheen took part in this, most famously
for the opening scene in the hotel room.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.120
He got drunk right before filming and told
Francis Ford Copolla to roll the cameras.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.620
Sheen’s performance here set the tone for
an intense ride, as he punched a mirror, started

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.940
weeping, and almost attacked Copolla off-camera.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.940
It’s tough to watch at times, but there’s
no denying it’s a great moment.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:16.940
Margot Robbie

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.860
Robbie’s big breakthrough came as Naomi,
Jordan Belfort’s wife in The Wolf of Wall

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:21.860
Street.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.970
The film is a celebration of excess, and features
a ton of explicit content – including numerous

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.030
sex scenes.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.870
Robbie is in a few of these herself, and she
was nervous to bare it all on camera to film

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:31.950
with Leonardo DiCaprio.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.970
To calm herself down, Robbie said she took
three shots of tequila before shooting the

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:36.970
first one.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.720
It definitely paid off, as the actress stole
the show and became a household name.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.420
The chemistry between her and Leo was electric
and made Wolf stand out.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.330
Those are our picks for actors that got drunk
before filming their scenes.
