00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.400
Today's scholars
have unique visions

00:00:15.401 --> 00:00:16.480
for their careers.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.440
Cheryl Knott pursues balance

00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:21.280
between her work as a professor

00:00:21.281 --> 00:00:23.080
and her child care needs.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.040
Rising scholars seek meaningful
mentoring experiences

00:00:28.041 --> 00:00:29.440
throughout their careers.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.680
Sangeeta Bathia and Jagesh Shah

00:00:33.681 --> 00:00:35.840
are a dual-career academic couple

00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:38.360
who both want fulfilling careers.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.240
In response to the needs
of today's scholars,

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.400
higher education is
changing to recruit,

00:00:45.401 --> 00:00:48.560
retain and develop top talent.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.560
Cheryl: All right.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.400
And think about--we're talking
about allometric scalling...

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.280
Cheryl Knott received
her PhD from Harvard

00:01:05.281 --> 00:01:09.200
and is an accomplished
researcher in biological anthropology.

00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:10.720
Cheryl: I work in a research
station in Borneo

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.400
and when I first came,

00:01:12.401 --> 00:01:14.880
I was interested in
studying actually human reproduction,

00:01:14.881 --> 00:01:17.720
looking into traditional
human populations

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.960
but then I decided that--

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.760
there's a really interesting
question about what was going on

00:01:22.761 --> 00:01:24.000
with reproduction in great apes

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:27.040
and I wanted to see if some of
the things that we were finding,

00:01:27.041 --> 00:01:30.400
my adviser was finding out in
humans if those applied to great apes.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.320
Cheryl is also married
and has two children.

00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:36.480
So my husband, Tim Laman,

00:01:36.481 --> 00:01:38.200
he is a photographer

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.120
and he primarily works for
National Geographic Magazine.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.680
And he and I actually met
here in graduate school,

00:01:43.681 --> 00:01:47.400
so he got his PhD in the
biology department, in OEB,

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.520
and we worked together
in the rain forest.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.800
And he travels quite
a bit in a year,

00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:56.040
about four to six months out of
the year I'd say he's gone.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.640
Jessica: Why do I have two forks,
Daddy? I don't need two forks.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.080
Tim: Oops, somehow we got you
two forks. Sorry about that.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.320
So can you pick up Jessica,
or what time does sheâ€¦

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.000
Cheryl: Oh, she--no, she
gets out today at 6:00.

00:02:11.201 --> 00:02:13.120
Cheryl: 6:00. So I'll pick her up.

00:02:13.201 --> 00:02:15.960
The schedule really is arranged

00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:18.320
for when he is gone
because when he's home

00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:19.640
we have more flexibility.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.480
I have to adjust my schedule

00:02:22.481 --> 00:02:25.000
and like my teaching for example

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.240
so that on certain days I have to
leave earlier to pick them up.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.640
Cheryl has responsibilities beyond
research and publishing.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.800
She teaches and advises graduate
and undergraduate students

00:02:58.801 --> 00:03:03.200
and runs a research project and
a conservation project in Indonesia

00:03:03.201 --> 00:03:05.560
and a REXO lab on campus.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.720
This work takes up
considerable time

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:11.200
and she's concerned about
the number of women

00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:14.440
with families that failed to
reach the tenured ranks.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.520
Cheryl says that about
75% of the men

00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:22.320
from her graduate program have
gone on to tenure track positions

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.800
compared with just
25% of the women.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.960
Which is pretty surprising, really.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.840
You know, they're just some of the
best graduate students in our area,

00:03:30.841 --> 00:03:32.640
and the country; and yet,

00:03:32.641 --> 00:03:35.080
the women really aren't going
into tenured track jobs.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.400
And you know, why is that?

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.320
It's kind of troubling.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.520
Cheryl strives to make
an impact in her field

00:03:43.521 --> 00:03:45.640
and be an excellent parent.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.400
But she wonders
if this is possible.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.160
If you have kids--

00:03:50.161 --> 00:03:51.800
presumably because you
want to have children,

00:03:51.801 --> 00:03:53.240
and so you want to
spend time with them

00:03:53.241 --> 00:03:55.160
so it's not just about finding

00:03:55.161 --> 00:03:56.880
other people who would
help to care of them,

00:03:56.881 --> 00:03:58.080
and that's part of it,

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.160
but you want to take
care of them yourself as well.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.960
Cheryl may need to leave
Harvard to get tenure.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.640
She'll also have to
consider child care,

00:04:07.641 --> 00:04:10.360
school districts, her
husband's career,

00:04:10.361 --> 00:04:14.240
and balancing work and family
before making any decisions.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.520
and how much work can get
done in a certain amount of time

00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:20.840
and you know,

00:04:20.841 --> 00:04:24.200
it's in the pressure that you're
under to be able to do it all.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.120
I think a lot of junior faculty are
sort of high-achieving people.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.960
And that I think a lot of us also
have high standards for ourselves

00:04:33.961 --> 00:04:35.640
as mothers or as parents;

00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:37.960
it's challenging then to
be the kind of mother

00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:39.560
as well as the kind of
professor you want to be.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.600
I mean something has to change.

00:04:41.601 --> 00:04:43.000
We have to make
some accommodations

00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:44.240
in order to

00:04:44.241 --> 00:04:48.960
make it possible to be a mother
and be on the faculty.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.280
More and more university
administrators

00:04:53.281 --> 00:04:55.680
are hearing that child
care arrangements

00:04:55.681 --> 00:04:58.800
are make or break policies
for young academics.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.840
Work life issues in general
and child care in particular

00:05:01.841 --> 00:05:04.600
is a key driver for
employee engagement

00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:06.280
in major workplaces.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.760
We also know that among faculty,

00:05:08.761 --> 00:05:10.040
many of them have--

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.800
and more women than men
have cited child care difficulties

00:05:13.801 --> 00:05:16.120
and other dependent care problems

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.160
as impeding their progress

00:05:19.161 --> 00:05:20.680
through the tenure track.

00:05:20.681 --> 00:05:22.960
And many of them have
strongly considered

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.920
leaving Harvard to go elsewhere,

00:05:25.921 --> 00:05:29.040
either to another institution
or into private industry.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.920
Cheryl says that she's
never seen a woman

00:05:31.921 --> 00:05:36.560
with more than one young child
granted tenure in her department.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.320
Diversity is not just having women

00:05:38.321 --> 00:05:41.160
but having mothers, and mothers
of more than one child.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.240
So is that possible?

00:05:44.241 --> 00:05:46.200
Can you even be a junior faculty

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.240
and have couple of kids and then
get tenure, is that possible?

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.240
Situations like Cheryl Knott's
are increasingly common.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.680
Higher education leaders continue
to explore innovative benefits

00:05:58.681 --> 00:06:00.960
to assist faculty with children

00:06:00.961 --> 00:06:03.200
such as child care scholarships,

00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:07.400
research-enabling grants, and
professional travel funds.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.640
Mentoring is something
very conscious,

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.520
recognizing that when
you become engaged

00:06:44.521 --> 00:06:47.600
with someone--involved with
someone as a teacher

00:06:47.601 --> 00:06:50.480
and adviser, you've
got a responsibility.

00:06:50.481 --> 00:06:56.080
And your responsibility is more than
just the dates and the requirements.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.400
You want to bring out in
someone who they are,

00:06:59.401 --> 00:07:01.760
how they work, and
what they can do best.

00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:05.400
To have a senior colleague
ask you how you're doing

00:07:05.401 --> 00:07:07.040
and actually mean it and
wait to hear the answer,

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.520
is a kind of profound
act of mentorship.

00:07:09.521 --> 00:07:11.080
I think that goes
underappreciated.

00:07:11.081 --> 00:07:13.680
So much of this was done
informally for so long,

00:07:13.681 --> 00:07:16.880
and so much of it was done between
people who had similar backgrounds

00:07:16.881 --> 00:07:18.320
and similar experiences

00:07:18.321 --> 00:07:22.560
so if we think about the US
academy 75 years ago

00:07:22.561 --> 00:07:26.640
or something, it was colleagues
junior and senior were probably

00:07:26.641 --> 00:07:28.200
mend from similar backgrounds,

00:07:28.201 --> 00:07:31.400
had similar networks, went to similar
schools and these sorts of things.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.520
And now you have a situation
where that's no longer the case.

00:07:34.521 --> 00:07:36.160
And I think it makes people

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.360
have to actively think about
mentorship in a different way.

00:07:40.361 --> 00:07:42.640
It means that you have to somehow

00:07:42.641 --> 00:07:45.000
find out who these people are.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.400
Not making the assumption

00:07:47.401 --> 00:07:50.360
that you want to turn them into
a mirror image of yourself,

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.280
a carbon copy, a clone;

00:07:52.281 --> 00:07:55.400
instead, you want to see
how they can be themselves

00:07:55.401 --> 00:07:58.320
in an effective manner.

00:07:58.321 --> 00:07:59.800
How do you even
talk to a professor

00:07:59.801 --> 00:08:01.280
when you try to make a meeting?

00:08:01.281 --> 00:08:02.680
Is the best way to
approach a professor

00:08:02.681 --> 00:08:05.200
to talk about your interests

00:08:05.201 --> 00:08:07.080
and what you want to do with them,

00:08:07.081 --> 00:08:09.040
or is it best to talk about

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.320
what you think their interest is

00:08:11.321 --> 00:08:12.960
based on what their
research areas are;

00:08:12.961 --> 00:08:14.520
and how do you bridge
the difference?

00:08:14.521 --> 00:08:16.200
I have often felt

00:08:16.201 --> 00:08:18.520
that I didn't know
what I could ask for.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.600
For example, I mean I might
be someone who is

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.280
somewhat diffident in that way,

00:08:26.281 --> 00:08:28.920
in the sense that I
have felt awkward

00:08:28.921 --> 00:08:31.600
even asking senior men in my field

00:08:31.601 --> 00:08:33.480
for letters of recommendation

00:08:33.481 --> 00:08:36.040
when I haven't personally
written a paper with them.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.240
And you know, this is something
that comes seamlessly

00:08:39.241 --> 00:08:40.680
to most other people;

00:08:40.681 --> 00:08:42.520
I have found that difficult.

00:08:42.521 --> 00:08:46.200
I know that a lot of my female
colleagues find the same.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.640
And it is true that
for a lot of the men,

00:08:51.641 --> 00:08:54.000
young male colleagues,
my contemporaries,

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:58.600
mentoring appears to
happen more seamlessly.

00:08:58.601 --> 00:09:02.840
They don't seem to have to ask
for it quite in the same ways.

00:09:02.841 --> 00:09:05.480
And I don't know why that is.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.400
Perhaps the low point of my
being a junior faculty was

00:09:09.401 --> 00:09:11.920
that I had worked
hard for months,

00:09:11.921 --> 00:09:14.800
many months, to get
that first big grant.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.640
And after a long
and hard struggle,

00:09:17.641 --> 00:09:20.880
I did get that first big
grant and I was elated.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.360
And after I found out,
a few hours later

00:09:23.361 --> 00:09:25.200
I got a call from my
chairman to come in.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.160
And I thought he was going to pat
me on the back for my good work.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.680
Instead he said, "Richard, it's
great that you got this grant

00:09:31.681 --> 00:09:33.880
but you know, this grant
doesn't pay much overhead.

00:09:33.881 --> 00:09:35.480
It really doesn't help
the department.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.160
You need to get grants that provide
a lot of overhead to be successful."

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.240
It was the worst day I
had as a faculty member.

00:09:42.241 --> 00:09:47.560
Mentoring is
important for students,

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.000
for younger faculty,

00:09:50.001 --> 00:09:51.120
younger colleagues

00:09:51.121 --> 00:09:54.840
at the point in which they're
undergoing a change.

00:09:54.841 --> 00:09:57.200
They have to recognize
that they are no longer

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.400
the recipients alone
of new knowledge,

00:10:01.401 --> 00:10:05.400
but that they are now also
sharing it and imparting it.

00:10:05.401 --> 00:10:07.560
And it's at that point

00:10:07.561 --> 00:10:10.920
that people's outlook and
attitudes are uncertain.

00:10:10.921 --> 00:10:12.760
And I think it's at that point

00:10:12.761 --> 00:10:15.520
that young colleagues
really need help

00:10:15.521 --> 00:10:18.520
as they move now to
the front of a lecture hall,

00:10:18.521 --> 00:10:22.440
as they figure out how to take
part in department meetings

00:10:22.441 --> 00:10:23.800
and bring new ideas forward.

00:10:23.801 --> 00:10:25.520
As a graduate student

00:10:25.521 --> 00:10:30.000
I aspired to be a top scientist

00:10:30.001 --> 00:10:32.240
in a major research intuition.

00:10:32.241 --> 00:10:35.840
I left the academy
for a variety of reasons,

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.040
the first of which is that
I felt I wasn't being

00:10:40.041 --> 00:10:43.240
intellectually challenged
any longer.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.120
I felt like a very
well-trained pair of hands

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.600
and really want to not
work from the neck down

00:10:50.601 --> 00:10:52.080
but from the neck up

00:10:52.081 --> 00:10:55.840
and use the training that I've
been given as a scientist-

00:10:55.841 --> 00:11:00.000
the ability to think critically and
analytically, solve problems...

00:11:00.001 --> 00:11:01.560
How do you do mentoring?

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.720
Well, you do it formally
and informally.

00:11:03.721 --> 00:11:05.680
And a lot has been
said about that.

00:11:05.681 --> 00:11:09.640
There's no simple or single way
you can put that badge on

00:11:09.641 --> 00:11:11.400
which says "mentor follow me";

00:11:11.401 --> 00:11:12.600
it doesn't work that way.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.440
It's something that you
learn through time.

00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:18.360
It's something that you
also consciously develop.

00:11:18.361 --> 00:11:21.120
Mentoring can be taught.

00:11:21.121 --> 00:11:23.120
People who've not done it,

00:11:23.121 --> 00:11:24.560
who've not thought about it

00:11:24.561 --> 00:11:28.240
can be helped to think
through it in a conscious manner.

00:11:28.241 --> 00:11:30.080
Not that there is a single formula,

00:11:30.081 --> 00:11:32.720
a single series of things
that everyone must do

00:11:32.721 --> 00:11:37.400
but that there are
types of issues,

00:11:37.401 --> 00:11:38.680
types of relationships

00:11:38.681 --> 00:11:41.400
which you can point to,
which you can bring out.

00:11:41.401 --> 00:11:43.680
And for people to recognize

00:11:43.681 --> 00:11:45.960
that it's not something
out of sight,

00:11:45.961 --> 00:11:47.240
something they can't achieve,

00:11:47.241 --> 00:11:50.760
but something that they
can, indeed, learn to do.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:00.800
Sangeeta: I think it's
how the book works.

00:12:00.801 --> 00:12:02.560
Remember what about it used to be--

00:12:02.561 --> 00:12:03.680
they used to be that

00:12:03.681 --> 00:12:06.160
you would pull on here the little
feet footsteps would come out.

00:12:06.161 --> 00:12:08.680
Sangeeta Bathia and Jagesh Shah

00:12:08.681 --> 00:12:11.000
are both professors in the sciences,

00:12:11.001 --> 00:12:14.920
part of a growing number of
dual-career academic couples.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.400
After beginning their
careers in California,

00:12:18.401 --> 00:12:20.240
they had their first child

00:12:20.241 --> 00:12:22.520
and decided to move
back to the northeast

00:12:22.521 --> 00:12:24.320
to be closer to family.

00:12:24.321 --> 00:12:28.000
I was already tenured and
Jagesh was finishing his post doc

00:12:28.001 --> 00:12:30.640
so we were both looking
for faculty positions.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:35.400
And I was hoping to
move and retain my tenure,

00:12:35.401 --> 00:12:37.840
and he was hoping to start
in a tenured faculty position.

00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:41.600
It's just like any one person making
a big life-changing decision

00:12:41.601 --> 00:12:43.320
but it's sort of like squared

00:12:43.321 --> 00:12:45.080
because everything is connected

00:12:45.081 --> 00:12:46.320
so we have to think
about our family

00:12:46.321 --> 00:12:48.080
and the financial piece of it

00:12:48.081 --> 00:12:49.400
and where we could buy a home

00:12:49.401 --> 00:12:51.120
and where we felt
that we could thrive.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:52.800
For us it was nice to think that

00:12:52.801 --> 00:12:55.000
we would be actually at
different institutions

00:12:55.001 --> 00:12:56.280
but were still in the same place

00:12:56.281 --> 00:12:58.760
because we could
have our own identities.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.960
We got married to
spend our lives together

00:13:00.961 --> 00:13:02.600
and we didn't want to
live in different cities.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.520
So we were just going to move,

00:13:04.521 --> 00:13:06.800
if we could, to Boston.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.720
Eventually, they limited their
search to New England.

00:13:09.721 --> 00:13:12.680
Harvard and MIT were
at the top of the list

00:13:12.681 --> 00:13:15.600
since they had both
trained at HST--

00:13:15.601 --> 00:13:18.520
a joint venture between
the two universities.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.240
Well, what was challenging for
us was the different stages

00:13:21.241 --> 00:13:22.280
that we were at.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.960
And feeling in our marriage
and as a couple

00:13:25.961 --> 00:13:27.480
since we trained together
in graduate school,

00:13:27.481 --> 00:13:30.280
we felt like real equals.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.680
Yet, in the outside world

00:13:32.681 --> 00:13:35.320
we had staggered our careers.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.800
Sangeeta mentioned her
accompanying spouse

00:13:37.801 --> 00:13:39.600
early in the recruitment process

00:13:39.601 --> 00:13:41.800
and that she could not
accept a position

00:13:41.801 --> 00:13:44.400
unless the outcome was
favorable for both of them.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.600
I think the things that go well

00:13:46.601 --> 00:13:50.080
are when you really do feel like
you're an independent candidate.

00:13:50.081 --> 00:13:51.640
When you walk in to
somebody's office

00:13:51.641 --> 00:13:55.280
and they have a frank academic
conversation with you

00:13:55.281 --> 00:13:57.040
about what it's
like at their place,

00:13:57.041 --> 00:13:59.280
somehow that makes you feel like
you're a part of the process.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:00.840
It's ultimately human endeavor so

00:14:00.841 --> 00:14:03.840
these other feelings do
creep up, kind of like

00:14:03.841 --> 00:14:06.880
"Oh, are they here for me or are
they just giving me a chance

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.280
because my wife is a superstar?"

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.600
What you wanted to feel was that this
was going to be a welcoming process,

00:14:13.601 --> 00:14:14.920
that this is going to
be a process that

00:14:14.921 --> 00:14:15.800
where they're going to say,

00:14:15.801 --> 00:14:18.240
"Oh, great! There's two of
you, that's even better."

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.320
They were willing to work at separate
institutions in the same city.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:26.440
This flexibility gave them
more options but still,

00:14:26.441 --> 00:14:29.400
their recruitment
experience varied widely.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.400
So we had a whole range of offers

00:14:31.401 --> 00:14:35.280
that we felt like
were really exciting,

00:14:35.281 --> 00:14:36.560
that we were excited about,

00:14:36.561 --> 00:14:38.000
where we both really felt valued

00:14:38.001 --> 00:14:40.440
and really could thrive in,

00:14:40.441 --> 00:14:43.520
all the way to positions
where we really felt like

00:14:43.521 --> 00:14:46.920
one offer was reasonable and
the other was just ludicrous.

00:14:46.921 --> 00:14:51.120
And you know, those were things
that we walked away from very quickly.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.160
Because they trained there,

00:14:53.161 --> 00:14:55.880
they kept in contact
with Harvard and MIT,

00:14:55.881 --> 00:14:58.600
and HST wanted to
bring them back.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.280
We had two administrators,
one on each side,

00:15:01.281 --> 00:15:02.640
who really championed our cases

00:15:02.641 --> 00:15:05.240
and understood we're
independent scientists

00:15:05.241 --> 00:15:07.600
who could bring something to the
community that was valuable.

00:15:07.601 --> 00:15:09.400
So that really made
all the difference.

00:15:09.401 --> 00:15:12.160
Those personally
relationships really ended up

00:15:12.161 --> 00:15:13.920
helping us decide to come.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.320
In the end,

00:15:15.321 --> 00:15:17.640
they both received
desirable offers

00:15:17.641 --> 00:15:20.880
because they were willing to work
at separate institutions.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:25.000
Meanwhile, their home institution
presented a counteroffer.

00:15:25.001 --> 00:15:28.400
But ultimately, they decided
to move closer to family.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.600
It was sort of a
holistic, you know,

00:15:31.601 --> 00:15:33.880
what is the life that we wanted to have, not just the job

00:15:33.881 --> 00:15:34.880
but the life, you know,

00:15:34.881 --> 00:15:38.120
and I had this vision that we would
be close to our families

00:15:38.121 --> 00:15:39.880
and that the kids would
know our parents

00:15:39.881 --> 00:15:42.360
and that it would be a
village so to speak.

00:15:42.361 --> 00:15:43.640
And you know,

00:15:43.641 --> 00:15:47.560
that the process was just one part in
what the lives that we wanted to have.

00:15:47.561 --> 00:15:49.760
Sangeeta: Yes. Yes, is it 8:00?

00:15:49.761 --> 00:15:50.800
Jagesh: It is 8:00.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.440
The demands of a
career in research

00:15:54.441 --> 00:15:58.840
science still strain the limits of
Sangeeta and Jagesh's schedule

00:15:58.841 --> 00:16:00.840
and they've had to push back,

00:16:00.841 --> 00:16:04.600
making careful decisions about
which meetings and conferences

00:16:04.601 --> 00:16:07.960
they can attend in order to
spend time with family.

00:16:08.001 --> 00:16:08.961
It's not just a
dual career, right?

00:16:08.962 --> 00:16:12.440
It's a life together and that
dual career is part of it

00:16:12.441 --> 00:16:14.920
and that when you make these
choices about where you want to go

00:16:14.921 --> 00:16:17.680
and how you want to accommodate
other aspects of your life,

00:16:17.681 --> 00:16:19.880
you really need to take--
it's a whole package.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.800
Finding creative solutions

00:16:21.801 --> 00:16:24.960
to the challenges created
by dual-career couples

00:16:24.961 --> 00:16:27.760
as well as child care
and mentoring issues

00:16:27.761 --> 00:16:30.880
will create a more supportive
working environment

00:16:30.881 --> 00:16:32.160
for faculty members.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.120
Developing faculty
early in their careers

00:16:42.121 --> 00:16:46.080
is essential to the continued
success of the academy.
