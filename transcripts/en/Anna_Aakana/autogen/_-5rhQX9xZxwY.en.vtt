(papers rattle)

00:00:01.102 --> 00:00:02.381
Okay, Joy?

00:00:02.843 --> 00:00:03.280
Joy: Here.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:03.780
Joy..

00:00:04.496 --> 00:00:05.450
Trea?

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.950
Trea: Here.

00:00:07.311 --> 00:00:07.979
Aiko?

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:08.596
Aiko: Yes.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.156
Grace?

00:00:12.496 --> 00:00:13.277
Teacher: No Grace?

00:00:14.255 --> 00:00:14.865
Teresa?

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:16.229
Hello.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:17.756
Jenny?

00:00:18.163 --> 00:00:18.666
Jenny: Here.

00:00:19.418 --> 00:00:20.509
Hey, I'm Anna.

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:21.419
I'm Brad.

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:22.593
What kind of white are you?

00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:24.101
What?

00:00:24.101 --> 00:00:24.841
Is it Irish?

00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:25.655
You look really Iry.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:27.949
I--Iry?

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:29.220
Yeah. It's short for Irish.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.845
Alright.

00:00:29.845 --> 00:00:31.042
Let's do some, uh,

00:00:31.042 --> 00:00:32.448
warm-up improv scenes.

00:00:32.448 --> 00:00:33.285
No suggestions.

00:00:33.285 --> 00:00:34.588
You're under arrest for embezzling

00:00:34.588 --> 00:00:35.918
from Bank of America!

00:00:35.918 --> 00:00:37.811
Throwing ME under the bus, Officer Kelly?

00:00:37.811 --> 00:00:39.720
But you were the mastermind behind the whole thing!

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.606
Oh, you're gonna rat me out?

00:00:41.606 --> 00:00:43.811
Classic wimpy, white man.

00:00:43.811 --> 00:00:44.712
Where's your honor?!

00:00:44.712 --> 00:00:46.464
(laughter)

00:00:46.464 --> 00:00:47.132
(gasp)

00:00:47.132 --> 00:00:48.602
I'm not hiding any Jews.

00:00:48.602 --> 00:00:49.102
Nein!

00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:51.919
A sword collection?

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:52.979
Really?

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:54.743
Your yellow fever's getting out of control, man.

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:58.192
Crash this beer can on your forehead, frat boy!

00:00:58.192 --> 00:01:00.069
For Delta U!

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.663
You know, I'm not really a religious person, but...

00:01:02.663 --> 00:01:03.780
this pope is pretty chill.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.781
Yeah. (scoffs)

00:01:04.781 --> 00:01:06.601
I mean, I even started going to church.

00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:07.218
Are you two--

00:01:07.218 --> 00:01:09.131
OH MY GOD, IT'S THE PEDOPHILE PRIEST!

00:01:09.131 --> 00:01:09.724
Get out of here!

00:01:09.724 --> 00:01:10.418
(Brad screams)

00:01:10.418 --> 00:01:11.219
Get out!

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:12.658
Brad: Okay, hold--I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

00:01:12.658 --> 00:01:14.010
do you not have a note on this?

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.810
Yeah.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:15.842
Super funny, Brad.

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:16.841
(laughs)

00:01:16.841 --> 00:01:17.662
But you could--

00:01:17.662 --> 00:01:18.694
You could...commit more.

00:01:18.694 --> 00:01:20.342
It seems like you're hesitating.

00:01:20.342 --> 00:01:22.688
The initiations are pretty stereotypical.

00:01:22.688 --> 00:01:23.693
Really? I--

00:01:23.693 --> 00:01:24.632
I didn't notice that.

00:01:24.632 --> 00:01:25.495
Frat bro?

00:01:25.495 --> 00:01:26.373
Embezzler?

00:01:26.373 --> 00:01:27.269
Pedophile priest?

00:01:27.269 --> 00:01:28.719
I mean, I know these are the only portrayals of

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:30.158
white men in media, but...

00:01:30.158 --> 00:01:31.720
that doesn't mean that we're ALL like that.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.979
Nobody's saying that, Brad.

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.688
It's just a little frustrating, you know?

00:01:34.688 --> 00:01:36.711
To...not see someone who looks like me

00:01:36.711 --> 00:01:38.918
in..class or on the stage, I mean,

00:01:38.918 --> 00:01:41.219
even at the higher levels, it's all just Asian women.

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:43.240
Hey, "funny" is "funny", dude.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.158
It's not our fault that most people in improv

00:01:45.158 --> 00:01:46.158
are Asian women.

00:01:46.158 --> 00:01:47.525
"Funny" is also subjective,

00:01:47.525 --> 00:01:50.158
I mean, you guys have a very particular sense of humor.

00:01:50.158 --> 00:01:52.015
And you're gonna identify with other Asian women--

00:01:52.015 --> 00:01:54.423
Wait, are you saying..

00:01:54.423 --> 00:01:55.418
we're racist?

00:01:55.418 --> 00:01:56.688
Hey, my boyfriend's white!

00:01:56.688 --> 00:01:57.509
Nonononono,

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.319
NOT racist.

00:01:59.371 --> 00:02:00.851
Maybe...

00:02:01.663 --> 00:02:03.310
unconsciously biased?

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.046
Alright,

00:02:04.046 --> 00:02:04.948
I think we all...

00:02:04.948 --> 00:02:05.980
we all heard Brad,

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.448
thank you, for speaking up,

00:02:07.448 --> 00:02:09.480
but let's--let's keep the politics out of here

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.943
for a little bit, and--and get back to work.

00:02:11.372 --> 00:02:12.102
Um,

00:02:12.102 --> 00:02:13.746
Brad, why don't you initiate a scene.

00:02:18.658 --> 00:02:19.343
Whoa,

00:02:19.343 --> 00:02:22.225
that new whey protein's really 
doing a number on your traps.

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:22.786
Yeah.

00:02:22.786 --> 00:02:23.785
Wrap it up, broski.

00:02:23.785 --> 00:02:25.719
We're late for a Coldplay concert.

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:26.296
And there are a bunch of

00:02:26.296 --> 00:02:27.571
women we need to shame into

00:02:27.571 --> 00:02:28.862
fucking us~

00:02:28.862 --> 00:02:32.039
(laughter)

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.539
Really?

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.101
(laughter continues)

00:02:35.101 --> 00:02:36.709
(subsides)

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.442
(footsteps)

00:02:42.442 --> 00:02:43.418
(door closes)

00:02:43.418 --> 00:02:44.208
I'd still do him.

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:45.449
Yeah.

00:02:46.862 --> 00:02:47.800
Ah...

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.313
dick.

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:50.800
People have this weird urge

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.542
to comment on my race.

00:02:52.542 --> 00:02:54.279
So, what exactly ARE you?

00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:57.575
Um, well I'm Japanese, Hawaiian, Filipino--

00:02:57.575 --> 00:02:58.132
Whoa,

00:02:58.132 --> 00:02:59.294
you are way too Asian.

00:03:00.254 --> 00:03:03.422
...English, German, Spanish, French, Irish..

00:03:03.422 --> 00:03:03.922
Wow.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.753
You are not Asian enough.

00:03:06.163 --> 00:03:08.040
It's especially weird when they say,

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.659
"You're white-washed."

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:09.159
