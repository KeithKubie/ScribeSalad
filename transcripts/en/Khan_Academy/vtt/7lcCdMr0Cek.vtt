00:00:00.123 --> 00:00:01.124
- [Voiceover] Hey, Becca.

00:00:01.124 --> 00:00:02.116
- [Voiceover] Hey, Kim.

00:00:02.116 --> 00:00:03.904
So, in this video we're
gonna continue talking

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:06.383
about how this arbitrary racial hierarchy

00:00:06.383 --> 00:00:08.763
was established in
America, specifically about

00:00:08.763 --> 00:00:11.095
the beginning of the Atlantic slave trade

00:00:11.095 --> 00:00:13.840
and how our society became so stratified

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.607
by race so early on.

00:00:15.607 --> 00:00:16.605
- [Voiceover] Okay, interesting.

00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:19.084
- [Voiceover] The Portuguese
had started to buy slaves

00:00:19.084 --> 00:00:21.863
and bring them to Europe as early as 1526,

00:00:21.863 --> 00:00:25.278
but it wasn't until the 1600s
when slaves were transported

00:00:25.278 --> 00:00:27.611
across the Atlantic and sold

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.683
into servitude in the new colonies.

00:00:30.683 --> 00:00:31.681
- [Voiceover] All right,

00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:33.527
so I'm gonna draw us a
little Atlantic world here

00:00:33.527 --> 00:00:37.360
and please forgive my
terrible maps womanship.

00:00:38.914 --> 00:00:40.580
- [Voiceover] This was directly connected

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.652
to this competition

00:00:42.652 --> 00:00:46.819
between European powers for a
stronghold in the new world,

00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:50.048
so this began with the Spanish

00:00:50.048 --> 00:00:52.564
in 1492 with Christopher Columbus,

00:00:52.564 --> 00:00:57.200
but slowly also the English,
the Dutch, the Portuguese,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.509
everyone is trying to
establish their own colony

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:04.485
that they could hopefully gain
a lot of new resources from

00:01:04.485 --> 00:01:07.782
and just establish glory,
really, in this new world

00:01:07.782 --> 00:01:11.232
and having slaves was a really big part

00:01:11.232 --> 00:01:12.885
of being able to do that.

00:01:12.885 --> 00:01:14.365
- [Voiceover] Yeah, I
mean, if you think about,

00:01:14.365 --> 00:01:17.517
just imagine, kind of, living
in, I don't know, England,

00:01:17.517 --> 00:01:20.934
and hearing about how well Spain is doing

00:01:21.865 --> 00:01:26.032
getting all this gold and
silver from the new world,

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.267
so Spain is definitely improving

00:01:31.267 --> 00:01:34.234
it's national standing in Europe

00:01:34.234 --> 00:01:38.949
and the rest of Europe is
thinking, "Mm, sounds to me

00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:41.654
like we need to get in on this game."

00:01:41.654 --> 00:01:43.359
- [Voiceover] And so,
to get in on the game,

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:45.613
really what the European powers needed

00:01:45.613 --> 00:01:48.437
were laborers to work in
these new plantations.

00:01:48.437 --> 00:01:51.285
As you may know, when
the Europeans came over

00:01:51.285 --> 00:01:53.276
they brought a ton of disease

00:01:53.276 --> 00:01:56.057
which decimated these
Native American populations

00:01:56.057 --> 00:01:59.290
which they had previously used to labor

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.014
through the encomienda system

00:02:01.014 --> 00:02:03.394
so the African slaves
actually had immunities

00:02:03.394 --> 00:02:07.109
to these diseases that the European powers

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:09.141
really wanted to capitalize upon.

00:02:09.141 --> 00:02:10.685
- [Voiceover] Yeah, I think
what's interesting here

00:02:10.685 --> 00:02:13.024
and the reason that I drew this map

00:02:13.024 --> 00:02:14.708
is because I think it
really helps us understand

00:02:14.708 --> 00:02:18.208
why it was that people who lived over here

00:02:19.097 --> 00:02:22.014
had no immunity to European disease

00:02:23.891 --> 00:02:27.305
and why the people who lived over here did

00:02:27.305 --> 00:02:28.930
because if you think about sailing,

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.082
so here's Europe, and
people had been trading

00:02:32.082 --> 00:02:37.080
with Europe and West Africa
and into the Middle East

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.136
to here for hundreds of years.

00:02:40.136 --> 00:02:41.096
- [Voiceover] Exactly.

00:02:41.096 --> 00:02:43.562
- [Voiceover] So that
gave them plenty of time

00:02:43.562 --> 00:02:46.447
to kind of build up
immunities to each other

00:02:46.447 --> 00:02:49.756
so not only do people in Africa

00:02:49.756 --> 00:02:52.559
have the immunity to disease,

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:56.948
they're also kind of a
readily available labor source

00:02:56.948 --> 00:03:01.234
because the practice of
taking prisoners of war

00:03:01.234 --> 00:03:04.976
and selling them as slaves
on the west coast of Africa

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:07.594
was already established so Europeans

00:03:07.594 --> 00:03:09.196
are looking for a labor force that

00:03:09.196 --> 00:03:10.824
isn't gonna die of disease

00:03:10.824 --> 00:03:13.672
and there are people being sold as slaves

00:03:13.672 --> 00:03:15.745
on the west coast of Africa already.

00:03:15.745 --> 00:03:16.801
- [Voiceover] So, at this point,

00:03:16.801 --> 00:03:19.361
there are kind of two
competing labor forces

00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:23.113
between the Native Americans
and the African slaves.

00:03:23.113 --> 00:03:25.659
Colonists start realizing
that the African slaves

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:29.077
are actually a more economical labor force

00:03:29.077 --> 00:03:33.682
than the Native Americans
since they had this immunity.

00:03:33.682 --> 00:03:35.694
- [Voiceover] Right,
and they're also easier

00:03:35.694 --> 00:03:38.947
to keep as slaves for Europeans

00:03:38.947 --> 00:03:41.646
because they're not on
their home territory.

00:03:41.646 --> 00:03:43.458
You know, if someone
showed up to your town

00:03:43.458 --> 00:03:45.385
and said, "You're my slave now,"

00:03:45.385 --> 00:03:47.498
you're gonna run away to the hills

00:03:47.498 --> 00:03:49.977
and they don't know anything
about where your town is

00:03:49.977 --> 00:03:51.095
so you're fine, right?

00:03:51.095 --> 00:03:54.795
It's hard to enslave people
on their home territory,

00:03:54.795 --> 00:03:57.124
but if you are buying someone

00:03:57.124 --> 00:03:58.897
who has been wrestled away from

00:03:58.897 --> 00:04:01.902
their home in Central Africa,

00:04:01.902 --> 00:04:04.385
brought to the coast, they're with people

00:04:04.385 --> 00:04:06.457
who don't even speak the
same language as them,

00:04:06.457 --> 00:04:09.683
they're put on a ship to the new world

00:04:09.683 --> 00:04:11.494
which is incredibly deadly,

00:04:11.494 --> 00:04:15.536
say probably about 30%
of enslaved Africans

00:04:15.536 --> 00:04:18.607
who were put in what was
called the middle passage

00:04:18.607 --> 00:04:20.524
died during the voyage.

00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:23.053
- [Voiceover] I think
that's a really good point

00:04:23.053 --> 00:04:25.389
and the reason that some colonists

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:27.564
actually preferred Native American slaves

00:04:27.564 --> 00:04:31.244
is because of their knowledge
of the land and agriculture.

00:04:31.244 --> 00:04:33.944
So, the subordination of
both the Native Americans

00:04:33.944 --> 00:04:36.991
and the African slaves led
to lots of intermarriage

00:04:36.991 --> 00:04:40.364
between the two groups
and so, in the colonies,

00:04:40.364 --> 00:04:42.355
there became a sense of racial mixing

00:04:42.355 --> 00:04:44.427
that we had never seen before.

00:04:44.427 --> 00:04:46.252
- [Voiceover] Interesting,
and I can see how this might

00:04:46.252 --> 00:04:49.245
pose a problem if you're
trying to figure out

00:04:49.245 --> 00:04:52.185
who should be a slave and who should not

00:04:52.185 --> 00:04:55.114
because if you have someone
who belongs to both groups,

00:04:55.114 --> 00:04:56.397
where do you categorize them?

00:04:56.397 --> 00:04:58.795
- [Voiceover] So, a lot of the
Spanish that were coming over

00:04:58.795 --> 00:05:01.761
had trouble distinguishing
who was supposed to be a slave

00:05:01.761 --> 00:05:03.911
and who was a Native American

00:05:03.911 --> 00:05:05.761
as these two groups intermarried?

00:05:05.761 --> 00:05:08.129
So let's check out this painting
to learn a little bit more

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:10.907
about how the different
groups were mixing at the time

00:05:10.907 --> 00:05:13.525
and how racial hierarchy really solidified

00:05:13.525 --> 00:05:14.903
at this time period.

00:05:14.903 --> 00:05:16.027
- [Voiceover] You can definitely see that

00:05:16.027 --> 00:05:19.156
they've put things in
multiple layers here.

00:05:19.156 --> 00:05:23.870
Here's Virgin Mary, her,
sort of representation of God

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.983
or the higher power and then here you see

00:05:25.983 --> 00:05:30.150
the Spanish, whites, and
below that Native Americans

00:05:31.712 --> 00:05:35.938
who might be the offspring
of white Spanish settlers

00:05:35.938 --> 00:05:37.688
and Native Americans.

00:05:39.102 --> 00:05:41.383
- [Voiceover] A Spanish
and a Native American,

00:05:41.383 --> 00:05:43.311
that was called mestizos, right?

00:05:43.311 --> 00:05:44.309
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:46.666
Or they might be the offspring

00:05:46.666 --> 00:05:49.583
of a Native American and an African

00:05:50.648 --> 00:05:54.398
and those people were
referred to as creoles.

00:05:55.888 --> 00:05:57.835
So there's a very complex system

00:05:57.835 --> 00:06:02.002
of racial hierarchy in this
Spanish society basically,

00:06:02.978 --> 00:06:07.145
organized around how much
white blood a person had,

00:06:09.191 --> 00:06:12.666
the more privileges and rights
you had in their society.

00:06:12.666 --> 00:06:14.739
- [Voiceover] And you see
the inverse in early America,

00:06:14.739 --> 00:06:17.258
right, in the early 1800s,

00:06:17.258 --> 00:06:20.383
when even one drop of African blood would

00:06:20.383 --> 00:06:22.417
make a person a slave.

00:06:22.417 --> 00:06:24.636
- [Voiceover] Right, and that's one thing

00:06:24.636 --> 00:06:26.587
that is always very confusing even to

00:06:26.587 --> 00:06:27.968
the people of the time period

00:06:27.968 --> 00:06:29.693
because it would be possible for someone

00:06:29.693 --> 00:06:31.096
who looked quite light
skinned to still be enslaved

00:06:31.096 --> 00:06:33.576
by virtue of their parentage.

00:06:33.576 --> 00:06:35.527
- [Voiceover] Exactly and
so this was the system

00:06:35.527 --> 00:06:39.101
by which society, in the
early colonial time period,

00:06:39.101 --> 00:06:41.314
was organized around a completely

00:06:41.314 --> 00:06:43.692
arbitrary factor like race.

00:06:43.692 --> 00:06:46.392
It was simply the easiest
way to identify people

00:06:46.392 --> 00:06:48.385
and create a working class.

00:06:48.385 --> 00:06:50.312
- [Voiceover] And, as we move forward,

00:06:50.312 --> 00:06:53.690
as the English begin
to settle North America

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.628
and shortly after their
settlement import African slaves,

00:06:57.628 --> 00:07:00.250
the United States will become heir

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.204
to a version of this system.
