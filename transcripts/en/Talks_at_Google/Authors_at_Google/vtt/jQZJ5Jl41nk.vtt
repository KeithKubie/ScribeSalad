00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:03.310
MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon
everybody.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.200
Thank you for joining
us this afternoon.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.030
Sorry we're a few
minutes late.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.470
I just want to give
a really quick

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.410
introduction to Peter Andreas.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.370
He's a professor at Brown
University, and he's going to

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.610
talk to us a little bit
about his book,

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.610
"Smuggler Nation." Enjoy.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.340
PETER ANDREAS: Thank
you to Google--

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.420
Christopher Jordan
for the invite.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.650
I'm thrilled that Google has
these kind of events, not only

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.680
once in awhile, but apparently
all the time.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.660
So it's the kind of place
I'd like to be.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.410
Sort of like a university
campus.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.270
Like where I'm at.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.435
Anyway, the name of the book,
as you know, is called

00:00:40.435 --> 00:00:45.010
"Smuggler Nation, How Illicit
Trade Made America." And what

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.190
I do in this book is
I basically narrate

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.730
the American epic.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.640
A 300-year epic that's
a pretty familiar

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.840
story to you all.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.140
But I tell it in a rather
unfamiliar,

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.130
unconventional way.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.710
So familiar episodes, the
American Revolution,

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.430
industrialization, Westward
expansion, Manifest Destiny,

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.760
the American Civil War, the
Progressive era, America's

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.890
rise as a global superpower.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.720
These are familiar stories in
our history, but I retell them

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.160
through the lens of smuggling
and anti-smuggling campaigns

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.340
of various sorts over time.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.770
And I'd like to think--

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.790
I hope you'll be convinced by
the talk, but you could look

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.560
at the book too, if
you're inspired--

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.610
that by looking at our country's
history through this

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.160
rather unconventional lens, we
see some things we otherwise

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.622
might miss.

00:01:42.622 --> 00:01:47.090
And in this case, I want to
hopefully convince you that,

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.800
in fact, it turns out that
smuggling and anti-smuggling

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.860
crusades were absolutely
essential to the very

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.060
founding, and development, and
expansion of the country, so

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.020
much so that there's this great
irony, which today,

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.120
America is the world's foremost
anti-smuggling

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.520
policing superpower, yet founded
and owes much of its

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.380
founding and development, I
would argue, to smuggling,

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.410
smuggling interests,
and so forth.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.100
And an interesting angle for
me is I teach at Brown

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.770
University in Rhode Island.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.140
Providence, Rhode Island.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.100
And it turns out I had no
intention of looking for this,

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.880
but I discovered in the process
of the research how

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.470
important tiny Rhode Island,
the smallest state in the

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.680
nation, is in this history.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.280
So let's backtrack to the
colonial period and look at

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.120
the importance of
say, molasses, a

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.260
seemingly benign product.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.580
But it's intimately intertwined
with smuggling in

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.830
the economy of the Northeast.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:48.850
Why is that so?

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.140
Well, the most important export
of the colonies is rum.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.770
And the most important
ingredient to make rum is, of

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.110
course, molasses.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.350
And molasses is coming
from the Caribbean.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.240
But it's supposed to come mostly
from the British West

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.210
Indies, but it's coming back
from the French West Indies.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.920
How do we know this?

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.900
We know all these distilleries
in Rhode Island and

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.230
Massachusetts produce a
certain amount of rum.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.200
And we know that the molasses
they're getting in legally

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.700
can't possibly produce
that much rum.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.190
So the difference is made
up by the black market.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.040
And it's crucially important in
terms of the slave trade as

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.550
well, because they export rum
to West Africa for slaves,

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.280
bring slaves to the Caribbean,
and then they bring back more

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.760
molasses to the colonies.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.220
Now the British for many years,
decades in fact, had a

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.600
kind of tolerant live and let
live attitude towards this

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.390
illicit trade.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.840
But after the Seven Years' War
with the French, the British

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.510
were broke.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.420
They desperately needed
more revenue.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.750
And so, they decided to crack
down on the colonies to help

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.260
fill the King's coffers.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.350
And instead of accepting
this, the

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.680
colonists, in fact, balked.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.900
They balked rather radically,
in fact.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.900
And Rhode Island was one the
first places is to basically

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.880
say, enough is enough.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.630
And they had a raiding party on
a customs vessel called the

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.020
"Gaspee." It's a famous incident
in Rhode Island.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.220
They celebrate it every
year now, actually.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.180
Called the Gaspee Affair, where
they basically burned

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.850
down the vessel in
Narragansett Bay.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.800
And Rhode islanders think of it
as the opening salvo in the

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.930
American Revolution, though the
Tea Party in Boston gets

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.120
all the credit for that.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.700
So I don't want to overstate
the case, how important

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.020
molasses and rum was in the
origins of the American

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.140
Revolution, but we should
also not gloss over it.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.700
After all, it was John Adams who
said, we should not blush

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.220
to recognize the importance of
rum and molasses in our War of

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.240
Independence.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.690
But it's not just a story
about the roots the

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:50.200
Revolution.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.290
The Revolution itself was made
possible by smuggling and

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.180
smuggling interests.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.510
So how does George Washington
take on the world's foremost

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.130
military power?

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.090
Well, he basically relies
deeply on smugglers to

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.290
basically provide enough
ammunition, especially

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.310
gunpowder, for his desperately

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.570
under-supplied Continental Army.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.090
Now it turns out that the people
supplying his army are

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.350
not only doing it as patriots,
but they're also doing it as

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:21.770
profiteers.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.810
In fact, John Brown, one of
the founders of Brown

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.530
University, there's some great
correspondence between him and

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.710
George Washington's buyer of
powder, where the buyer is

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.690
basically saying, you're
charging us exorbitant prices

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.730
for this powder, but under the
desperate circumstances, we

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.150
really have no other
alternatives.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.750
And John Brown actually emerges
from the American War

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.090
of Independence as probably
the richest

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.390
man in Rhode Island.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.910
So he made some of his fortune
in powder runs.

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.780
He was also involved in the
molasses trade and other

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.550
illicit trades before
the Revolution.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.585
But part of his fortune was very
much as a war profiteer

00:05:56.585 --> 00:05:58.560
of sorts in our very War
of Independence.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.250
So yes, the war was about
patriotism, and

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.600
freedom, and liberty.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.660
But they also were able to
harness the profit motive and

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.640
greed, frankly, in actually
pulling it off.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.910
In some respects, there's
parallels to today's

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.430
insurgencies and civil wars.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.270
There's a sort of vigorous
debate in the literature on

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.440
contemporary civil wars, arguing
that somehow, they're

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.570
profoundly new and different
because they're so

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:27.850
greed-driven.

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.480
And we look at things like
cocaine finance guerrillas in

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.570
Colombia, or opium finance
insurgents in Afghanistan, or

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.320
blood diamonds in West Africa.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.920
We all know the term
blood diamonds now.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.680
They even made a James
Bond movie about it.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.240
And I think Leonardo DiCaprio
even made a movie with the

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.210
title "Blood Diamonds."

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.240
But what I argue here and in
more detail in the book is

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.340
that the role of conflict
commodities, the importance of

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.620
trade in war time, goes all the
way back, not just years

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.880
or decades, but in
fact centuries.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.200
So if we fast forward in
American history to the

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.090
American Civil War, I cannot
think of a single conflict

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.200
commodity that mattered more in
an armed rebellion than the

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.580
role of cotton in actually
perpetuating an insurgency.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.510
In fact, the Confederacy
arguably would not have even

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:19.520
had the chutzpah to actually try
to go independent if they

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.080
didn't think that King Cotton,
as they called it, could help

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:23.830
them pull it off.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.100
Initially, we thought the
British would come to their

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.400
aid formally, intervene on their
side because the British

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.140
were so dependent on cotton.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.180
But the British were smart about
it, and realized they

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.290
could acquire a significant
amount of cotton through

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:35.610
illicit channels.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.020
They didn't need to formally
intervene on

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.770
the side of the South.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:41.390
That would be very risky, and
too overt blunt and direct.

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:44.440
So they could, in fact, turn a
blind eye to what they called

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.200
blockade runners.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:51.150
So basically, running through
the Union blockade of Southern

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:55.200
ports, smuggling arms and
ammunition in, and bringing

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.810
out desperately needed cotton
out for British

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.900
factories, and so on.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:04.690
It wasn't as much, obviously,
as pre-war cotton supplies,

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:06.710
but it was enormously profitable
for those who could

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:09.690
actually successfully get
this commodity out.

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:11.720
There was also a lot of trading
of cotton across the

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.340
front lines.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.840
A lot of Northerners made
a lot of money on cotton

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.980
speculation, cotton trading,
cotton smuggling.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.190
Abraham Lincoln, known as Honest
Abe, actually had a

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.880
pretty tolerant attitude
about this.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.920
He actually pardoned a lot of
cotton smugglers who were

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.520
sitting in jail during the
American Civil War.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.360
A lot of it's for political
connections.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.549
He decided not to make
a big deal out of it.

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:36.640
So again, we only need to look
at our own Civil War to

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.070
realize it's not that
fundamentally--

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:41.500
today's civil wars are in some
ways not that fundamentally

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.240
different in terms of their
dependence on conflict

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.660
commodities and keeping
them going.

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:49.550
Now notice, it wasn't enough to
turn the balance of power

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.610
on the ground in favor
of the South.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.980
But it actually helped
perpetuate that conflict far

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:58.250
longer and make it far bloodier
than anyone expected.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:00.310
In fact, more Americans died in
the American Civil War than

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:03.490
any conflict the US has been
involved in since, over

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:07.080
600,000 Americans died
in that war.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.180
And I would argue that cotton
actually played an important

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:15.740
role in keeping it fueled,
if you will.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.130
There's also an interesting
story, and perhaps

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:21.620
particularly interesting to
you folks here at Google,

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.400
about intellectual
property theft.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.970
Basically, there's a rigorous
debate going on right now, as

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.570
you're well aware in Washington
and elsewhere,

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:32.770
about the growth of intellectual
property theft,

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:35.130
and knock-off products,
and so on.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.960
A lot of finger pointing it at
China, especially, but other

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.360
countries as well.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.790
Well, from the perspective of my
book, the message that the

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:46.180
United States is sending China
and other countries around the

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.540
world is do as I say,
not as I did.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.050
And basically, I don't think
it's too much of an

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.290
overstatement to say that the
United States in the 19th

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:57.550
century was the world's
hotbed of

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:59.250
intellectual property theft.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:04.980
Of outright blatant piracy
of other countries'

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.480
and people's products.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.660
So let's start actually with
America's actual own early

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.000
industrialization process.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.850
How does an upstart nation, a
backward nation, actually

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:21.030
catch up to its European rivals
that it has just gone

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:22.210
independent from?

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:24.820
Well, it can't do it purely
through indigenous means.

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:29.600
So Alexander Hamilton and others
actually very bluntly

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.480
say we need to acquire the
technologies and machinery

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.820
from Europe, especially England

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:35.950
through any means necessary.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:38.530
Now they use words like
borrow, a very

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:39.590
polite word, right?

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:42.330
But it's not like you're
giving the stuff back.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:42.600
Right?

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.830
So it actually meant
outright theft.

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:46.990
And theft, in fact,
meant smuggling.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:52.770
So early textile equipment,
newly invented in England,

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:55.890
would soon appear in the United
States in various

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:59.130
pieces, and packages,
and so on.

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:01.590
And the British authorities
tried to crack down on this

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.010
with mixed results.

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:05.620
It slowed it, but
did not stop it.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.240
And when the equipment got to
the United States, there was

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.970
just one problem that the
importers couldn't deal with,

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.540
which was, the equipment doesn't
really come with

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.380
operating instructions.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.850
And in fact, sometimes it came
in pieces, so you don't even

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:21.170
know how to put it together.

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:23.840
So you not only need the
technology, the machinery, but

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.157
you actually need the know-how,
the people, who know

00:11:26.157 --> 00:11:27.350
how to operate it.

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:28.760
And guess what?

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.335
It's illegal for British skilled
workers, artisans, who

00:11:32.335 --> 00:11:34.820
know how to operate the
machinery to leave Britain.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:38.630
It's actually a violation of
British immigration laws to

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:41.060
actually bring yourself over to
the United States and help

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.020
the country industrialize.

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.110
So again, this is a
smuggling story.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:49.560
Some of Britain's most ambitious
artisans, skilled

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.100
workers, clandestinely found
their way across the ocean,

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.810
sneaking aboard ships,
pretending to be

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:56.110
farmers, and so on.

00:11:56.110 --> 00:12:00.390
Some of them were actually
wooed over by agents, US

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:03.060
agents, which would go over
and try to basically tell

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.770
people, spread the message,
that there's good

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:07.070
opportunities in the
United States.

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:12.850
The most famous of these
ambitious British artisans who

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:15.240
came to the United States is
a man named Samuel Slater.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.490
You've maybe heard of him.

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:21.760
High school textbooks usually
attribute him as the father of

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.370
the American Industrial
Revolution.

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:25.750
It's a bit of an overstatement,
but there's a

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.520
lot of truth to it.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.610
When he arrived in New York
looking for work, a man named

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:34.360
Moses Brown, one of the other
founders of Brown University,

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.250
heard about him and actually
made him an

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:37.210
offer he couldn't refuse.

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:40.520
So Samuel Slater came up to
Pawtucket, Rhode Island to

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:44.430
create the first textile
mill in the area.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:47.780
And there's now actually a
museum where you can visit

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:48.900
Slater Mills.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:53.030
And this was really the very
early industrialization

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:55.960
process in the United States,
but done through Illicit

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.480
acquisition of machinery and
illicit acquisition of the

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:03.860
skilled workers necessary
to work the machinery.

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:06.010
It's not just an issue of
patents, though, it's also a

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:07.090
copyright story.

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:13.940
So a famous battle, actually,
in the 19th century between

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.040
Charles Dickens in the
United States.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:21.590
Now, right, it's Steven
Spielberg and other producers

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:24.610
of art and so on, upset that
their movies appear overnight

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:27.160
in China on the black
market, and so on.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.610
Music industry and Hollywood
and so on are obviously

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:31.250
tremendously upset.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:34.610
But the equivalent in the 19th
century would have been people

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:35.490
like Charles Dickens.

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:38.530
He's only the most famous one,
but there are many of them.

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:40.590
So when he came to the United
States to tour, to do

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:43.510
readings, he was, of course,
thrilled that he had so many

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:45.180
fans on this side
of the ocean.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.710
But he was really not very happy
to find out that all his

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:50.960
books were easily obtainable
without him

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.620
seeing any of the proceeds.

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.720
In fact, his publisher had
nothing to do with it.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.610
He got no money, royalties,
at all.

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:02.860
And for a number of decades,
he actually was screaming

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.770
bloody murder to the US federal
government to please

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:05.860
do something about this.

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:09.390
And the US government turned
a blind eye and

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:11.010
turned a deaf ear.

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:16.240
And it wasn't, in fact, until
people like Mark Twain came

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:20.290
along and had their own
self-interest in intellectual

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:21.850
property protection.

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:24.860
In other words, when the United
States actually was

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.610
producing intellectual property
of its own, did the

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:30.790
country discover, oh yeah, maybe
there's actually real

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:34.330
logic here for protecting
intellectual property.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.970
So the United States goes in a
relatively short period of

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:42.640
time from being at the
forefront of piracy,

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:47.010
intellectual property theft, to
become the world's foremost

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:51.550
advocate of protection of
intellectual property,

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:57.420
conveniently forgetting
about it illicit past.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:59.940
And again, it wasn't
just Charles

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:00.860
Dickens and Mark Twain.

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:02.640
They're just representative
of this debate.

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:06.950
So if we were to fast forward
to today, the most benign

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:09.790
reading of what the relevance
of that historical story is

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:12.900
for today is that China and
other countries really are not

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:16.420
going to get totally on-board
intellectual property

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:20.540
protection until they actually
develop much stronger

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:23.450
self-interest, their own

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:25.840
intellectual property to protect.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.470
So in other words, the most
benign reading of the

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.800
situation is that we're really
just going through growing

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.200
pains here.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:39.080
If China follows in some form or
fashion US past steps, that

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:44.440
in fact, it will become a
protector, not just an evader

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.550
of intellectual property laws.

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:50.400
Another dominant story in the
book carried out throughout,

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.520
but in some chapters more
prominent than others, is a

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.560
story about borders.

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.670
And right now, as you all know,
it's a hot topic in the

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:59.270
news, especially in relation
to immigration control.

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:03.000
Especially, actually, in the
West, here in California.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.090
And the dominant mantra in
Washington about borders is,

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:11.000
in fact, we can't have any
fundamental immigration reform

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.940
right now until we so-called
regain control of our border.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:19.170
Well, the very language of
regaining control of our

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:21.790
border suggests it was
ever under control

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:22.540
in the first place.

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:22.760
Right?

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.620
You're like, restoring something
to its previous

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.470
idyllic status of being
under control.

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:29.010
But it never existed.

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:31.350
This is kind of a
mythical past.

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:34.140
And I would argue that the
border debate in Washington

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:37.950
and elsewhere has suffered
from a severe case of

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:42.970
historical amnesia, pretending
that, in fact, we're today

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:47.660
facing an unprecedented border
threat, when in fact, quite

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:52.300
arguably, the US-Mexico border
is today more policed, more

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:58.420
surveilled, more militarized,
more monitored, and flooded

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:03.160
with federal resources to seal
it by far than any other time

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.109
in American history.

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:07.890
So the norm is actually out
of control borders, for

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:09.420
better or for worse.

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.950
Not just the US-Mexico border,
but the US-Canada border.

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:13.910
Seaports as well.

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:16.010
And much of the history of the
United States is one of

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:22.609
gradually trying to gain some
semblance of control over air,

00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:25.569
sea, and land flows coming
into the country.

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:28.390
But for much of the nation's
history, it was basically a

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:30.260
wide open story.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.590
They just didn't have the
capacity to even pretend to be

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:36.220
able to control these spaces.

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:40.130
All the attention today is on
Mexico and Mexican migrants

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:41.390
crossing the border.

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:45.020
But one thing I find ironic is
the first migrants who caught

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:47.890
the attention of US authorities
crossing the

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:51.770
border, which was concerned
the serious policy threat,

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:55.310
were actually Chinese coming
from Mexico, not Mexicans.

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:59.170
After the Chinese Exclusion Act
in the late 19th century

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:01.820
right here in San Francisco,
they shut the front door to

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:03.720
entry of Chinese laborers.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:04.990
And they didn't stop coming.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:07.350
They were basically dispersed.

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:10.480
And so they start coming in
across the Canadian border.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.960
They were diverted to Canada,
and came across that border.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.810
Then they were diverted to
Mexico, and started coming

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:17.660
across the US-Mexico border.

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:20.900
So towns like Juarez, and
Tijuana, and so became known

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:24.620
as depots or hubs for
smuggling people.

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.350
And they weren't Mexicans
being smuggled.

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:27.630
They were Chinese and

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:29.610
nationals from other countries.

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:32.950
In fact, Mexicans were so taken
for granted, it was

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:35.360
basically overlooked
as a problem.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.490
They just came and go as they
wanted, and US authorities

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:40.420
didn't really see that
as a problem.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:44.460
It was so overlooked, so taken
for granted as a non-issue,

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.490
that one way you snuck across
the border from Mexico was to

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:49.400
pretend to be Mexican.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.980
It's hard to imagine today that
that would work as a way

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:53.180
of coming into the
United States.

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:56.470
But in fact, one effort was to
kind of blend in with the

00:18:56.470 --> 00:19:00.850
crowds of workers going back and
forth say, across the the

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:06.270
bridge between Juarez
and El Paso, Texas.

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:09.450
Fast forward to today.

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:12.020
It's interesting that in
recent decades, there's

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:15.730
actually been a new influx of
Chinese trying to come into

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:16.580
the country.

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:19.230
And as they were able to
actually put a stop on

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:24.970
maritime smuggling of Chinese
coming in directly, they

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:27.980
actually were then diverted
again, as history showed us in

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:32.810
the past, smuggled in across the
Canadian border and across

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:33.730
the Mexican border.

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:37.150
So again, there's a sense of
historical deja vu if, in

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:40.390
fact, in the policy debate, they
actually we're interested

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:46.390
in looking back more than
a few years or decades.

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:49.250
There's also an interesting
technology story, perhaps

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:53.350
particular of interest to you
folks here at Google, about

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:56.740
the importance of new
technologies in fueling

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.290
illicit trades of
various sort.

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:02.270
The mantra in policy circles
about transnational organized

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:05.180
crime, drug trafficking, migrant
smuggling, and so on

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:10.580
today is that they're all
greatly aided by new

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:14.720
technologies and revolutions
in communication and

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:15.120
transportation.

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.110
And it's all true.

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:20.060
Just like new technologies and
transportation methods

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:23.100
facilitate legal flows across
borders, they obviously also

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.700
facilitate illegal flows.

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:29.150
But from a larger historical
perspective, it's pretty clear

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:30.720
that this is just the
latest chapter in a

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.520
very, very old story.

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:37.110
And I mean basically, if we
go back to the origins of

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:38.470
transoceanic commerce--

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:41.020
the invention the steamship, the
invention of the railroad,

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:43.760
the invention of the automobile,
the airplane, the

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.410
telegraph, the telephone--

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:49.030
all these inventions, long
before globalization became a

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:52.420
buzzword that we're all now
familiar with, radically

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:57.580
altered cross border flows,
both legal and illegal.

00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:02.990
And it's not just a story about
government authorities

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:07.710
increasingly under siege and
unable and out of control, as

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:10.070
these illicit actors are
taking advantage of new

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:11.190
technologies.

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:13.080
In fact, it's very much
a two-way street, a

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.020
double-edged sword.

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:17.350
So the authorities are also
taking advantage of these new

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:18.040
technologies.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:21.230
So let me just give you a
couple examples of that.

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:23.450
The invention of the telephone
greatly aided

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.500
bootleggers in the 1920s.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.290
And they started actually
using the telephone to

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:31.490
basically plan their operations,
coordinated

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:32.530
drops, and so on.

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:33.920
It was very effective.

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.160
And they were speaking quite
openly on the telephone,

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:40.050
because they've never heard of
anything called wiretapping.

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:46.240
Yet wiretapping became a bread
and butter basic law

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.790
enforcement tool, technique,
that was first developed with

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:53.055
the invention of the telephone
and with bootleggers adopting

00:21:53.055 --> 00:21:57.040
it as a favored method
of doing business.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:00.230
At the time, it was considered
so radical, so new, so

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:03.960
revolutionary as a law
enforcement tool that the

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.150
first bootlegger to be busted
with it, a guy named Olmstead

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:10.830
in Seattle, the case went all
the way to the Supreme Court.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:13.660
It was just unheard of that the
police could listen in on

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:14.470
telephone lines.

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:16.140
Now we just sort of take
it for granted.

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:19.890
If you've gone to the right
paperwork, have a court order,

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:23.610
and so on, you can do
wiretapping it's hard to

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:25.830
imagine law enforcement actually
being able to do its

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:28.800
job in some cases without
wiretapping.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.070
The very show, the HBO show
"The Wire," right?

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:33.590
It was all based on the ability
of wiretapping.

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:36.660
Well, the very origins of that
is in the invention of the

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:41.460
telephone and in the Prohibition
era and so on.

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.360
Our Fourth Amendment, which
basically protection against

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:49.230
unreasonable search and seizure,
the origins of it are

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:54.720
actually anger at British
customs officials in the late

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:59.330
colonial period, basically very
abusive, heavy-handed

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:02.480
searches and seizures of US
vessels, and warehouses, and

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:05.230
so on looking for
smuggled goods.

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:09.440
So when they actually wrote
these amendments up, they had

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.590
this in the back
of their mind.

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:13.020
Well, I would argue and others
have argued that there's been

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:19.060
a loosening of Fourth Amendment
rights over time.

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:22.160
And some of that loosening
has happened with

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.600
battles over smuggling.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.480
And it's very clear in the
case of Prohibition.

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:29.780
The first ability to actually
look at automobiles, to search

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:33.130
automobiles, well, the
justification was, maybe it's

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:35.260
coming across the border
from Canada.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:38.170
Maybe it's carrying alcohol.

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:41.980
You look at the kind of things
that you can now search that

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.730
didn't even exist before that
are sources of information for

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:45.100
authorities.

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:47.560
So when you cross a border,
the power of the federal

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:51.690
government is nowhere stronger
legally than at the point

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:53.320
where you're entering
United States.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.420
They can do pretty much,
not anything to you.

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:58.090
But they can do a lot more than
they can anywhere else.

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:00.480
And that includes looking
through your

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.570
belongings, your clothes.

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:04.520
Unfortunately, sometimes
including your body.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.750
But it also includes looking
through your telephone, your

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:09.330
hard drive, your computer.

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:12.470
All these new technologies are
also enormously important

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:15.170
sources of information and
perfectly legitimate things

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:16.970
that authorities
can now search.

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:19.930
So my bottom line here is that
we need to see technology as

00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:24.460
not just enabling law evasion
in the history of smuggling,

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:30.690
but also greatly empowering the
federal government in its

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:32.850
efforts to enforce the law.

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:40.530
Obviously, the big story in
recent weeks has been the NSA.

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:45.050
But this is all fueled by
counter-terrorism and so on.

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:48.020
The origins, I would argue, is
not in counter-terrorism.

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:51.360
The origins are actually
in counter-smuggling.

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.410
It's just that when
anti-terrorism becomes the

00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:58.500
dominant motivation, then that
becomes the main driving force

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:01.490
for surveillance and so on.

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:06.980
The last thing I want to talk
about a bit is, everyone talks

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:09.090
about the United States
as a superpower.

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:11.810
And what they usually mean about
that is that it's the

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:14.230
world's largest economy.

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:15.720
And it obviously is the world's

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:18.600
foremost military power.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:21.330
But I would also emphasize that
it's also the world's

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:23.970
foremost policing power.

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:26.020
A sort of interesting narrative
I weave through the

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:29.760
book is that even as US
authorities are being often

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:33.610
overwhelmed in a sense of siege
by illicit cross border

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:37.930
actors of various sorts over
years and decades, there's

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:41.140
simultaneously an empowering
of the federal government.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:45.970
And it's no surprise that this
country has the largest prison

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:50.230
population in the world at a
time when it also has the most

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:51.340
draconian--

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:52.720
not the most draconian
drug laws.

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:56.280
But drug laws are, in fact,
the single most important

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.330
incarcerater in this country.

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:01.860
So the United States has, I
believe, about 25% of the

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:04.890
world's incarcerated population,
but only 5% of the

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:06.140
world's population.

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:09.540
It puts more people in jail for
drug law violations than

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:13.030
Western Europe puts in jail for
all violations combined.

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:13.280
Right?

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:16.020
So there's a certain
zealousness, if you will,

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:17.430
about enforcing drug laws.

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:19.970
And it's not the only thing
filling our jails, but it's

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:23.060
the single most important one.

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:26.120
So the profile, the face of
the federal government's

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:29.730
criminal justice apparatus, has
been profoundly shaped by

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:31.180
anti-smuggling efforts.

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:33.900
In the modern era, most
profoundly by drug

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:34.400
enforcement.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:38.170
But I would also argue
increasingly by immigration

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:39.420
law enforcement.

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:41.350
But it goes all the way
back to the founding.

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:45.510
So in a country that was
allergic to the very idea of

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:50.200
creating a strong federal
policing apparatus, there was

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:55.690
a recognition that you had to
actually have some capacity to

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:57.180
police trade.

00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:00.180
After all, federal government
had no source of revenue other

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:04.160
than a very modest
impost on trade.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.560
Well, how do you actually have
the policing capacity to

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:07.240
enforce it?

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.530
You have to create
a custom service.

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:11.420
So one of the first pillars,
founding pillars of the

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:14.450
federal government, was in
fact the custom service.

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:18.450
It's one thing these previously
fragmented colonies

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:20.780
could all agree on.

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:24.350
And so the very sort of raison
d'etre of having a federal

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:27.560
government which raises revenue
was actually to have

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:32.570
some capacity to enforce customs
duties and not let the

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:36.840
smugglers completely get
away with everything.

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.610
Now I want to give you the
impression that my book argues

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:42.050
that nothing's changed in 300
years, and that we shouldn't

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:45.950
be concerned about these various
elicit cross border

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:46.830
activities today.

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:48.760
In fact, far from that.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:51.330
It's a very serious problem
and deserving

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:53.825
of a lot more attention.

00:27:53.825 --> 00:27:56.650
But part of giving it more
serious attention, I think, is

00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:59.950
recognizing how important it's
actually been historically,

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:03.500
not just as a contemporary new
and different phenomena.

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:06.410
And I don't want to suggest that
basically it's all story

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:09.330
of continuity rather than
change, but the bottom line of

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:16.480
the book is in a debate about
global organized crime and so

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:20.270
on that emphasizes change and
transformation so much, we

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:22.460
also need to see patterns
of continuity.

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:26.480
So as Mark Twain liked
to put it, history

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.350
does not repeat itself.

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:29.980
But in fact, does rhyme.

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:31.210
So I kind of put it
better than him.

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:32.960
So that's kind of the takeaway
message of the book.

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.626
Thank you so much.

00:28:34.626 --> 00:28:39.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.360
MALE SPEAKER: What exactly
makes an illicit product?

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:44.210
It's not necessarily something
that's just

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:45.470
illegal itself, right?

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:47.570
But something that maybe has
a secondhand market that's

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:52.230
willing people to go behind the
backs of the law to make

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:53.990
money off of it?

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:57.080
PETER ANDREAS: Actually, for the
purposes of the book and

00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:58.670
definition I use in
the book, it is in

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:00.100
fact something unlawful.

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:04.220
So the law has to be
broken for it to be

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:07.300
included in the book.

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:08.510
I couldn't include everything.

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:11.290
So in fact, I don't have the
book in front of me, but I do

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:15.330
have a definition of smuggling
that is basically to bring in

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:21.220
or take out clandestinely
without authorization.

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:23.075
But the point is, that leaves
open it could be people.

00:29:23.075 --> 00:29:24.730
It could be goods.

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:27.460
It could be money.

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:29.000
It could the animals.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.620
And so one striking thing is
that that definition applies,

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:35.880
I think, over a 30-year period,
but the very content

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.650
of what's being smuggle
changes over time

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:40.140
dramatically.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:44.790
So at one point in time, there
were no endangered species

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:45.500
legislation.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:45.750
Right?

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:48.380
So there's no wildlife, black
market and wildlife trade.

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:50.490
And now, it's actually a
thriving industry, partly

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:54.820
because in the last 30-40
years, we actually have

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:59.240
protections that an unintended
perverse side effect has been

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.160
to create a thriving
black market.

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:04.170
So good for you to ask that
question, because a basic

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:06.835
definitional issue is
at stake here now.

00:30:06.835 --> 00:30:11.730
Now typically, you can
categorize these things as

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:14.820
untaxed activities.

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:15.700
Stolen.

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:17.700
So basically, things
that stolen and

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:19.940
then crossing borders.

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:21.170
Or prohibited.

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:22.980
Outright prohibitions.

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:27.980
And early in history, much
of what is of concern is

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:31.400
basically tax evasion.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:34.750
But as history progresses,
there's more and more things

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:37.080
that are actually in the
outright prohibited category,

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:38.300
like drugs and so on.

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:41.020
Notice I hardly said anything
about drug trafficking, right?

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:43.840
The reason is, it's the longest
chapter in the book.

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.460
But it's a 20th century story.

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:50.840
So it's a relative late comer
to a much larger important

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:54.450
story of smuggling and anti
smuggling campaigns in US

00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:56.940
history, though arguably the
single most important one in

00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:59.680
terms of its consequences
and longevity.

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.650
I mean, it's a 100-year
drug war, if you will.

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:07.150
I also, on this topic, I teach
a senior seminar, just 20

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:11.370
students, typically seniors,
doing research papers on

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:14.370
states in illegal
global markets.

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:17.590
And basically, what we do is we
spend much of the semester

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:20.240
studying the best known
illicit trades.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:24.410
Drug trafficking, migrant
smuggling, sex trafficking,

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:27.870
money laundering, arms trade,
intellectual property theft.

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:31.000
But then we devote the last
few weeks of the semester

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.880
where students have done
research on illicit markets

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.250
and trades that we haven't
covered in class.

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:39.530
So I've actually learned, I've
been teaching that seminar off

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:41.190
and on for the last decade.

00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:44.150
I've learned as much from my
students from my classes as

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:47.390
they've learned from me giving
them the more conventional

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:49.120
illicit trades that everyone
knows about.

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:53.820
So I never knew there was a bear
bile trade, for example.

00:31:53.820 --> 00:32:00.100
I learned a lot about some
exotic drugs that otherwise,

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:03.700
other than the meth, and
marijuana, and cocaine, and

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:10.880
heroin, a lot of the
human organ trade.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:13.440
The cadaver trade.

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.830
There's a black market in
cadavers that we rarely even

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:18.390
talk about.

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:19.320
I could go on and on.

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:23.520
But basically, students come up
with research projects on

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:27.130
illicit trades not otherwise
covered in the class.

00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:28.770
So those are the two classes
I teach related to this.

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:31.750
I also teach some basic
introduction to international

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:34.430
relations, a lecture class.

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:37.740
And also, a graduate seminar
on the post-Cold

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:39.120
War conflict issues.

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:41.460
So, security issues.

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:44.020
AUDIENCE: In seeing things about
the era of Prohibition

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:47.490
in this country, I thought to
myself, that's probably one of

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:50.890
the reasons why there's such
fear and anger at the United

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:54.750
States government when it tries
to get additional powers

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:57.350
or enforce the powers that
it supposedly has.

00:32:57.350 --> 00:33:01.830
And in the last decade, we've
seen great outcries against

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:06.950
the United States from the Tea
Party and others saying that

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:08.920
the federal government is
basically an evil thing and we

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:13.550
should not allow it to have any
powers, or increase its

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:15.260
powers at all.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:19.930
But it seems to me it goes much,
much further back than

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:20.710
Prohibition.

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:22.980
So, you've kind of opened
my eyes to that.

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:27.120
Can you talk about smuggling,
and powers, and fears, and

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:29.540
oppositions to governments
in general?

00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:30.500
PETER ANDREAS: Yeah.

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:33.680
I don't know if I can fully
answer that question, since it

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:36.940
deserves a lot more attention
than just a quick answer.

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:43.800
But it's not just myth that the
country was founded in a

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:48.390
kind of anti-statused political
culture and

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:50.390
environment.

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:55.070
But as I mentioned earlier very
briefly, the ability to

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:57.845
regulate trade to some extent in
order to raise the minimal

00:33:57.845 --> 00:34:00.400
amount of revenue to have a
functioning government, even

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:04.380
the most extreme libertarian
probably thinks there should

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:07.810
be some form of government,
and that means

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:08.900
revenue to run it.

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:09.690
Right?

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:14.679
And so a 5% impost on trade
helps in that respect.

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:19.590
There was no national
income tax until

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:22.250
early in the 20th century.

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:24.920
So much of the nation's history
is one of federal

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:28.100
government dependence almost
exclusively on a

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:31.370
modest tax on trade.

00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:34.699
And its policing powers were
very constrained at the

00:34:34.699 --> 00:34:35.560
federal level.

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:38.179
We have local and state
police, and so on.

00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:40.489
Well, the federal government,
the cornerstone of its

00:34:40.489 --> 00:34:42.045
policing powers were
actually regulation

00:34:42.045 --> 00:34:44.960
of interstate commerce.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:48.590
And so it's fascinating to me as
they used that basic power

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:52.969
to then extend to illicit trades
of various sorts, not

00:34:52.969 --> 00:35:00.990
just taxing trade, but other
vices that they want to stop

00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:02.330
was based on that--

00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:06.770
the first anti-sex trafficking
laws in the United States

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:09.550
written in the 20th century
were party based on this.

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:12.950
The Mann Act, for example.

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:18.150
So there has been, whether one
likes it or not, a kind of

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:23.970
creeping federal policing power
through decades, in fact

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:27.820
centuries, of fighting various
illicit trades.

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:30.770
Government officials in some
ways end up very bruised and

00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:32.910
battered through
the experience,

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:35.140
but also more empowered.

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:38.770
So Prohibition was
a lesson in--

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:41.360
it was almost an embarrassment
to the federal government in

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:43.510
terms of just huge amounts
of corruption.

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:48.240
Probably the most corrupt period
in American history was

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:51.100
the corruption in actually
organized crime and violence

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:52.760
created by that.

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:56.360
But in some ways, the, federal
government, the legacy of

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:57.790
that, was more empowerment.

00:35:57.790 --> 00:36:01.670
And so the agencies and
officials and strategies

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:04.290
developed during Prohibition,
they then just turned around

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:06.730
and applied to drugs.

00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:06.990
Right?

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:11.210
So alcohol prohibition was
lifted, but drug prohibitions

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:13.710
started in 1914 were not.

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:17.100
In fact, they got stricter
and stricter over time.

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:23.680
In fact, America's first drug
czar, if you will, actually

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:29.200
earned his stripes first
inviting the alcohol trade.

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:32.940
AUDIENCE: So you made a really
clean case in some sense for

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:35.970
the IP situation, in which a
country potentially flips its

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:38.320
position because it's
now producing that.

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.200
And I'm wondering to what extent
that parallels, or are

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:44.400
there other cases
that for like--

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.730
so we've been talking
about drugs.

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:49.100
So is there a parallel in terms
of rationale for that?

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:52.320
Or what are the ways in which
societies take ownership over,

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:55.270
and then start making
things illegal?

00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:58.610
I mean, sex trafficking,
everyone produces humans.

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:01.470
Why is it that some people have
decided that they need

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:03.320
protection, and others
perhaps haven't?

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:06.940
Like I mean, are there parallels
in terms of when

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:08.790
people take ownership and decide
to make things illicit

00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:10.800
or prohibited?

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:11.860
PETER ANDREAS: That's
a good question.

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:16.140
The IP theft debate, I think
is as you pointed out, the

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:19.460
most transparent flip.

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:24.310
And not only flipping, but
forgetting, of the past.

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:31.250
But in the other cases, it's not
so obviously a particular

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:33.990
economic self-interest
going on.

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:40.480
The turnaround right now going
on about marijuana in this

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:42.760
country, especially in Colorado,
which I was in

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:46.280
Denver just a couple days, or
Washington State and so on,

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:50.827
it's very hard to actually
pinpoint that turnaround in

00:37:50.827 --> 00:37:56.370
laws to some particular
economic interest.

00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:59.440
Alcohol prohibition.

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.850
Some very powerful economic
interests

00:38:01.850 --> 00:38:04.490
were actually subverted.

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:09.110
Brewing was the fifth largest
industry in the country, I

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:12.190
believe, when they still
had Prohibition.

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:15.670
It did take very powerful rich
people like the DuPonts and so

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:19.210
on turning against Prohibition
to make people realize, to

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:23.310
help people realize, that
these were dumb laws.

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:28.150
But I'd be curious to think
through some of the parallels

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:31.860
that it sounds like you maybe
have seen that I haven't

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.420
latched onto yet.

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:35.250
It's not that hard see the
connection say, for example,

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:37.240
sex trafficking.

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:42.830
There, actually, I'm in the
critique of the International

00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:44.660
Campaign Against
Sex-Trafficking, which the US

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:47.640
is very much at the forefront
of, is that it seems more

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:50.450
intent on criminalizing the
trade than actually protecting

00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:52.480
the rights of those
being trafficked.

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:56.040
That's the basic critique, I
would say, of those who have

00:38:56.040 --> 00:39:00.670
found the whole campaign
lacking and having some

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:02.180
negative repercussions.

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:04.630
Driving it more underground
in some ways and making

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:07.530
trafficked women even more
vulnerable depending on their

00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:09.950
pimps, and so on.

00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:14.725
I think maybe a case would be
the slave trade, where an

00:39:14.725 --> 00:39:17.810
extraordinarily divided country
over the slavery

00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:19.460
issue, and they just
basically punted.

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:22.060
They put a pause on making
a decision at the time of

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:23.200
independence.

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.760
And just sort of said, we'll
deal with that later.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:29.470
So they said, freedom, but
only for some of us.

00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:33.140
But it actually in that case
took a full-blown civil war to

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:38.030
actually take ownership in a
way that people could feel

00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:42.575
unified in saying that slavery
should not exist.

00:39:42.575 --> 00:39:42.900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:45.040
PETER ANDREAS: Yeah, right.

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:46.760
You know, I didn't even
mention it, frankly.

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:49.260
Now that I brought it up,
slave trafficking.

00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:55.380
There was a period between 1808
and the Civil War where

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:58.390
bringing in more slaves was
actually banned at the federal

00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:01.310
level, but the slave trade
domestically and slavery

00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:04.620
domestically in the South was
completely allowed legally.

00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:07.086
And so it was a weird situation
where you actually

00:40:07.086 --> 00:40:09.290
had the criminalization
international slave trade,

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:12.910
including by the United States,
but a kind of not just

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:18.840
tolerance, but state backing
of slavery domestically.

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:20.860
But it wasn't until after a war
that you actually had more

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:24.210
of a unified view of
that as something

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:25.500
that should be banned.

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:32.710
It's arguably the most
successful case of abolishing

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:34.700
an illicit trade.

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:38.490
And arguably, a huge thing that
made it possible was that

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:44.170
the state was no longer backing
slavery domestically.

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:48.010
And the international slave
trade pretty much dried up

00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:51.930
once, at the local level where
slaves were being used, you no

00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:54.110
longer had the support
of governments.

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:59.990
