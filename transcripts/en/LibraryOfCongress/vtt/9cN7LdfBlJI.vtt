00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From The Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.750
&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome the 14th Librarian

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.510
of the Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:50.420
[ Applause ]

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.720
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Wow.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.730
Good evening and welcome to
the 2016 National Book Festival

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.940
Gala Celebration.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.560
This is my first public event as
the new Librarian of Congress,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:20.420
and you guys [applause] - and
it's also my first opportunity

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.530
to welcome a large gathering
to your nation's Library.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.830
Thank you.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.130
Thank you.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.430
Thank you.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.730
This is a wonderful,
wonderful way to begin.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.610
Our program this evening is
being live streamed on YouTube,

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.960
so thousands of people outside
of this room and outside

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.640
of Washington are able to join us,
and I think that's so important.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.820
To be able to share the collections
and programs of The Library

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.940
of Congress with as many people
as possible is my priority

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:54.190
as Librarian, and it also builds on
the legacy of my 13 predecessors.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.680
Now this event is one of
the highlights every year,

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.910
and I am honored to
be here with you.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.510
It's a National Book Festival

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.270
that brings together our
greatest authors, poets,

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.920
illustrators with their many
fans, and I'm one of them,

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.140
that includes all of you
joining us here tonight.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.320
I want to thank a few people
because no event like this happens

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.360
without a lot of work by
a lot of different people.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.320
We have members of Congress here.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.810 position:56%
The United States Congress has built
and sustained this Library and I'm

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.450
so appreciative that you're here
to celebrate this achievement.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.190
The Library of Congress is
one of the greatest gifts,

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.280
the legacies that the
Congress has given.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.650
Thank you.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.310
Also, thank you to the Embassies
of Italy, Latvia, Mexico,

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.470
Spain and Uruguay for providing
us with such wonderful talent

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.640
for international and
[inaudible] stages.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.010
I want to say a special hello
to Ambassador Carlos Gianelli

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.510
of Uruguay who is with us tonight.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:08.290
[ Applause ]

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.000
Also joining us this
evening are the many sponsors

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.290
who make this event possible.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.510
Mr. David Rubenstein,
the Festival's Co-Chair.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:24.040
[ Applause ]

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.510
AARP - you may clap.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.040
[ Applause ]

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.510
The Institute of Museum
and Library Services.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.110
[ Applause ]

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.510
The Washington Post.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.040
[ Applause ]

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:49.010
Wells Fargo, FedEx.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.310
[ Applause ]

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.510
Scholastic, The National
Endowment for the Arts.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.220
[ Applause ]

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.250
The James Madison Council
of the Library of Congress.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.480
[ Applause ]

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.050
And there are many others.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.470
Because of your generosity
this Festival,

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.060
and I think this is the
most important part,

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.380
is completely free to the public.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.510
So thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.070
[ Applause ]

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.160
Plus there are more than a thousand
volunteers who give their time -

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.440
Library of Congress staff, the
general public, the Junior League

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.550
of Washington, and our introducers
from the Washington Post,

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.210
National Public Radio and
numerous other media organizations.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:46.490 position:56%
And speaking of Library staff I have
had the privilege to get to know

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.140
so many of them in a short period
of time, and more than two dozen

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.290
of them have worked for nearly a
year on planning tomorrow's events

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.080
which will offer the most
impressive lineup of authors

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.550
in the 16-year history
of the Festival.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:08.410
I'd especially like to acknowledge
Festival organizers, Guy, Sue,

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.510
Jean and Maureen, please stand up.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:25.040
[ Applause ]

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.920
My first meeting right after
the swearing in was a briefing

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:35.190
on the Book Festival, and I felt
like I was at the Command Center.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.580
[laughter] It was something
and it was filmed by CNN,

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.970
so you might see it this weekend.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.950
The beautiful image you see
behind me is our Festival poster,

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.940
it was designed by Uko Sumizu
[Assumed Spelling] and she wanted

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:55.290 position:56%
to convey the idea that books take
us on journeys, they open up a world

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.220
of possibilities, they
make us ask questions

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.420
and encourage us to
look for answers.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.320
They are essential to
the human experience.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.710
And I remember my parents giving
me books when I was a little girl

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:15.080
and I remember vividly the moment
when I realized those symbols

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.130
on a page were words, words
that translated into ideas

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.700
and stories, and I was hooked.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.510
Reading and a love of reading
literally changed my life.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.200
And, as Frederick Douglas
said, once you learn

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.560
to read you will be forever free,
you will be free to explore,

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.490
to dream and make your own history.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:45.360
Our wonderful Festival Co-Chairman,
the patriotic philanthropist,

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.530
David Rubenstein, was also
touched by the power of books.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.940
When he was growing up in
Baltimore his dad would send him

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.770
to the Enoch Pratt Free Library.

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.660
I know a little something
about that place.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.740 position:56%
Where he would check out the maximum
number of books allowed each week,

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.700
12, he finished before
the week was out.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.870 position:56%
And he has said that the ability to
read and the love of reading, quote,

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.360
got me where I am today, and
he has called reading one

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.130
of the joys of my life.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.340
And, David, I do second
that emotion.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.450
But celebrating reading,
as he has enabled us to do

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.600
with his extraordinary support
of the National Book Festival,

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.400
is only a part of his mission.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:36.420
He's also troubled, as many of us
are, by the persistent struggles

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:40.380
in our country and around
the world with illiteracy.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.190
His dedication to make
sure every child

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:48.460
and adult shares the opportunity
and experience of reading moved him

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:53.640 position:56%
to establish and support The
Library of Congress Literacy Awards.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.720
The awards recognize organizations

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.400
that have made outstanding
contributions to improve literacy,

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.430
encourage the continuing
development of innovative methods

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:07.640
for combatting illiteracy, and
support the wide dissemination

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.010
of the most effective practices.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:15.770
By recognizing current achievements
the awards seek to inspire others,

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:19.990
organizations, foundations and
other private sector groups

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:23.240
to become involved in
battling illiteracy.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:28.820
In a few short years those awards
have provided more than $1 million

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.680
to support dozens of organizations,

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.890
both in the United
States and the world.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:46.870
I think there's a video.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:52.010
[laughter]

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:53.310
[ Video ]

00:08:53.310 --> 00:09:02.180
&gt;&gt; Here at The Library of
Congress it's our mission

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:06.910
to provide the American people with
a rich, diverse, enduring source

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:11.590
of knowledge and the ability
to read and write is critical

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:13.810
to fulfilling that mission.

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:16.650
It's why we support the
thousands of organizations

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:21.740
around the world working to promote
literacy, advocating for change,

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:28.080 position:56%
and empowering families, adults and
children to learn to read and write.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.900
Literacy offers so many
life-enhancing benefits.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:41.430
People who can read and do read are
healthier, happier and live longer.

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:47.160
They are more likely to
get preventative healthcare

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:55.190
and less likely to go
to an emergency room.

00:09:55.190 --> 00:10:00.050
Globally women and girls who
are educated have fewer children

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:06.950
and those that they do have
are twice as likely to survive.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.250
Everyone benefits from literacy.

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:25.900 position:56%
For every 1% increase in a country's
literacy rate there's a permanent

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:29.270
1.5% increase in their
gross domestic product.

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:30.570
David M. Rubenstein's
creative vision

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:32.030
and generosity support The Library
of Congress Literacy Awards.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:33.470
Each year the Literacy Awards
program recognizes some

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:35.330 position:56%
of the most innovative and effective
organizations promoting literacy

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:36.630
in the United States
and around the world.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:37.930
Through these awards we
celebrate literacy organizations

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:39.230
and the dedicated people
who through passion

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:40.530
and hard work are bringing
education and literacy

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:41.830
to an unprecedented number
of people around the globe.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:43.580 position:56%
We hope to inspire others to emulate
these groups and to do their part

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.140
to help end illiteracy in their
own communities and beyond.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.440
We still have a long way to go,

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.240
together we're making
tremendous progress.

David M. Rubenstein
prizewinner, WETA Reading Rockets.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:41.680
We are grateful to David M.
Rubenstein for his vision

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:45.600
and commitment to literacy in
America and throughout the world.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.200 position:56%
More than 60 organizations have been
recognized by the program and more

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.510
than 25 million people have been
served by those organizations.

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:56.540

welcome David M. Rubenstein,

Co-Chairman of the National Book
Festival and the creator and sponsor

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.920
of The Library of Congress
Literacy Awards.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.910
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
Thank you very much.

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:09.500
My mother did not make that movie.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:15.730
I want to just express on behalf
of all Americans our delight

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:19.510
that Carla Hayden is now
the Librarian of Congress.

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:26.060
[ Applause ]

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:28.350
Obviously, we've had a lot of
great Librarians of Congress,

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:31.000
but somehow we've never had a
woman be Librarian of Congress,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.110
we've never had a person of
color be a Librarian of Congress,

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:36.440
and now we have a perfect
combination.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.340
So I think it's long
overdue, and we have a person

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.760
who is extraordinarily
interested in books.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.960
She has also some other features
that I can't resist mentioning.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:51.210
She came from Baltimore,
where I'm from.

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.360
[applause] She was head of
the Enoch Pratt Library,

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.500 position:56%
which gave me my first library card.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.970 position:56%
[applause] She has a graduate degree

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:00.380
from the University
of Chicago, as do I.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:04.480
And she loves to read books
and encourage other people

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.490
to read books, and no quality
could be more important

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:08.790
in a Librarian of Congress.

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:12.490
So, Carla, we're very much
indebted to you for taking this job

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:16.130
at a salary decrease from
what you had in Baltimore,

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:20.380
but public service is very
important and you will be rewarded

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:23.150
in Heaven no doubt
for having done this.

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:29.540
[applause] I realize
all of you came to hear

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:32.210
about the National Book
Festival, and it's spectacular,

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:33.660
it's an incredible event.

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.630
It was conceived of 16 years ago
really with an idea that Laura Bush

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:43.380
at the inaugural events asked Jim
Billington, then the Librarian

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.460 position:56%
of Congress, if you have a National
Book Festival, she had one in Texas,

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:48.670
and he said, no, but we'll get one.

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.770
And Laura Bush and
he put it together.

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:53.170
It's now an incredible
event with more

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:57.960
than 100,000 people will be there
tomorrow, more than 125 authors.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.770
Maria has lined up
spectacular groups

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:01.850
of authors, many of you are here.

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:05.300 position:56%
Just as an American I want to thank
you for taking the time to come here

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.180
because you can't imagine
how many people are delighted

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.670
to meet the authors, to hear
them read from their books,

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:14.530
to have questions of them and
to get autographs from them.

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:19.100
It's a spectacular event, and as
the Librarian said, it's free.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:21.190
And so it's going to
be a great event.

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:22.730
For those who haven't been there

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:26.090
yet you will never
really forget this event.

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:30.770
We normally go right into to have
some authors and you'll hear them

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:33.790 position:56%
in a moment, but we just thought
tonight it would be a good idea just

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:37.050 position:56%
to remind all of you who love books,
and everybody here loves books

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:39.260
and loves reading books
and loves making certain

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:44.560
that other people are encouraged to
read books, that we are a majority

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:48.020
but not as much a majority
as we should be.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:53.080
It's hard to believe this,
but roughly 14% of Americans

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.770
in our country, the richest
country in the world, cannot read,

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.830
they're illiterate,
functionally illiterate.

00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:59.150
Maybe they can read a stop sign,

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.290
maybe they can sign
their name a bit,

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.750
but they can't really read
past the third grade level.

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:06.750
That's 14% of Americans,
one-seventh of Americans.

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:12.010 position:56%
If you are illiterate you have a
very modest chance of enjoying life.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:17.100 position:56%
So many people who cannot read earn
much less, on average about 40% less

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.560
than people who are literate,
but there are other problems.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.100
If you cannot read you have a
much greater chance of going

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:23.850
into our criminal justice system,

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:28.410
85% of juvenile delinquents are
illiterate and roughly two-thirds

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:30.160
of all the people in
our federal prisons

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.450
and state prisons are illiterate.

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:36.300
So, obviously, if you cannot
read it is a big disadvantage

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:40.120
in our country's ability to
give people the joy of living

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.850
that they should get and
live up to all the freedoms

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:45.460
that this country is
supposed to be about.

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:48.170 position:56%
So it's a sad situation, but there's
another situation that's just

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:51.940
as important to me, and that's
something called aliteracy,

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:55.110
which means people who can
read but choose not to do so.

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:58.710
This is hard to believe, but
roughly 30% of people who graduate

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:03.340
from college never read
another book, hard to believe.

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:07.430
And it's also hard to believe, but
it's also true, that roughly 50%

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:09.850
of Americans have not
been in a bookstore

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:12.690
or bought a book in
the last five years.

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:16.940
Also hard to believe that roughly
25% of Americans, all Americans,

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:19.350
have not read a book
in the last year.

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:23.630
Now this is sad because all of us
know that the pleasure of books is

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:26.710
that it brings you in a different
world, it can take you as it did

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:30.320 position:56%
for me from a modest background into
somebody who really enjoys books,

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.440
can meet people all over the world,
and can have a much richer life.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.180
So as tomorrow you are at
the National Book Festival

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:40.420
and as you hear the authors tonight
I'd just like everybody to think

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:45.260 position:56%
for a moment what can you do to help
improve literacy in this country,

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.210
illiteracy and aliteracy?

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:50.220
So just think about it, in addition
to writing books, reading books

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:52.150
and encouraging people to do so,

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:56.900
just think about what event
you could be involved with

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.150
or what organization you
could be involved with?

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.120
So the organizations that are going

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.940
to be honored tonight are terrific
organizations and I appreciate all

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.630
of them coming here this evening,

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:09.550
but they are really just
representing a small section

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:11.090
of the people doing
outstanding work.

00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:13.810
They did outstanding work and
we're going to recognize them,

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:16.100
but we should all realize that all

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.930
of these organizations need
additional financial support,

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:22.850 position:56%
they need your help, your ideas,
and really if you take anything away

00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:24.690 position:56%
from this evening and tomorrow it is

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:27.470
that while books are wonderful
we need to encourage people

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:30.630
to learn how to read books and
also once they learn how to read

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:32.560
to actually read the books.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.040
So tonight you're going to have an
enjoyable evening, but first we'd

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.170
like to give out the awards to the
people who have won these awards,

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:41.670
so why don't we begin to do so,
and I would ask the Librarian

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:48.540
of Congress if she
would come up here.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.800
Carla? Okay, ready?

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:54.120
&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen, here
to receive the award on behalf

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.380
of America prizewinner,
Parent-Child Home Program,

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:59.680
is Sarah Walter [Assumed Spelling].

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:27.050
[ Applause ]

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:30.150
Here to receive the award on behalf
of International prizewinner,

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:34.510
Libraries Without Borders, is
Allister Chang [Assumed Spelling].

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:57.070
[ Applause ]

00:18:57.070 --> 00:19:00.780
Here to receive the award on
behalf of Rubenstein prizewinner,

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:05.490 position:56%
WETA Reading Rockets, is Sharon
Percy Rockefeller, President and CEO

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:09.510
of WETA, and Noel Gunther.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:42.570
[ Applause ]

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:47.930
The check is in the mail and
they'll get the money soon.

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:49.550
[laughter]

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:52.270
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: It's very
hard to surprise someone

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:58.920
like Mr. Rubenstein, as you can
imagine, but hold on for a minute.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:05.570
Because you have been so generous
- and he's like what is she doing?

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:07.480
This is really fun.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:12.010
You have been so generous to
the Library, to the nation,

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:15.140
and to so many people, we
thought we'd surprise you

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:20.660
with a special something,
given by a special person.

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:27.770
Guess who this might be given by?

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:36.510
One of our honored authors
is Mr. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:42.200
who is a Professor, too, in his
way and he's just wonderful,

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:45.540
and he has a special
presentation for you.

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:46.840
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Wow.

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.640
Okay.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:21:12.250
[ Applause ]

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:15.300 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: You could imagine
what went into the planning of this.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.660
So way to go, David.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:21.960
Thank you so much.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.260
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
Thank you very much.

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.460
I'm the Chairman of the
Board at Duke University

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:27.600
and we never could beat
UCLA when Kareem was there.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:31.240
[laughter] I didn't play at Duke

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.040
because to dunk the ball
I told them they had

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.340
to lower it to about six feet.

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:37.810
And, anyway, thank
you all very much.

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:39.610
Thank you.

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:48.050
[ Applause ]

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:49.680
&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome novelist

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:54.510
and memoirist, Edwidge Danticat.

00:21:54.510 --> 00:22:03.040
[ Applause ]

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.940
&gt;&gt; Edwidge Danticat:
Good evening, bonsoir,

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:08.720
and congratulations
to the award winners.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:15.490
What an incredible honor it is to
be here with all of you tonight.

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:19.360
Being at one of the first events
being hosted by our new Librarian

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:23.240
of Congress, Ms. Carla
Hayden, is phenomenal.

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.630
[applause] It's also wonderful
to be here in Washington,

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:32.880
D.C. on the same weekend
that the National Museum

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:38.130
of African-American History and
Culture will be officially opened.

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:48.820
[applause] The ancestors must
be rejoicing just a little bit

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.330
about this weekend.

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:56.540
Speaking of ancestors, I'm glad
that tonight's theme links journeys

00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:01.960
and literacy because it gives me an
opportunity to kick off with a line

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:06.480
from our Librarian of Congress
at her swearing in ceremony.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:11.830
Ms. Hayden, you said, people of my
race were once punished with lashes

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:14.940
and worse for learning to read.

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:21.360
My people, too, and this is why
I often call myself an accident

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.490
of literacy.

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:28.960 position:56%
I am an accident of literacy because
I risked not existing at all.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:32.420
My parents grew up during the
father-son Duvalier dictatorship

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:37.440
in Haiti, which lasted from
the 1950s to the 1980s.

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.690
The first 12 years of my
life were spent living

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:42.790
under that dictatorship.

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:47.160
Growing up in Haiti I knew many
children who had a parent killed,

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:50.040
sometimes a father,
before they were born.

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:54.780 position:56%
This often took away the possibility
of their being able to go to school

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:57.230
and getting an education.

00:23:57.230 --> 00:24:01.300
I am an accident of literacy
because I might not have been able

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:04.720
to attend school at all had
my parents not journeyed here

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:08.240
to the US, like thousands
of immigrants,

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:11.090
some of whom are being
deported today.

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:14.650
Parents who have no choice
but to leave their countries,

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:19.470
their families and even their
children behind for the possibility

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:22.140
of a better life elsewhere.

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:25.930
I am an accident of literacy
because it is the money earned

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:28.950
from my parents working
sometimes two jobs,

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:31.870
sometimes around the clock,
in New York sweatshops,

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:34.720
factories, kitchens and carwashes.

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:38.820
Their salaries from these jobs
paid for me to start on my journey

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:41.170
to learning to read and write.

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:44.410
I am an accident of literacy
because when I was able

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:48.280
to join my parents here in
the United States at age 12

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:52.960 position:56%
if we were undocumented I might have
been shut-out of the public schools

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.810
that eventually allowed me
to learn English and put me

00:24:55.810 --> 00:25:01.120
on a path towards reading and
writing in my adopted tongue.

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.660
I am an accident of literacy

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:06.790
because some libraries might
have refused me entry or access

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:10.260
or a library card, they might
have put up a wall between me

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:13.940
and those hundreds and hundreds of
books that I didn't know I needed,

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:17.420
wanted, to help me
imagine a better journey

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:19.230 position:56%
and a life beyond the barred windows

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:23.700
of my family's crammed
two-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn.

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.910
I am an accident of literacy
because even though I was new

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:29.530
to the United States
and new to English some

00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:33.190
of my teachers refrained from
telling me that certain words,

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:37.130
thoughts, ideas and dreams
were unavailable to me.

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:40.500
I am an accident of literacy
because all those things

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:44.350
that could have happened to me did
not, in part because of struggles

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:48.760
that others have fought and
continue to fight today.

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:52.500
I always tell people when they ask
who my best writing teachers were

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:55.460
that they were the
storytellers of my childhood.

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:58.640
My grandmothers and aunts
who were not all readers,

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:02.720
some of them were not even
literate, but they carried stories

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.050
like treasures inside of them.

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:09.360
And every once in awhile on a dark
night when the lights were out

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.980
or even when they were on
they would tell me stories

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:16.750
because there were some things that
they did not want me to forget.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:20.940
They did not want me to forget what
it is like to laugh, to be afraid,

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.860
to feel sadness and to feel joy,

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:27.010
all sometimes within the
scope of a single story.

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:31.310
To these great storytellers,
Griots, Lechoneras,

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:35.090
Loniceras [Assumed Spelling], every
story was a gift that you carried

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:38.770
with you until it was
your turn to pass it on.

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:42.580 position:56%
And even if you did not understand
the story fully as it was being told

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:46.710
to you one day it would become
clearer when some event would show

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:51.280
up in your life when you would
need a story, most on your path,

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:56.490
on your journey, and that story
would appear again like an ancestor

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:59.750
or an heir, someone yet to be born.

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:01.630
Which is why this wonderful
celebration

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:06.120
of literacy also makes me think
of so many, both here in the US

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:08.670
as Mr. Rubenstein said
and around the world,

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:13.430
for whom literacy is still beyond
reach, either for political

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:18.220
or socioeconomic reasons many
are not allowed to read and write

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.900
or can afford to learn
to read and write.

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:24.780
Theirs is one of the shadows
that dims some of our joy

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:29.710
as we celebrate literacy and the
individuals, writers, librarians

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:35.830 position:56%
and institutions, like this one,
that nurtures and supports literacy.

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:40.480
As Richard Wright wrote in
his 1945 memoir, Black Boy,

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:43.050
after borrowing a white
man's library card

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:47.150 position:56%
and forging his handwriting so he
could borrow books from the library,

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:52.170 position:56%
Wright wrote that, quote, reading
can be a passion, a hunger too great

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:57.790
to be contained, words can also be
used as weapons or counter weapons,

00:27:57.790 --> 00:27:59.960
words help us experience the depths

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:03.090
of what is possible
for us and others.

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:07.610
Which is why literacy is so often
closely monitored, suppressed

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:13.830
or forbidden by oppressors, bigots,
dictators, tyrants and their like.

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:17.680
And maybe this is why our ancestors
might be a little bit pleased

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.410
tonight and this entire weekend

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:25.090
because not only are we celebrating
reading and writing, literacy

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:28.770
and the word, but we are
also celebrating some,

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:32.100
like our wonderful new
Librarian of Congress,

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:35.870
who have become living
stories, as well.

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:37.670
Thank you.

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:50.040
[ Applause ]

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.520
&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen,

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:55.860
please welcome science
writer, James Gleick.

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:03.580
[ Applause ]

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:04.880
&gt;&gt; James Gleick: Thank you.

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.180
Thank you.

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:07.480
I'm so happy to be here.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.220
I'm honored to be here,
especially at the very beginning

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:13.050
of what's going to be
called the Hayden era.

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:18.030
I've just been working on a book
about time travel for awhile,

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:21.160
and when I told people
I was working on a book

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:24.620
about time travel I got all
kinds of different reactions.

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:27.740
But I think my favorite
was a woman who said,

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:30.360
cool, have you ever done it?

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:36.510 position:56%
[laughter] And I have a feeling that
she was disappointed by my answer.

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:41.330 position:56%
Because, of course, nobody
actually gets to hop into a DeLorean

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:47.420
and speed into the past and
meet our parents as teenagers.

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:51.500
We can't plunk ourselves down
in the saddle of a time machine

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:54.870
and turn the lever that
sends us to the 31st Century.

00:29:54.870 --> 00:30:01.320 position:56%
Much as we might want to meet them
there aren't actually time travelers

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:04.840
from the future walking
in our midst.

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:10.200
Still nowadays time machines
are a great cultural totem.

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:13.300
The Time Machine is a
well-known movie, actually,

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:17.560
a whole slew of movies and TV shows
and comics and everything else,

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:21.060
but of course first
and foremost before all

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:24.280
of that The Time Machine is a book.

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.970
It was a little book.

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:30.680
The American edition was sold
in New York by the publisher,

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:33.910
Henry Holt, for 75 cents.

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:37.380
Eventually, the young man
who wrote it, H.G. Wells,

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:42.010
became an international celebrity,
a historian, a visionary,

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:44.650
champion of world government.

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:51.810
But in 1895 he was just a son of
shopkeepers, fresh out of school,

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:56.470
desperately hoping to
make a living as a writer.

00:30:56.470 --> 00:31:01.060
He wrote The Time Machine and
rewrote it again and again,

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:04.310
working late at night by the
light of a paraffin lamp,

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:09.180
and finally found a publisher
who paid him 100 Pounds for it.

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:14.690
It wasn't easy to make a
career out of writing books

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:19.210
in Victorian England,
but it was possible.

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:24.340
Wells wrote to a friend,
someday I shall succeed,

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:29.150
I really believe, but
it is a weary game.

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:34.580
In 21st Century American it's
possible to make a career

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:39.960
out of writing books, but it isn't
easy, and forces of technology

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:41.920
and commerce are combining

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:46.120
to make it harder every
year for young writers.

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:49.560
I think we all know that
our commitment to literacy

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:52.830
and our commitment to
the writing life have

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:56.380
to be inseparable, one in the same.

00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:01.020
I have time traveled, by the way.

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:06.510
[laughter] And so have you
all, readers and writers.

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:14.110
There was a massacre in Haiti
in 1937, all but forgotten.

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:16.410
Edwidge Danticat takes us there.

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:26.640
[applause] In 1914
Theodore Roosevelt hauled

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.120
and paddled dugout canoes
down the River of Doubt

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.440
in the Amazon Rain Forest.

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:35.700
Candice Millard takes us there.

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:43.530
[applause] We can leave
our busy electric present

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:49.380
and turn the clock back 60
years to a small Iowa town

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:54.870
where a dying pastor is preserving
his memories and reconnecting

00:32:54.870 --> 00:33:00.380
with his own past and the clock
turner is Marilynne Robinson.

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:05.930
[applause] And, of course, a lot

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:08.280
of writers aren't busy
recreating the past,

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:10.910
instead they're trying
to invent the future.

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:16.170
Our best sense of the future
and maybe our worst sense,

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:22.270
the future we can hope for,
the future we should fear,

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:25.470
they both come from the
imaginations of writers.

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:32.240
You want to take a journey, we
are all time travelers nowadays,

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:34.170
and the book is our time machine.

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:38.180
And the Library is time
travel headquarters,

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:42.720
which I guess makes The Library of
Congress the time travel pentagon.

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:46.430
[laughter] And I mean that
in the nicest possible way.

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:54.300
The great Ursula K. Le Guin put it
this way, story is our only boat

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:58.500
for sailing on the river of time.

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:00.300
Thank you.

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:11.490
[ Applause ]

00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:16.510
&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome historian, Candice Millard.

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:25.250
[ Applause ]

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:26.550
&gt;&gt; Candice Millard: Thank you.

00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:31.110
I can't tell you what an incredible
honor it is for me to be here among

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:36.830 position:56%
so many distinguished authors, and I
had just the unbelievable privilege

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:40.730
of meeting Dr. Hayden earlier
tonight and I will never forget it.

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:45.500
So thank you so much for
allowing me to be here.

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:50.210 position:56%
I grew up in a small town in Ohio
and it was a great place to grow up,

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:53.800
it was safe, the people were
nice, there were a lot of woods

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:57.540
and streams and ponds that
froze over in the winter

00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:59.510
so we could skate on them.

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:04.510
But if I look back at my childhood
the happiest moments I had were

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:08.860
spent in the library, and
it was a great library.

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:12.390
It was in this old
two-story red brick building

00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:14.790
with wide front steps.

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:17.710
It had a small room in the
front for children's books.

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:21.620
It had high ceilings
and creaky wood floors,

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:24.470
and it smelled like old books.

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:28.380
If it was a nice day or even a
cold one I used to sit outside

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:32.440
on the front steps and I would
dangle my legs over the side

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:36.340
and I would feel the sun on my
face, and I would read the books

00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:42.550 position:56%
that I had just picked out and I was
never happier than in those moments.

00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:46.810
Then one day when I was about nine
years old I went to the library.

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:48.500
You could walk there from my house.

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:54.390
And I saw this small vertical
revolving rack of paperback books,

00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:59.010
and there was this handwritten
paper sign on top of them

00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:02.900
with just one word
and it said, free.

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:06.380
And we had always had books in
my house because we always went

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:10.520
to the library, but I didn't have
very many books that were mine,

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.980
that actually belonged to me.

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:17.430
So I stood in front of that
revolving rack and I turned it

00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:20.600
and I turned it around and around.

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:24.310
And these weren't children's books,
so I didn't know any of them,

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:28.580
but one finally caught
my eye and it was called,

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:31.290
I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:35.850
And, again, I was just this kid
from this little working class town

00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:38.670
in Ohio, so I had never
heard of this book,

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:43.710
I had no idea what it was about, I
had no idea who Maya Angelou was.

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:48.970
I just liked the title and the
cover, so I pulled it off the rack

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:52.180
and I slipped it in my
pocket and I brought it home.

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:57.480
And I didn't know it at the time,
but that walk, that small journey

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:01.810
from the library back to my
house, past the hardware store

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:06.630
and the elementary
school and J.B.'s ruista,

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:09.500
stopped to get deep-fried
mushrooms -

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:13.970
that walk I had made a thousand
times before would be different

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:15.270
this time.

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:20.160
Because I began to read, I
Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:23.570
Of course, at nine a lot
of it confused me and some

00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:27.600
of it scared me, but for
the first time I realized

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:32.260
that books could be more than
just entertaining or educational,

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:35.990
they could be beautiful
and they could be moving,

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:39.740
and they cannot just teach
me, they could transport me.

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:45.730 position:56%
As I grew older books became not
less important to me, but even more.

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:49.410
I turned to books when I went
to Ethiopia on assignment

00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:52.880
for National Geographic for the
first time, and I was scared.

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:56.630
I wasn't scared because I was
in Ethiopia, I loved it there.

00:37:56.630 --> 00:38:01.240
I was scared because I was new
at this, this was my big chance,

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:04.120
and I knew that I was
going to mess up.

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:09.070
So every night, tired and worried,
I would climb into my sleeping bag

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:12.810
under my mosquito net and
I would reach for my book.

00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:15.490
And instantly I would
be in another world,

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:19.570
a world in which whatever
happened it wasn't my fault,

00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:22.910
and I didn't have to worry
about it the next day,

00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:26.370
I could just be whisked away.

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:29.810
I also turned to books when
my husband and I had a child

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:34.000
who was born with cancer, and
every night in the hospital

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.560
when she fell asleep I would sit in
a corner of her room with a bottle

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:43.460
of water and some beef jerky
from the vending machine

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:49.300
and a little book light and Harry
Potter, and in a flash I would be

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:55.530
in Hogwarts, far away from
all the tears of the day.

00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:59.140
So all that I can hope from
the books that I write is

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:04.720
that they might be a comfort to
someone, somewhere at some time.

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:08.140
I know that there are
people who think the idea

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:11.770
of a book being your
friend is ridiculous,

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:15.480
but I think that there is
absolutely nothing wrong with that.

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:18.030
On the contrary, I
think it's a shame not

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:20.780 position:56%
to have books that are your friends.

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:24.810
And when I think of literacy,
when I think of what it must mean

00:39:24.810 --> 00:39:29.150
to not be able to read, I think
that it is a deprivation not just

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:34.560
of knowledge, enlightenment and
opportunity, although it is all

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:38.700
of those things, but it also
denies a powerful source

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:42.230
of refuge and friendship.

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:45.130
Winston Churchill, who was
not only a voracious reader

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:49.120
but an extraordinarily talented
writer who supported himself

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:54.610
for 70 years with his writing, who
won the Nobel Prize for Literature,

00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:59.290
said that if you cannot read all
of your books, at any rate peer

00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:02.760
into them, let them fall
open where they will,

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:05.990
read from the first sentence
that arrests the eye,

00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:09.200
set them back on their
shelves with your own hands,

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:13.430
arrange them on your own plan, so
that if you do not know what is

00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:19.260 position:56%
in them you will at least know where
they are, let them be your friends.

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:24.310
I still have my first copy of I
Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:28.110
I brought it with me tonight, and
it's come on a long journey with me

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:32.410
over many decades and to many
places, and it will always be one

00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:35.080
of my most treasured possessions,

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:38.630
but more than that it
will always be my friend.

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:40.430
Thank you.

00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:50.060
[ Applause ]

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:53.210
&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome novelist and winner

00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:56.200
of the 2016 Library
of Congress prize

00:40:56.200 --> 00:41:00.510
for American Fiction,
Marilynne Robinson.

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:14.910
[ Applause ]

00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:16.210 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Marilynne Robinson: Good evening.

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:18.450
It's a wonderful honor to be here.

00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:23.600
Sometimes, you know, this
building is a celebration,

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:25.680
much more than a monument.

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:30.420 position:56%
And to be included in an event of
this kind and to be among the people

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:35.900
that sustain it and love it
is a very, very moving thing.

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:44.480
I've taught writing for a
long time to gifted writers,

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:52.170
who enriched my life for many years
with their brilliance and grace.

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:57.110
And while I taught I talked
about experiences of my own

00:41:57.110 --> 00:42:00.090
that made me feel the importance,

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:04.020
the qualitative significance
of reading.

00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:08.860
These are some, a couple
of not quite anecdotes

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:13.490
that I often mentioned
with my students.

00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:18.760
In any case, I remember
quite distinctly what it was

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:21.700
like when the difficulties
of my new literacy,

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:25.650
my marginal literacy somehow
became the utter trance

00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:30.510
of childhood bookishness, when the
resistance offered by unknown words

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:34.680
and complicated sentences
fell away before my absorption

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:38.610
in almost any book that
fell into my hands.

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:41.670
When children love books
the experience they find

00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:45.180
in them is unsought and
engrossing like a dream.

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:49.640
I realize how important it is
to me now to have been haunted

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:54.350
and enchanted by Edgar Allan Poe,
to have laughed myself to tears

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:57.840 position:56%
over the lesser works of Mark Twain,

00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:00.450
to have been given
the collected poems

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:03.320
of Emily Dickinson
by my big brother.

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:08.760
The sense of progressive
initiation has been part of it all

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:13.190
through my whole life, together
with an impulse and desire to speak

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:15.690
into that great conversation.

00:43:15.690 --> 00:43:18.780
An experience like this
has been the privilege

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:23.600
of very few people historically,
very few human beings.

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:27.720
It waited on the technologies
of printing and publishing,

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:33.790
on public libraries, and on the
historically recent assumption

00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:37.910
that literacy should
be the norm in society.

00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:42.380
Now it is hard to remember that
it is individually an achievement

00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:47.840
and collectively a privilege, and
that the modern world is unique

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:51.670
in the extraordinary degree
that it is structured by

00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:55.010
and permeated by written language.

00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:59.360
We tend to think of things that
are fruitful, as if they are

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:02.390
to be valued for their utility.

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:06.670
We forget how objectively
wonderful they are.

00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:12.570
I have had a few opportunities
to speak with people who are

00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:16.130
or who have been incarcerated.

00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:19.890
Typically, they have come
to reading late or at least

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:23.770
from marginal literacy
to actual literacy,

00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:26.370
for reasons that are
familiar to all of us.

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:29.990
They have been brought to
books by boredom and loneliness

00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:33.320
and restlessness with the
thought that they are excluded

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:36.610
from knowledge of another life.

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:41.170
One man told me that he had
been drifting from bad to worse

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:46.200
and then I read a book, he said,
that was the first time I realized

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:50.210
that the world was something
I could be interested in.

00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:55.660
The fruitfulness I've spoke of
is the change in this man's life,

00:44:55.660 --> 00:45:02.070
in his mind, without reference to
potential contributions to society,

00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:04.850
which might very well be modest

00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:08.450
as these things are
conventionally reckoned.

00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:13.120
Anyone who remembers being struck
and moved by a book knows something

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:18.510
of his experience and knows that
it is an excellent thing in itself,

00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:23.920 position:56%
a real liberation, without any
reference to practical consequences.

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:27.290
I mention these conversations

00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:31.240
because they have made me
particularly aware of what we,

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:34.630
as a community, give
people or deny them

00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:37.820
when we make them fully
literate or leave them in a state

00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:41.920
of exclusion most of
us cannot imagine.

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:45.940
They remind me, also, that the
written word is unaccountably rich

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:51.020
and powerful, efficacious in
the manner of food and drink

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:52.320
and the light of the sun.

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:57.890
And here we are at the wealthiest
country in history wondering darkly

00:45:57.890 --> 00:46:02.610
about the wisdom of our
investment in the humanities.

00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:07.180
Will our children enhance a
corporate profit margin as a result

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:10.140
of reading, even studying
leaves of grass?

00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:13.400
Quite possibly.

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:19.900
[laughter] I think the question
being mulled really is whether we

00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:24.210
should invest so much social
wealth in providing a great part

00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:28.440
of our population with an
acquaintance, at least,

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:31.290
with their human heritage.

00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:38.240
Stinginess creeps, it finds
its own logic irrefutable.

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:44.360
Increasingly public assets are
spoken of as public burdens.

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:45.660
Why after all lock-up

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:48.700
so much exploitable
wealth in national parks?

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:52.600
Do we really need all
these great universities?

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:56.200
We, the public, could be
impoverished radically before we

00:46:56.200 --> 00:47:00.730
understood the nature of the loss.

00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:05.380
An incarcerated woman said
to me, tell your students

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:09.610
to write good books,
they're all we live for.

00:47:09.610 --> 00:47:15.010
What would it matter if that
sustenance were denied to her?

00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:17.150
Who would even know?

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:23.640
This is a metaphysical question,
so is the disputed value

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:32.320 position:56%
of the astonishing communion we have
among ourselves mediated by books.

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:36.090
How we value her solitary
obscure human life,

00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:41.000
how much wealth we are honored to
share with her, will speak directly

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.090
to the kind of civilization
we are and will become.

00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:50.280
This great Library is the proof of
the value our society has placed

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:55.570
in the world civilization of
readers, writers and books.

00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:58.930
I cannot begin to reckon
the pure good I have taken

00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:04.730
from American fiction, American
libraries, American education.

00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:09.790
This prize that I will receive
is profoundly gratifying to me.
