00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.760
Welcome to 2D game
development with Lib GDX.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.220
Before we do anything else,

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.790
I want to show you the game
you'll make in this course.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.430
It's called Icicles.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.560
We can select a difficulty, and

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.710
then we use the arrow keys
to dodge the fallen icicles.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.580
We keep track of our score as the number
of icicles that we've dodged And

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.670
when an icicle hits us, the game resets.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.150
Even better, once you've made
this game it'll run anywhere.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.410
&gt;From your desktop computer to
web browsers to your phone,

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.840
either Android or iOS.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.200
So want to make awesome 2-D
games that run anywhere?

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.960
Let's get started.
