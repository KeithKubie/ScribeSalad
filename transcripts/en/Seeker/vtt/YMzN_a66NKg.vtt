00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.090
Ahh, I broke my phone screen.

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:11.670
Hey does anyone have any yttrium, terbium,
europium, or gadolinium? ….or tape?

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.400
Hey all you screen time junkies, Trace here
for DNews.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.680
For futurists, technology is the great unifier,
and the internet democratizes communication

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.450
for all of humanity!

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.750
The statistics organization IDC estimates
44 percent of the planet is on the internet

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.480
in 2016, and according to Pew Research, gloabally
54 percent own smartphones.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.629
But creating devices to access this future-world
of technology, involves pulling lots of minerals

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.679
from the actual-world we have to live in now!

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:46.480
It’s probably no surprise to learn that
the modern smartphone is an absurdly complex

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.579
little rectangle.

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.769
Inside an iPhone, for example, you can find
about 75 of the 118 elements on the periodic

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:53.769
table.

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:56.149
That’s most of the elements.

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.719
For comparison, life needs only about 30 elements
elements to...well, be alive.

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.850
Admittedly, many of the iPhone’s elements
are common enough: silicon is used to make

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.920
transistors, those tiny on-off switches that
form the basis of microchips.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.009
Aluminum, silicon, potassium, and oxygen all
go into the reinforced glass that covers every

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:16.009
screen.

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.799
Lithium powers an iPhone’s battery, as it
does in a gazillion other devices.

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.270
And there’s some Carbon in there because,
well, there’s carbon in almost everything.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.729
None of that is particularly controversial...the
tricker smartphone elements are the ones that

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.329
are either rare, or hard to harvest, or both.

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.790
Gold and tin, for example, are used in electronics
wiring...gold is an excellent conductor, and

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.369
tin is critical part of the soldering process.

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.149
Both are relatively rare elements, which can
mean that companies end up doing business

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.890
with mining outfits in countries with poor
environmental and human rights records.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.670
This is why minerals like gold, tin, and tantalum
are considered “conflict minerals.”

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.009
Apple, to its credit, is working hard to source
its minerals from less exploitative places.

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.460
And then there are the so-called “rare-earth
metals”... a group of elements that are

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.860
not actually all that rare...they’re just
spread around the word in small pockets, and

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.030
are notoriously difficult to mine.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.690
They also happen to be crucial to most electronics...these
are elements like yttrium, terbium, europium,

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:17.690
or gadolinium.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.800
In iPhones, they help screens display colors,
vibrating units vibrate, and speakers...speak.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.760
Once again, supply is an issue here: today
more than 90% of rare earth metals are mined

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.020
in China...and the impact of those operations
is not great.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.460
China’s lax environmental laws have caused
millions of residents living near mines to

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.950
be threatened by radioactive waste and other
by-products of mineral production.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.630
So why on Earth do companies continue to use
these super problematic elements?

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.290
Why not find an alternative?

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.540
Well, they might not have much of a choice.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.060
A study at Yale University looked at all 62
metals used in the electronics industry...and

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.060
found that many simply had no functional substitutes.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.940
Meaning we’re probably stuck with them.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.010
And also meaning that companies can work hard
to source materials as responsibly as possible,

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.760
but at the end of the day, those elements
that make up an iPhone are going to come from

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.850
all over the world.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.180
The final wrinkle here, of course, is that
all of these metals and minerals are nonrenewable

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.190
resources...and when they’re gone, that
electronics industry is going to look very

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.190
different.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.940
So if there’s all these rare minerals in
your phone...why does the battery still suck?

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:26.970
We explain why, here.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.400
Are there any other electronics or items you
want to know about?
