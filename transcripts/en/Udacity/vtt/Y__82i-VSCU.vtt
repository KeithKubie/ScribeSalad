00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In Unit 1, we talked about the Tropic of Cancer, but I'm not sure if we actually used that word.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The city of Siena where Eratosthenes saw the sun shining vertically down the row

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
is located on the Tropic of Cancer.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The sun isn't always directly above the Tropic of Cancer

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
as it happened to be on the summer solstice.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
In fact, due to the tilt of the earth, the sun can be directly overhead anywhere between

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
the Tropic of Cancer, the equator, and another imaginary line 23.5°

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
south of the equator known as the Tropic of Capricorn.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The sun is directly over the Tropic of Cancer on the summer solstice and directly over the equator

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and what's known as the equinoxes--it's directly over the other tropic on the winter solstice.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I'm using a northern hemisphere bias here.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
If you're in the southern hemisphere, you'd probably refer to this as the winter solstice.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Now thinking that's what we did in Unit 1, let's say you're standing at some unknown latitude.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Where one where your latitude would just be this angle here which I've labeled α,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and let's say it happens to be one of the equinoxes

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
said the sun is directly above the equator and we do an experiment.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
You look at a vertical object, measure its shadow, and do some trigonometry

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
to find that the angle here I've labeled α is equal to 40°.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
So I want you to tell me for this measured angle of 40° and remember

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
this is when the sun is highest in the sky and the sun is directly overhead on the equator

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
so it's one of the equinoxes, what is your latitude.

00:01:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
