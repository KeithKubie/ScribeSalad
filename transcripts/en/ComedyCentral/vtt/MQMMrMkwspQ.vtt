WE HAVE BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD A
FEW TIMES THIS YEAR.

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:07.407 size:75% position:38% line:85%
EACH TIME IT'S NOT EASY.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.542 align:start position:0% line:91%
TONIGHT MARKS THE END OF AN ERA,
THE FINAL SHOW OF THE LONGEST

00:00:09.575 --> 00:00:15.014 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
SERVING MEMBER OF THE GREATEST
[BLEEP] NEWS TEAM,

00:00:15.047 --> 00:00:15.815 align:start position:0% line:85%
SAMANTHA BEE.

00:00:15.848 --> 00:00:17.216 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT ALL STARTED BACK IN 2003 OT
THREE.

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:18.551 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE BUSH PRESIDENCY WAS ENTERING
ITS TERRIBLE TWOs.

00:00:18.584 --> 00:00:24.424 line:85%
THE IRAQ WAR WAS JUST STARTING.

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:25.692 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO WE NEEDED A CORRESPONDENT, WE
LOOKED IN THE USUAL PLACES,

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:29.295 line:91%
YOUR LIQUOR STORES, YOUR BETTING
PARLORS, YOUR METHADONE CLINICS,

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:36.803 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND OBVIOUSLY GOOGLE MAPS WAS
IN ITS NASCENT STAGES,

00:00:36.836 --> 00:00:39.539 size:78% position:39% line:91%
AND WE TOOK A WRONG TURN,
WE ENDED UP IN CANADA.

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:41.774 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
AND WE FOUND THIS, THIS, THIS

00:00:41.807 --> 00:00:46.579 align:start position:0% line:91%
JUST DELIGHTFUL, INCREDIBLY
FUNNY, PERSON, SAM BEE.

00:00:46.612 --> 00:00:48.581 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO WE HID HER IN THE TRUNK AND
RACED BACK OVER THE BORDER

00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:51.184 align:start position:0% line:85%
PURSUED BY MOUNTIES.

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:53.820 align:start position:0% line:91%
CANADA HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS
LOSING.

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:56.522 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HAVE YOU HAD A HOT CARL SINCE
YOU'VE BEEN HERE?

00:00:56.555 --> 00:00:57.456 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NOT. I JUST,
YOU KNOW, THERE'S SO MUCH

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.925 align:start position:0% line:91%
TO DO, I HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO
DO EVERYTHING YET.

00:00:58.958 --> 00:00:59.859 line:91%
&gt;&gt; I COULD TOTALLY SEE IF LONG
ISLAND SECEDED AS ITS OWN STATE.

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:01.160 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt;WE'RE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT
GROUP OF PEOPLE.

00:01:01.193 --> 00:01:03.129 line:85%
&gt;&gt; WHAT STATE COULD YOU BEAT UP?

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:03.796 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IRELAND.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:04.397 line:85%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK THAT COUNTS.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.831 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OH, STATES, I'M SORRY.

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:05.598 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OTHER STATES.

00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:06.599 size:88% position:44% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I FEEL LIKE A RETARD NOW.

00:01:06.632 --> 00:01:08.167 line:85%
&gt;&gt; OTHER STATES NOT IN EUROPE.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.602 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; STATEN ISLAND.

00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:13.139 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OTHER STATES.

00:01:13.172 --> 00:01:13.573 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; CANADA?

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:14.440 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; CANADA? OKAY.

00:01:14.473 --> 00:01:16.209 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NONE OF THESE TOOLS ARE
STERILE.

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:20.246 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; OKAY, WELL NEITHER IS THIS.
SO LET'S GO.  GET STARTED.

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:22.682 align:start position:0% line:91%
 CAN I CALL YOU
BACK? MY MOM IS IN MY ROOM,

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:25.818 align:start size:94% position:6% line:91%
AND SHE WANTS TO TALK TO ME
ABOUT SOMETHING!

00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:29.055 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
 I'M SAMANTHA BEE AND I WATCH
THE FIVE!

00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:35.962 size:88% position:44% line:91%
IT'S THE TALE OF A WINSOME
BLONDE INGENUE, DANA PARINO.

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:37.263 size:81% position:41% line:85%
THERE'S GOT TO BE A CATCH!

00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:39.866 align:start position:0% line:91%
 COULD YOU MAKE IT SNAPPY?
I'VE GOT PLACES TO BE. SERIOUSLY

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:41.667 size:78% position:39% line:85%
OKAY, DRIPPING WET BALLS.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.871 align:start position:0% line:85%
IGNORE THIS.

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:45.572 line:85%
BABY'S ON FIRE AGAIN. DAMN IT.

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:50.076 line:85%
YOU TWO TIMING MONSTER -- AHHH!

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:54.780 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'M THE ONE GETTING  FLOWN OUT
OF THIS (BLEEP) POOL!

00:01:54.813 --> 00:01:55.648 line:85%
ONE PILL MAKES YOU LARGER AND --

00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:57.517 align:start position:0% line:85%
LET IT RING!

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.917 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WELL I THINK A LOT OF THE
TIME IT FEELS LIKE A

00:01:57.951 --> 00:02:00.353 align:start position:0%
THANKLESS JOB.

00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:04.190 line:91%
PEOPLE THINK OUR DAY ENDS AT
3:00 AND THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

00:02:04.223 --> 00:02:10.863 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE FEEL UNAPPRECIATED.

00:02:10.896 --> 00:02:11.764 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; GIVES MEN BASICALLY INSTANT
ERECTIONS.

00:02:11.797 --> 00:02:14.567 size:88% position:44% line:85%
TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF DOING.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.801 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OH BOY, OKAY, OKAY.

00:02:15.834 --> 00:02:20.706 align:start position:0% line:91%
HAVE YOU HAD YOUR PICTURE TAKEN
WITH A BLACK PERSON YET?

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.642 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WELL, I DON'T THINK SO, BUT I
WOULDN'T MIND DOING IT.

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:25.011 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S SOMETHING YOU WOULD BE
WILLING TO TRY?

00:02:25.044 --> 00:02:25.611 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; WHY, CERTAINLY.

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:26.779 size:81% position:41% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THERE'S PLENTY OF THEM.

00:02:26.812 --> 00:02:27.613 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I KNOW.

00:02:27.646 --> 00:02:30.583 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; DO YOU HAVE ANY OF THEM IN
MONTANA?

00:02:30.616 --> 00:02:34.387 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE DON'T, YOU KNOW. WE DON'T
HAVE ANY.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.723 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
IN FACT, OUR KIDS WERE PRETTY
OLD BEFORE THEY SAW ONE.

00:02:37.756 --> 00:02:39.692 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: HERE'S A LITTLE
SOMETHING, SOME DAILY SHOW

00:02:39.725 --> 00:02:40.693 align:start position:0% line:91%
TRIVIA, OF ALL OF OUR
CORRESPONDENTS SAM IS ONLY

00:02:40.726 --> 00:02:41.527 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE THIRD CORRESPONDENT
TO EVER GET HER

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.733 size:84% position:42% line:85%
FACE STUCK IN A PENIS PUMP.

00:02:47.766 --> 00:02:48.801 line:91%
BUT WHILE SHE COULD ALWAYS DO
THE SILLY, THE SAM PIECES THAT

00:02:48.834 --> 00:02:51.270 align:start position:0% line:91%
I LOVED THE BEST ARE THE ONES
CLOSEST TO HER HEART.

00:02:51.303 --> 00:02:54.540 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SARAH PALIN TOOK THE STAGE
AND SILENCED HER CRITICS.

00:02:54.573 --> 00:02:55.007 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT THERE'S ONE ISSUE FOR WHICH
SHE'S STILL BEING

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.344 align:start position:0% line:85%
UNFAIRLY ATTACKED.

00:02:58.377 --> 00:03:05.618 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT'S VERY INAPPROPRIATE
THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE SEIZED

00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:06.319 align:start position:0% line:91%
ON THE ISSUE OF BRISTOL'S
PREGNANCY.

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:07.954 line:85%
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S A FAMILY ISSUE.

00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:08.721 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, SHE'S GOING TO HAVE
THE BABY,

00:03:08.754 --> 00:03:10.356 line:85%
SHE'S GOING TO GET MARRIED..

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:13.159 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SHE SAID NO, IT'S A HUMAN
BEING.

00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:14.727 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SHE MADE THE -- I'M SORRY,
WHAT IS THE DECISION --

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.964 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE DECISION -- THERE'S ANOTHER
WORD I'M LOOKING FOR.

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:19.665 line:85%
I THINK IT RHYMES WITH VOICE.

00:03:19.698 --> 00:03:22.935 size:88% position:44% line:91%
EVERY FAMILY AND EVERY WOMAN
SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO --

00:03:22.968 --> 00:03:24.837 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'M SORRY, WHAT'S THE WORD I'M
LOOKING FOR?

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.907 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S HER FAMILY, IT'S HER --
GOD, WHAT IS THE WORD?

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.075 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHAT IS THE WORD
I'M LOOKING FOR?

00:03:29.108 --> 00:03:31.110 line:91%
IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU HAVE A LOT
OF OPTIONS, AND YOU HAVE TO

00:03:31.143 --> 00:03:31.911 align:start size:94% position:6% line:91%
SELECT ONE. WHAT'S THE WORD
I'M LOOKING FOR?

00:03:31.944 --> 00:03:34.013 align:start size:94% position:6% line:91%
WHAT IS THE WORD I'M LOOKING
FOR?

00:03:34.046 --> 00:03:37.116 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; ADOPTION IS ONE.

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:39.018 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NO, THERE'S A SPECIFIC WORD
I'M LOOKING FOR.

00:03:39.051 --> 00:03:43.389 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YES, BUT I DON'T THINK THE --
I DON'T THINK THAT THE

00:03:43.422 --> 00:03:49.295 line:91%
DECISION -- I THINK IT SHOULD
BE -- NOT -- I THINK THAT THE

00:03:49.328 --> 00:03:56.002 align:start position:0% line:91%
FAMILY DECISION WOULD BECOME --
THAT'S HOW -- YES.

00:03:56.035 --> 00:03:56.536 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.137 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; A DIFFERENT CHOICE?

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.738 align:start position:0% line:85%
CHOICE!

00:03:58.771 --> 00:03:59.438 align:start position:0% line:85%
YES!

00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:00.606 align:start position:0% line:85%
EXACTLY!

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.309 align:start position:0% line:91%
EVERY FAMILY, EVERY PERSON
SHOULD HAVE THE CHOICE TO DECIDE

00:04:03.342 --> 00:04:05.311 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHAT'S BEST FOR THEM!

00:04:05.344 --> 00:04:09.148 line:91%
&gt;&gt; THERE MAY SEE A 10-YEAR-OLD
OUT THERE PICKING TOBACCO BUT

00:04:09.181 --> 00:04:10.516 line:85%
YOU WON'T SEE HIM THERE ALL DAY.

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:11.784 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I WORK 12 HOURS A DAY IN THE
TOBACCO FARM.

00:04:11.817 --> 00:04:15.721 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; OR SOMETIMES A LITTLBE BIT
LONGER.

00:04:15.754 --> 00:04:16.789 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
&gt;&gt; OKAY, WOW. YOU'RE MAKING IT
VERY HARD FOR ME

00:04:16.822 --> 00:04:21.627 line:91%
TO IRONICALLY SUPPORT
CHILD TOBACCO LABOR.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.996 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE PRESIDENT SAYS THAT HE WANTS
US TO TALK ABOUT RACE.

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:25.831 size:78% position:39% line:85%
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT RACE!

00:04:25.864 --> 00:04:28.334 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU GO FIRST.

00:04:28.367 --> 00:04:30.069 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT IF
YOU STARTED OFF.

00:04:30.102 --> 00:04:32.638 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE
GREAT AT ALL.

00:04:32.671 --> 00:04:35.041 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE SCARED, SAY YOU'RE
SCARED.

00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:37.510 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; WHY WOULD I BE SCARED? NO!

00:04:37.543 --> 00:04:40.713 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'M NOT AT ALL.

00:04:40.746 --> 00:04:42.715 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'M JUST INCREDIBLY
UNCOMFORTABLE.

00:04:42.748 --> 00:04:46.619 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I KNOW THE PERCENTAGE IS SO
SMALL, SO SMALL OF A PERSON

00:04:46.652 --> 00:04:50.790 line:91%
BECOMING PREGNANT FROM A RAPE
THAT I JUST DON'T EVEN KNOW IF

00:04:50.823 --> 00:04:53.292 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT'S EVEN IN THE EQUATION
BECAUSE THEY SAY THAT PERCENTAGE

00:04:53.325 --> 00:04:55.695 align:start position:0% line:91%
IS JUST, LIKE, ALMOST
IMPOSSIBLE.

00:04:55.728 --> 00:04:59.065 line:91%
NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT CLOSE, AND
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CASES.

00:04:59.098 --> 00:05:00.833 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, PROBABLY ABOUT 32,000 A
YEAR.

00:05:00.866 --> 00:05:04.203 align:start size:81% position:19% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IS IT 32? OKAY. 
&gt;&gt; THOUSAND.

00:05:04.236 --> 00:05:05.437 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, OKAY.
&gt;&gt; 32,000.

00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:09.308 line:91%
&gt;&gt; WOMEN IN COMBAT POSITIONS ARE
A THREAT TO MILITARY COHESION.

00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:13.512 size:84% position:42% line:91%
IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT MEN CAN
ACTUALLY BOND WITH WOMEN.

00:05:13.545 --> 00:05:16.315 align:start position:0% line:91%
MEN JOIN THE INFANTRY BECAUSE
THEY WANT TO FIGHT.

00:05:16.348 --> 00:05:21.921 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SORRY, EXCUSE ME FOR ONE
SECOND.

00:05:21.954 --> 00:05:23.923 align:start position:0% line:91%
OKAY. OKAY, THAT'S MUCH BETTER.
SORRY.

00:05:23.956 --> 00:05:25.891 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; GIRLS BECOME WOMEN BY GETTING
OLDER.

00:05:25.924 --> 00:05:29.895 line:91%
BOYS BECOME MEN BY ACCOMPLISHING
SOMETHING, BY PROVING SOMETHING.

00:05:29.928 --> 00:05:30.796 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:05:30.829 --> 00:05:32.198 align:start position:0% line:91%
HAVE YOU EVER ACTUALLY MET A
WOMAN BEFORE?

00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:35.835 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; SEVERAL.

00:05:35.868 --> 00:05:36.736 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; UM...

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:40.606 align:start position:0% line:91%
A WOMAN WHO DID NOT WANT TO
STRANGLE YOU?

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:44.977 line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE REVERSE HAPPENS AS WELL,
WHERE HOMOSEXUALS GO OUT AND

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.113 size:81% position:41% line:85%
FIND STRAIGHTS TO BEAT UP.

00:05:47.146 --> 00:05:50.116 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; REALLY?

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:50.750 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:05:50.783 --> 00:05:51.617 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.951 align:start position:0% line:85%
HEY!

00:05:51.984 --> 00:05:52.484 align:start position:0% line:85%
WATCH OUT!

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:56.789 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'VE GOT A CHRISTIAN!
