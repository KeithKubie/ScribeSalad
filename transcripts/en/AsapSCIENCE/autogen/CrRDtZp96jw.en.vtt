00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.980
 When we grew up in Canada, they showed us maps of Canada that looked like this ... 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.170
 Much of Canada is something called the Arctic. The Arctic occupies 40% of Canada 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.500
 and forms two-thirds of the Canadian coast. We haven't really learned much about it at school 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.210
 and it was always the place we wanted to visit the more 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.730
 that we knew that the ice was rapidly disappearing. So we decided to pack our bags, take them 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.530
 take some cameras with us and go there on the Greenpeace ship that sailed from St. John's Newfoundland 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.960
 to Clyde River on Baffin Island to see the consequences of global warming 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:37.640
 with your own eyes. Scientists found the Arctic warming twice as fast as other parts of the world 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.039
 which causes ice on the land and seas to melt, changing sea currents. We really were 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:46.969
 surprised how little ice there was, which we could see as soon as we arrived. 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.860
 Climate change is a global phenomenon. Not just in some places - it's about it 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.300
 all of us. Increased temperatures caused by our burning of fossil fuels 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.899
 it results in the Arctic melting. And these extreme changes strongly affect wild animals 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.290
 and human lives. These are the Inuits. They are indigenous people, 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.080
 who have been living in North America for thousands of years. "Inuit" means "people". And so is it 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.110
 we also perceive - people. When we talk about other cultures ... say ... France. 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.040
 "There are many Inuits" - that's what we call it. That's how we use this word. Besides, we use it, 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.530
 when we talk about ourselves as people. What makes us Inuity is that we are hunters. 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.090
 We come somewhere, we live there for a year, we hunt whales, 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:42.960
 seals and fishes - I think this lifestyle makes us Inuit. In 1939 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.970
 The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled that the Inuits are under jurisdiction 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.440
 federal government, which allowed Canadian laws to take their habits. During 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.910
 World War II, these areas became very important and strategically occupied. 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.160
 These European influences have had a very negative impact on the lifestyle of the Inuit, 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.500
 not to mention forced assimilation in order to eradicate their culture and then destroy their traditional ties, 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.640
 as well as many other indigenous cultures in the world. In the 1950s, the Canadian government 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.680
 forced the Inuit communities to settle permanently in cities or settlements such as the Clyde River for the purpose of 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.011
 ending their nomadic way of life. When you walk through places in my community, you see 

00:02:21.011 --> 00:02:27.690
 that people's homes are nothing but bungalows, wooden cabins. All our roads 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:35.629
 they are gravel and we lack any infrastructure. I remember being with the whole family 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:42.060
 they went camping. We've been gone for weeks, sometimes even months, if we had enough food with us. Actually 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:49.470
 we lived on what the earth gave us and what my father and my brother had caught. 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:56.209
 I wish we would return to the way we lived before, because we had moments together with the family. 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.999
 Everything changed when we couldn't camp anymore. When you consider that agriculture 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:04.900
 is not the simplest activity that could be run in the Nordic regions, so it makes sense that any threat 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.690
 for wild animals, which make up a large part of their livelihoods, it would be a big problem for them. We have with nature 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:15.640
 such a relationship that we do not kill anything unnecessarily. It's our food source. 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.620
 When we kill an animal, we treat it properly, process it properly and give it 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.279
 food community. My favorite dish in the summer is narval - we call it "muktuk". 

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:33.779
 Taste for the first time narwhal. Like this? Just give it to me without anything? Ah, it's warm! 

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:43.090
 Did you cook it? Hmm. Yeah, it's just cooked. Is it soft? Yeah, it's pretty good. This 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:52.010
 is raw. How does it taste? Like a fish. It's like shells. 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:58.599
 Or as an oyster. It's good. Which one do you prefer? It depends on what day I am. 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:05.549
 Today, 68% of Inuit do not have permanent access to healthy or nutritionally nutritious 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.760
 food, making them the hardest-supplied indigenous community 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.989
 in the world. 35% of homes literally lack enough food. In Clyde River 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:21.660
 we have one store. It's called "Northern store". It's a chain of stores that are everywhere in Nanavutu 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.500
 and elsewhere in Canada. Most indigenous communities have a "Northern store" - and that's it 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:35.060
 our only business, so they can charge as much as they want. The prices are 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.229
 twice, three times and sometimes up to four times higher than you would 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:41.380
 bought in Ottawa. 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:52.060
 This pepper costs $ 15.99 ($ ​​12) and I don't even know if it's for paprika or pound and I don't want to know, but it doesn't matter. Anyway, it's a big shock to me. 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.300
 All things that have yellow stickers are delivered by plane, those with black stickers are shipped. So 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:05.889
 a little of this vegetable costs $ 16 ($ 12) and this can of rounds is $ 6.15 ($ 10). 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.990
 And this is happening in Canada - in a community that obviously has problems to make a living. 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.639
 And you know that something is wrong and the goods are overpriced because 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:21.400
 Coca-Cola is 6.15, but Pepsi is 2.59, so there is probably more demand for Coca-Cole. So obviously 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.600
 they are able to lower the price. It's interesting to be 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.009
 in Canada - we are not in another country. We didn't show passports on the way here. 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:33.360
 Our family lives from paycheck to payday and it happens that it's not enough 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:41.539
 to get food for my siblings and my parents. But even if we didn't have food bought in the store, still 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:50.509
 we would have meat from narwhal, seals, fish in the refrigerator - that will often save us. He will save 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:55.900
 we're starving. As if these lack of food problems were not enough, Clyde River probably 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:08.090
 he is currently experiencing the greatest challenge and danger threatening the life of the community. These are seismic 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:13.090
 explosions. Energy and oil companies use seismic explosion technology at 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:18.639
 oil search underwater. Heavily compressed air is fired under water 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:24.069
 ten seconds to explore the seabed and detect any oil deposits. Using 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:28.789
 sound. At the same time, however, this technology poses serious environmental and wildlife impacts. 

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:35.860
 Almost all sea animals use the sound for their life functions. And that's because 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:42.009
 that the sound in the water spreads extremely effectively - five times faster than in the air. And so it is transmitted 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:47.129
 very fast over great distances. Seismic explosions represent the loudest sound created by the human being, 

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:52.419
 at a distance of 4,000 km, it can form a major component of ocean noise. 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:58.169
 Sea animals will have much more difficulty finding food, orienting themselves in space, 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:04.479
 navigation, communication with each other, communication with young, reproduction, mating, 

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:10.830
 Stress will have negative consequences on their immune system. They use the sound for everything. As 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:16.199
 can they not be hit? I can't even imagine. Yippee 

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:22.400
 For me it is much harder to imagine that they will not be hit than they will be. Softly 

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:28.439
 in other words, they will suffer somehow. 

00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:33.270
 And if animals are affected, it's a matter of life and death for the Inuit in the Clyde River. But the Clyde River community is unique 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:37.469
 in that it has launched an unprecedented legal dispute with the Canadian government and 

00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:42.490
 oil corporations to protect their country, culture, wilderness and way of life. Oil companies 

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:49.710
 ask for permission to launch a five-year seismic testing project in Baffin Bay a 

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:54.639
 Davis Strait to find oil and gas under the seabed. They want to fire 

00:07:54.639 --> 00:08:00.189
 a huge area of ​​the Arctic Ocean bottom by seismic explosions. Project Approved 

00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:05.919
 it allows them to bombard the seabed for five years during the year when these areas are accessible to ships - which is quite 

00:08:05.919 --> 00:08:11.539
 significant part of the year. So they are going to bombard the seabed every ten seconds 

00:08:11.539 --> 00:08:15.909
 24 hours per day. But this should not be a problem when you consider that the indigenous peoples in 

00:08:15.909 --> 00:08:19.860
 Canada and around the world have certain human rights as enshrined in the Declaration 

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:24.219
 the rights of indigenous peoples of the United Nations, which \ t 

00:08:24.219 --> 00:08:29.430
 indigenous peoples. Clyde River has never approved this project, yet 

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:33.889
 however, it was approved. The National Energy Council and representatives of oil companies have come 

00:08:33.889 --> 00:08:40.260
 to Clyde River to consult - as they called it. They brought a lot of documents and presentations with them. 

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:44.350
 They told us how they planned to do it. When they presented their plans to us, 

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:49.200
 we asked questions. We asked them things like, "Okay, 

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:54.990
 what about fish like flounder? What will the bursts of these cannons have on the plaice 

00:08:54.990 --> 00:09:01.130
 (or on pakambalu)? "On the crows, walruses ... We were hoping to get answers that would explain 

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:06.790
 what happens, but no, they didn't give us such answers. Here they are 

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:11.279
 excerpts from the debate between experts and the Inuit community. When they asked them, "What 

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:15.140
 the animals will be hit? ", they replied," This is a very complicated question 

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:19.560
 we are not experts on the subject ”. When asked, "What are the effects of seismic testing 

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:25.430
 to marine mammals? ", they replied," How would I just tell you? I am not an expert in this field ”. When they were 

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:29.670
 asked, "How will this research move?", they replied, "It has not yet been decided." 

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:34.370
 This avoidance of genuine consultation to find more oil affects not only 

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:40.360
 animals and the ecosystem, but also the entire Arctic, and thus the lives of the Inuit. So what's going on, 

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:45.639
 is that big oil companies that refuse to understand the fact that what's in the country 

00:09:45.639 --> 00:09:51.310
 we have to leave the country if we want to survive, take the opportunity to 

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:56.910
 to get more of what causes Arctic ice melting from the start. It's them 

00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:02.680
 no matter how their grandchildren will be. They don't care. It doesn't matter to them because 

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:07.250
 see sign. They know what happens. They know that conflicts will escalate, 

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:14.750
 while water supplies will shrink while food becomes increasingly unavailable. 

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:18.820
 Conflicts will escalate across the planet. And what happens then? What will happen, 

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:22.710
 when low-lying places like Bangladesh or the Netherlands engulf water? 

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:25.810
 Where will these people go? The refugee crisis in Europe will be the opposite 

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:30.080
 "walk through rosy garden". That is why the efforts of the Clyde River people to protect their rights in the Arctic 

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:35.930
 so important - it could be an important example for all other indigenous 

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:40.070
 culture in the world. If they lose, seismic blasts start in summer 2017 and they will 

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:44.529
 for the next five years, thus jeopardizing primary food sources 

00:10:44.529 --> 00:10:51.450
 Inuit. They are people who are already fighting for survival. And that's why 

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:57.920
 seismic testing is an absolutely crucial issue regarding their rights to their country, concerning 

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:05.149
 the safety of their country, concerning the safety of their livelihood. Therefore, no company has the right to play 

00:11:05.149 --> 00:11:10.950
 with their source of livelihood. It is and should be illegal and we sincerely hope 

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:17.649
 that it will be illegal. If the seismic explosions began, we feel like we will come 

00:11:17.649 --> 00:11:23.780
 for much of our food, our culture of hunters. It will be absolutely 

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:29.560
 devastating. Because if we don't have anything to hunt, it'll be totally devastating for us. 

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:35.019
 If whales disappear somewhere else, we won't have anything we can catch, I don't know 

00:11:35.019 --> 00:11:45.680
 what will happen. We lose our lives. I'm afraid that seismic explosions absolutely 

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:58.920
 it will change our way of life and marine mammals. I really want to stop it because all 

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:03.740
 animals are really very important to us. And you can only be part of the change by 

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:07.420
 that you sign a petition to push the Supreme Court and the Canadian Government 

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:12.399
 to be on the side of the Clyde River. Or come with us on November 30 to support the Clyde River in Ottawa 

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:16.480
 at a court hearing. If you can't, please sign the petition and share this video 

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:21.160
 to help the Clyde River in their efforts to save the Arctic. Your audience - young people - has 

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:26.529
 much more power than my generation because you are online. I'm absolutely sure 

00:12:26.529 --> 00:12:31.649
 that the only thing that can change anything, however important, is the mass movement of people. 

00:12:31.649 --> 00:12:36.410
 Now, at the moment, the mass online movement is showing up, so it's just that it is 

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:41.070
 you add Greenpeace and sign a petition, it's a great deed. Because politicians have to 

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:47.760
 listen to young people. "Who will vote for us?" I mean, it doesn't matter if you believe 

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:52.610
 in what they do or if they can do anything, but they have to listen 

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:57.440
 and big corporations must also listen to you. That's why I think it's very important to know that when 

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:03.160
 you are young, you have the potential and you can use it. Arctic people are one of the smallest 

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:07.550
 contributors to global warming but are most affected by it. It's not just 

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:12.480
 about CO2, it's about people, about how unfair this situation is, and about everyone 

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:16.360
 we can connect and help the community that needs our help. Some of you probably know Nanny McPhee ... 

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:22.650
 If you don't get involved, I'll show up with my stick, warts and my teeth 

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:24.650
 and I will hurt you. Yeah? Peace.
