00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.930
A simpleton might ask, “If CO2 in our atmosphere
is causing climate change, why don’t we

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.440
just put it underground?”

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.540
You idiot, you’re a genius.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.330
Hi everybody, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.770
There are a lot of options for curbing CO2
production on the table, with my personal

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.000
favorite being not making any more of it.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.490
But as it stands right now, we’re still
very dependent on energy production methods

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.860
that pump billions of tons of it into the
atmosphere annually.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.850
Recently I made a DNews episode on a method
natural gas plants can use to condense their

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.250
CO2, which makes it easier to pressurize it
and store it underground.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.770
But I wanted to follow up with a look at if
that’s really a viable option.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.949
Right now the idea is being put into action
in Decatur, Illinois by Archer Daniels Midland.

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:48.960
They produce over 2,700 tons of CO2 daily
as a byproduct of turning corn into ethanol.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.989
For the last 3 years they’ve been pressurizing
a third of that CO2 and pumping it into sandstone

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.469
2,100 meters below the surface.

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.199
The Carbon Dioxide is heated to 35 degrees
celsius and pressurized to 9.8 megapascals.

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.150
At that temperature and pressure the molecules
don’t act like a gas, but they don’t act

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.150
like a liquid either.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.240
They’re whats called a supercritical fluid,
with properties of both.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.970
It can be pumped through a pipe, but when
it reaches the sandstone sediment deep underground,

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.690
it effuses through the pores like a gas.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.940
This property lets ADM pump 1,100 liters of
Carbon Dioxide underground a minute.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.470
Of course eventually the sandstone deposit
underground will run out of pore space, but

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.720
right now it’s estimated this particular
deposit can store centuries of emissions from

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.850
the upper midwest.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.270
According to the US Geological Survey, there
are enough sandstone sites around the US to

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.330
store American emissions for 500 years.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.480
Great, let’s start drillin’ and fillin’
right?

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.480
Not so fast, there are possible downsides.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.950
Recently headlines were made when studies
showed conclusively that earthquakes in Ohio

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.840
were becoming more frequent because of hydraulic
fracturing.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.590
Fracking isn’t quite the same as this method
of carbon capture and storage, Fracking involves

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.520
pumping water, sand, and other chemicals underground
to break rocks and release natural gas.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.030
Scientists believe the water may be causing
slippages in hidden faults, or providing just

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.660
enough pressure to induce seismic activity.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.850
With this in mind the USGS is monitoring seismic
activity by the Decatur site and so far it

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.190
looks like the storage isn’t having negative
effects topside, so ADM is planning on scaling

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.390
up and pumping all their CO2 underground.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.219
Even if it works flawlessly here detractors
aren’t certain other sites won’t be near

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.709
hidden faults, and we’re going to need a
lot more places to put the carbon dioxide

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.830
if this is going to put a dent in how much
we make.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.459
Thousands more wells like the one in Decatur
in fact.

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.181
So far ADM has pumped about a million tons
underground but the US emits over 5 billion

00:02:30.181 --> 00:02:31.510
tons of it annually.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.049
Plus if the CO2 will find or open cracks in
the bedrock above it and seep back out again,

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:37.310
the whole exercise is moot.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.739
It’s not an immediate fix to the problem,
and if it ends up causing more damage than

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.139
it prevents the plug may be pulled on this
form of carbon storage entirely.

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:47.901
So for now it looks like the best solution
is to reduce emissions where possible, work

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:51.590
towards carbon-neutral energy production,
and steadily introduce carbon capture and

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.680
storage to cut down on how much we emit now.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.639
CO2 isn’t just messing with the environment
globally, it can also screw up your brain

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.150
if you’re stuck in a crowded room.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.299
Matt’s video explains over here.

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.650
Have you been affected by earthquakes either
natural or man-made?

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.450
If you’ve got a story or want us to look
into it, share with us in the comments and

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.889
I’ll see you next time on DNews
