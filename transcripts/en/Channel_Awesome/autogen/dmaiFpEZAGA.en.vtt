probably know this video was not it was

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980
probably know this video was not it was
 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.220
probably know this video was not it was
not a big hit and a lot of people really

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230
not a big hit and a lot of people really
 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.830
not a big hit and a lot of people really
really disliked it and I think it's very

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840
really disliked it and I think it's very
 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.369
really disliked it and I think it's very
important to talk about what to do how

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379
important to talk about what to do how
 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.619
important to talk about what to do how
to handle a failure just as well as how

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629
to handle a failure just as well as how
 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.889
to handle a failure just as well as how
to handle a success because you can have

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899
to handle a success because you can have
 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.650
to handle a success because you can have
a ton of successes and great people love

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660
a ton of successes and great people love
 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.320
a ton of successes and great people love
you for it but once you have a failure

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330
you for it but once you have a failure
 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.640
you for it but once you have a failure
you have to know how to handle it

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650
you have to know how to handle it
 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.800
you have to know how to handle it
because if you keep getting successes

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810
because if you keep getting successes
 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.149
because if you keep getting successes
you're fine but once you have a failure

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159
you're fine but once you have a failure
 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.300
you're fine but once you have a failure
and you don't handle it well and you

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310
and you don't handle it well and you
 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.240
and you don't handle it well and you
handle it very poorly you can lose an

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250
handle it very poorly you can lose an
 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.370
handle it very poorly you can lose an
audience forever potentially and it'd be

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380
audience forever potentially and it'd be
 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.440
audience forever potentially and it'd be
very very hard to get them back if ever

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450
very very hard to get them back if ever
 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.020
very very hard to get them back if ever
so I think it's very important to talk

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030
so I think it's very important to talk
 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.440
so I think it's very important to talk
about that and this video uh I was not

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450
about that and this video uh I was not
 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.990
about that and this video uh I was not
satisfied with when I was done shooting

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000
satisfied with when I was done shooting
 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.539
satisfied with when I was done shooting
it I was really just sort of hoping and

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549
it I was really just sort of hoping and
 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.960
it I was really just sort of hoping and
praying that maybe you know that there's

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970
praying that maybe you know that there's
 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.730
praying that maybe you know that there's
just something there that maybe I'm not

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740
just something there that maybe I'm not
 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.160
just something there that maybe I'm not
seeing that maybe people like in anyway

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170
seeing that maybe people like in anyway
 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.539
seeing that maybe people like in anyway
because there are times where I've put

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549
because there are times where I've put
 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.880
because there are times where I've put
out videos that I felt you know wasn't

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890
out videos that I felt you know wasn't
 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.830
out videos that I felt you know wasn't
my stronger so it wasn't as good as it

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840
my stronger so it wasn't as good as it
 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.590
my stronger so it wasn't as good as it
could be but people still enjoy them so

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600
could be but people still enjoy them so
 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.940
could be but people still enjoy them so
you always sort of take that risk and

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950
you always sort of take that risk and
 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.319
you always sort of take that risk and

was always sort of the idea is that if I

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200
was always sort of the idea is that if I
 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.899
was always sort of the idea is that if I
ever got too busy with stuff or I had

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909
ever got too busy with stuff or I had
 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.280
ever got too busy with stuff or I had
too many trips or something that this

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290
too many trips or something that this
 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.770
too many trips or something that this
could be sort of a fast easy video I

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780
could be sort of a fast easy video I
 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.600
could be sort of a fast easy video I
could do that could also be entertaining

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610
could do that could also be entertaining
 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.930
could do that could also be entertaining
when I was half right I was fast and

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940
when I was half right I was fast and
 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.699
when I was half right I was fast and
easy but it wasn't very entertaining um

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709
easy but it wasn't very entertaining um
 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.300
easy but it wasn't very entertaining um
and I think part of that is that you

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310
and I think part of that is that you
 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.430
and I think part of that is that you
know when I first tried recording this

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440
know when I first tried recording this
 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.720
know when I first tried recording this
and they didn't work I mean that was

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730
and they didn't work I mean that was
 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.830
and they didn't work I mean that was
about four or five years ago and I think

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840
about four or five years ago and I think

something you have to keep in mind when

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220
something you have to keep in mind when
 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.149

proud of but you take a very very very
long time to get to it you have to keep

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.899
long time to get to it you have to keep

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.119
aware whether or not it's still fresh
it's still new and if it still works

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129

because there's so many various levels

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700
because there's so many various levels
 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.610
because there's so many various levels
that you can do and when you do lose

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620
that you can do and when you do lose
 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.290

it's very humorous and there's so many
various ways that you can die and you

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889
various ways that you can die and you
 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.590
various ways that you can die and you
can lose and you can mess up rules and

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600
can lose and you can mess up rules and
 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.420

Creek and that actually was not the
problem I was doing that too much I was

00:16:44.139 --> 00:16:44.149
problem I was doing that too much I was
 

00:16:44.149 --> 00:16:48.069

playing something reacting to it and or

00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079

very similar to it and I was just
 

00:16:53.089 --> 00:16:55.870
very similar to it and I was just
stating the obvious in these reviews in

those to review specifically I recall

00:16:57.699 --> 00:16:57.709
those to review specifically I recall
 

00:16:57.709 --> 00:16:58.990
those to review specifically I recall
thinking to myself this is gonna be

00:16:58.990 --> 00:16:59.000
thinking to myself this is gonna be
 

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.480
thinking to myself this is gonna be
great and it was just like all the other

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:01.490
