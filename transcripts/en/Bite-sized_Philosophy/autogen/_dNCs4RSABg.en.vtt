it hasn't been that long I mean I read
once about a Neolithic ceremony that

once about a Neolithic ceremony that
 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.860
once about a Neolithic ceremony that
involved the particular placement of a

involved the particular placement of a
 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.099
involved the particular placement of a
bear skull in a cave and then I read

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109
bear skull in a cave and then I read
 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.640
bear skull in a cave and then I read
that and they had found these placements

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650
that and they had found these placements
 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.670
that and they had found these placements
in caves that were at least 25,000 years

that tradition remained unbroken for
about 25,000 years and you think it well

Testament documents that implicitly
unconsciously as a consequence of

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:34.740
unconsciously as a consequence of
 

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.110
unconsciously as a consequence of
descriptive fantasy and that that's

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.120
descriptive fantasy and that that's
 

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.790
descriptive fantasy and that that's
what's going on in the book and that so

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800
what's going on in the book and that so
 

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.970
what's going on in the book and that so
the cosmos is under the control of

generic daddy to begin with something
 

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.320
generic daddy to begin with something
like that and then that control shifts

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:49.330
like that and then that control shifts
 

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:54.180
like that and then that control shifts
to localized identifiable increasingly

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:54.190
to localized identifiable increasingly
 

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:57.300
to localized identifiable increasingly
personal and detailed individuals and

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:57.310
personal and detailed individuals and
 

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.550
personal and detailed individuals and
you see that in Noah and then you see

00:07:59.550 --> 00:07:59.560
you see that in Noah and then you see
 

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.870
you see that in Noah and then you see
the neighbor ham and then you see it in

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:00.880
the neighbor ham and then you see it in
 

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.840
the neighbor ham and then you see it in
Moses and and then there's this working

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:03.850
Moses and and then there's this working
 

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.060
Moses and and then there's this working
out of what it would mean to be a fully

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:06.070
out of what it would mean to be a fully

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:08.050
developed individual and that's what
 

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:09.480
developed individual and that's what
