00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.910
Out there in the cosmic abyss are objects
like stars, galaxies and planets.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:12.080
They can coexist peacefully … but sometimes,
a star might look so tantalizing, its neighbor

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.559
will want to eat it.

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.309
*MUNCH*

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.070
White dwarfs are very dense stars, comparable
in mass to our Sun.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.410
These stars are at the end of their lives
and can no longer produce any energy on their

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.220
own to survive.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.579
So when gravity pushes a white dwarf next
to an energy producing star, it makes its

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:32.040
move.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.019
Using its strong gravitational pull, the white
dwarf will suck up the outer gas layers of

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:38.019
a star.

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:42.449
Those gases are essentially star food.

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:48.290
In one instance, a white dwarf devoured 90%
of a star’s mass, turning it into a brown

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.280
dwarf.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.350
Brown dwarfs are considered failed stars because
they can’t shine as brightly.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.429
Basically another star sucked the life out
of it.

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.719
This isn’t just something that happens with
stars.

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:06.480
Our nearest neighbor, the Andromeda galaxy,
is also a space predator.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.079
Stars and dwarf galaxies that get too close
to Andromeda have reportedly been consumed!

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:14.500
And Andromeda is heading our way.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:21.229
The Milky Way and Andromeda galaxy are moving
towards each other at about 75 miles per second.

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.780
It'll take billions of years, but Andromeda
will eventually swallow us whole.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.540
*gasp* Creating a super-giant galaxy.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:34.180
Ultimately, the stars and galaxies can’t
help it, cosmic cannibalism comes down to

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.180
gravity.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.579
It’s a star eat star world out there.

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:38.579
*MUNCH*

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.020
You can watch new episodes of Space Crafts
right here every Wednesday!

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.980
And for more on star siblings, check out this
video to learn about the family tree for the

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.450
stars in our Galaxy.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.299
