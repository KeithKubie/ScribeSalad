00:00:06.045 --> 00:00:09.560
SPEAKER: Good morning and
welcome to the Talks at Google,

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.850
in Cambridge, MA.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.150
Today it is my enormous pleasure
to introduce Gregory Maguire.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.270
Gregory is the author of the
beloved "Wicked Years" series,

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.450
including "Wicked,"
which is the basis

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.990
for the mega long running, mega
popular Broadway musical, which

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.320
will be made into a
mega popular movie

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.230
someday after the musical
stops running, probably.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.110
He has published over 30 other
novels and stories for children

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.890
and adults, including
"Confessions

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.360
of an Ugly Stepsister,"
"Lost," and "Mirror, Mirror."

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.630
He lives outside Boston
with his partner,

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.610
the outstanding
painter Andy Newman.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.130
I recommend visiting his
studio, as I have done,

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.380
which is at the Emerson
Umbrella in Concord.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.670
The next time they have open
studios --beautiful work.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.660
And with their three children.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.740
Please join me in
welcoming, Gregory Maguire.

00:01:14.296 --> 00:01:16.230
GREGORY MAGUIRE: I
assume I am wired

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.770
in several directions,
this one and then this one.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.400
But if it starts to do feedback
you can all plug your ears.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.650
But I won't see you because
the lights are too bright,

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.510
so it won't have
too much effect.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.530
I met a distant friend in
Cambridge in Harvard Square

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:33.460
yesterday.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.750
By distance I mean I'd met
her once or twice before.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.050
She's a Tony nominated musical
actress, Carollee Carmello

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.495
who is playing the
part of Mrs. du

00:01:41.495 --> 00:01:46.230
Maurier in "Finding
Neverland" at the ART.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.080
That's J.M. Barrie's-- the
mother of J.M. Barrie's friend,

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.200
Mrs. Llewelyn Davies.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.980
The reason I know her is because
we both went to the University

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.190
at Albany, and I met her at some
sort of a festival of the arts

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.880
celebrating the University's
contribution to the arts

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.100
about 10 years ago.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.556
When I saw she was in town
I said to myself, well,

00:02:07.556 --> 00:02:09.639
I suppose I should be a
good alum and call her up.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.170
And so we had a nice lunch.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.120
She said she was very proud
to have an ID from Harvard

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.910
because she was an
actress at ART since June.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.610
I said I never got that far.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.440
Indeed, when I first
moved to the area in 1977

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.210
I lived just north
of Harvard Square.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:35.300
But I was so timid about
the radiant intellectualism

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.740
generated by the furnace
of those red bricks

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.860
in that campus, that
for about two years

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.370
I didn't even know I was
permitted to cross the campus.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.980
I always walked completely
around the perimeter

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.130
if I had to get
to the other side.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.120
That's the kind of
insecurity that I

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.680
start with to suggest
two things-- that I feel

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.340
a little bit of
that same insecurity

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.560
today to walk into a
building with Google

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.760
on that letterpress
of it, lets say.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.020
Being a person who
plays and thinks

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.060
with very old fashioned
materials namely, folklore

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.060
and children's
stories, anything that

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:21.650
smacks of cultural
development beyond about 1875

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.580
makes me very nervous indeed.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.590
Nonetheless, here I am, and I'm
thankful to be welcomed here.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.770
I will make a slight correction
to the introduction, which

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.350
is that my books are not
just for children and for YA.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.710
Indeed, "Wicked" and
eight other novels

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.150
were published by the adult
division of HarperCollins.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.540
"Wicked" is published
as an adult book.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.820
And within the first
four pages there's

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.970
a puppet representing
a local minister who

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.570
has two male appendages, one in
the front and one in the back.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.220
And a widow lady puppet
and her daughter position

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.070
themselves on both prongs and
do a kind of a seesaw on him.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.700
I put that scene
in really early so

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.200
that grandmothers
who were looking

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.610
to see if this would be suitable
for eight-year old Hapsiba

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.120
for Christmas, would
right away know

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.360
that Hapsiba was
going to love it.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.460
But it was definitely
not a book for children.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.310
But there's a kind of
a puzzle right there.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.050
Because a great deal of my
work starts with the one thing,

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:24.250
perhaps, that everybody in
this room and almost everybody

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.730
I ever talk to has in common
despite our intellectual

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.970
differences, despite our
political differences,

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.290
our racial, and ethnic, and
socioeconomic differences,

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.640
and that is that
we all originated

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.280
in the culture of childhood.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.080
And we are all
excommunicated from that land

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.990
for the rest of our lives.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.550
But we all remember it,
and we share that memory.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.180
And before we identified
ourselves in other ways,

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.610
we identified ourselves
as children yearning

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.320
toward some kind of story that
helped to unriddle the world

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.710
and make sense of us.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.420
Here's a little bit
about the unriddling.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.970
I'm going to read
three small things,

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.340
but mostly I'm going to show
slides today because I like

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.930
to support my notion
about the universality

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.420
of our common
origins in this room,

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.270
and in every room
that I speak in,

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.750
by showing slides of my
rather common origins

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.710
which were in upstate New
York about 50 years ago.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.540
But here's a section
from "Son of a Witch,"

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.786
which is one of the books
over here on the table.

00:05:31.786 --> 00:05:34.160
I think this is the one that's
being given away for free.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.350
So if you don't take
it, and it's for free,

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.890
I'm going to notice.

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.550
This is the beginning
of the second section.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.730
And here is a sort
of, I suppose,

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.821
little proof that this was
not published for children.

00:05:46.821 --> 00:05:50.930
"A notion of character,
not so much discredited

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.090
as simply forgotten, once
held that people only

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.220
came into themselves part
way through their lives.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.480
They woke up, were they lucky
enough to have consciousness,

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.510
in the act of doing
something they already

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.580
knew how to do-- feeding
themselves with currents.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.500
Walking the dog.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.130
Knotting up a broken boot lace.

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.200
Singing antiphonally
in the choir.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.690
Suddenly-- this is I, I am the
girl singing this alto line

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.130
off-key, I am the boy
loping after the dog,

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.010
and I can see myself
doing it as, presumably,

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.930
the dog cannot see itself.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.560
How peculiar!

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.790
I lift on my toes at
the end of the dock,

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:43.000
to dive into the lake
because I am hot,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.220
and while isolated like a
specimen on the glassy slide

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.950
of summer, the notions
of hot and lake

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:57.300
and I converge into
a consciousness

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.720
of consciousness--
in an instant--

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.960
in between launch and landing,
even before I cannonball

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.710
into the lake, shattering
both my reflection

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.930
and my old notion of myself.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:13.130
That was what was once believed.

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.730
Now, it seems hardly to
matter when and how we become

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.620
ourselves, or even
what we become.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.530
Theory chases theory
about how we are composed.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.750
The only constant--
the abjuration

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.760
of personal responsibility.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.040
We are the next thing the
Time Dragon is dreaming,

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.950
and nothing to be done about it.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:42.710
We are the fanciful
sketch of wry Lurline,

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:46.150
we are droll and ornamental,
and no more culpable

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:50.600
than a sprig of lavender
or a sprig of lightning,

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.500
and nothing to be done about it.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.230
We are an experiment in
situational ethics set

00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:00.940
by the Unnamed God, which
in keeping its identity

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:04.440
secret also cloaks the
scope of the experiment

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:08.810
and our chance of
success or failure at it,

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:12.090
and nothing to be done about it.

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:16.690
We are loping sequences
of chemical conversions,

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:19.930
acting ourselves converted.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:23.730
We are twists of genes
acting ourselves twisted;

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:28.850
we are wicks of burning neuroses
acting ourselves wicked.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.870
And nothing to be done about it.

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:36.659
And nothing to be
done about it."

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:38.559
Not much plot in that section.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:42.210
But it does, in fact,
bring us to the point--

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:43.614
where did we start from?

00:08:43.614 --> 00:08:46.150
And how is it that we
have a common language?

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.080
So now comes to the common part.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:53.010
I was born in 1954
in Albany, New York.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.270
Oh, I see.

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:00.372
Now I see myself, but
I don't see the slides.

00:09:00.372 --> 00:09:02.580
So I'm going to have to turn
so I can see where I am.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:07.400
My father was a journalist,
a humorous writer.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.860
There they are,
thank you so much.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:12.090
And my mother died
in childbirth.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:15.862
So after I was born I was
first taken by an aunt,

00:09:15.862 --> 00:09:17.070
and then put in an orphanage.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:18.528
They still had
orphanages, and they

00:09:18.528 --> 00:09:22.060
called them that in Catholic
orphanages in upstate New York.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:26.120
And after about two years,
because I had not been adopted,

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.440
my father remarried and
collected his children

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.510
from the various
places they were sent.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:35.400
And my stepmother and my
father had three more children

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.630
together, and that
was a group of seven.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:41.830
This is a group of four
of us, the older four,

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:43.520
sitting at my father's
newspaper office,

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.620
"The Albany Times Union."

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.935
He wrote a humorous column and
was a journalist, as well--

00:09:47.935 --> 00:09:48.950
a reporter.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:52.090
I'm the one second
from the back.

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:57.156
The one with the fat knees
and the check jumpsuit.

00:09:57.156 --> 00:09:58.620
I'm kneeling up
on my typewriter.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:02.640
My father very kindly took
us out from our stepmother

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.342
to babysit us for once a year.

00:10:04.342 --> 00:10:05.800
And we went to the
newspaper office

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.200
and played on the typewriters.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.670
Probably on a Saturday.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:11.970
Now, my parents were
not very prosperous,

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.770
and they were very strict.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.840
Because of the death of
my mother in childbirth,

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:22.390
my parents raised us under
a lightning and thunder

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:26.670
cloud of anxiety about who
would be the next to go.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:30.240
So we did not enjoy a lot
of middle class privileges

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.080
that probably we
could have afforded.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.810
My parents weren't impressed
with middle class culture

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:38.620
and the burgeoning
TV generation.

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:44.420
So every week at Sunday dinner,
the seven children and the two

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.800
adults had to vote which
half hour in the upcoming

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.210
week the TV would
be on for the kids.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:52.580
One half hour a week.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:56.210
Every week it was
"Gilligan's Island."

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:59.940
And this says a lot about
the limitations of democracy.

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:03.760
But, the greatest good
for the greatest number,

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.540
or the greatest bad for the
greatest number, perhaps.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.100
Nonetheless, once
a year my parents

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.590
relented and let us
watch "The Wizard of Oz"

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:14.820
when it was shown
as a kind of moment

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.494
in the liturgical calendar.

00:11:16.494 --> 00:11:18.410
I mean, there was
Christmas, there was Easter,

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:19.640
there was "The Wizard of Oz."

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.110
And because they
relented their harshness

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:24.190
about too much
exposure to TV, it

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:26.120
became a kind of magical event.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.570
We anticipated it.

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:30.070
We talked about it
in the weeks to come.

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:31.770
All the schoolkids watched it.

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:35.290
And then when we came together
around the water cooler,

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.259
as it were, the water
fountain in a grade school,

00:11:38.259 --> 00:11:39.800
we talked about it
after it was over.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.000
Talked about which
were our best parts.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.570
I suppose, in some ways, I
began to become a writer when

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:49.570
I was about six,
by dint of loving

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:53.740
that extravagant story which
was so filled with adventure,

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:58.610
and privilege, and rambling
in a way that my life was not.

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.440
My life was only filled
with brothers, and sisters,

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.730
and books.

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:06.695
Here's a picture of me, and my
sister, and my younger brother.

00:12:06.695 --> 00:12:09.080
I'm the shy one
picking my fingernails.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.230
And we're about to start
playing the Wizard of Oz

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.210
again in the backyard.

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:13.770
I was a kind of impresario.

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:17.870
I would rake in various kids
and say, you can be Dorothy,

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:20.350
and you be the Tin Man, and
you be the Wicked Witch,

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:22.510
and I'll be the Wizard.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:24.447
And we could,
interestingly, we could--

00:12:24.447 --> 00:12:25.780
we all knew the story very well.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:26.970
If you didn't put
the music in it,

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:28.719
you could run through
the entire 90 minute

00:12:28.719 --> 00:12:30.870
film in about 12 minutes.

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:33.150
But then, what to do next?

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:34.046
I was the boss kid.

00:12:34.046 --> 00:12:35.670
There's always a boss
kid in any group.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:37.760
But I was the boss
kid, so I'd say,

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.380
now we're going to do it again.

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:41.160
But this time, you
can be the Tin Man,

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.380
and you can be the Wizard,
and you can be Tinker Bell,

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:46.530
and you can be Captain Hook.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:48.740
And somebody would
say, no, Captain Hook

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:50.400
doesn't belong in that story.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.760
And I would say,
hey, it's our story.

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.490
We can put in it what we want.

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:59.330
So in this version
Captain Hook comes to Oz.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.670
And he meets the Wicked
Witch of the West.

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:04.510
And they get married.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.030
And they have twins.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:11.780
And they call them little
Hookems and little Snookems.

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:16.420
And so you give kids new
material and say, now let's go.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.650
It was a little improv,
it was "Chicago,"

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:22.400
and the kids ran with it.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.420
And I ran with it.

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.670
And I think it's when
I began to understand,

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:29.040
we all own this stuff
together and there's

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.340
no way to do damage
to the original

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:35.760
just by examining it and
seeing what else will happen.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.624
Here's my brothers and
sisters, not even all of us,

00:13:38.624 --> 00:13:39.790
when I'm a little bit older.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.120
I'm the one at the end
with a head like a bowling

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:46.000
ball and eyeglasses.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.790
And I started writing
stories that I

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:53.140
was playing when I was about
in third grade or fourth grade.

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.720
I show this slide just to
suggest that I was never

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.465
the brightest banana in the
bunch, even in my family.

00:13:58.465 --> 00:13:59.840
I couldn't spell
my own last name

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.298
until I was about
in seventh grade.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:09.970
Because of the intense
pressure and oppression

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:14.477
of my parents on our liberty,
stories were an escape for me.

00:14:14.477 --> 00:14:16.560
And I suppose they were
mental health and therapy,

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.180
although I didn't
know it at the time.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:19.970
When I say the
pressure, here's what

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:22.150
I mean, here's an
example-- we were not

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:25.600
allow as children to ride two
wheeled bicycles until we were

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.100
16 and had passed the New York
State driver's license exam

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.840
and were legally
allowed to drive a motor

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.220
vehicle on the street.

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.640
That was our privilege,
to ride a bike.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.040
That's how strict they were.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.260
But they did not
restrict our imaginations

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.100
and they did not censor
our choices in the library.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.330
So I was raised by my
father, my stepmother,

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.990
and the local librarians,
and the local nuns.

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:47.815
Here's a story, the
oldest one I have,

00:14:47.815 --> 00:14:49.690
though it's not the
first story I ever wrote,

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:51.200
called, "The Hotel Bomb."

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.290
I know this not a good
slide and I apologize.

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:54.410
"The Hotel Bomb."

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:57.630
At the top it says, by Gregory
Maguire and David Carton.

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:59.130
The David Carton
part is crossed off

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:02.460
in pencil, and underneath that
it says, "Stupid David Carton."

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.940
He was my best friend
in fourth grade.

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:07.000
He was going to help me
collaborate on this book,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.666
but he never actually
did any work on it

00:15:08.666 --> 00:15:11.560
so I took his name
off the credits.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.310
To get a story started
when I was in fourth grade,

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:18.730
I knew the importance of
a hook, an exciting image.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:22.770
Here's a picture of the
main character, a husband

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:25.400
named Bob, who has red
trousers and a gray suit coat.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:29.330
He's trying to run 100 miles
across the landscape of Ohio

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.900
to try to save his wife who is
about to be blown up by a bomb.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.030
And I drew the
picture first as a way

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:38.940
to instill excitement and
interest myself in figuring out

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.730
why is this happening,
and what's going on.

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:46.130
I also was like any
kid, one who found

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:48.890
handwriting
difficult and tiring.

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:51.110
So I would draw pictures
in the corner of the pages.

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.840
Every page.

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.570
I illustrated every page
of my first 50 books,

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:58.780
let's say, both
to take up space,

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:00.510
and to make the book go faster.

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:04.480
But also, I realized, I was
inventing for myself that

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.330
theory of left
brain/ right brain.

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:07.940
That sometimes I
would draw pictures,

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.440
and then I would
look at them, and I

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:13.009
would see what my subconscious
actually was interested in.

00:16:13.009 --> 00:16:14.550
So here's a picture
from Chapter One,

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:16.350
Bob getting a letter
that says his wife is

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:18.420
about to be blown up by a bomb.

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.580
I drew a picture of Bob's
wife hanging there on the wall

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.320
so as to instill
sympathy and compassion

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.800
in the part of the readers.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.650
Once when I showed this slide
to some second grade boys

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:32.750
in Syracuse, New York, one
kid raised his hand and said,

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:36.090
is that picture of Bob's wife
hanging on the wall behind him?

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:37.460
I said, yes, it is.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.120
And he said, if
that was my wife,

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.494
I'd let her get
blown up by bomb.

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:46.670
I felt I had failed
as an artist if he

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:49.140
didn't have great sympathy.

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:50.570
Stories were always
four chapters

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:52.400
long when I was in
fourth grade, which

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.483
meant that there was
a page for the front,

00:16:53.483 --> 00:16:54.540
and a page for the back.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.920
Here was the chapter
about guests at the hotel.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.780
His wife is staying
on the 50th floor.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:02.050
The story takes place in 1865 so
they haven't invented elevators

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:02.580
yet.

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:06.270
But he has no major cardiac
problems, and he's running up.

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:08.410
He's at the 19th
floor, 31 floors to go.

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:09.699
He gets there right in time.

00:17:09.699 --> 00:17:10.990
Throws the bomb out the window.

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:12.420
His wife is saved.

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:14.510
I did not know how
to edit my work.

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:16.230
As soon as I was
finished with it,

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:19.690
I showed it to my brother,
my sister, my best friend,

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:21.490
and opened up the
next set of pages

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:24.140
and stapled them
with a Tot stapler,

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.579
and began the next story.

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:28.390
I never knew how to look back
and say, why would somebody

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:29.660
want to blow Jane up?

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:31.559
And who was the villain anyway?

00:17:31.559 --> 00:17:33.100
And if they did want
to blow Jane up,

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:34.710
why did they bother to
send Bob a letter saying

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:35.710
we're going to do it?

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:37.510
That just gave him a
chance to save her.

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:39.620
There are many,
many loose strands.

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:42.000
But what there wasn't,
was a lack of energy,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.500
and a lack of motion, and
lack of forward thrusting.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:51.170
Now, I don't have pages and
pages and pages of my text.

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.785
I do have pages of
illustrations because they

00:17:53.785 --> 00:17:55.630
were more fun to look at.

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:57.430
So to indicate the
kinds of things

00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:00.560
that I wrote when I was a kid--
not a single one of these being

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:03.640
a homework assignment,
I might point out.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.920
I guess I was an example of
what Malcom Gladwell talks

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.590
about in "Outsiders,"
that young person who

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:13.730
was 10,000 hours worth of work
before they finish college

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:14.990
and the thing that they love.

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:16.720
And I probably-- I
counted it up once--

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.300
I probably did about
10,000 hours of writing

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.290
between fourth
grade to 12th grade,

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:25.270
just because I love to do it,
and because I was inspired,

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.800
I guess.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.550
Not inspired by
anything important, just

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:29.130
inspired to work.

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:31.940
All kinds of adventures happened
in my early childhood stories

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:35.820
like ladies falling off clipper
ships and almost drowning.

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:39.029
I see from the prose, that
the sailors are willing,

00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:40.320
but sailors are always willing.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.300
So there they go
trying to save her.

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:47.220
Avalanches would come down
and crash up people's houses.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:49.460
I feel sorry for that
particular character.

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.370
She's running for
safety form an avalanche

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:55.290
into a thatch roofed
cottage, which

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:58.350
I hope is reinforced
with iron beams.

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:01.482
Avalanches would come down
and knock people off cliffs.

00:19:01.482 --> 00:19:02.315
I liked perspective.

00:19:02.315 --> 00:19:03.770
I liked action.

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:06.580
I liked to put people
in danger, but I always

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:10.100
made sure they got saved
in the nick of time.

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.617
People would get notes in
the mail that said, beware.

00:19:13.617 --> 00:19:14.950
Which is not terribly efficient.

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:16.710
Beware of what?

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:19.670
Beware of the left elevator
in the bank of three?

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:23.930
Beware of the lack
of proper signage

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:26.180
on the streets around
East Cambridge?

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:28.800
What are you supposed
to beware of?

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.220
To get a story started
I began to understand--

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.860
and these are all things
that I found for myself

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.040
by experimentation,
not by reading

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.520
how to write stories--
I sort of invented

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.040
the notion of the story board.

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:45.240
And I invented a collection
of characters, colored them,

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.320
drew them, cut them out,
and tried to arrange them

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:52.210
on the top of my desk to decide
where the conflicts-- where

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:55.340
there were surprising
conflicts, where there were

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.410
obvious conflicts-- and
how to make a story out

00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:00.150
of the stress among
the characters.

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:02.460
In this set of characters,
as you can see,

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.510
the guy with the torch
on the upper left

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:06.300
looks as if he
doesn't really enjoy

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.875
the beauties of modern ballet.

00:20:08.875 --> 00:20:10.250
Then the guy with
a bow and arrow

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:13.830
has just about had it
with cafeteria lunches.

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:15.249
There's a nun.

00:20:15.249 --> 00:20:16.790
There's a lady who
looks suspiciously

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:18.560
like Barbara Eden in
"I Dream of Jeannie,"

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.340
even though we never voted
for "I Dream of Jeannie."

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.230
And three knights
in shining armor,

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:25.510
and a man on a flying carpet.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:28.350
I also figured out
the business about how

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:30.800
to use a prompt for myself.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.890
Sometimes I would draw
an exciting picture,

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:35.610
and then ask myself the
journalist questions about it.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.120
Here's a lady falling
off the roof of a castle.

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.010
Well, where is this castle?

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:41.600
When does this story take place?

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.150
So if she's not
wearing a long skirt

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:46.270
it must be fairly contemporary.

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:47.590
Who are those people?

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:51.010
Why is the blond haired woman
looking in the wrong direction?

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:53.139
What is that woman carrying
in her pocketbook that

00:20:53.139 --> 00:20:55.430
is so important, that as
she's falling through the air,

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:58.610
she needs to grip
on the strap of it?

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:01.190
If I can answer any
of those questions,

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:03.010
even a couple of
them, then maybe

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:06.010
I have the nugget, or
the germ, or the yeast,

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:09.530
or the virus for a story.

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:11.260
But the time I was
in seventh grade,

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.920
actually a little
bit earlier, I had

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:17.170
learned how to make friends
whom I could boss around

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:19.370
and put on my team.

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:21.500
And so here's an
example of a story

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:22.750
that I wrote in seventh grade.

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:25.180
It was about 120 pages long.

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:26.780
And the way we
would work it would

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:29.830
be, we'd knock it back and
forth like playing tennis,

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:32.300
or badminton, or ping pong.

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:33.780
I would write three
or four pages,

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:36.790
bring it in to school the next
day, hand the volume of pages

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:38.780
to my friend who
would take it home,

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:41.140
add a couple pages of
his own to bring it back.

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:44.080
We never talked in advance
about what would happen.

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.730
We just reacted,
again, like improv,

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:50.350
to whatever had been
put on the pages before.

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:51.480
Here's a sample chapter.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.440
Chapter 28.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.719
Philip in Trouble.

00:21:53.719 --> 00:21:55.510
I'm not going to read
the depth-less prose,

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:57.970
but you can see by
looking at the picture

00:21:57.970 --> 00:21:59.530
that Philip is in trouble.

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:02.750
He's hanging off the wing
of an airplane with one hand

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:06.230
and his girlfriend
is hanging off him.

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:09.214
Airplane crashes on the
next page and burns up.

00:22:09.214 --> 00:22:10.630
Luckily, Philip
and his girlfriend

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:13.300
have unusually resilient ankles.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.920
And a hay wagon has been
driving by the airstrip

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:19.170
and they managed to swing
and sway and drop themselves

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:20.209
into the hay wagon.

00:22:20.209 --> 00:22:21.750
The only other person
in the airplane

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:24.370
was the pilot, who is
capably doing a back flip out

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:29.290
the broken cockpit window
and just escaping the flames.

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:31.700
Again, a lot of danger.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:34.250
Danger was on the
edge of my life.

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:36.180
It's on the edge of
all of our lives.

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:39.890
But I was trying to manage
danger and write stories

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:42.800
about people escaping from the
things that might otherwise

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.930
have happened to them.

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:46.680
Upstate New York--
Albany, New York--

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.370
was not a place that inspired
a great deal of fascination

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:50.640
for me at the time.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.280
William Kennedy had not
started to write about it yet.

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.720
So when I was a
kid, and never going

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:59.030
farther afield than, say, the
Adirondacks or the Catskills,

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:02.050
I set a lot of stories in
Europe, which seemed much more

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:05.540
dramatic, and a place where
real adventure would happen.

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:10.070
"Episode in Rome" was a story
about a lady whose main job

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:13.504
is to fix the TV
antenna for the Pope.

00:23:13.504 --> 00:23:15.670
There she is running across
the roof of the Vatican.

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:19.070
A very important secret signal
is going to come into the Pope

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:20.890
through the aegis
of some talk show.

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:23.580
And he has to watch it,
but at signal is bad,

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:24.830
so there she goes.

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:27.026
I don't remember too
much more about it.

00:23:27.026 --> 00:23:30.330
"Grecian Nightmare"
took place in Greece.

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:33.840
You see, I began to be
increasingly historical-- very

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.860
interested in
historiography, let's say--

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:39.380
and I broke down the beginnings
and endings of the story.

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:42.680
I don't remember what was the
nightmare about in this story,

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:44.870
except it took place
in Greece and the lady

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:47.755
looks like she has a
collapsed cake on her head.

00:23:47.755 --> 00:23:50.570
"Something is Rotten"
took place in Denmark.

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:56.250
I was trying to
cover the waterfront.

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:58.614
"Some Rise by Sin."

00:23:58.614 --> 00:23:59.530
I was in eighth grade.

00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:01.060
I was becoming pretentious.

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:03.840
That's a quote from
Shakespeare, "Some rise by sin.

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:05.940
Some by virtue fall."

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:07.570
Well, I had to ask
myself the question,

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:09.680
how does one rise by sin?

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.710
As a Catholic school
boy I had no idea.

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:14.850
How does one fall by virtue?

00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:17.740
I had just a little
bit more idea of that.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:21.110
Here's a sample chapter
of what I knew of romance.

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:23.050
"I love you, John.

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:25.200
I love you, Margaret.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.460
No, I love you, John.

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:29.270
You've already said
that, Margaret."

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:31.664
So I'm obviously not very
interested in romance

00:24:31.664 --> 00:24:32.330
in eighth grade.

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:34.788
I just think this is what I'm
supposed to be writing about,

00:24:34.788 --> 00:24:35.800
but I get bored.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:39.160
One of my rules to myself as a
writer my whole life has been,

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:42.330
if it's boring to me, it's going
to be boring to everybody else.

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:43.230
So what happens?

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:45.180
The next chapter--
"John and Margaret

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:49.150
get new jobs as trapeze
artist in the circus."

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:52.450
I look at this picture now
many decades later and I think,

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:55.290
Margaret looks like she's
about four months pregnant.

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:57.930
But women are working a lot
later than they used to.

00:24:57.930 --> 00:24:59.577
Maybe she has good coverage.

00:24:59.577 --> 00:25:01.910
What they don't know is that
Margaret's former boyfriend

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:05.740
works at the circus, and he's
on the other end of the trapeze

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.530
act-- the high wire act.

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:09.900
And just as she goes
sailing through the air

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:12.200
he's going to tuck his
hands back and accidentally

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.560
miss her on purpose.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.630
So now we know how
one falls by virtue.

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:18.410
Luckily, there's safety net.

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:20.160
And Margaret is in the
practice of packing

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.970
a pearl handled derringer
in her pantyhose.

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:26.190
So she bounces back
and takes revenge

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:27.650
before the end of chapter.

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:30.510
Some rise by sin,
some by virtue fall.

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:33.950
Keep working at it
and you work it out.

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:36.670
I tried about the time
I was-- about the summer

00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:38.750
in between eighth
grade and ninth grade,

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:42.029
or seventh grade and eighth
grade-- I tried branching out.

00:25:42.029 --> 00:25:44.320
And I to tried to write
stories for my younger brothers

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.980
and sisters who were
being able to read fairy

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:50.490
tales like this one
about two princesses who

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:53.810
look like Nazi
stormtroopers in drag.

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:56.510
Very strong shoulder
muscles dragging those capes

00:25:56.510 --> 00:26:00.070
across the floor, up
stairs, out the door.

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:02.780
I was imitating
different genre trying

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:05.420
to figure out where
I felt best at home.

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:08.630
There was a great love
of John le Carre--

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:12.660
"The Spy Who Came in from
the Cold"-- and that stuff.

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.495
When I was-- "A Small
Town in Germany"--

00:26:14.495 --> 00:26:16.570
but I was in early high school.

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:19.140
So I realized that what
you always have to do,

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:21.770
is you have to engage your
reader by giving them something

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:22.589
that they know.

00:26:22.589 --> 00:26:24.630
But then you have to trick
them and surprise them

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:27.560
by turning the tables,
much as one does in a joke.

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:32.990
So if we think of Russian,
and Soviet and American spies,

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:37.260
or German spies even, in
the '40s or '50s or '60s,

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:40.080
we think of middle age
balding men with trench coats.

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.360
So I decided to put
a conversion on it

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:46.000
and make it middle age
balding women in trench coats.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.290
So the American spy is
woman and Grannie Harquin

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:51.680
and the Russian spy is
a gangster's girlfriend,

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.386
a ball with a pistol.

00:26:53.386 --> 00:26:54.760
She has a head
like a light bulb.

00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:59.850
I tried writing
historical fiction,

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:02.660
although I didn't know
much about history, really.

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:05.680
If any of you have ever visited
the home of Frederic Church,

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.280
the painter, near Hudson in
New York in the Hudson River

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.180
Valley, you might
recognize that staircase.

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:13.150
It's the staircase he
designed his home, Olana.

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:13.990
I went there.

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:18.370
I loved all the art and I
loved the mid 19th century wood

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:22.850
work, and the Moorish,
Byzantine, Gothico design

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:23.990
of the building.

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:27.410
Being an architect was my
second ambition in life.

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:31.150
But I didn't
actually have Google,

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:32.950
yet I didn't know how
to do research on,

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:36.240
for instance, how horse's legs
were attached to their bodies.

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:39.170
This horse could never
run because his back legs

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:41.050
are on backwards.

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:42.940
He basically has
four front legs.

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:45.930
They're all bending
in the same direction.

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:48.217
And I tried to smear it
all up in the rain storm

00:27:48.217 --> 00:27:50.550
so nobody would see that I
actually didn't know anything

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:53.790
about the anatomy of a horse.

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:58.020
My characters eventually began
to have more complicated adult

00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:58.820
lives.

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:02.370
In this story, whatever it
was I don't even remember,

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:04.800
there are two
characters who have

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.840
roles in Broadway musicals.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.190
Who knew?

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:09.990
But still on their
nights and weekends off

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:11.906
they have time to do
exciting things like fall

00:28:11.906 --> 00:28:13.880
off fire escapes.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:15.541
The woman on the
upper balcony looks

00:28:15.541 --> 00:28:17.540
like she's balancing a
bowling ball on her head,

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:18.759
but that was just a blob.

00:28:18.759 --> 00:28:20.550
I was trying to learn
how to do pen and ink

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:25.360
and it was hard to
control the quill pen.

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.160
This woman has lost her shoe.

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.660
She's about to lose her mind,
but she's lost her shoe.

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:31.820
I love how that
shoe was highlighted

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:36.380
with no paint around it.

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:38.030
It's so tender.

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:41.270
And I don't really know if
she's going to be saved,

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:43.810
but I suspect she will.

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:47.455
Now, that business about
looking at something you love

00:28:47.455 --> 00:28:49.496
and drawing inspiration from it.

00:28:49.496 --> 00:28:50.870
When I was about
in sixth grade I

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:52.580
discovered the
"Narnia Chronicles."

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:55.180
They weren't as popular
as they later became,

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:57.290
and it really was a
discovery in the library.

00:28:57.290 --> 00:28:59.740
It was like a scene
but from a story.

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:00.620
There they were.

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:02.920
I picked out "The Lion, the
Witch and the Wardrobe."

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:05.650
There was a picture of a dwarf
drinking a cup of hot chocolate

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:06.580
on the cover.

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:08.440
And I thought, this is
not just a fairytale,

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.440
this is a whole book that has
characters from fairytales.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.020
How cool is that?

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.019
I never had heard
of such a thing.

00:29:15.019 --> 00:29:17.560
Although, I had loved the Grimm
tales and the Perrault tales.

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:20.430
So quite quickly I made
up my own magic land.

00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:22.870
I didn't set a story in
Narnia, but I made up

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:28.150
my own land called Fliaan,
which was your standard issue,

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:31.750
sort of medieval, late medieval,
magic kingdom with kings,

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:34.390
and queens, and dragons,
and witches, and elves,

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:35.910
and dwarves, and
things like that.

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:39.200
This kingdom was ruled by a
rather loud mouthed queen named

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.145
Ethel Berman.

00:29:40.145 --> 00:29:42.550
She used to stride
around the palace singing

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:43.580
at the top of her lungs.

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:46.140
She was so loud that they
had to hire a sorcerer

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:47.840
to get a spell on
her, to shut up once

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.700
and while so they could
all get some sleep.

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:51.240
That was one of the plot points.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.160
I suppose you can
see the conversion

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.900
of my interest in fantasy
and children's stories,

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:59.580
and my destination on the
Broadway musical stage

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:02.070
coming together a little bit,
even before I was halfway

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:03.210
through high school.

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:11.390
This is, in a sense,
the last childhood story

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:14.310
that I wrote, "The
Nash- Manhattan."

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:16.070
I think this was in 10th grade.

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:19.240
It's about a 50 story hotel
in New York, once again.

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:21.850
It's the first story in which
I put kids as characters.

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:23.755
Kids are descending off
the roof of the hotel

00:30:23.755 --> 00:30:26.801
on bed sheets they've
tied together into a rope.

00:30:26.801 --> 00:30:28.800
They're trying to steal
back a teddy bear that's

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.430
been stolen from them.

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:33.630
The nightclub singer in
the Windows on the World

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:36.980
restaurant, as it were, is
having a glass of Alka Seltzer.

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:38.480
She thinks she's
going insane seeing

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:42.320
two kids on the outside
of a skyscraper.

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.440
The last scene in
the story is where

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.010
the two burglars who
stole the teddy bear

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:50.290
are being chased and captured
by the annual convention of nuns

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:53.040
who are having their
meeting in the ballroom.

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:56.480
They tied them up
with rosary beads.

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:59.650
Yes, I did go to Catholic
school through 12th grade.

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:04.510
Now, there is a very thin line
between being a wunderkind

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:06.300
and being insane.

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:09.040
And we never of
us know which side

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:11.720
we are at any point
or moment of our day.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.986
I do address often
the importance

00:31:13.986 --> 00:31:15.610
of keeping notes and
keeping a journal.

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:20.945
And I've been keeping a journal
for, I think, 49 years now,

00:31:20.945 --> 00:31:22.420
or 47.

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:24.620
But there are times when
you can go overboard.

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:27.480
My sister Annie gave
me a little $0.19

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.670
duo tang folder for
Christmas one year.

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:31.170
That was our sort
of holiday budget.

00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:33.284
No more than $0.20, kids.

00:31:33.284 --> 00:31:34.825
And I didn't know
what to do with it,

00:31:34.825 --> 00:31:36.430
so I put in it some
school paper and I

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:37.900
began to keep a
list of everything

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:40.870
that I ate for
dinner in year 1969.

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:42.300
And I have it.

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:43.490
And I still have it.

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:44.950
And why I did
this, I don't know.

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:47.760
But once I started
I couldn't stop.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:51.180
I only did it for
one year, though.

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:54.590
I began to see how
playing with conventions

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:58.260
can be funny, as well
as just a way to learn.

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:01.030
My mother-- my stepmother--
went back to college

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:03.360
after her youngest child
was in kindergarten,

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:06.310
and started out by taking
computer programming, and then

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:08.160
computer law, and
then for break she

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.740
took a course and old films.

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:12.710
So one year for Christmas
I made her my approximation

00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:13.940
of an old movie.

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:15.740
We didn't have
video H recorders--

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:18.310
or whatever the super eight
they called them-- again,

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:20.550
because we weren't
very prosperous.

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:22.950
But there was a
local Woolworth's

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:25.570
with one of those booths
where you take strips.

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:27.860
Four pictures for $0.25.

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:30.720
So I wrote a play and I got
my brothers, and sisters,

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:34.030
and friends and we trooped
to Woolworth's with our props

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:35.840
and our costumes,
and our set design

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:40.250
and we filmed the movie in the
Woolworth's booth, "Passion,

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:42.600
Pride, and a Place to Pray."

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:43.340
Here's one reel.

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:44.410
Reel two.

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:46.129
My sister Annie,
who is about eight,

00:32:46.129 --> 00:32:47.670
is playing the part
of the widow lady

00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:50.300
whose house is about to
be foreclosed on her.

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.920
Her best line, indeed the
best line in the entire piece,

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:55.510
is when she says to the
villain, "You can take my baby,

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:56.440
but not me."

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:59.250
And she throws her baby in
the face of the villain.

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:00.547
That's the third strip.

00:33:00.547 --> 00:33:02.880
She's saying it somewhat
hilariously because, of course,

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.980
the camera's going
every seven seconds

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:08.590
and then she had to scoot
out so that the villain could

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:11.270
have his leering close up.

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:13.440
The baby went out the
curtain and over the heads

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:15.439
of four cashiers of
Woolworth's so we were never

00:33:15.439 --> 00:33:17.050
allowed back there again.

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:18.610
So there was no sequel.

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:23.870
There was no "Passion, Pride,
and a Place to Pray, Part Two."

00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:25.740
This is my first published book.

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:28.960
I got the idea when
I was in high school.

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.785
It was-- what was that movie?

00:33:31.785 --> 00:33:33.660
I don't know if it was
called "Multiplicity,"

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:36.420
but about a person
who splits and becomes

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:39.790
different flitches
of his own self.

00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:42.140
I had that idea too,
before the movie.

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:45.310
And so this was the story that
I thought of in high school

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:49.620
and I wrote when I was in
college about a boy who

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:52.300
meets a girl who
is about his age.

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:54.792
But there's also a
woman in her late '80s.

00:33:54.792 --> 00:33:56.500
And he's actually
meeting the same person

00:33:56.500 --> 00:34:01.270
at two different points in
their time in the same building.

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:03.090
Originally it was
called "Grandma Passes,"

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:05.780
but I was afraid it sounded too
much like grandma passes out,

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:08.150
so I changed it to
"Daniel in Battle."

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:11.040
And then wrote it three times.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:15.639
I wrote it in '7s-- started
in '72, started it in '73,

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:19.260
and then started it
again for good in '74.

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:22.139
I got three independent
study credits

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:24.306
toward my undergraduate degree.

00:34:24.306 --> 00:34:25.989
I was good at doing
that kind of thing.

00:34:25.989 --> 00:34:27.280
But it was my first
published book.

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:28.738
It was published
by Farrar Strauss.

00:34:28.738 --> 00:34:33.190
I sold it when I was 24, and
it was published when I was 25.

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:36.239
The first one of
38 books, to date.

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:39.810
I kept drawing all the
way through college.

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:41.020
I didn't do my own covers.

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:43.780
My editors never liked
the way that I drew.

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:45.674
I didn't like this cover.

00:34:45.674 --> 00:34:48.920
This is supposed to
be a fantastical book

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:50.690
and that kid is having
a dream journey.

00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:52.949
But to me he looks like
the Campbell's Soup kid

00:34:52.949 --> 00:34:55.239
who's escaped from jail.

00:34:55.239 --> 00:34:57.139
And I don't think any
self-respecting kid

00:34:57.139 --> 00:34:58.347
would want to read that book.

00:34:58.347 --> 00:35:06.650
And the magic bird looks like
a rat with polio, or something.

00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:08.290
A goiter condition of some sort.

00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:10.430
It's terrible.

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:11.560
Get out of there.

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:14.400
But I kept drawing and I kept
being interested in magic.

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.530
But I also kept being
interested in the way

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:20.090
the stories about magic
served so adequately,

00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:25.130
and even more than adequately,
as situations in which we could

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:28.790
talk about everything
that's important to us.

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:30.490
Whether it be
ethical conundrums,

00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:33.570
as I tried to talk about in
"Wicked," or in the new book,

00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:36.380
"Egg and Spoon,"
about issues really,

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:38.650
even though it's
set in 1907 Russia,

00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:41.740
issues about global warming,
about food shortages,

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:43.990
and about ways of sharing.

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:46.220
This is a picture of
Baba Yaga the witch.

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:48.980
I did this picture
about 30 years ago,

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.230
I think, with the
hope that it would

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:55.740
be the cover for my book
called "The Dream Stealer."

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:57.700
I think that would have
made a better cover,

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:02.290
but indeed, this is
the cover they chose.

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:04.180
This was published 31 years ago.

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:06.820
And this year my new
book, "Egg and Spoon,"

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:10.610
is about, in some ways, the same
character, Baba Yaga the witch,

00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:14.340
who stands in two
houses on chicken legs.

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:16.451
I'm going to read a little
bit from this book now.

00:36:16.451 --> 00:36:18.575
And I'm going look at my
watch to see where we are.

00:36:18.575 --> 00:36:21.370
I'll just a little bit, and
then I'll flash to the end

00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:24.570
and we'll have five or
eight minutes for questions.

00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:26.410
Does that sound good?

00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:31.270
The girl, Cat, is about 12
and she's a wealthy girl.

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:32.960
She has accidentally
changed places

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.880
with a serf girl, a peasant.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:37.030
So the peasant girl is
on the train on the way

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:39.970
to a party for the tsar
where Cat is supposed to be.

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:42.160
And Cat wandering
through the woods

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:45.420
has come upon the
witch Baba Yaga.

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:48.250
Which I drew there,
only she's more

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:51.171
like Phyllis Diller the
way I write about her here.

00:36:51.171 --> 00:36:53.910
"The disappearance of stock
items from the witch's larder

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:55.060
was becoming habitual.

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:58.230
'Are you running some sort of
a cooking consortium behind

00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:01.880
my back when I'm asleep,'
the witch demanded of Cat.

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.000
Cat, 'I don't cook.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.970
That's a job for Cook.'
'Cook and Butler.

00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:09.390
Butler and Cook.

00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:12.300
I suppose you had someone
to soap you in the tub too,

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:16.050
lest your hands come in contact
with your own personal grease.'

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:19.420
'Don't be discusting.'
'Don't dare me.

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:23.330
I majored in disgusting at
Gulag Community College.

00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:26.640
Lucrezia Borgia taught
cooking, and Madame Defarge

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.050
taught knitting.

00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:29.890
Emperor Nero taught
violin and also led

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:31.490
the cheerleading squad.

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:33.630
I skipped all my
classes and failed with

00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:37.820
distinction.' 'I never know
what you're talking about.

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:39.640
I hear the words,
but you quote only

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.820
nonsense.' 'She's
mad,' said the kitten.

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:46.040
'Haven't you noticed?' 'I'm
not mad,' said the witch,

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:47.240
rooting through a cabinet.

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:50.260
'I'm a scad get loose in
the head, true, but redeemed

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:52.650
by the genius of my
personal glamour.

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:56.060
If you must know, I'm
hungry, that's what I am.'

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:58.950
She tossed out dusty hardtack,
sacks of dried herbs,

00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:00.270
and an empty mousetrap.

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:06.500
'Not much of a hunter-gatherer,
am I?' 'Improvise,' said

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:09.300
the kitten. 'Do I have to
suggest everything?' 'Are you

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:10.390
volunteering?

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:13.470
Kitty kabobs on a charcoal
grill?' The witch opened

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:16.700
a hinged panel in the wall and
pulled out a stone fire pit,

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:19.630
above which hung a
battered copper basin.

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:23.340
'I never saw that before,' said
the girl while the kitten leapt

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:24.170
to the rafters.

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:25.840
'This house.

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:28.670
Dumb Doma is always
into self-improvement.

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:33.220
Every time I turn around another
airing cupboard, a root cellar.

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:36.470
Once I opened the door and
there was a closet of the sort

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:39.350
that the Americans
call an elevator.

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:41.750
If I'm not mistaken,
it was invented

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:44.630
by a man named Otis Elevator.

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:46.300
Have you ever seen one?

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:49.980
The English call it a lift
and the French l'ascenseur.

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:52.210
I think the Dutch
don't believe in it.

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:55.210
The Dutch are a
low-lying people.

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:57.340
The whole chamber
rises to another floor.

00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:59.530
I took it up and found
a penthouse done over

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:02.750
in pickled birch wood, with a
tiger skin thrown over the baby

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:03.790
grand.

00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:07.550
Not to my taste, and maybe Dumb
Doma caught on, as I've never

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:11.060
seen it again.' She threw a
pinch of cayenne pepper onto

00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:14.280
the stones, and a roaring
fire resulted at once.

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:16.040
The house filled with smoke.

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:18.270
Dumb Doma opened its
own window and flapped

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:19.900
to clear out the stench.

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:22.240
'I just remembered,'
said the witch,

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:25.820
and drew a salted cod fish from
a purse beneath her clothes.

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:29.510
'I was using this as
kind of personal sachet,

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:31.460
but the time has come
to sacrifice my vanity

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:35.030
for the sake of dinner.' She
threw the fish in the pot,

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:39.520
and it began to flop around
as if it had just been hooked.

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.590
In a minute it was charbroiled.

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:43.920
The meal seemed
mouthwatering to the girl.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.710
I must truly be
hungry, she thought.

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:50.130
The witch flipped the fish
on a plate, picked up a fork,

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:53.586
stabbed it, and swallowed
the entire thing whole.

00:39:53.586 --> 00:39:54.280
'Hey!

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.075
What about sharing?'
said the kitten.

00:39:56.075 --> 00:39:57.740
'I forgot.

00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:59.450
I didn't think you'd want any.

00:39:59.450 --> 00:40:01.202
I can bring it back up.'

00:40:01.202 --> 00:40:02.650
'No, thank you.

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:06.390
Is there truly nothing else?'
'Well, I sent you out to scare

00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:08.850
up a delivery of fresh meat,'
said the witch to the kitten.

00:40:08.850 --> 00:40:11.260
'Instead you brought
in a debutante

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:13.790
armed with an ugly party
gift for the hostess.

00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:18.030
Vexing, but there we are.'
'Aren't there some onions

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:19.770
in a basket somewhere?
asked the kitten.

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:23.790
'Of course not,' said Baba
Yaga. 'No, we have no bread,

00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:27.190
we have no meat, we
have no cheese, no milk.

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:30.400
None of my famous Granny
Yaga's Frozen Tater Tots,

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.760
made from real tots.

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:35.270
As the great sage put
it, 'When she got there,

00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:37.940
the cupboard bare.'
And so what was there,

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:41.230
they all had to share: Noting.'"

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:44.310
And that, in a sense, is what
"Egg and Spoon" is about.

00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:46.865
It looks like a fairy
tale, it's illustrated

00:40:46.865 --> 00:40:49.580
--it's not illustrated,
it's designed--

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:51.920
to appeal to those
who like books

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.520
with a little fantasy in it.

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:56.950
But just as "Wicked"
is, at its heart,

00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:59.967
not a book about
the Wizard of Oz,

00:40:59.967 --> 00:41:01.425
but a book about
how we contemplate

00:41:01.425 --> 00:41:05.450
and how we talk about evil
and those we deem evil.

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:10.300
So, too, "Egg and Spoon" is
only superficially a fairytale.

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:14.500
It's really a story about equity
and about moral distribution

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:15.480
of goods.

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:16.780
Who has the egg?

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:18.300
Who has the spoon?

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:22.490
This is a book without a
lesson, without a moral.

00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:24.270
It's a book with a
lot of questions.

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:28.030
And that is why I
wrote when I was a kid,

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:31.310
and why I write now--
to ask questions.

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:34.060
Later on, the Wicked Witch
of the West came back to me

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:37.010
when I was living in London
and was the inspiration--

00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:39.560
nt the inspiration,
excuse me-- she

00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:43.840
was the garb in which I dressed
my questions about evil that

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:47.920
came up to me during
the first Gulf War.

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:50.920
At the same time that a
small boy who wandered away

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:54.840
from his mother was taken
up by two school boys who

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:57.610
were playing hooky, and by
the end of the day murdered

00:41:57.610 --> 00:41:58.890
by them.

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:04.220
Questions about where evil
comes from, and who defines it,

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:08.130
and what we do about it
if we recognize it in us.

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:12.520
Or the conversion for
me, from a wannabe writer

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:16.120
to a professional writer halfway
through my career 32 year

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:19.850
career-- roughly 35 years--
it was about 17 years in I

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:22.440
wrote "Wicked."

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:24.020
Even before the
play got to it, it

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:29.500
had sold almost a million copies
and it made me the professional

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:32.450
that I'd been working on being
since I was in sixth grade.

00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:35.400
So that brings us to just a
few minutes for questions.

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:37.940
I want to say first, thank
you for letting me come

00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:39.280
and talk to you.

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:43.620
And leave you with
the question, I guess,

00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:46.060
which is, when you
turn off your light,

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:49.850
and you have three minutes
before you fall asleep

00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:51.970
and your mind
hasn't yet settled,

00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:57.080
what do you find that comes back
to you from the first 10 years?

00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:59.100
That's something you're
still working on.

00:42:59.100 --> 00:42:59.600
I

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:02.690
Was working for the first
10 years, and in a sense

00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:05.190
I've been working
ever since, on why

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:07.170
did my mother die
when I was born?

00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:08.650
What did that do to me?

00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:10.610
In what way was I culpable?

00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:17.370
And in what way can I
make good on that accident

00:43:17.370 --> 00:43:21.350
that characterized my beginning
and propelled me, I think,

00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:24.320
into needing to write
in order to stay sane

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:28.820
and not to be pressured
and crushed down

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:31.160
by a sense of
obligation to guilt.

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.040
So if there are any
questions about anything

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:36.940
that I've talked about, about
books, about Broadway theater,

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:41.676
about fantasy, I'm very
happy to entertain any.

00:43:41.676 --> 00:43:43.530
AUDIENCE: What happened
to John Gaffney?

00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:46.670
John Gaffney eventually died
of AIDS, I'm sorry to say.

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:52.250
But before he did, he left the
field of writing and drawing

00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:54.150
and became a concert pianist.

00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:58.630
So he was a very talented kid.

00:43:58.630 --> 00:44:00.310
And he had some bad luck.

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:00.810
I'm sorry.

00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:02.654
He died about 20 years ago.

00:44:02.654 --> 00:44:04.320
We were best friends
up until his death.

00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:07.654
Yes, please.

00:44:07.654 --> 00:44:08.820
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:10.780
And I just had a
quick question, and it

00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:12.821
should be for some members
of the crowd, as well.

00:44:12.821 --> 00:44:16.090
But both as your
upbringing and as a parent,

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:18.610
as well, right now
we're in an age

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:21.890
where kids have access--
essentially immediate access--

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:25.530
to other people's imaginations,
to hundreds of thousands

00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:27.530
of viewers at the
tip of their fingers,

00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:31.139
whether it's on YouTube or
TV with a thousand channels.

00:44:31.139 --> 00:44:32.680
I'm just wondering,
what your thought

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:36.110
of how that's going to
play into the imagination

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:36.972
and development.

00:44:36.972 --> 00:44:38.930
I'm a new father of an
18 month old, and trying

00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:42.090
to battle with she has
access to this stuff,

00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:44.090
again, at our
fingertip versus having

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:46.030
to build our
imaginations on our own.

00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:48.590
So just wondering what
your opinion is on that.

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:50.298
GREGORY MAGUIRE: That's
a great question,

00:44:50.298 --> 00:44:53.800
and it's a question that my
husband and I toss around

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:57.030
virtually every night at dinner,
and have done so for 15 years.

00:44:57.030 --> 00:45:02.800
And we have not come up with a
particularly heartening answer.

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.070
We find that--

00:45:04.070 --> 00:45:05.720
Now, all our kids are adopted.

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:07.680
They're all from poor countries.

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:09.720
They're from Cambodia,
and from Guatemala.

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:14.090
Who knows what kind of in vitro
nutrition they got in infancy.

00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:17.180
Who knows what their gene
pools have conferred upon them.

00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:19.120
Certainly not the
advantages that even

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:22.570
my impoverished
family could confer

00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:26.490
upon me or my husband's family
who was less impoverished.

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:29.340
Nonetheless, they
show almost no signs

00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:32.470
of any imaginative
struggle that we can see.

00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:33.450
None.

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:35.700
Even when they were
little, maybe they

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:39.160
would run cars along
the edge of the carpet

00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:41.300
and play brum brum noises.

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:42.590
That was about it.

00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:44.970
They didn't play,
let's play office.

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:49.140
Here's a stapler, here's some
scotch tape, let's play house.

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:50.682
Let's play Mass.

00:45:50.682 --> 00:45:51.640
I get to be the priest.

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:53.800
Everyone else has to be quiet.

00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:57.430
They did, and have
done, none of that.

00:45:57.430 --> 00:46:00.217
They are not verbally
supple, despite the fact

00:46:00.217 --> 00:46:01.800
that both their
parents are loquacious

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:03.360
and like talking to them.

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.720
And all our friends like
talking, and singing.

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:10.530
And being voluble,
and garrulous.

00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:14.120
And I can't be
encouraging about it.

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:16.800
But I also can't know whether
ours is a particular test

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:21.640
case, where these children
are daunted by two parents who

00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:24.140
won't shut up, and who
have good educations,

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:29.340
and are older parents,
and have a thriving desire

00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:31.660
to want to share with them.

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:33.840
So if anybody else
has anything more

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:35.700
positive to say
about that, I'd love

00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:39.660
to hear about it because I'm
still asking the same question.

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:41.360
I will say the final
thing, and I really

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:42.720
do mean that, I'd love
to hear if anybody

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:44.030
has anything to say about that.

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:47.910
I will say that with
every passing year

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:50.840
I try to restrict
the privileges,

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:53.120
just as my parents were
strict with us about TV,

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.640
I try to pull back
the privileges

00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:58.390
that we've conferred when I see
that they're being dangerous.

00:46:58.390 --> 00:47:00.590
And I do see that
they're being dangerous.

00:47:00.590 --> 00:47:04.527
So I have a 17-year-old, a
15-year-old, and a 14-year-old,

00:47:04.527 --> 00:47:06.360
and they all turn their
computers and phones

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:09.320
and iPads in at 9
o'clock, unless the oldest

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:10.960
one is using it for homework.

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:14.340
And they're locked
in a safe with a key

00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:15.340
to try to protect them.

00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:18.910
Because I've seen all three
of then making mistakes.

00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:21.620
Does anybody have anything
any encouragement about that?

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:23.132
It could be about
your own kids, It

00:47:23.132 --> 00:47:25.006
could be about some kid
you saw on the street

00:47:25.006 --> 00:47:29.117
once who was drawing something
with a piece of chalk.

00:47:29.117 --> 00:47:31.200
AUDIENCE: The sense that
my wife and I have gotten

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:34.450
and we've heard from others
is that children need

00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:40.390
to be bored in order to, one
learn how to deal with boredom,

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:45.990
and two to work from
within themselves,

00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:49.090
rather than from
what they can look

00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:51.490
at that someone
else has produced.

00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:54.700
My brother, my big
brother, when he was little

00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:55.710
invented a country.

00:47:58.890 --> 00:48:02.800
I have run role playing
games throughout my life,

00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:07.640
including one that ran 29 years.

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:14.180
And the entire complex world
with many overlapping plots,

00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:15.090
and so on.

00:48:15.090 --> 00:48:18.800
And you don't get that
from watching movies.

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:23.220
Reading books helps, I
think, more than movies

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:26.340
because it's more built
within your own mind.

00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:27.970
And you come to the
end of the story

00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:30.410
and you think, where
else could that go?

00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:33.300
What would I have liked
to have done differently?

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:36.140
But I didn't read much, really.

00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:39.570
My entertainment came much
more from within myself.

00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:41.640
But I see plenty
of other examples

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:43.050
of people who read a lot.

00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:49.610
So I think literature,
especially without pictures,

00:48:49.610 --> 00:48:51.340
helps a lot here.

00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:54.070
Fantasy, romance in
what I understand

00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:56.860
as it's true meaning,
things that could be,

00:48:56.860 --> 00:49:00.362
rather than hugging and
kissing specifically.

00:49:00.362 --> 00:49:01.570
GREGORY MAGUIRE: That's good.

00:49:01.570 --> 00:49:06.180
AUDIENCE: It leads you into
those directions at that time

00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:08.880
of what you might
want to happen,

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:11.721
or what could happen in
an alternate reality.

00:49:11.721 --> 00:49:12.970
GREGORY MAGUIRE: That's great.

00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:14.680
Well, thank you for
that and I, too,

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:17.470
endorse that if you
can divorce the image--

00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:19.120
the image is so sexy.

00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:20.756
Any image is so
sexy-- if you can

00:49:20.756 --> 00:49:23.610
divorce the image from the
word and let the child come up

00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:26.030
with image first.

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:30.429
Or to share by providing
an image from the brain.

00:49:30.429 --> 00:49:30.970
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:32.640
I also am a mom.

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:36.470
I have a 10-year-old who,
it's so funny some of the ways

00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:40.240
that you describe your
coming into loving to write,

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:43.550
and illustrating, he
has a similar approach.

00:49:43.550 --> 00:49:47.970
And illustrating his own
stories and creating characters.

00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:51.300
And it's interesting
this technology

00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:55.780
question is so ever-present.

00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:58.110
We wrestle with
whether it's better

00:49:58.110 --> 00:50:02.160
to sit and watch a TV show, than
play a video game where you're

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:05.070
planning and thinking and
creating like in Minecraft,

00:50:05.070 --> 00:50:06.050
for example.

00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:10.700
Or if you were using an
application on an iPhone

00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:15.280
to create your own LEGO movie,
is that somehow better or worse

00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:19.380
because you have a
screen, than being outside

00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:24.160
and throwing all the
toys all over the yard.

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:25.590
Because they're
using them in ways

00:50:25.590 --> 00:50:29.200
they were not
intended to be used.

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:33.490
I guess I just want to push back
a little bit on some of this,

00:50:33.490 --> 00:50:36.280
because I don't think it's
as simple as we make it.

00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:40.180
And we have to, I
guess-- when you

00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:45.680
were talking about your kids
and the ways that they play,

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:48.410
they play in ways
that surprise you.

00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:52.180
I find that my kids play in
ways that surprise me and make

00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:53.760
me mad because I
want them to play

00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:55.800
the way I think
they should play.

00:50:55.800 --> 00:51:00.820
And I guess my question
to everybody would be,

00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:03.050
are we putting
expectations on them

00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:07.570
that are not helpful
in having them

00:51:07.570 --> 00:51:09.935
deal with the world
they have to deal with?

00:51:09.935 --> 00:51:10.810
GREGORY MAGUIRE: Yes.

00:51:10.810 --> 00:51:14.990
That's a great question and when
a therapist pointed that out

00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:18.180
to me, that I had been
raised in the 1960s--

00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:21.340
as if I were a sickly
Edwardian child--

00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:23.910
and that if I was trying to
raise my children the same way,

00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:26.110
I was about 100
years out of date.

00:51:26.110 --> 00:51:27.300
And it wasn't fair to them.

00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:30.280
It wasn't incorrect, it
wasn't morally correct.

00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:32.090
And I accepted that
and that's when

00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:37.054
I started to loosen up
the rules a little bit.

00:51:37.054 --> 00:51:38.720
But then I had to
tighten them up again.

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:39.970
I think two things about that.

00:51:39.970 --> 00:51:42.700
I think one is it's quite
possible our kids are playing

00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:45.700
in ways that we can't interpret
because they're so far

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:48.360
ahead of us, and their brains
are different than our brains,

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:49.880
and the world is
different than our brains.

00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:51.890
But the other thing I
think about the Minecraft

00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:55.200
versus the toys flown
all over the yard

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:58.030
is that there's
something about playing,

00:51:58.030 --> 00:52:00.930
which is by its
nature transgressive.

00:52:00.930 --> 00:52:03.030
You have to break the
rules in order to play.

00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:05.760
That's what you're doing
in order to play, I think,

00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:07.050
is breaking the rules.

00:52:07.050 --> 00:52:09.930
And so when I see my
own 14-year-old spend

00:52:09.930 --> 00:52:13.970
14 hours on a Saturday
downstairs doing Minecraft,

00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:16.970
I think, where is the
potential transgression there?

00:52:16.970 --> 00:52:19.590
It's not as if you're
building Spanish bordellos.

00:52:19.590 --> 00:52:21.610
You can't build a
bordello in Minecraft.

00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:23.180
It doesn't let you do that.

00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:25.840
Run a prostitution ring,
something, I don't care.

00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:30.280
Just do something that breaks
the rules of Minecraft.

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:33.070
I'm trying to find the
pictures of-- yeah,

00:52:33.070 --> 00:52:37.200
this is the Christmas
about five, six years ago.

00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:40.740
But there they are living
fully in their lives,

00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:42.320
but I don't know who they are.

00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:44.820
And I want them to be
healthy, I want them be safe,

00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:47.720
and I want them to
be transgressive.

00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:51.360
And here's the last paragraph
and here's where I'll close.

00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:53.430
This is from the book,
"Confessions of an Ugly

00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:56.890
Stepsister," which is not
a fantasy, despite the fact

00:52:56.890 --> 00:52:58.570
that it's based on Cinderella.

00:52:58.570 --> 00:53:00.180
It's really a
historical novel set

00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:05.120
in Haarlem, the
Netherlands in 1628.

00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:09.050
Here's one paragraph
about why I do what I do,

00:53:09.050 --> 00:53:12.300
and perhaps why we read, too.

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:14.300
The narrator's an old woman.

00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:17.450
"Crows and scavengers
at the top of the story,

00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:20.700
finches at the top
of the linden tree.

00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:25.300
God and Satan snarling
at each other like dogs.

00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:31.620
Imps and fairy godmothers trying
to undo each other's work.

00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:37.360
You might be born as
donkey-jawed Dame Handelaers

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:43.910
or as dazzling as Clara van den
Meer, Young Woman with Tulips.

00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:47.720
How we try to pin the world
between opposite extremes.

00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:50.120
And in such a world,
as Margaret used

00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:54.890
to ask, what is
the use of beauty?

00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:57.530
I have lived my life
surrounded by painters

00:53:57.530 --> 00:54:01.490
and I still do not
know the answer.

00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:05.640
But I suspect, some
days, that beauty

00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:09.070
helps protect the
spirit of mankind,

00:54:09.070 --> 00:54:14.110
swaddle it, and succor it,
so that we might survive.

00:54:14.110 --> 00:54:18.720
Beauty is no end in
itself, but if it

00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:21.530
makes our lives less
miserable so that we

00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:26.930
might be more kind-- well,
then let's have beauty painted

00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:29.380
on our porcelain,
hanging on our walls,

00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:31.470
ringing through our stories.

00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:34.780
We are a sorry tribe of beasts.

00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:38.090
We need all the
help we can get."

00:54:38.090 --> 00:54:39.890
Thank you.
