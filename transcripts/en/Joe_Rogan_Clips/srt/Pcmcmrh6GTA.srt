1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,140
Um, I'm, I'm such a sucker for a
specialist, whether it's a style vendor,

2
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:07,530
specialists who are striking
specialist or Damien Maia specialist.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,190
I love watching the guys that
are like at the tip of the,

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,970
the ability in whatever their
disciplines, instyle, bender, man,

5
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:17,580
he seems to be getting better
every time. Yeah. Yeah.

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,490
Well for him it was just
about avoiding take downs.

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,290
Like he was so high level as a
kickboxer. He's so clever. Like he's,

8
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:30,090
he's like, in my opinion,
probably the very best in the
sport. It's setting traps.

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,260
He like gauge you see what you're
doing and it'll switch dances and some

10
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:36,870
information. Yeah. It's
not, it's not random.

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,840
And I liked the way he dealt
with the take downs. I mean,

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,810
he knows where he safe and where he's not,
you don't see that he's panicking.

13
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:45,670
He's like, yeah, it's got a minute and
let this cook a minute. But I seen him,

14
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,490
I seen with this attempt,
looks like,

15
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:50,940
I see what this one looks like
walking it through. All right,

16
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:53,970
now my party's going to start.
Yeah. Here's a guy I talked to,

17
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,990
one of his guys he trains with,
um,

18
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,040
I was referenced some
fights in China and uh,

19
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:02,460
it's one of the guys who trained with New
Zealand and this guy was telling me so

20
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:06,690
much and show me different things about
angles they do and things that they set

21
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:09,240
up in their striking that I had
never knew or thought about.

22
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:13,040
And this was before I saw him
start fighting in UFC. I, you know,

23
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,310
just everybody was aware of him but he
hadn't been in the UFC. Yeah. And Man,

24
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:20,160
these guys, these guys
are really smart. These,

25
00:01:20,161 --> 00:01:24,330
the techniques like this sport is
growing so much, you know? Yeah, yeah.

26
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:25,140
That's what I was saying.

27
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,760
Like when you're seeing like really high
level super technical strikers like him,

28
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,170
like who's a worldclass lobbying as good,

29
00:01:34,171 --> 00:01:38,460
he easily could be world champion in many
organizations as kickboxer to see him

30
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,360
now in the UFC and see guys having
to deal with that. It's like, okay,

31
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:44,370
this is like the Anderson fights a great,
great example.

32
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:47,670
We know how great Anderson is. Yeah.
And it's still look pretty good. Again,

33
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:52,080
style bender. But you could see why style
bender was special in that flight. He,

34
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:55,020
I'd like another level
of trickery. Yeah. Yeah.

35
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,380
And I mean and stuff John Jones
is doing. Yeah. Yeah. Well,

36
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,460
so you can't call him a specialist cause
man, he does so many different styles.

37
00:02:02,461 --> 00:02:04,950
Right. It's like a, it's really
like a Kung Fu movie, right.

38
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:09,600
Where he changed styles. Yeah.
Yeah. And then they do they
do something. Yeah. Yeah.

39
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,320
Well John, such a good
kicker too. I mean that's,

40
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,430
that's interesting that he started
out as a wrestler. Cause like how,

41
00:02:16,431 --> 00:02:20,000
how much of his style now is kicking you.
It's a giant part of his game,

42
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:23,420
his utilization,
those long ass legs and knees.

43
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,490
It's interesting like how,
how much time he did.

44
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,590
It looks like he's getting
information a lot. Right.

45
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,830
And then all of a sudden they have them.
Then when he shifts gears it's like,

46
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:36,120
okay, I've gotten a lot of information.
Here's what to do with it. Yeah. Yeah.

47
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,620
He's gonna Fight Tiago
Santos, right? Yeah. Yeah.

48
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:46,200
That guy goes for broke.
I mean he goes for broke.

49
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,290
It's interesting to watch him fight
because you want to talk about like a,

50
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:55,470
a wild reckless dude.
Like Santos is dangerous.

51
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:59,710
Uh, Jon Jones should and probably
will be a heavy favorite,

52
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,250
but Santos, he does w he
throws some, Hey, make no, no,

53
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,470
it's gonna be, it's going to be a,
it's a great fight to watch. Yeah.

54
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:11,890
That guy's going to go out on his
shield. No, he and he puts pressure.

55
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,990
I think the interesting thing about,
uh,

56
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,710
well for me with interesting when I
watched any of the heavier guys fight is

57
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,010
that they really have to understand where
they're safe and whether or not that's

58
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:22,240
something that John does really good.

59
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,050
How to be in the pocket and the
places where he's safe and you know,

60
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,270
knowing where he's, yeah, he's the
best Everett utilizing his reach.

61
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:32,470
Like no one's ever been
better at controlling reach
and then never letting a guy

62
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:36,710
reset. When guys try to reset Bam, he
kicks him, Bam. He kicks him again. Bam.

63
00:03:36,711 --> 00:03:40,000
He kicks him again. He's like, he knows
when you're trying to get comfortable,

64
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:42,540
when you're trying to settle in,
and that's when he kicks you like ass.

65
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,390
Like he senses it. I just started to
battering you like you sees like, no, no,

66
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:51,100
no breaks, no brokers, no breaks, no
breaks, no breaks. Like the Anthony Smith.

67
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,040
What about a man? Um, Max Holloway.
Oh Dude, he's the king of no bricks.

68
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,900
Max Holloway is no break.
Oh, pours it on you.

69
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,640
He's just keeps coming.
Yeah.
