1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.970
This is more perfect. I'm Jad Abumrad today, a story from our producer,

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.170
Julia Longoria,

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.230
so I've been working on an episode about sex discrimination for like months now.

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.610
Yeah, and we're supposed to release it.

5
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.770
<v 1>Sexual harassment scandals have been golf, Harvey Weinstein,</v>

6
00:00:17.771 --> 00:00:22.771
Senator Al Frank and Louis C k this week after Kevin Spacey date,

7
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.220
we more today, the story we're going to tell is not about sexual harassment,

8
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.030
but I can't think street with all this stuff that's happening.

9
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.990
Look at what's happening with people. Look at a tipping point and all that.

10
00:00:33.991 --> 00:00:34.880
A watershed mold,

11
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.610
thousands posted the claims online using the simple phrase meat too.

12
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.780
This has been happening since the beginning of time,

13
00:00:40.781 --> 00:00:43.840
but now people are finally talking about it and I can't help but think that

14
00:00:43.841 --> 00:00:48.841
we've seen this before where it's outcry for public change and positive ones.

15
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.440
We have a backlash. They claim there's a war on women out there.

16
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.370
No one takes them seriously. If you can't handle some of the basic stuff,

17
00:00:57.371 --> 00:00:59.620
that's become a problem in the workforce today, right?

18
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.060
Like you don't belong in the workforce.

19
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.560
Like we're in our respective corners and men to help us letting out a big

20
00:01:05.561 --> 00:01:08.030
screen. How do people not know? Right?

21
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.650
You get with your ass when things quiet down, call the experts on the line.

22
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.063
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

23
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.900
<v 0>will there be a change?</v>

24
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.673
<v 2>Hello?</v>

25
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.170
<v 0>And what kind of change is the kind that will stick?</v>

26
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.650
Today's story is about a time and the not so distant past when there was a

27
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.240
similarly loud rock is division in our country over sexual equality.

28
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.300
And one woman quietly,

29
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.950
strategically laid the foundation for real change.

30
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:44.790
<v 3>The honorable,</v>

31
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.810
the chief justice and the associate justices of the Supreme Court of the United

32
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.300
States. Oh, Yay. Yay.

33
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.810
<v 4>Having business before the honorable,</v>

34
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.680
the Supreme Court of the United States for money to go on air and get married.

35
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.233
[inaudible] card.

36
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.613
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

37
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.210
<v 0>here we are. I'm going to ask you to utterly false question, which is,</v>

38
00:02:40.211 --> 00:02:41.044
where would you like to start?

39
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.110
I if we haven't been doing this for so damn long. Okay,

40
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.680
so let me outline the basic dilemma that's at the heart of the story here.

41
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.050
All right, I'm going to put it to you as a question. Bring it.

42
00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.010
If you were to do a control in the constitution,

43
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:02.290
like how many times do you think the word sex comes up?

44
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.850
<v 4>Oh, that's interesting.</v>

45
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.020
<v 0>Six. No guessing. Cause the answer is one.</v>

46
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:16.870
One time in the 19th amendment,

47
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.640
which grants people the right to vote based on sex. Really? Yes.

48
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.050
That's the only time. That's the only time. Which is crazy because we are none.

49
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.620
Is there a sex word that's not sex? Like gender or something? Something.

50
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.210
Nothing. Is there like ladies in the costume. Women No.

51
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.240
To really. Okay. Constitutionally women have a problem,

52
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.680
which is that basically we're not in the constitution except like in this one

53
00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:45.340
little spot. So when it comes to discriminating against women,

54
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.260
some people have argued that you,

55
00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.710
there's nothing in the constitution that says you can't do it.

56
00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.820
Certainly the constitution does not require sexual discrimination and

57
00:03:55.821 --> 00:04:00.290
discrimination on the basis of sex constitution doesn't require it.

58
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.220
It simply doesn't forbid it. That's the lead Justice Antonin Scalia.

59
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.070
It doesn't mean nobody ever voted for that.

60
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.660
So where do you get it from? There was nothing that said that. I mean,

61
00:04:11.661 --> 00:04:13.250
not not those words explicitly,

62
00:04:13.251 --> 00:04:15.820
but there was nothing that says you can't discriminate. Uh,

63
00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.090
not on the basis of sex. That's legal editor, Christian various.

64
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.770
We had a 14th amendment that told people that we are equal under the law,

65
00:04:24.771 --> 00:04:28.040
that everyone has an equal protection of the laws, but doesn't that say, man,

66
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.640
they never applied the 14th amendment two women,

67
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.030
they didn't apply the 15th that's Martha Griffiths. Congresswoman.

68
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.010
When you think about the history of the 14th amendment as legal editor,

69
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.610
Linda Hirshman says the 14th amendment was passed in the aftermath of the civil

70
00:04:43.611 --> 00:04:48.500
war along with the 13th and the 15th 13th Amendment Abolishing Slavery and 15th

71
00:04:48.501 --> 00:04:52.250
Amendment essentially giving black people really black men the right to vote.

72
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.310
If you understand the 14th amendment to be a part of that trio of amendments,

73
00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:58.670
you're like, oh, okay.

74
00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.790
It was meant to bring equality to black people when the 15th amendment had been

75
00:05:04.191 --> 00:05:08.260
written, which had every citizen could vote in the name of heavens.

76
00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:10.570
Why couldn't women vote? Why didn't you,

77
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.080
why did you have to have the 19th amendment? Oh, of course.

78
00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:18.190
The answer was they didn't consider women people, but I was all gone,

79
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.900
but I was old. There was this basic assumption in the law that, you know,

80
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.750
equality for black people is one thing, but men and women,

81
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.153
they're different.

82
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.780
It was the case that the supreme court had never once met a distinction between

83
00:05:38.141 --> 00:05:41.170
men and women. It didn't like Wendy Williams law,

84
00:05:41.171 --> 00:05:42.790
professor emeritus at Georgetown.

85
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.680
What are some greatest hits of the just ridiculous distinction. Okay, here,

86
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.740
here there was a case called Bradwell and it was 1873 or four in that case,

87
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.280
a woman wanted to become a lawyer.

88
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.210
<v 6>Illinois bar said no, and the justices said that, um,</v>

89
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.270
that that was a perfectly good rule because the justice system could be seen as

90
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:13.120
not appropriate for women. Now, let's jump clear into the next century here.

91
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.250
1948 in his case it was called guesser versus Cleary that went to the Supreme

92
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.550
Court and the issue was whether women could be bartenders.

93
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.360
The court thought that that was pretty humorous,

94
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.930
that it made sense that women could not be bartenders and less their husbands or

95
00:06:32.301 --> 00:06:35.330
fathers were in charge. Of the bar.

96
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.350
Both those laws,

97
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:44.300
you know women are not supposed to be at the bar at either bar. Right.

98
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:49.390
Those two cases represent attitudes almost 80 years apart that women belonged in

99
00:06:51.081 --> 00:06:54.620
the private sphere. That was not only their place,

100
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:59.650
it was built into their bodies and that was the assumption for a long,

101
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.420
long time,

102
00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:07.470
but just about 67

103
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.500
<v 7>there are a lot of women in this country who feel like they're being pushed</v>

104
00:07:14.501 --> 00:07:15.334
around.

105
00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:19.490
<v 1>Thanks. D things had started to come to a boil</v>

106
00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.790
<v 7>and they become very vocal. They call themselves the Women's Liberation Movement</v>

107
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.610
<v 8>section. Race because they are easy.</v>

108
00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:29.630
Visible differences have been the primary ways of organizing human beings into

109
00:07:29.631 --> 00:07:31.790
superior and inferior groups,

110
00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:35.430
<v 1>so in the late sixties and early seventies people like glorious dynamo.</v>

111
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:40.190
<v 8>We are talking about a society in which there will be no roles other than those</v>

112
00:07:40.191 --> 00:07:40.720
chosen

113
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.590
<v 7>free from the diseases of racism. Adrienne Boyd,</v>

114
00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:46.810
I've sexism, a process.

115
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:51.590
<v 1>They get some traction saying, okay, it's time to put us in the constitution.</v>

116
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.880
Hurry up. I'm a historian. Say It's a constitutional convention for women.

117
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.100
<v 8>The adoption of the following resolution</v>

118
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:03.010
<v 1>you see is this push for something called the equal rights amendment.</v>

119
00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:06.430
<v 8>The equal rights amendment should be rabbi</v>

120
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:16.723
<v 4>[inaudible].</v>

121
00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.380
<v 1>It will be ratified. This ratified early next year. I was quite sure.</v>

122
00:08:20.381 --> 00:08:25.320
I bet in 1975 that will be ratified, but it didn't get the votes.

123
00:08:25.321 --> 00:08:30.321
In 1975 I hope 1976 will be the year or in 1976 a special report on the 1977

124
00:08:35.311 --> 00:08:39.990
national women's conference or in 1977 and the movement is stalled.

125
00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:46.330
<v 6>Why? What? What stalled it? Well, a lot,</v>

126
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:48.840
but much of the credit goes to this

127
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.630
<v 9>one man in Phyllis Schlafly of Allen, Illinois,</v>

128
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:53.950
a woman

129
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.800
<v 1>named Phyllis Schlafly</v>

130
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.180
<v 4>two was sick. My husband Fred, for letting me come today.</v>

131
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.830
I love to say that because it irritates the women's livers more than anything

132
00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:05.660
that I said.

133
00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:10.660
<v 0>She was a lawyer and a self-described housewife who started a movement called</v>

134
00:09:11.001 --> 00:09:12.140
stop era.

135
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.320
<v 10>The whole thing is misrepresented as a woman's rights amendment. In fact,</v>

136
00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:18.270
the principle beneficiary will be men.

137
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:22.200
It will give men a great opportunity to get out from under their obligations.

138
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.790
<v 0>Her position was that the equal rights amendment would actually strip women of</v>

139
00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:30.360
this special privilege that they have that comes from being a woman?

140
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.921
<v 10>Probably not.</v>

141
00:09:30.921 --> 00:09:34.760
I think though the laws of our country have given a very wonderful status to the

142
00:09:34.761 --> 00:09:39.260
married woman and the wife has a great deal of many rights. For example,

143
00:09:39.261 --> 00:09:42.470
she has the legal right to be supported by her husband

144
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.450
<v 0>and she said if this amendment passes,</v>

145
00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.480
there will be certain unintended consequences.

146
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:54.170
<v 10>The equal rights amendment says you cannot discriminate on account of sex and if</v>

147
00:09:54.391 --> 00:09:59.391
you want to deny a marriage license to a man and a man or deny a homosexual the

148
00:10:00.181 --> 00:10:03.180
right to teach in the schools or to adopt children,

149
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:07.140
it is on account of sex that you would deny it and that would be

150
00:10:07.141 --> 00:10:09.690
unconstitutional under era.

151
00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:12.290
<v 0>And that argument caught on.</v>

152
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:16.440
<v 10>I would caution the members of this platform committee that they are things that</v>

153
00:10:16.441 --> 00:10:21.210
could happen from the passage of an era amendment that none of us would like to

154
00:10:21.211 --> 00:10:21.840
see happen.

155
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:26.000
<v 4>Um, I think that families would generation after generation deteriorate.</v>

156
00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:29.900
I think that there would be homosexual to expect preferential treatment.

157
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:32.030
If you said, brother, we're all in danger.

158
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:35.990
You got to hear what I have to say because you know what's going to happen if

159
00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:39.860
they pass the Er. There will be women in all of our bathrooms,

160
00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:43.340
women using all our stalls. They'll be wasting the paper towels.

161
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.180
They'll be hung out in the yard or in the halls.

162
00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:50.380
They'll be pushing the old soap scorners pushing the hot air dryers to the past.

163
00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.300
The Yardi Lord, I don't know what they're going to do.

164
00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:58.363
[inaudible]

165
00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:02.480
<v 0>had the equal rights amendment passed legal editor, Linda Hirshman. Again,</v>

166
00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:06.230
it would've looked a lot like the racial civil rights movement did,

167
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:09.380
but the equal rights amendment did not pass.

168
00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:14.560
It fell three states short to get a constitutional amendment passed.

169
00:11:15.771 --> 00:11:19.310
Turns out you need three quarters of state legislatures to say they want it.

170
00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:24.170
That is 38 out of 50 they only ever got 35

171
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.240
<v 11>do. So the question is,</v>

172
00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:31.950
if you want to get equal rights for women written into the law,

173
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:37.790
what do you do? There's no era. The women's lived movements sparked

174
00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.560
<v 12>backlash. Like what do you do?</v>

175
00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:44.253
Well,

176
00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:46.650
<v 0>enter stage left.</v>

177
00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:48.203
<v 10>Not, not</v>

178
00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:55.150
<v 4>RBG. [inaudible]</v>

179
00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:56.640
<v 0>Ruth Bader Ginsburg,</v>

180
00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:01.280
RBG can do 20 pushups and not the so-called girl kind. Yeah.

181
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:05.880
Before she was a supreme court justice feminist icon or a workout sensation.

182
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.630
All the, before all that, Ruth Ginsburg,

183
00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.790
she was at the ACL. Ooh,

184
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.200
this was in the 70s and one of the characteristics of Ruth Ginsburg,

185
00:12:16.201 --> 00:12:17.880
which exists to this day

186
00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.180
<v 4>very well, you can hear this.</v>

187
00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:26.610
It's the first time she argued in front of the Supreme Court in 1973 when you'd

188
00:12:26.611 --> 00:12:30.030
ask her a question, there would be silence

189
00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:32.670
enough silence

190
00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:42.690
to make a person nervous and start trying to help her answer the question.

191
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:47.430
You had to wait, but

192
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:52.720
<v 0>we can imagine that it was in one of those long pauses at Ruth Bader Ginsburg</v>

193
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:55.780
rescued some of the key principles behind the era,

194
00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.930
repackaged them and marched them in through a side

195
00:12:59.300 --> 00:12:59.920
<v 13>door.</v>

196
00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:04.920
Mr Chief Justice and may it please the court sex like race is a visible

197
00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:07.460
characteristic, daring known,

198
00:13:07.461 --> 00:13:12.461
necessary relationship to ability sex like race has been the,

199
00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.040
made the basis for unjustified

200
00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:28.723
<v 4>[inaudible].</v>

201
00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:33.530
<v 0>Wait, so backing up a second, what, what exactly did RBG do?</v>

202
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:38.480
So let me walk you through it now cause it's, it's beautiful. Um,

203
00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:43.610
the era fight is underway and RBG and her colleagues are watching this happen,

204
00:13:43.611 --> 00:13:47.060
right? And they're getting worried. What if the era doesn't pass?

205
00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:49.190
So what are we gonna do if that's the case,

206
00:13:49.191 --> 00:13:52.970
how are we going to get equal rights for women? So they decided, okay,

207
00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:56.480
as an alternate approach, let's go back to the 14th amendment,

208
00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:57.710
the 14th amendment,

209
00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:02.770
immediate objective wash to provide national protection for the newly freed

210
00:14:02.841 --> 00:14:04.910
slaves. You know, which as we said,

211
00:14:04.911 --> 00:14:07.550
was designed from the beginning to be only about race,

212
00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:11.120
but it sweeping provisions suggest broader objectives.

213
00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:16.310
The states were prevented from depriving any person equal protection of the

214
00:14:16.311 --> 00:14:19.070
laws. Well it says the word person.

215
00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.910
So that should include women. Yeah.

216
00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:25.520
If they could just get the courts to see it that way,

217
00:14:25.521 --> 00:14:29.690
then by default almost we would have a sort of era.

218
00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.310
And accordingly,

219
00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:36.610
the task was showing that the racially inflected 14th amendment applied to sex.

220
00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:42.320
The what about the law? Is she trying to change what,

221
00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.300
what does she want the court to say?

222
00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:49.400
She wants the court to say that sex would be treated just like race.

223
00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:50.511
And here's why.

224
00:14:50.511 --> 00:14:55.511
That's so when the court sees racial discrimination happening under the 14th

225
00:14:55.761 --> 00:14:59.390
amendment, it takes a really hard line. It looks at it really,

226
00:14:59.391 --> 00:15:02.120
really closely or at least it's supposed to.

227
00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:04.760
Whereas other kinds of discrimination,

228
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.840
not so much because actually some discrimination is necessary.

229
00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:11.120
The law discriminates. It has to,

230
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:15.470
it discriminates between 18 year olds and 17 year olds between criminals and non

231
00:15:15.471 --> 00:15:18.110
criminals. There would be chaos otherwise. Right.

232
00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:22.130
But the courts decided that race is going to be a big red flag.

233
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.600
They're going to ask the governments, legislatures,

234
00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:29.120
presidents to have a compelling reason and compelling state interest to do race

235
00:15:29.121 --> 00:15:33.890
discrimination. Otherwise it's going to be unconstitutional. You with me so far?

236
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:36.890
Yes. To discriminate based on race.

237
00:15:36.891 --> 00:15:40.040
You need to pass a really super hard test by the way.

238
00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:44.840
The legal name for this test. Oh, strict scrutiny. Oh,

239
00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:45.831
I know.

240
00:15:45.831 --> 00:15:49.100
They should have called it like what do you mean business or something like

241
00:15:49.101 --> 00:15:52.820
that. But anyway, the point was that like they took it seriously,

242
00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:54.021
which you know,

243
00:15:54.021 --> 00:15:58.940
back in the day they weren't doing with sex discrimination at all because when

244
00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:02.510
legislators would come up with these laws like this women can't be bartenders

245
00:16:02.511 --> 00:16:05.240
law, the Supreme Court would be like, you know,

246
00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.370
hey guys probably have a good reason for that.

247
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.520
It doesn't have to be [inaudible]. It can just be a reason.

248
00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.110
Doesn't have to be very good. This up to be good.

249
00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.680
They could even maybe even make it up on the fly.

250
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:18.710
It just has to be a reason for upholding this law.

251
00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:22.580
Like in the case of the bartenders, law bars are dangerous.

252
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:26.030
Women need more protection. And of course it would be like, okay, sure.

253
00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:31.690
So RBG needed a way to convince the court to be as intense about sex

254
00:16:31.821 --> 00:16:34.940
discrimination as they were about race discrimination.

255
00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:38.570
But how do you convince an audience of men,

256
00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:40.180
<v 1>aw,</v>

257
00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:44.320
<v 0>we're used to discriminating on the basis of sex who've been doing it for years?</v>

258
00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:48.170
How do you convince them that discrimination is a bad,

259
00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:53.390
<v 14>I think of people who want to keep women down with like nothing better than to</v>

260
00:16:53.391 --> 00:16:57.920
women go off in a corner and speak only to women. Nothing would happen.

261
00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:02.150
This is her giving a recent talk about her 1970 strategy.

262
00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:07.240
You need to persuade men that this is ripe with society.

263
00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:11.840
Part one of her strategy. Choose your words carefully.

264
00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:15.860
I had a secretary at Columbia who said,

265
00:17:15.861 --> 00:17:20.861
I'm typing these things for you and jumping out all over the pages.

266
00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:22.253
Take seconds.

267
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:23.563
<v 4>Okay.</v>

268
00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:29.490
<v 14>To know that the audience you are addressing that the first association of those</v>

269
00:17:30.511 --> 00:17:34.530
men with the word sex is not what you're talking.

270
00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:39.520
<v 4>Okay? So why note</v>

271
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:44.590
<v 14>you use the grammar book term use gender because you know what the word sex has</v>

272
00:17:44.961 --> 00:17:45.890
a charge to it.

273
00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:51.150
<v 0>Gender is cooler and part two of her strategy.</v>

274
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.610
Choose your cases carefully.

275
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:58.860
This is all happening in the 70s when RBG is the head of the ACLU women's rights

276
00:17:58.861 --> 00:17:59.694
project.

277
00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:04.790
So she's deciding which kinds of cases the HCLU is going to support as they make

278
00:18:04.891 --> 00:18:09.600
their way to an all male supreme court. And her strategy was,

279
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.360
if we live in a man's world right now,

280
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:17.840
we need to find cases that nine men at this moment can handle.

281
00:18:18.061 --> 00:18:22.500
So, for example, early on in her tenure at the women's rights project,

282
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:27.590
the other lefty lawyers are suggesting that the women's movement needs to take

283
00:18:28.231 --> 00:18:31.770
up the cause of lesbian rights. And she says,

284
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.480
not yet.

285
00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.930
<v 15>And I think go slow is</v>

286
00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:39.340
<v 0>the right approach. She said,</v>

287
00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:44.370
first we need to go after that small and insidious idea at the supreme court had

288
00:18:46.331 --> 00:18:47.680
been keeping alive for years.

289
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:51.570
<v 6>So the laws of our country have given a very wonderful status to the married</v>

290
00:18:51.571 --> 00:18:52.404
woman. And that, yeah,

291
00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:56.460
<v 0>Phyllis Schlafly idea that discrimination is actually good for women.</v>

292
00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:01.520
Gender classifications will always rationalized as favors to women.

293
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:08.360
And so RBG decided not just to bring cases where women were the victims of

294
00:19:08.581 --> 00:19:12.210
discrimination. Okay. Uh, my name is Curtis Craig.

295
00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.210
She brought cases where men were the victims.

296
00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.420
Who were you as an 18 year old?

297
00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:19.740
<v 6>No, that's a great question. Um,</v>

298
00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:24.150
that was like any 18 year old young man, um,

299
00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.190
invincible. You know, thought I was quite the ladies man.

300
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:29.080
<v 15>Hm.</v>

301
00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.100
<v 6>You name it. I mean,</v>

302
00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:34.680
he made it into Lambda Chi Alpha at Oklahoma state and he was

303
00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.153
<v 2>living</v>

304
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:40.770
<v 6>frat house. Our, uh, our fraternity was primarily made up of wrestlers.</v>

305
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:43.800
So it was, uh, when you went down the hall,

306
00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.790
you were about to be taken down at any moment.

307
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.940
You'd be thrown into the wall and you'd, you'd leave a body print.

308
00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:55.030
What do you mean, like an indentation? Literally in the wall or like, yeah,

309
00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:01.810
it was, it was amazing. There was a lot of partying going on. Yeah.

310
00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:07.230
<v 16>[inaudible] it'd</v>

311
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:10.770
<v 6>be the yard would be filled with beer cans. And here's the key.</v>

312
00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:14.670
If they wanted to get all that beer, we bang my glasses down.

313
00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:18.140
They had to enlist the help of the ladies. Yeah. I mean, uh,

314
00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:20.130
you know the sorority sisters, yes.

315
00:20:20.131 --> 00:20:24.630
You would have a female buy your beer and you'd go out and party.

316
00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.660
They need the women to buy beer. Yup. Why?

317
00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:30.510
Because in Oklahoma state at the time, oh,

318
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:32.940
Brahma had a very silly lot.

319
00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:36.390
Girls could buy beer at age 18,

320
00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.510
but the boys had to wait until 21.

321
00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.510
And there was something about the level of maturity, I guess,

322
00:20:42.511 --> 00:20:44.340
for women versus men at that time.

323
00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:49.030
The basic principle was that boys got into more car accidents,

324
00:20:49.031 --> 00:20:52.300
so they should be trusted with less beer.

325
00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:57.940
Did that make you angry? Oh, absolutely. Well, it was extremely unfair. Yeah.

326
00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:00.910
I would say it made, I think most men angry.

327
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:01.220
<v 14>Yeah.</v>

328
00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:06.220
At the time I'm a supreme court case was born.

329
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.330
So the thirsty boys at a fraternity, uh,

330
00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:14.290
brought this case.

331
00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:18.700
<v 17>So the RBG RBG gets involved in this beer case. Yes. But this is a,</v>

332
00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:23.320
this is a, this is a situation where women have rights. Men Don't have,

333
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:28.150
why would she want to argue this case? I would imagine she'd want the opposite.

334
00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:33.670
Well, this is where her strategy is kind of like, okay,

335
00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:37.650
<v 6>Trojan horse. If you look at this case right on the outside,</v>

336
00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:42.270
it looks like a case about men being discriminated against. Yeah.

337
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:43.740
But if you think about it,

338
00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:49.970
beneath that discrimination is actually this kind of unspoken idea about women.

339
00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:55.980
So go with me on this, right? If men are irresponsible,

340
00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:59.790
they can't handle beer, then women, girls are more responsible.

341
00:21:59.791 --> 00:22:02.550
And well-behaved, more delicate,

342
00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:06.390
but they can be trusted with something like beer cause they won't abuse it,

343
00:22:06.391 --> 00:22:09.360
you know? So with that line of thinking,

344
00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:14.310
it's not long before you're trying to protect women, protect them from,

345
00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:15.211
you know,

346
00:22:15.211 --> 00:22:20.211
scary places like bars or courtrooms or political office.

347
00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:24.460
<v 17>Using this case,</v>

348
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.870
RBG is able to walk into the court this discrimination about men,

349
00:22:28.871 --> 00:22:33.871
but also the discrimination against women that's attached to it or inside of it.

350
00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:39.070
Oh that's clever. Yeah, we're just getting started.

370
00:24:08.951 --> 00:24:12.790
We've been following kids as they ping pong through the criminal justice system

373
00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.140
This is my perfect MGI boom rod here with Julia Longoria,

374
00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:29.030
who's telling us the story of a case involving boys in beer that became a kind

375
00:24:29.031 --> 00:24:29.900
of Trojan Horse

376
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:33.980
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

377
00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:35.330
<v 17>in the battle for women's rights.</v>

378
00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:37.810
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

379
00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:40.960
<v 17>now the story of the Trojan horse, maybe you know this, it's uh,</v>

380
00:24:40.961 --> 00:24:43.780
you know ancient Greece. You've got Sparta fighting.

381
00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:46.550
Troy's Spartans want to get into the city of Troy,

382
00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:50.540
but it's this giant walled city too big they can't get in.

383
00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:53.420
And so Odysseus comes up with this clever plan.

384
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:56.120
We'll give the Trojans this giant wooden horse.

385
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:57.740
They'll bring it into their city.

386
00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.880
They'll think it's a gift that we're retreating, which is what they thought.

387
00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:05.720
And then at night, our soldiers who were hidden inside the horse will

388
00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:12.920
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

389
00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:16.880
<v 17>and they will take the city. Now in our case, Odysseus is,</v>

390
00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:20.720
is RBG the city she's trying to get into as the all male supreme court.

391
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:26.350
But in order for this very admittedly imperfect analogy to work,

392
00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:30.530
um, we need someone in the horse to come out the warrior in the horse,

393
00:25:30.531 --> 00:25:31.364
the woman warrior.

394
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:34.770
<v 0>And in our case, that woman warrior,</v>

395
00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.370
she didn't even know she was going to go into battle.

396
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:41.833
<v 4>No,</v>

397
00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:43.480
<v 0>Julia, you take it from here.</v>

398
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:48.100
So I got in the car and I drove a long time,

399
00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:53.220
tiny little gravel road leading up to narrow street of houses to Sparta,

400
00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.000
North Carolina. Oh, it's called Sparta.

401
00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:02.530
I know the cows and horses and Trump science

402
00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:07.740
tractor up front, trespassing.

403
00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.630
And so I walk up to this house,

404
00:26:10.631 --> 00:26:15.340
it's this beautiful cream colored cottage perched on top of a mountain.

405
00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:16.323
Wow.

406
00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:20.800
And I can hear Whitney Houston's saving all my love for you.

407
00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:25.320
Blasting you travel. Hi. No, I didn't you Carolyn.

408
00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:29.770
Hi. Very nice to meet you. And I meet Carolyn Whitener.

409
00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:34.860
I'm 76 soon to be 77 she be here

410
00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:41.420
immediately offers me a course. Yeah.

411
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:47.700
<v 6>Oh, you have a beer with me? No I can't. I'm a diabetic.</v>

412
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:51.390
I can drink a little bit. Not Match. Thank you.

413
00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.540
And I've got some brownies over here. What does she look like?

414
00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:58.920
Describe her reddish blonde hair. Green eyes, spring golden hoops.

415
00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:01.500
She has like this here,

416
00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:05.160
this air about her that she could have been a beauty queen, you know,

417
00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:09.790
but she also could have been a car mechanic. Match yourself.

418
00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:16.080
So we get to talking. I tell her a little bit about who I am, about the story.

419
00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.500
She actually told me like a friend, she's like, I'm proud,

420
00:27:19.501 --> 00:27:23.840
I'm proud of the young women. I have a granddaughter there. I'm so proud of you,

421
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.160
your generation. They're finishing the fight.

422
00:27:26.161 --> 00:27:29.430
I started and I was essentially like, no, no, no, no.

423
00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:34.490
This stuff like your story has like a huge impact on like women like me,

424
00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.270
you know, generation.

425
00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:44.130
But see my name was never tied in with it. It was always Craig's name.

426
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.970
So you know, it wasn't that big a deal.

427
00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:52.720
She told me she grew up bouncing around different oil fields.

428
00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:57.390
I was on a little field trash, that's what we were called or field trash.

429
00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:02.610
That meant Carolyn and her brother and sisters split the school year between two

430
00:28:02.611 --> 00:28:04.980
or three schools a year. We moved a lot.

431
00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:08.070
She said school didn't come easily to her, but my dad,

432
00:28:08.071 --> 00:28:12.330
he taught all three of us how to weld. He was a welder, how to work on a car.

433
00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:16.500
She was very independent and when she was about 13 they moved to Chickasha.

434
00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:17.363
Oklahoma

435
00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:20.720
<v 4>happened there? No, low home, Huh?</v>

436
00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:26.160
<v 6>Is where she met Dwayne. That was the first boy I went with.</v>

437
00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:29.220
They met in high school and they were roughly the same age,

438
00:28:29.221 --> 00:28:33.450
but he was three years ahead of her at school and no. What attracted you to him?

439
00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.393
His mind.

440
00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:41.060
He had an excellent mind and he was just a farm boy with no education.

441
00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:46.670
He never went to college that he could have been about anything he would have

442
00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:51.660
wanted to have been. What do you think attracted him to you? Like,

443
00:28:51.661 --> 00:28:56.220
what do you think he saw in you? I was somebody new in town talking to Carolyn.

444
00:28:56.250 --> 00:29:01.250
I got the sense she did not have any shortage of suitors that not married him

445
00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.153
<v 4>please.</v>

446
00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:14.500
<v 6>And when I married my husband, uh,</v>

447
00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:19.360
I was equal to him except the money and he didn't think anybody could handle

448
00:29:19.361 --> 00:29:24.070
that, but him, he acted like he was raising me and he probably was,

449
00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.610
she says she was really comfortable with him.

450
00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:30.880
He was a quiet man with this brilliant mind,

451
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.480
but he just was, he was pure German girl.

452
00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:39.130
Have you ever met a German man? Okay.

453
00:29:39.131 --> 00:29:42.710
They are in total control. And how does Carolyn, uh,

454
00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:47.380
connect to the case with the Frat boys and RBG? Okay, so here's what happens.

455
00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:48.790
It's 1962.

456
00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:53.350
Carolyn and Duane are about 20 years old at this point and they moved to a town

457
00:29:53.351 --> 00:29:57.010
called Stillwater, Oklahoma to open a business and

458
00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:58.453
<v 16>do water</v>

459
00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:03.130
is a college town.

460
00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:07.450
It's that college town that you got Oklahoma State University right there.

461
00:30:07.451 --> 00:30:11.020
Tons of fraternities, including lambda with the wrestlers.

462
00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:12.970
Huge homecoming drawing,

463
00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:16.690
<v 6>40,000 alumni. We didn't know what homecoming was,</v>

464
00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:20.740
had no idea what homecoming was. But shortly after moving just the water,

465
00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:23.990
they opened the doors to the honk and Holler

466
00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:31.230
and where we went in was just about three blocks,

467
00:30:31.231 --> 00:30:34.440
four blocks from the college, and we went into business there,

468
00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:36.900
a drive through convenience store.

469
00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:41.340
It was like the real old gas station with the opiate in the floor.

470
00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:42.300
Here's how it would work.

471
00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:47.010
Customers pull up to the side of the convenience store and they drive through,

472
00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:51.000
honk their horn, holler their order,

473
00:30:51.001 --> 00:30:53.370
and you'd have to go out and wait on them,

474
00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:56.310
come back in and get what they wanted and take it back out.

475
00:30:57.690 --> 00:30:59.820
So it's a lot of in and out, in and out

476
00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:05.070
all night long. You wear tennis shoes out real fast.

477
00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:10.080
So it was all sheer energy and guts. Homecoming night,

478
00:31:10.081 --> 00:31:15.081
we were supposed to close it for 11 the store is flooded with customers till I

479
00:31:15.991 --> 00:31:18.000
think two or three o'clock in the morning.

480
00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:21.000
They were like thrilled because they've never run a business by themselves

481
00:31:21.001 --> 00:31:24.900
before and all these college kids are coming in and buying quarter's beer,

482
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:30.830
including of course a steady stream of girls buying beer presumably for their

483
00:31:30.931 --> 00:31:34.260
boyfriends and it a, yeah, I never did get to see homecoming.

484
00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:39.780
All I saw was cars coming in and out. Fast forward a few years,

485
00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:43.440
it's 1972 back at the university. He's a tall,

486
00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:47.340
had long blonde hair. Curtis Craig's buddy named Mark Walker,

487
00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.670
he was the president of Lambda Chi House at the time is in a political science

488
00:31:50.671 --> 00:31:54.570
class and the professor starts talking about the whole fight for the [inaudible]

489
00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:57.310
<v 18>Dra, which is happening right at that moment.</v>

490
00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:03.450
And at this point Oklahoma hasn't ratified the era and somehow the conversation

491
00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:04.570
turns

492
00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:08.020
<v 6>this beer law, Mark's like talk about discrimination.</v>

493
00:32:08.021 --> 00:32:10.780
This beer law is discrimination against us.

494
00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:15.160
And the professor challenged him about doing something about the bear laws if he

495
00:32:15.161 --> 00:32:16.360
was going to complain about him.

496
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:20.860
So one day I was behind the counter people coming in and out.

497
00:32:20.861 --> 00:32:25.750
Mark Walker walks into the honk and holler. The young man came in to talk to me.

498
00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:28.540
She doesn't really have time to talk. She's running in and out,

499
00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:31.210
but he stood there waiting patiently.

500
00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:35.260
I bet he was in there for hours and he was looking at the beer license.

501
00:32:35.261 --> 00:32:39.200
He looks at the license and he notices that Carolyn's name is the one on it

502
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:44.360
because actually my husband lost his license after he sold beer to a young man.

503
00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:47.450
So he put him in my name. Anyway,

504
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:50.570
at a certain point in between all the honks and Hollers,

505
00:32:50.571 --> 00:32:55.571
he asked me what I thought about the beer laws and I told him I was very vocal

506
00:32:57.231 --> 00:33:00.680
about it. I always had band. She says, it doesn't make any sense.

507
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:02.390
We send these young men off to war,

508
00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:06.260
were being drafted at 18 oh we don't let them drink beer when they come back.

509
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:09.080
Was that just at the mention the liability issues.

510
00:33:09.081 --> 00:33:12.080
You have these 18 year old girls coming in buying beer,

511
00:33:12.081 --> 00:33:15.240
slipping into their boyfriends. How am I supposed to stop that? You're,

512
00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:18.140
you can't prove who buys what.

513
00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:21.080
So eventually when Mark Walker asked for her help,

514
00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:25.820
he said he was going to do a term paper. She's like, sure, why not?

515
00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:30.880
I was always willing to help them because they had helped us get started and I

516
00:33:31.671 --> 00:33:33.560
still thought it was a term paper.

517
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:38.240
So was he not being completely honest with you then? Well,

518
00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:42.740
I didn't hear half of what he said. I was busy every time he came in.

519
00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:47.210
So, you know, it wasn't that important at the time.

520
00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:50.960
So I didn't think any more about it. He left, my husband was gone.

521
00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:53.750
He was out of state working.

522
00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:58.940
And I didn't even say anything to him about it. It wasn't important, you know,

523
00:33:58.941 --> 00:34:00.680
I just thought it was a conversation,

524
00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:05.360
but it wasn't just a conversation because before that meeting,

525
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:08.780
mark had gone out looking for a lawyer. That's correct.

526
00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:12.980
And Curtis and mark and the other frat brothers had tried to raise some money

527
00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:15.910
that was flawed. Um, in a campus town,

528
00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:19.540
everybody uses their last dollar for that last bear.

529
00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:23.740
They managed to find this lawyer who would do it on the cheap. All right,

530
00:34:23.741 --> 00:34:28.060
well I'm just Fred Johor. The attorney at law, no big thing. Mono. No big deal.

531
00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:31.540
I remember him always wearing 'em, his military boots. Actually,

532
00:34:31.541 --> 00:34:34.390
I believe he wore them even to the supreme court.

533
00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:39.490
Fred had worked on another male discrimination case in the past and to him this

534
00:34:39.491 --> 00:34:40.810
case was pretty straight forward.

535
00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:45.940
Man couldn't buy beer until they are 21 but most irresponsible and drunken woman

536
00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:50.230
in the state could buy a limited quantities that 18 well,

537
00:34:50.231 --> 00:34:54.310
that was discrimination. It was kind of more a male rights case.

538
00:34:55.480 --> 00:35:00.460
Well, it was. Do you remember corresponding with Ruth Ruth Bader Ginsburg? Yes,

539
00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:04.840
I knew Ruth Bader Ginsburg before she was on the court.

540
00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:10.380
Somehow Ruth Bader Ginsburg noticed this case and she watched as Fred made his

541
00:35:11.021 --> 00:35:15.340
way up the courts losing at every level and by this point,

542
00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:19.150
Ruth Bader Ginsburg was head of the women's rights project at the ACL view.

543
00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:22.540
She'd already argued a few cases before the Supreme Court,

544
00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:27.780
which had inched the court slowly toward the idea that sex was like race,

545
00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:32.800
and she thought that this case was interesting. She gave Fred a call,

546
00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:36.790
you know we have a problem in a personal relationship, there's no question.

547
00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:38.040
I was

548
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:42.120
<v 19>something of an unreconstructed male chauvinist and she was not,</v>

549
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:45.120
Fred did not see this as a women's rights case,

550
00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:49.320
which just kind of an unnecessary insult. Demand for no reason at all.

551
00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:53.890
<v 6>And Ruth looking at this case. Dot. No, Fred, it's more than that.</v>

552
00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:58.480
It didn't matter to her if the plaintiff was a man or a woman because in most of

553
00:35:58.481 --> 00:36:03.481
those cases the discrimination against the man was derivative of a prior and

554
00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:05.380
worst discrimination against [inaudible].

555
00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:06.213
<v 20>The woman</v>

556
00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:12.130
used to the lady is the fair and the weak. How do they do?

557
00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.380
Where do they find all that energy,

558
00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:18.010
that seemingly inexhaustible store of pep and ginger.

559
00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:19.083
<v 6>Again,</v>

560
00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:23.740
Ruth was after the stereotype about women that was nestled inside the beer law,

561
00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:27.520
that women are more responsible and well behaved,

562
00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:30.310
but in order for her to make that connection,

563
00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:34.150
she needed Fred to write his brief in a way that would be useful to her.

564
00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:37.480
So refer not just to male discrimination,

565
00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:41.170
but discrimination based on gender. Well,

566
00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:46.360
<v 19>I supported her. I just never was shall we say,</v>

567
00:36:46.361 --> 00:36:51.070
a militant feminist. So like Ruth had her work cut out for her at this point.

568
00:36:51.071 --> 00:36:53.950
She was getting sort of used to dealing with these robes from the sticks.

569
00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:57.470
<v 6>So with other local lawyers that she'd worked with in the past,</v>

570
00:36:57.530 --> 00:37:01.250
Ruth had been more forceful insisting that she make the argument,

571
00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:05.210
but that had backfired. So she liked, it's like, okay, you argue it. Right.

572
00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:08.120
Cause she wrote that Fred telling him that she didn't need to be the one to

573
00:37:08.121 --> 00:37:11.930
present oral argument before the court. She was fine if he'd do it,

574
00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.240
but she very gently,

575
00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:19.270
very persistently was able to convince him to let her help him with his legal

576
00:37:19.281 --> 00:37:23.000
brief and bet. I think it was a,

577
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:26.990
a couple of months later, because my husband was out of state every month.

578
00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:31.040
Meanwhile back at the Hong Kong Holler, Carolyn has no idea what's going on. Uh,

579
00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:35.120
no, uh, no idea. And I got a phone call.

580
00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:37.160
My husband was on the phone.

581
00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:42.580
Well I had salesman in and I had people coming in and out and he was,

582
00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:46.880
I right, he was furious.

583
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:50.660
I couldn't figure out what was going on. She was like, case,

584
00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:51.770
what are you talking about? Well,

585
00:37:51.771 --> 00:37:56.771
he had picked up a newspaper in North Carolina and a bank and it was on the

586
00:37:58.461 --> 00:38:03.461
front page of the newspaper with my name and about as soon it looked like we

587
00:38:05.301 --> 00:38:09.860
sued everybody in the state of Oklahoma that was in office all the way down to

588
00:38:09.861 --> 00:38:13.860
the garbage man. He's like, what did you do? How are you,

589
00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:16.460
we don't want to get mixed up in this. We don't want our name on this.

590
00:38:16.461 --> 00:38:20.180
We don't want to make a fuss like this could hurt business. Like, how dare you?

591
00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:23.600
You know? I didn't know what had happened. I really didn't know.

592
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:27.740
And eventually she figured out it must've been that kid who came in here and now

593
00:38:27.741 --> 00:38:30.290
it's like at the Supreme Court, what?

594
00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:35.320
I was back and forth on that phone with him trying to wait on customers and I

595
00:38:35.381 --> 00:38:39.210
bet that took about three hours and he would not let up on me.

596
00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:43.060
And he kept calling back and call him back. He called a lawyer,

597
00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:48.120
he was mad and then the last phone call he said,

598
00:38:48.401 --> 00:38:50.290
I am flying back in. And he said,

599
00:38:50.291 --> 00:38:54.610
you picked me up a couple nights later she drove to the airport,

600
00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:59.150
picked him up and uh, he was still mad.

601
00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:04.690
That was the longest car ride.

602
00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:11.130
As they drove back, she says he just lectured her the whole ride.

603
00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:13.890
I just listened to him. What did he say?

604
00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:16.860
I don't know what he said word to word.

605
00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:19.740
I just know he was strong with what he said

606
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.610
with my husband, it was best to just be silent.

607
00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:34.760
I was never afraid of him, but I knew how far to push it.

608
00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:40.400
Tell Him we got from the airport to the other side.

609
00:39:40.401 --> 00:39:42.440
It was about an hour and 20 minutes.

610
00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:46.130
That's a long hour and 20 minutes in the car where you can't get out.

611
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:51.540
<v 1>And over the course of that hour and 20 minutes,</v>

612
00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:57.290
she said something in her just kind of shifted and at a certain point she

613
00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:01.620
basically turned to him and was like, no,

614
00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:07.240
<v 6>like, I know you want me to drop this case but I'm going to fight this.</v>

615
00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.070
He threatened me every which way.

616
00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:14.340
I didn't budge and probably the reason why I didn't budge because he fought me

617
00:40:15.911 --> 00:40:18.280
so hard on it. You know,

618
00:40:18.281 --> 00:40:22.570
I believed in it that I hadn't ever stepped out like that.

619
00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:27.310
That's the first time I really put my foot down and didn't budge.

620
00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.180
I gave so much to him. I mean,

621
00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:38.310
I didn't get a salary for 25 years. I didn't ask for it.

622
00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:41.830
I figured we were equal.

623
00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:47.010
I figured I worked the same hours he did and I figured I stood beside him,

624
00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.470
not behind him and not in front of him.

625
00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:57.270
October 5th, 1976 the day of oral arguments, the lawyer,

626
00:40:57.271 --> 00:41:01.260
Fred Gilbert, I haven't ran across very many people that I didn't care for him.

627
00:41:01.261 --> 00:41:04.440
I didn't care for Fred. He, he was so pushy.

628
00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:09.060
Insists that Caroline needs to come to d c or I didn't have the money to go when

629
00:41:09.061 --> 00:41:11.910
I didn't want to go and never traveled anywhere by myself.

630
00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:16.320
What I recall that day Curtis Craig came to, I was dressed up,

631
00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:20.850
suit and tie, had borrowed a dress, plastic look like leather,

632
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:25.020
walking up those stairs, high heels. I remember that distinctly.

633
00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:27.150
It was so big, beautiful building.

634
00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:31.920
I felt like I was walking forever up those stairs. I was burning up,

635
00:41:31.921 --> 00:41:32.754
I was sweating.

636
00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:38.390
<v 3>You don't hear arguments neck 75, six 28</v>

637
00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:44.060
Craig Against Foreign Gilbert, you [inaudible] whenever you're ready.

638
00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:46.480
<v 6>Fred Gilbert starts things off.</v>

639
00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:49.690
He walks up to the podium in his combat boots.

640
00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:53.730
<v 21>The law is broad and all conversing and it's sweet.</v>

641
00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:58.920
It says they're all females. Even those that are the most drunk, most alcoholic,

642
00:41:58.921 --> 00:42:03.921
most immature and most irresponsible may purchase 3.2% beer at age 18 and

643
00:42:04.651 --> 00:42:08.780
absolutely unlimited quantity. The law doesn't say it quite those words does it

644
00:42:10.810 --> 00:42:13.840
<v 6>by all accounts. He didn't exactly kill it.</v>

645
00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:18.730
<v 21>No, your honor. And the law doesn't say it quite the words that, uh, all males,</v>

646
00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:20.550
<v 6>the justice is just kept hammering.</v>

647
00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:24.530
<v 21>I mean, your honor, the van door's still, he can get the leaf at the movies,</v>

648
00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:28.230
age back and dread hammering in a technical sense.

649
00:42:28.231 --> 00:42:31.580
I don't technical once you're on it, but it might as technical, yes.

650
00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:35.100
Complaint is drafted and what does before the court will put you, say you say,

651
00:42:35.101 --> 00:42:38.850
what's before the court? What's before the court is your complaint?

652
00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:43.020
<v 6>Curtis was sitting beside me and I kept punching him. What does that mean?</v>

653
00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:46.760
What are they talking about? What does that mean? He kept saying, Shh,

654
00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:49.590
just be quiet too. This over. I'll tell you,

655
00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:54.390
<v 21>you're already doing [inaudible] movies, any of the tracks right then door,</v>

656
00:42:54.391 --> 00:42:55.430
who is trying to sell them?

657
00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:57.360
<v 6>I didn't understand what they were doing.</v>

658
00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:01.340
<v 21>Fear Law that we challenged today was originally inactivity 18 nights,</v>

659
00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:05.910
<v 6>but she says what caught her ear was a moment when justice Rehnquist when he</v>

660
00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:06.610
call me.

661
00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:11.540
<v 21>When you say we, you're referring to your client who is the tavern keeper?</v>

662
00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:12.590
<v 6>The saloon.</v>

663
00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:13.423
<v 21>Yes, your honor.</v>

664
00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:18.450
<v 6>I'll tell you when, when you call me that and the Supreme Court, I came so near,</v>

665
00:43:18.451 --> 00:43:22.380
standing up incorrect and him and I always wondered to this day, why?

666
00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:24.750
<v 21>Well, isn't the DFT technically turned right?</v>

667
00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:25.990
<v 6>As arguments went on,</v>

668
00:43:25.991 --> 00:43:29.180
Fred did at least try to do the thing that Ruth wanted him to do.

669
00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:31.960
<v 21>Your honor, I would say anything could be,</v>

670
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:37.030
you could pass a law saying no negro will drive while intoxicated,

671
00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:40.150
<v 6>compare sex discrimination to race discrimination.</v>

672
00:43:40.290 --> 00:43:42.350
<v 21>Now this relates to the public thing, but you,</v>

673
00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:46.650
the thing is you can't discriminate even for something like public safety on the

674
00:43:46.651 --> 00:43:48.420
basis of certain criteria. Well,

675
00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:52.580
has the court ever held that discrimination of this sort is of the same class?

676
00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:57.060
Is discrimination the basis of race? Your honor, this court has come very,

677
00:43:57.061 --> 00:44:00.670
very well. I asked you a question. Has It ever held? No. It has never held,

678
00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:04.000
but it is totally to be treated the same as restaurant.

679
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:07.900
<v 6>To make a long story short, by the end of oral argument,</v>

680
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:10.870
things were looking great for Fred.

681
00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:14.090
<v 21>See, I mean, I think that depends on the thrust of ours. All right,</v>

682
00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:15.490
let me explain this. First of all,

683
00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:19.430
<v 6>we did at one point, [inaudible] interrupts a supreme court justice,</v>

684
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.970
which verge, this all. You don't do that

685
00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:24.740
<v 21>hoarding the denial of beer to young men. 18 to</v>

686
00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.500
<v 6>it. Just uh, yeah. I wasn't happy.</v>

687
00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:31.200
<v 21>No, I don't have time for a parting thought. I thank you for your time.</v>

688
00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:33.090
Thank you, Jonathan. The case is submitted.

689
00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:38.670
<v 0>Well, you win some, you lose some, right ladies. No, no, no, no, no.</v>

690
00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:42.980
<v 6>Here comes the craziest part of the story.</v>

691
00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:48.730
It's like a double Trojan horse horse within a horse because after the Fred

692
00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:54.260
Gilbert debacle, there was another case at the Supreme Court that afternoon

693
00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:57.590
and it just so happened

694
00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:01.940
that it was a case being argued

695
00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:08.090
by none other than Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Somehow she organized.

696
00:45:08.091 --> 00:45:12.200
I've now forgotten how to get that argued the same day. That was on purpose.

697
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:15.860
Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh my God. That's genius. Yeah. No, she's a genius.

698
00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:19.170
Mr Chief Justice and may it please the court what you're saying.

699
00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:23.300
She somehow managed to get herself in the court on another case on the same day,

700
00:45:23.301 --> 00:45:27.770
so I couldn't confirm that for sure. I don't even know how you would do that,

701
00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:32.720
but what I can tell you is that she arranged to go second because she knew there

702
00:45:32.721 --> 00:45:34.850
was probably a good chance that Fred,

703
00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:38.900
the completely incompetent lawyer was going to be, you know,

704
00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:40.840
less than amazing. The court was,

705
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:43.640
was asking him questions and he was completely incapable of answering.

706
00:45:43.641 --> 00:45:45.410
So finally the court just went, oh, nevermind.

707
00:45:45.411 --> 00:45:48.050
And then when Ruth's do an octa argue her case,

708
00:45:48.051 --> 00:45:49.920
they asked her about Greg Vibhor.

709
00:45:50.170 --> 00:45:54.270
<v 21>You had a case this morning just to be concrete involving a law that would not</v>

710
00:45:54.271 --> 00:45:57.810
permit males to make certain purchases if females get make and was attacked as

711
00:45:57.890 --> 00:45:59.190
it discrimination against males.

712
00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:03.150
My question is whether we should examine that law under the same or a different

713
00:46:03.151 --> 00:46:05.940
standard than if it were a discrimination against.

714
00:46:05.941 --> 00:46:08.310
The question is no,

715
00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:12.270
in part because such a law has an insidious impact against females.

716
00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:14.640
<v 0>And then she told Justice Stephens,</v>

717
00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:18.630
even in this case where it seems like men are the ones who are being

718
00:46:18.631 --> 00:46:23.070
discriminated against. Beneath that discrimination is a more insidious one

719
00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:27.220
<v 21>against females. It stabs them docile compliance, safe to be cleared.</v>

720
00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:31.800
Your answer always depends on their finding some discrimination against females.

721
00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:35.280
Is it your view that there is no discrimination against males?

722
00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:38.760
I think there is discrimination against male.

723
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:42.450
If there is such discrimination is it to be tested by the same or by a different

724
00:46:42.451 --> 00:46:44.250
standard from discrimination against females.

725
00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:49.020
My response to that Ms. Justice Stevens is that almost every discrimination that

726
00:46:49.021 --> 00:46:52.740
operates against males operates against females as well.

727
00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:56.680
Is that a yes or a no answer? I just don't understand you and I,

728
00:46:56.681 --> 00:46:59.790
I you're trying to avoid the question and now I am not trying to avoid the

729
00:46:59.791 --> 00:47:00.624
question.

730
00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:05.490
I'm trying to clarify the position that I don't know of any line that doesn't,

731
00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:07.530
that doesn't work as a two edged sword.

732
00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:08.970
<v 0>It go back and forth a bit.</v>

733
00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:12.990
Justice Stevens is basically like why do you keep insisting on this?

734
00:47:12.991 --> 00:47:17.970
Like why do you keep saying that discrimination against men contains within it

735
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.060
discrimination against women. They're different and she's like, no,

736
00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:21.870
they're not different.

737
00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:26.370
<v 21>So your case depends in an are enlightening this case as a discrimination</v>

738
00:47:26.371 --> 00:47:27.210
against female.

739
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:32.750
My case depends on your recognition that using gender as a classification

740
00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:40.200
resorting to that classification is highly questionable and should be closely

741
00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:41.660
reviewed.

742
00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:43.670
<v 1>She makes this point again and again,</v>

743
00:47:43.850 --> 00:47:47.900
all discrimination based on gender is bad and it should be checked with

744
00:47:47.901 --> 00:47:52.730
something at least approaching that hardcore standard that the court uses for

745
00:47:52.731 --> 00:47:57.170
race. That was really something seeing this little woman.

746
00:47:57.630 --> 00:48:01.020
<v 21>Yeah. I don't know of any purely anti male discrimination.</v>

747
00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:03.720
<v 6>I'll never forget that because she was small.</v>

748
00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:07.560
<v 21>In the end. The women are the ones who end up hurting. Yes,</v>

749
00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:09.470
<v 6>she's so small and person,</v>

750
00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:14.120
but she had a lot of force going hurt cases.

751
00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:17.930
About two months later,

752
00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:19.843
<v 21>judgment,</v>

753
00:48:20.290 --> 00:48:22.680
<v 1>December 20th, 1976</v>

754
00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:25.550
<v 21>Craig against a Marham</v>

755
00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:28.090
<v 1>Justice William Brennan announces that the court</v>

756
00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:30.133
<v 3>we reversed.</v>

757
00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:32.280
<v 1>It's striking down the beer law.</v>

758
00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:38.020
<v 3>We hold that Oklahoma's gender based differential does constitute and Nvidia's</v>

759
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:41.690
violation of the equal protection clause.

760
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.000
<v 1>This silly beer case was basically the first time the court clearly said that</v>

761
00:48:48.151 --> 00:48:50.160
when you discriminate based on gender,

762
00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:53.520
you need to pass a harder test.

763
00:48:54.450 --> 00:48:58.050
It wasn't as rigorous as race. It wasn't strict scrutiny.

764
00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:03.330
They settled on a standard that we now call intermediate scrutiny and it was

765
00:49:03.331 --> 00:49:04.230
pretty damn close.

766
00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:13.320
RVG would go on to strengthen the standard over time. But this was the case

767
00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:19.080
that first got us a kind of equal rights amendment through a side door.

768
00:49:19.770 --> 00:49:24.770
<v 6>We wish that the court had picked a less frothy case to make that announcement,</v>

769
00:49:26.850 --> 00:49:28.320
but of course we look very,

770
00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:33.740
very pleased that after that the day the decision was announced,

771
00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:38.040
I had just came in from work. I was at home by myself there in Stillwater.

772
00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:43.160
She's by herself in the kitchen and the phone rings and who calls who called

773
00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:49.380
national news call to tell me that we had won.

774
00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:53.040
I didn't ask what we had one,

775
00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:58.200
I didn't ask anything. I just said okay.

776
00:49:58.830 --> 00:49:59.521
She hung up,

777
00:49:59.521 --> 00:50:02.880
stood there for a little bit and then Craig called and he wanted me to come down

778
00:50:02.881 --> 00:50:07.710
and celebrate with the guys there or his fraternity. Fraternity. Yeah.

779
00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:09.960
She told him no thanks.

780
00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:14.610
And then she hangs up the phone and she gets one more phone call and it was my

781
00:50:14.611 --> 00:50:15.121
husband,

782
00:50:15.121 --> 00:50:20.121
he was in North Carolina again and he heard he heard something about the case

783
00:50:22.441 --> 00:50:27.290
but he didn't hear it all. And he said, what's going on now? And I said,

784
00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:32.150
uh, we won. And he says, is it over? I said, it is over,

785
00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:38.580
it's totally over with. He said, good. And he hung up.

786
00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:43.560
I fixed me a very good drink.

787
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:47.520
Vodka and coke sat down in the middle of the floor and that's the way I

788
00:50:47.521 --> 00:50:49.770
celebrated. I drank that,

789
00:50:49.771 --> 00:50:53.820
drank all by myself and it was over with. It was over with

790
00:50:58.350 --> 00:50:59.183
<v 4>[inaudible].</v>

791
00:50:59.190 --> 00:51:02.600
<v 0>Carolyn says that for decades after this case,</v>

792
00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:05.540
she didn't understand what it meant.

793
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:10.820
She didn't understand what it meant as a legal principle or that it ushered in

794
00:51:10.821 --> 00:51:13.340
this new era for women in this country.

795
00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:17.930
<v 1>But even so in</v>

796
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:19.310
<v 0>her own life,</v>

797
00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:23.980
<v 1>this case was the beginning.</v>

798
00:51:27.210 --> 00:51:32.210
<v 6>Wait a couple of years after we won that case and went into China right after it</v>

799
00:51:32.611 --> 00:51:35.960
opened up, she saved up money and went with her sister-in-law.

800
00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:39.390
Cause Dwayne didn't want to come with him. I did.

801
00:51:39.610 --> 00:51:43.740
I was so curious and we never went like the tourist went,

802
00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:48.030
we'd get on a train and if we saw something we wanted to stop and see,

803
00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:51.660
we would stop. We never had a schedule

804
00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:55.380
and I never did really go to shop.

805
00:51:55.381 --> 00:51:58.980
I was just curious about the people and how they lived.

806
00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:02.880
I saw so much and I talked to so many people,

807
00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:07.230
I was gone that uh, it was like a hunger

808
00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:13.120
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

809
00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:16.530
<v 6>and you grow from it. Yeah.</v>

810
00:52:16.690 --> 00:52:19.900
And I just wanted to see things and that was just dope.

811
00:52:20.090 --> 00:52:21.740
That just opened the doors for me.

812
00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:36.483
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

813
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:10.103
<v 4>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

814
00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:16.853
[inaudible]

815
00:53:19.210 --> 00:53:24.100
<v 0>what happened to Carolyn in the end? She and Duane divorced in 2007.</v>

816
00:53:24.370 --> 00:53:26.030
Huh. And, and when you,

817
00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:30.300
and when you said she didn't know the effect her case had for decades,

818
00:53:30.301 --> 00:53:32.660
like when did she figure it out or when did what,

819
00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:37.850
how so in around 1996 this professor guy named Bob Darcy calls her up and

820
00:53:39.061 --> 00:53:44.061
invites her to speak at a class and she is kind of learning from the students

821
00:53:46.051 --> 00:53:49.350
and from the professor like what the case actually stood for.

822
00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:53.670
And then eventually the professor puts her in touch with Ruth Bader Ginsburg and

823
00:53:53.671 --> 00:53:58.671
they meet again in person and it sort of starts to Donna,

824
00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:02.910
<v 6>one of the letters,</v>

825
00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:07.200
I don't know if that's a one when we're sitting in her bedroom,

826
00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:11.190
she was looking through some old letters and pulled out one with the supreme

827
00:54:11.191 --> 00:54:15.390
court seal on it. Can you read it? Oh No, I don't have my glasses.

828
00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:17.130
You have to read. Okay dear Carolyn,

829
00:54:17.131 --> 00:54:21.510
as I told you in 1996 when we celebrated the 20th anniversary of Craig vs borne,

830
00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:24.180
you are the true heroine of that case.

831
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:27.030
Although no financial gain was at stake for you.

832
00:54:27.031 --> 00:54:30.870
You realize the potential the case had in paving the way for the courts

833
00:54:30.871 --> 00:54:32.760
recognition of equal citizenship,

834
00:54:32.761 --> 00:54:35.970
stature of men and women as constitutional principle.

835
00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:38.453
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

836
00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:44.080
<v 6>I bet I was going to get that framed. I haven't done it yet. Hm.</v>

837
00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:48.170
Signed Ruth Bader Ginsburg. I need to get it laminated for I have your friend,

838
00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:49.973

00:55:44.490 --> 00:55:45.323
<v 4>Okay.</v>

853

856
00:55:55.840 --> 00:56:00.490
I used to sing at Tokyo Disney land and my side Gig on my days off,

857
00:56:00.550 --> 00:56:04.180
or was recording voiceovers at a little Japanese studio.

858
00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:09.040
I did a lot of language lessons for kids. Listen,

859
00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:09.970
and repeat.
