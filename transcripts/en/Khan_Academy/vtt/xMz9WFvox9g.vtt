00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.590
Human beings have
always realized

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.700
that certain things are
longer than other things.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.630
For example, this
line segment looks

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.820
longer than this line segment.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.470
But that's not so satisfying
just to make that comparison.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:12.490
You want to be
able to measure it.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.448
You want to be able to
quantify how much longer

00:00:14.448 --> 00:00:16.920
the second one is
than the first one.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.490
And how do we go
about doing that?

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.770
Well, we define a unit length.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.410
So if we make this
our unit length,

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.270
we say this is one unit, then
we could say how many of those

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.430
the lengths are
each of these lines?

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.729
So this first line
looks like it is--

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.350
we could do one of those units
and then we could do it again,

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.727
so it looks like
this is two units.

00:00:38.727 --> 00:00:40.810
While this third one looks
like we can get-- let's

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.970
see that's 1, 2, 3 of the units.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.460
So this is three of the units.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.500
And right here, I'm
just saying units.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.490
Sometimes we've made conventions
to define a centimeter, where

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.270
the unit might look
something like this.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.686
And it's going to look different
depending on your screen.

00:00:57.686 --> 00:01:01.330
Or we might have an inch that
looks something like this.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.890
Or we might have a
foot that I won't

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.970
be able to fit on this screen
based on how big I've just

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.600
drawn the inch or a meter.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.480
So there's different
units that you

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.120
could use to
measure in terms of.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.580
But now let's think
about more dimensions.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.250
This is literally a
one-dimensional case.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.310
This is 1D.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.430
Why is it one dimension?

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.970
Well, I can only measure length.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.350
But now let's go to a 2D case.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.720
Let's go to two
dimensions where objects

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.730
could have a length and a
width or a width and a height.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.340
So let's imagine two figures
here that look like this.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.770
So let's say this
is one of them.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.260
This is one of them.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.692
And notice, it has a
width and it has a height.

00:01:47.692 --> 00:01:49.650
Or you could view it as
a width and the length,

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.191
depending on how
you want to view it.

00:01:51.191 --> 00:01:53.970
So let's say this is one
figure right over here.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.805
And let's say this
is the other one.

00:01:55.805 --> 00:02:00.630
So this is the other
one right over here.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.580
Try to draw them
reasonably well.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.880
Now, once again, now
we're in two dimensions.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.250
And we want to say, well,
how much in two dimensions

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.700
space is this taking up?

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.147
Or how much area are each
of these two taking up?

00:02:14.147 --> 00:02:16.230
Well, once again, we could
just make a comparison.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.530
This second, if you viewed
them as carpets or rectangles,

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.860
the second rectangle is
taking up more of my screen

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.740
than this first one, but I
want to be able to measure it.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.270
So how would we measure it?

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.889
Well, once again, we would
define a unit square.

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:31.305
Instead of just a unit length,
we now have two dimensions.

00:02:31.305 --> 00:02:34.270
We have to define a unit square.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.840
And so we might make
our unit square.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.620
And the unit square we will
define as being a square,

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.390
where its width
and its height are

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.670
both equal to the unit length.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.310
So this is its width is one
unit and its height is one unit.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.250
And so we will often
call this 1 square unit.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.750
Oftentimes, you'll
say this is 1 unit.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.746
And you put this 2 up here, this
literally means 1 unit squared.

00:03:03.746 --> 00:03:05.120
And instead of
writing unit, this

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.740
could've been a centimeter.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.420
So this would be 1
square centimeter.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.490
But now we can use this
to measure these areas.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.900
And just as we said
how many of this unit

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.620
length could fit
on these lines, we

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.797
could say, how many of these
unit squares can fit in here?

00:03:19.797 --> 00:03:21.880
And so here, we might take
one of our unit squares

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.597
and say, OK, it fills
up that much space.

00:03:24.597 --> 00:03:26.180
Well, we need more
to cover all of it.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.740
Well, there, we'll put
another unit square there.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.370
We'll put another unit
square right over there.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.670
We'll put another unit
square right over there.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.530
Wow, 4 units squares
exactly cover this.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.170
So we would say that
this has an area

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:45.950
of 4 square units
or 4 units squared.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.110
Now what about this
one right over here?

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:58.910
Well, here, let's seem I could
fit 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:59.940
and 9.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:06.710
So here I could fit 9
units, 9 units squared.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:07.710
Let's keep going.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.960
We live in a
three-dimensional world.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.320
Why restrict ourselves
to only one or two?

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.890
So let's go to the 3D case.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.751
And once again,
when people say 3D,

00:04:16.751 --> 00:04:18.209
they're talking
about 3 dimensions.

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.050
They're talking about
the different directions

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:21.341
that you can measure things in.

00:04:21.341 --> 00:04:22.620
Here there's only length.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.340
Here there is length and
width or width and height.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.890
And here, there'll be
width and height and depth.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:37.910
So once again, if you have,
let's say, an object, and now

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.910
we're in three dimensions,
we're in the world we

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.120
live in that looks
like this, and then

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:52.260
you have another object
that looks like this,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.730
it looks like this second
object takes up more space,

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.120
more physical space than
this first object does.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.510
It looks like it
has a larger volume.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.050
But how do we
actually measure that?

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.460
And remember, volume is just how
much space something takes up

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.960
in three dimensions.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.340
Area is how much space something
takes up in two dimensions.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.660
Length is how much
space something takes up

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.030
in one dimension.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.530
But when we think
about space, we're

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.238
normally thinking
about three dimensions.

00:05:21.238 --> 00:05:24.250
So how much space would
you take up in the world

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.370
that we live in?

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.530
So just like we did before,
we can define, instead

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.080
of a unit length
or unit area, we

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.160
can define a unit
volume or unit cube.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.870
So let's do that.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.770
Let's define our unit cube.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.110
And here, it's a cube so its
length, width, and height

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.170
are going to be the same value.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.400
So my best attempt
at drawing a cube.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.050
And they're all
going to be one unit.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.580
So it's going to be one
unit high, one unit deep,

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.685
and one unit wide.

00:05:55.685 --> 00:05:57.560
And so to measure volume,
we could say, well,

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.020
how many of these
unit cubes can fit

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.200
into these different shapes?

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.391
Well, this one right
over here, and you

00:06:04.391 --> 00:06:06.140
won't be able to
actually see all of them.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.300
I could essentially
break it down

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.390
into-- so let me see
how well I can do this

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.105
so that we can count them all.

00:06:13.105 --> 00:06:14.980
It's a little bit
harder to see them all

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.850
because there's some
cubes that are behind us.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.180
But if you think of
it as two layers,

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.980
so one layer would
look like this.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.060
One layer is going
to look like this.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.000
So imagine two things like this
stacked on top of each other.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.655
So this one's going to
have 1, 2, 3, 4 cubes.

00:06:30.655 --> 00:06:32.280
Now, this is going
to have two of these

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.630
stacked on top of each other.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.370
So here you have 8 unit cubes.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.720
Or you could have 8
units cubed volume.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.140
What about here?

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:46.150
If we try to fit
it all in-- let me

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.525
see how well I could draw this.

00:06:50.735 --> 00:06:52.360
It's going to look
something like this.

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:58.260
And obviously, this is
kind of a rough drawing.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.600
And so if we were to
try to take this apart,

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.850
you would essentially have a
stack of three sections that

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.840
would each look
something like this.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.030
My best attempt at drawing it.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.250
Three sections that
would look something

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:19.220
like what I'm about to draw.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.130
So it would look like this.

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.270
So if you took three of
these and stacked them

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.830
on top of each other, you'd
get this right over here.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:32.050
And each of these have 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 cubes in it.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:38.280
9 times 3, you're going to
have 27 cubic units in this one

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:38.966
right over here.

00:07:38.966 --> 00:07:40.840
So hopefully that helps
us think a little bit

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.510
about how we measure
things especially

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:45.960
how we measure things in
different number of dimensions,

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.120
especially in three dimensions
when we call it volume.
