Obama a man a hope. February 1968 I joined
the demonstration against the bombing of them.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:17.360
Big church. Marting Luther King spoke to us
about justice is like mighty stream. After

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.779
his lecture I was completely taken in by this
mighty prophetic man. And I lost a book. A

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:31.380
book of poems. I'm a child survivor. And poems
for me were very important because they were

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.079
poems about peace, about justice. And I looked
for that book. So I opened my work space at

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:43.480
home and there were all different kinds of
paper, so I looked for the book. Went on my

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:50.600
knees, suddenly a door opens and Martin Luther
King comes in. And he says to me, have you

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.230
lost something? I said yes, a book of poems.
He said let's look for it, he goes on his

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:03.890
knees next to me and he looks threw the papers.
I want to say a thousand things as I speak

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:11.020
in silence with him. After a long search he
says, unfortunately my brother, we don't seem

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:18.500
to find it. We shake hands. I think him for
helping me search for it, and he disappears

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.920
out of my life, two months later out of the
life of the world. Now in the first week of

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.590
President Obama I have a feeling that we together
will find the book of peace.
