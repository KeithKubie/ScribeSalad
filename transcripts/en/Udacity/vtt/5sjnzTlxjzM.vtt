00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.360
One of the main things
professional prototypers and

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.530
UX engineers do is build
out prototypes in code.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:11.380
Often, we use things like Framer.js,
Sublime Text, Android Studio, or Xcode.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.750
With these tools, we can make
prototypes of arbitrary fidelity.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.620
This is really useful when you have a
particular feature that needs to be seen

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.410
to be understood.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.120
Often, users will have trouble
understanding such a feature

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.570
from a low or medium fidelity prototype

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.420
since it doesn't always come
through in those mediums.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.549
By building out a minimum viable version
of that feature, we can test whether it

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.320
makes sense to build a production
quality version later on.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.920
Another use case that makes
code prototypes vital

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.680
is dealing realistically
with user input.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.450
We use this when making prototypes for

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.430
Google Maps, we want to understand how
the changes impact a user's ability to

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.950
find the information
they're looking for.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.250
Building a prototype that
leverages real data and

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.220
user input can provide valuable insight
into how a user approaches the app.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.970
Remember, that Jeremy wanted
to type his information

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.100
when presented with our
inVision prototype.
