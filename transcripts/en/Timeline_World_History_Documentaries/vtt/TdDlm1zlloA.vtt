'It is 1559.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
'England has a newly-crowned queen.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:38.158
'Elizabeth has overcome extraordinary
obstacles to gain the crown.

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.359
'But her struggle isn't over.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.240
'There's one thing about her
that will lead to scandal...

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.009
'that will compromise her power...

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.250
'threaten her security...

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.490
'and demand a terrible personal sacrifice.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.650
'She is a woman.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.569
'Elizabeth inherited a part

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.040
'that was traditionally
played by two people -

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.090
'king and queen, male and female.'

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.849
A king was supposed to be
strong-willed and assertive,

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.319
a decisive leader in war and peace.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.170
The queen, on the other hand,
embodied softer, more feminine virtues.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.650
She was to be pious,
merciful and charitable

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.040
but above all, she was
a royal breeding machine.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.840
It was her duty
to get pregnant early and often.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.159
So for Elizabeth to succeed

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.849
she'd to do something extraordinary,
unnatural even -

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.599
she'd to be a royal hermaphrodite.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.209
To rule like a man and a king

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.480
and to bear children
like a queen and a woman.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.008
'Elizabeth would have to fight to survive

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.560
'and in a man's world
she would need men to help her do it.

00:02:23.968 --> 00:02:28.479
'Her first task as queen
was to establish her own court.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.848
'Her council, who would be in charge of
the everyday running of the country

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.318
'and her household staff
who would look after her'.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.889
'The old regime was Catholic,
the new was largely Protestant,

00:02:43.968 --> 00:02:47.639
'though a few
favoured Catholics survived.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.650
'Some councillors were old hands
who had served under her father

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.688
'but the top job went to a younger man,

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.250
'William Cecil, who became
her secretary of state.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.490
'He was 38, serious, brilliant
with an instinctive grasp of politics

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.930
'and a fierce loyalty to the Queen.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.968
'In a flamboyant age,
he dressed in black and he rode a mule

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.968
'because it was modest
and good for his gout.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.568
'There were also surprises
in the new household.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.199
'As Master of the Horse, the man
responsible for the Queen's safety,

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.840
'Elizabeth appointed
the son of a traitor duke.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.318
'Robert Dudley's father
had been executed for his treachery

00:03:43.408 --> 00:03:46.438
'and the family remained
tainted by the crime.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.550
'Known disparagingly as "the Gypsy"

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.718
'because of his dark looks
charm and cunning,

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.158
'Dudley's appointment raised
more than a few eyebrows at court.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.688
'Elizabeth and Dudley were the same age
and had known each other in childhood.'

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.050
They may also have met
in less happy circumstances

00:04:12.128 --> 00:04:17.720
here in the Tower where they were
both imprisoned early in Mary's reign.

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.399
Elizabeth was in fear of death.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.689
Dudley had already seen
his father, his brother

00:04:24.769 --> 00:04:26.838
and his sister-in-law executed

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.720
and he was under
sentence of death himself.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.319
It was this common experience
of imprisonment and imminent death

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.610
that lay at the basis of that unbreakable,
instinctive bond of sympathy

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:43.720
that joined the Queen and her favourite.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.360
'Elizabeth's choice of Cecil
was about politics and duty.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.449
'Her choice of Dudley
was about pleasure and desire.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.850
'Elizabeth had inherited from her sister
Mary a nation that was bankrupt,

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.000
'militarily weak
and hemmed in by enemies.

00:05:19.329 --> 00:05:24.040
'In the parlance of the time, the country
was a bone between two dogs -

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:26.079
'France and Spain.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.319
'England needed friends.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.970
'The obvious way to achieve it
was an alliance through marriage.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.009
'The Queen must marry...

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:41.079
'and soon.

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:47.959
'Parliament petitioned the Queen

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.689
'asking her to pledge herself
to a suitable international marriage.

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:56.199
'Three days later,
she gave her response.'

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.610
Now that the public care of
governing the kingdom is laid upon me,

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:04.759
to draw upon me
also the cares of marriage

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.569
may seem a point of inconsiderate folly.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.610
Yea, to satisfy you,

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:14.519
I have already joined myself
in marriage to an husband,

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.250
namely the Kingdom of England.

00:06:17.329 --> 00:06:21.480
And for me it shall be a full satisfaction.

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:25.560
If, when I shall let my last breath,

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.360
it may be engraven
upon my marble tomb,

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:32.480
"Here lieth Elizabeth

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:34.870
"which reigned a virgin

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.129
"and died a virgin."

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:47.759
(Starkey) 'But the Queen
wasn't behaving like a virgin,

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.399
'as the Spanish ambassador
insinuatingly observed.'

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.209
(Reader) "During the last few days,

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.889
"Lord Robert has come
so much into favour

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.850
"that he does whatever
he likes with affairs.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:05.360
"It is even said that Her Majesty
visits him in his chamber day and night."

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:16.959
(Starkey) 'By the end of April,
the ambassador reported

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:22.000
'that the Queen was in love with Robert
and wouldn't let him leave her side.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:26.290
'But the Queen's closeness
to Dudley disturbed her courtiers.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.199
'As a colleague,
they could put up with him.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.250
'As a potential king, he was intolerable.'

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:39.120
(Woman) I think William
was very worried about Dudley.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.519
He saw him as a huge threat

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:46.810
both to national prosperity,
if he married the Queen

00:07:46.889 --> 00:07:49.040
and also to his position at court.

00:07:49.129 --> 00:07:51.959
He was the one man
that he was fussed about.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.410
'And I suspect there was
a certain amount of jealousy.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:00.329
'He adored the Queen and there was this
guy he considered to be lightweight

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.370
'coming between him and her.

00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:04.879
'He certainly did not
want them to get married.'

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:08.600
(Starkey) 'Cecil stepped up
the pressure

00:08:08.689 --> 00:08:11.439
'for the Queen to marry
a European prince.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.689
'There was no shortage of candidates.'

00:08:14.769 --> 00:08:16.360
King Philip?

and widower of Elizabeth's sister Mary.'

Charles IX?

00:08:23.449 --> 00:08:26.480
He is 16!

00:08:26.569 --> 00:08:31.040
'Charles IX of France
Catholic and a mere sickly boy.'

00:08:32.168 --> 00:08:33.840
Charles of Austria?

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:38.570
'The Archduke Charles, the most
promising candidate but still a Catholic.'

00:08:38.649 --> 00:08:40.600
Erik of Sweden?

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.490
No...my Lord.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.408
'Elizabeth was playing hard to get

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:51.250
'for reasons that were political
as well as personal.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.090
'She'd seen the problems

00:08:53.168 --> 00:08:57.120
'created by her sister's disastrous
marriage to Philip of Spain

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:59.570
'and she was determined to avoid them.'

00:08:59.649 --> 00:09:02.840
But actually,
that was easier said than done.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.850
If she married a foreigner,

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:09.210
how could England avoid
the disastrous foreign entanglements

00:09:09.288 --> 00:09:11.240
which had led to the loss of Calais?

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:16.200
And if she married a Catholic, and
almost all her suitors were Catholics

00:09:16.288 --> 00:09:20.399
how would Protestant England
cope with a Catholic king?

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.879
And finally, and above all,

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:27.490
how could she be happy if she married
a man that she'd never seen?

00:09:28.649 --> 00:09:33.798
Sometimes she must have reflected
it was safer to follow her own inclination

00:09:33.889 --> 00:09:35.918
and not marry at all.

(# Choral anthem)

00:09:59.048 --> 00:10:03.000
'Elizabeth faced
her second major challenge.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:08.730
'She was a Protestant queen in a country
that was still officially Catholic.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:19.288
'Her sister had stamped Catholicism
on England with extraordinary violence,

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:24.038
'burning at the stake over 300
Protestant men, women and children.

Protestantism in England.

'On 20th May 1560
Thomas Watson, Bishop of Lincoln,

As well as the ex-bishops,

the surviving Catholic members
of Mary's council were also arrested.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:22.730
But Elizabeth, unlike her sister Mary,
didn't try to force them to convert.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:27.528
It wasn't her business, she said
to make windows into men's souls.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.610
Elizabeth was subtler.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.808
She insisted only on outward conformity.

00:11:32.889 --> 00:11:35.350
'They had to acknowledge
her supremacy

'and they were allowed
to celebrate Mass only privately.

'The result deprived Catholicism
of the publicity of martyrdom.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.730
'Instead, it reduced it
to something furtive,

'to be allowed, Elizabeth hoped,
slowly to wither away.

00:11:57.889 --> 00:12:01.120
'Whilst Catholicism
was forced underground,

'England's new religion
was given a bold public face.'

This is the rood screen.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.129
Rood means cross

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:26.048
and originally an image
of Christ hanging on the cross

stood in the centre of the screen

00:12:28.408 --> 00:12:32.558
with the Virgin Mary on one side
and St John on the other.

00:12:32.649 --> 00:12:35.720
Under Elizabeth
these images were torn' down

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.649
because they were seen
as being idolatrous.

They were replaced with this painted,
gigantic version of the royal arms.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:52.690
Queen Elizabeth, the arms say, is God's
direct representative here on earth.

his wife of five years' standing.

00:15:04.408 --> 00:15:06.360
The house is unusually quiet

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:11.399
because the servants have been
given the day off to attend a local fair.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.450
When they return,

00:15:13.528 --> 00:15:17.230
they find Lady Dudley's body
at the foot of the staircase

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.288
dead and with her neck broken.

00:15:30.408 --> 00:15:34.558
'Dudley's first reaction?
Fear for his reputation.

00:15:34.649 --> 00:15:36.600
'He was right to fear.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.129
'A major scandal erupts at court -

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:47.250
'Queen's favourite murders wife
to clear way to Queen's bed.

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:55.048
'Elizabeth, fearful for her reputation -

00:15:55.129 --> 00:15:58.360
'she couldn't allow
the scandal to besmirch her.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:05.288
'Reluctantly,
she banishes Dudley from court.

00:16:08.408 --> 00:16:13.759
'The inquest exonerated Dudley by
returning a verdict of accidental death.

00:16:16.168 --> 00:16:21.600
'But his enemies were confident
that his reputation was beyond repair,

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:27.048
'that he would never recover his all too
intimate relationship with the Queen.

00:16:34.889 --> 00:16:38.278
'It is October 1562.

00:16:45.048 --> 00:16:50.399
'Queen Elizabeth has lain unconscious
in a coma for the last 24 hours.

00:16:53.649 --> 00:16:56.440
'Her physicians
have diagnosed smallpox

00:16:56.528 --> 00:16:58.639
'and she's not expected to live.

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:10.868
'In a nearby room,
the Privy Council is in crisis.

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:13.048
'It is three years into the reign

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:17.210
'but Elizabeth has neither married
nor named a successor.

00:17:17.288 --> 00:17:21.400
'If she dies, there will be
a constitutional crisis

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.009
'possibly a civil war.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:29.170
'And a new threat
was waiting in the wings.

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:37.250
On 19th August 1561

00:17:37.328 --> 00:17:42.348
a tall, striking-looking woman
stepped ashore at Leith, near Edinburgh.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:48.528
It was Mary, Queen of Scots
returning to her kingdom.

00:17:48.608 --> 00:17:51.558
There was a thick sea mist that morning.

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.930
Some later saw this as an evil omen

00:17:55.009 --> 00:17:58.680
of the sorrow
the darkness and the impiety

00:17:58.769 --> 00:18:02.118
which Mary's return
was to bring to Scotland.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:10.808
'The 18-year-old Queen of Scots
had been brought up in France

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:14.328
'and she'd not seen Scotland
for 13 years.

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:17.009
'But even when
she was back in Scotland

00:18:17.088 --> 00:18:21.278
'her sights were set
on another, greater kingdom -

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:23.328
'England.

00:18:27.288 --> 00:18:30.078
'The Catholic Mary
was Elizabeth's cousin

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:33.450
'and had a very strong claim
to the English throne.

00:18:33.528 --> 00:18:36.160
'She posed a double threat to Elizabeth.

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:41.038
'Protestantism was only
recently established and still vulnerable

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:45.088
'and with Elizabeth unmarried
childless and in poor health,

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:47.848
'the succession was dangerously open.

00:18:51.048 --> 00:18:55.519
'But Elizabeth recovered
and for the moment the crisis was over.

00:18:55.608 --> 00:18:58.598
'Her first words on
regaining consciousness

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:02.240
'were to command her council
to appoint a Lord Protector

00:19:02.328 --> 00:19:04.118
'in the event of her death.

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:08.608
'His salary, she specified,
would be a staggering £20,000,

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.328
'more than was spent on the coronation.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:15.250
'The man she named was Robert Dudley.

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:28.240
'The scandal of his wife's death
had died away

00:19:28.328 --> 00:19:31.160
'and Dudley's reputation had recovered.

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:35.160
'Now he was back in favour
in spectacular style.'

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:44.170
Only three months after her illness
Elizabeth faced a fresh ordeal.

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:47.759
Parliament had been summoned
for January 1563

00:19:47.848 --> 00:19:50.598
and everybody knew
that a reluctant queen

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:55.250
would be forced once more to confront
the issue of the succession.

00:19:55.328 --> 00:19:57.838
The Parliament was opened
with a sermon

00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:59.890
preached in Westminster Abbey

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:03.009
by Alexander Nowell,
the Dean of St Paul's.

00:20:03.088 --> 00:20:08.400
And Nowell put into words
what most people only dared think.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.848
(Man) "All the Queen's
most noble ancestors

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:15.808
"have commonly had
some issue to succeed them.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:19.130
"But Her Majesty yet none.

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:26.130
"The want of your marriage and issue
is likely to prove a plague.

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:32.808
"If your parents had been of your mind,
where had you been then?

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.048
"Alack, what shall become of us?"

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:41.009
I reckon that's pretty straight talking.

00:20:41.088 --> 00:20:44.160
It was a very small part of the sermon

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:48.400
but this was almost before
a state opening of Parliament.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.848
Now I don't know if Dean Nowell
had been put up to it

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:54.930
by Elizabeth's political advisors

00:20:55.009 --> 00:20:57.880
or whether he was
just speaking for himself

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:00.538
but I do think
he was taking a bit of a risk.

00:21:00.608 --> 00:21:05.278
Nowell would not have been the first
churchman to be sent to the Tower.

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:08.328
He'd had a run-in
at St Paul's the year before

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:12.038
when he'd given
her a prayer book with pictures of saints

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.170
and she took exception to this.

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:17.720
This was a kind of idolatry
that she'd forbidden.

00:21:17.808 --> 00:21:20.558
So, he was playing with fire a bit
but, clearly,

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:25.288
he was prepared to nail his colours
to this particular mast.

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:32.048
(Starkey) 'Nowell's tough words
set the tone for Parliament.

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.608
'But again, the Queen
hedged and obfuscated.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:41.088
'For her, marriage
was simply not on the cards.

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.088
'Mary, though,
showed no such reluctance

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:52.288
'and was entertaining the suits
of several European Catholics.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:56.078
'An alliance between Scotland
and one of England's enemies

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.130
'could spell disaster.

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:02.970
'So Elizabeth requested
diplomatic talks with the Scots.

00:22:06.328 --> 00:22:11.680
'For nine days she entertained
Mary's ambassador, Sir James Melville.'

00:22:14.608 --> 00:22:19.440
(Melville) "She desired to know whether
my queen's hair or hers was best

00:22:19.528 --> 00:22:22.160
"and which of the two was fairest.

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:25.078
"I said she was
the fairest queen in England

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:28.048
"and mine the fairest queen in Scotland.

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:31.410
"She inquired which of them
was of highest stature.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:36.618
"I said, 'My queen.'
"'Then she is too high,' sayeth she,

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:41.130
"'for I, myself, am neither
too high nor too low.'"

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:45.838
(Starkey) 'There was a final round
in this game of diplomacy.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:50.880
'Elizabeth offered an English candidate
for the hand of the Queen of Scots -

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.730
'Lord Robert Dudley.'

00:22:55.608 --> 00:22:59.230
(Melville) "Her Majesty called him
her brother and best friend

00:22:59.328 --> 00:23:01.278
"whom she could have married

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.250
"had she ever minded
to have taken a husband.

00:23:04.328 --> 00:23:07.720
"But being determined
to end her life in virginity,

00:23:07.808 --> 00:23:10.798
"she wished that the Queen
her sister might marry him."

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:16.450
(Starkey) 'But did Elizabeth
really intend to give the man she'd loved

00:23:16.528 --> 00:23:18.078
'to Mary, Queen of Scots?'

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:23.038
Robert Dudley, who should have known,
took her intentions seriously enough

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.930
to do everything he could
to scupper the scheme.

00:23:26.009 --> 00:23:29.038
But there was a lot
to be said for it politically.

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:31.848
It would have solved
the problem of Dudley.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.400
He wouldn't have become
king of England

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:37.528
but he would have become
king as consort of Mary.

00:23:37.608 --> 00:23:40.278
And it would've solved
the problem of Mary.

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:43.288
She'd have been safely married
to an Englishman

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:45.970
and away from a foreigner
and the alliance

00:23:46.048 --> 00:23:49.798
that the English so feared
for their northern neighbour.

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:53.568
And it would have solved
the problem of the succession -

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:58.210
any children would be recognised
as heirs to the English throne.

00:23:58.288 --> 00:24:00.278
But the scheme did fail.

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:02.170
Not because of Elizabeth

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:05.759
but because of Mary's contempt
for the man that she called

00:24:05.848 --> 00:24:07.798
"Elizabeth's horse keeper".

00:24:12.808 --> 00:24:15.720
'Mary had her own ideas about love.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.250
'Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley,

00:24:20.328 --> 00:24:24.440
'was 18, tall, handsome
and a fine lute player.

00:24:25.568 --> 00:24:30.558
'Mary described him as the lustiest
and best proportioned long lad

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.930
'she had ever seen.

00:24:34.009 --> 00:24:36.160
'When he fell ill, she nursed him.

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:41.200
'They fell in love.

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:47.200
'It was a whirlwind romance

00:24:47.288 --> 00:24:52.598
'and four months later, in the Chapel
Royal at Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh,

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.690
'they were married.'

00:24:54.769 --> 00:24:56.598
(Bells tolling)

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:59.450
'The effect on Elizabeth was dramatic.

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:07.759
'Within a few days,
it was reported that she and Robert

00:25:07.848 --> 00:25:10.150
'had become inseparable again.

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:13.400
'If the young Queen of Scots
could marry for love,

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:16.568
'why couldn't England's queen
do the same?

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:23.250
'But the return of the rumour of marriage
brought new and fierce resistance.

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:29.890
'The Duke of Norfolk
the most powerful noble in the land,

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:32.490
'was the Queen's closet male relative

00:25:32.568 --> 00:25:35.920
'and was bitterly opposed
to the prospective match.

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:42.210
'Norfolk had always resented
the rise to power of the upstart Dudley.

00:25:42.288 --> 00:25:46.920
'A resentment intensified
by his own failure to gain high office.

00:25:47.009 --> 00:25:50.358
'He became the focus
of the anti-Dudley camp.

00:25:53.769 --> 00:25:56.118
'Their rivalry split the court.

00:25:58.848 --> 00:26:02.078
'Dudley's side took to
wearing purple ribbons...

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:05.410
'and Norfolk's, yellow.

00:26:07.568 --> 00:26:12.880
'The two factions roamed
the corridors of power, armed and angry.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:21.048
'The Queen intervened
to slap both sides down.

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:26.160
'When Dudley objected to the Queen's
flirtation with a young, pretty courtier,

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:31.519
'she lashed him with her tongue
loud enough for the whole court to hear.'

00:26:31.608 --> 00:26:36.400
"I will have here
but one mistress and no master."

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:42.808
(Starkey) 'Norfolk,
too, found himself in disgrace.

'At a Privy Council meeting,

00:26:44.848 --> 00:26:48.470
'he raised the matter
of marriage and the succession.

00:26:48.568 --> 00:26:51.318
'She flew into a rage, calling him a traitor

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:54.210
'and adding that
she would not name a successor

00:26:54.288 --> 00:26:57.118
'as she had no wish to be "buried alive".

00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:01.450
'For good measure, she also threatened
to have the Duke arrested.

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:08.690
'But her tough words
could not resolve the tensions at court.

00:27:08.769 --> 00:27:14.558
'Behind the bickering
lay the real problem - the succession.

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:17.930
'Until Elizabeth married
and produced an heir,

00:27:18.009 --> 00:27:20.358
'the crisis would never go away.

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:33.450
'While Elizabeth fought
to hold the men of her court together,

00:27:33.528 --> 00:27:35.558
'Mary enjoyed a female triumph.

'On 19th June 1566 in a tiny room
in the castle at Edinburgh,

'She had a child.'

Her labour was long and hard

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:03.288
but the baby was healthy
and it was a boy.

They christened him James.

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:11.930
Scotland now had an heir
and Mary, Queen of Scots a son.

When the English ambassador
saw the baby a few days later

00:28:17.608 --> 00:28:22.240
he reported that he was
likely to prove a goodly prince.

'The news was
far from goodly for Elizabeth.

'The initial euphoria
of marriage had faded

A group of Protestant
Scottish lords also hated Rizzio

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:30.130
because he was a Catholic
and the Queen's favourite.

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:33.608
So the two groups of Rizzio's enemies
came together

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.078
and signed a contract to murder him.

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.848
On the night of 9th March 1566

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:44.328
the conspirators burst in here,
the Queen's smallest chamber

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:48.650
where they found Rizzio
having a tête-à-tête with the Queen.

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:52.210
He was dragged outside
and stabbed 57 times.

00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:59.730
The conspirators thoughtfully
left Darnley's dagger

00:29:59.808 --> 00:30:02.368
sticking in Rizzio's belly.

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:08.009
'Less than a year later,
Darnley himself was dead.

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:13.368
'The house where he was staying
was blown up.

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:16.528
'Darnley was found
strangled in the orchard.'

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:22.088
Everything suggested
that the man responsible for the crime

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:24.690
was James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell,

00:30:24.769 --> 00:30:27.480
who was one of
Mary's leading supporters.

00:30:27.568 --> 00:30:32.118
Still worse, the finger of suspicion
also pointed at Mary herself.

00:30:34.528 --> 00:30:36.990
'And, as Elizabeth told her bluntly,

00:30:37.088 --> 00:30:40.680
'her behaviour was making
a bad situation worse.'

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:46.170
"Madam, my ears
have been so astounded

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:48.078
"and my heart so frightened

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:53.650
"to hear of the horrible murder of
your former husband, our mutual cousin,

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:56.250
"that I have scarcely spirit to write.

00:30:56.328 --> 00:31:01.118
"Yet I cannot conceal
that I grieve more for you than for him."

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.650
(Starkey) 'But there was still
worse to come.

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:12.930
'Mary was abducted,
taken by force to Dunbar and raped.

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:18.490
'The perpetrator was James Hepburn,
the Earl of Bothwell.

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:23.000
'Two weeks later, they were married.'

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:35.088
"Madam, how could a worse choice
be made for your honour

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:41.608
"than in such haste to marry a subject
who, besides other notorious lacks

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:46.450
"public fame has charged with
the murder of your late husband?"

00:31:48.088 --> 00:31:52.480
(Starkey) 'Within a few weeks,
Mary paid a terrible price for her folly.

00:31:52.568 --> 00:31:55.130
'A large party of the Scottish nobility

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:58.368
rose up in arms
against their scandalous queen.

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:03.720
'The two sides joined in battle

00:32:03.808 --> 00:32:07.588
'but Mary's troops melted away
without striking a blow.

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:11.930
'Even her husband Bothwell
negotiated a safe conduct for himself

00:32:12.009 --> 00:32:13.960
'from the field of battle.

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:18.798
'Mary was defeated and abandoned.

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:32.088
'Mary was brought as a prisoner here,

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:36.328
'to the island fortress of Lochleven
where she miscarried of twins.'

00:32:38.328 --> 00:32:44.640
Then, broken in body and mind, under
the immediate threat of physical force,

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:49.730
she was compelled to abdicate
in favour of her one-year-old son James.

00:32:49.808 --> 00:32:51.759
She was never to see him again.

00:32:55.009 --> 00:32:59.358
'Mary had married unwisely,
for love and for lust

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:05.528
'and as a consequence she had lost
her crown, her son and her liberty.

00:33:05.608 --> 00:33:11.078
'Perhaps after all there was wisdom
in living and ruling alone.'

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:27.088
(Elizabeth) "To be led from the place
of arraignment to the Tower of London

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:29.608
"and thence to the gallows at Tyburn.

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:38.210
"And there to be hanged
and being half-dead

00:33:38.288 --> 00:33:41.440
"to be cut down and the bowels
to be taken out of the belly

00:33:41.528 --> 00:33:43.480
"and thrown into the fire.

00:33:48.608 --> 00:33:50.558
"And the head to be cut off

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:53.730
"and the body to be divided
into four parts

00:33:53.808 --> 00:33:58.519
"and the head and four quarters to be
set up and disposed at our pleasure.

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:04.130
"Which manner of execution
is due to every person

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:06.450
"that committeth treason.

00:34:06.528 --> 00:34:10.559
"Given under our signet
at our palace of Westminster,

00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:12.599
"Elizabeth R."

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:18.840
'For the Tudors
treason was the worst of crimes

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:21.570
'which deserved
the worst of punishments.'

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:24.880
Elizabeth had personal experience
of its terrors

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:29.530
because she'd been imprisoned in the
Tower on charges of treason herself.

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:33.480
When she became queen she hoped
that the moderation of her rule

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:38.079
would make treason and its
terrible penalties a forgotten memory.

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:41.760
But a decade after her accession
these hopes were fading.

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:45.329
Catholicism hadn't
withered away as she'd hoped.

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:49.969
The nobility were no longer content
simply with honour and dignity.

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:52.639
Instead, some of them wanted real power

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:55.559
which Elizabeth
was reluctant to give them.

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:58.760
And above all
there were the unsolved questions

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:01.130
of the succession and her marriage.

00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:05.518
It was a combustible mixture
that needed only a spark to set it alight.

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:12.090
'In May 1568 Mary escaped
from her island prison.

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:18.920
'Thousands of troops
flocked to join her standard.

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:24.170
'But once again
she was defeated in battle.

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:27.409
'This time the defeat was final.

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:36.599
'She escaped from the field of battle
but she was now alone and desperate.

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:38.679
'She fled to the only place

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:42.849
'that might offer her safety, protection
and even support -

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:46.768
'England.

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:52.429
'Elizabeth dispatched
one of her councillors to Carlisle

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:57.079
'to convey Mary to a place of refuge
and to treat her with all honour

00:35:57.170 --> 00:35:59.518
'as befitted her status as a queen.

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:03.920
'In reality, she was a prisoner.

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:10.119
'Mary's arrival in England
was a disaster for Elizabeth.

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:13.989
'Until now, the Queen had kept
Catholicism under control.

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:19.960
'But Mary gave English Catholics,
especially those in the north,

00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:24.000
'a figurehead round whom
they could rally and even rebel.

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:29.889
'The north of England
had been the scene

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:32.929
'of the biggest rebellion
against Henry VIII.

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:35.719
'Now insurrection was brewing again.

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:38.768
'The population
had remained largely Catholic

00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:44.010
'and felt little loyalty to the
Protestant Queen far away in London.

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:48.559
'The northern earls were Catholic too.

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:51.400
'They had been prepared
to put up with Elizabeth

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:53.449
'providing she left them alone.

00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:58.389
'But slowly, the government was
nibbling away at their independence.

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:03.719
'The earls looked to Norfolk
for leadership.

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:06.250
'Norfolk was not a natural rebel

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:11.460
'but he too was aggrieved
and disaffected - ripe for rebellion.'

00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:19.559
In June 1568 Mary's envoy
approached the Duke of Norfolk

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:21.949
with an extraordinary suggestion.

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:26.559
He proposed the Duke should
marry Mary, Queen of Scots

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:28.679
and retake Scotland.

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:31.809
Norfolk would then
exchange a ducal coronet

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:33.889
for the Royal Crown of Scotland

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:38.489
whilst their children would be
the natural heirs of England also.

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:41.159
Attractive but dangerous.

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:44.800
Norfolk had in his pocket
a commission from Elizabeth

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:49.369
which said that anybody marrying Mary
would be adjudged a traitor.

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:52.730
And Norfolk himself
was convinced of Mary's guilt

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:55.570
as a murderer and an adulterer.

00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:58.360
But ambition brings strange bedfellows.

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:04.369
'Rumours of this dangerous
conversation reached Elizabeth

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:06.889
'and she summoned Norfolk to court.

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:11.289
'But her cousin denied the charge.

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:14.449
'She gave him two more chances
to come clean.

00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:16.679
'Twice more came denial.

00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:22.369
'His denials roused her suspicions.

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:25.690
'This was more than
just a covert marriage plan,

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:29.130
'it was a plot to overthrow her.

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:38.679
'Norfolk suddenly left
the Queen's summer progress

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:42.690
'and returned here to the Charrterhouse
his London residence.'

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:44.570
He agreed to join in a plot

00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:48.190
hatched by the Earls of Westmoreland
and Northumberland.

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:52.079
The earls would raise the north
liberate Mary, Queen of Scots

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:54.730
and bring about her marriage to Norfolk.

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:59.090
All the north, Northumberland boasted
would rebel at his command.

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:10.039
'Thomas Percy,
the Earl of Northumberland

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:12.559
'had his own reasons for rebellion.

00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:19.880
'It was partly about religion - the Percys
had remained staunchly Catholic -

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:22.170
'but at heart it was about power.

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:27.090
'Northumberland thought
he had a right to share in power.

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:30.679
'Elizabeth was prepared
to share power with no one.'

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:36.409
Thomas was really driven
to rebellion by Elizabeth

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:38.800
and Cecil in particular.

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:42.849
Cecil didn't like the power
of the Percys in the north.

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:45.768
The fact that they were Catholic as well -

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:49.170
and a lot of the people
in this area were Catholic -

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:52.250
meant that there was
a power base in the north,

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:55.768
close to Scotland
close to Mary, Queen of Scots

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:59.050
that presented
a serious problem to the crown.

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:02.690
Thomas could have had an easy life.

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:05.929
He was wealthy enough
to maintain his life

00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:08.119
he loved country pursuits,

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:12.880
he had a wonderful wife
he had four beautiful children.

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:15.250
He risked everything, basically.

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:24.650
(Starkey) 'But the risk
was too much for Norfolk.

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:29.320
'He wrote to Northumberland
begging him to cancel the rising.

00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:31.369
'But it was too late.

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:37.489
'Midnight on November 9th 1569.

00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:41.920
'Churches all over the north
rang their bells backwards.

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:45.239
'It was a signal for the rebellion to begin.'

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:15.909
On 10th November
the rebel earls entered Durham

00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:19.400
and broke open the doors
of this great cathedral.

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:23.570
And here they performed
an act of calculated defiance -

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:27.840
they tore up and burned
the Protestant bibles and prayer books,

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:29.889
the symbols of the new religion.

00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:33.090
And they celebrated
the central mystery of the old

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:35.159
by attending a Catholic Mass.

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:39.849
They had crosses on their armour and
they carried the badge and the banner

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:42.090
of the five wounds of Christ.

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:45.869
It looked like a holy war, a crusade.

00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:59.369
'The loss of Durham was a catastrophe.

00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:03.809
'The city was a fortress
to stop an invasion from Scotland.

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:08.920
'Now it had fallen to the rebels
and could be turned against the Queen.

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:17.320
'Elizabeth was paying a heavy price for
her mishandling of the northern earls.

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:20.690
'By bullying them,
like her father at his worst

00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:23.130
'she had pushed them over the edge.

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:31.630
'Their goal was obvious -
to rescue Mary from captivity.

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:50.239
'Mary was imprisoned
at Tutbury in Staffordshire.

00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:55.050
'If they managed to reach her,
they would hold not only half of England,

00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:57.880
'they would have an alternative queen.

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:03.559
'Elizabeth acted decisively.

00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:07.268
'She had her cousin moved
further south to Coventry,

00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:11.768
'well inside the Protestant heartland
and beyond the rebels' reach.

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:15.889
'She also ordered the rapid deployment
of an armed force to the north

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:17.929
'to intercept the marauders.

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:22.719
'The rebel earls had advanced
south confidently,

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:25.849
'expecting that other
noblemen would join them.'

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:31.409
So when they heard that the southern
lords were marching against them

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:35.969
with royal troops in overwhelming
numbers, they were taken off guard.

00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:39.559
They decided to retreat
to fight on their own territory.

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:43.349
But the retreat knocked the stuffing
out of the rebellion

00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:48.289
their troops melted away
and the earls fled towards Scotland.

00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:50.610
Elizabeth was exultant.

00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:55.480
By behaving like her father
she'd helped to provoke the rebellion.

00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:57.518
Now she actually outdid him

00:43:57.610 --> 00:44:00.960
in the savagery with which
