00:00:04.236 --> 00:00:07.607
- Aloha, aloha, aloha,
my friends!

00:00:07.607 --> 00:00:08.841 align:start size:47% position:53%
Hey, what's up?

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:10.109
- What's going on?
- Here you go.

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:11.343 size:88% position:56%
I got you some boogie boards

00:00:11.343 --> 00:00:12.678 align:start size:69% position:31%
as sort of a thank-you

00:00:12.678 --> 00:00:14.447 align:end position:100%
for coming all this way
to do "House Party."

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:16.983 align:end position:100%
I really appreciate it.
Mahalo.

00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:18.584 align:start position:0%
- Thanks.
Uh, I don't really boogie.

00:00:18.584 --> 00:00:21.220
Uh, but thanks
for buying us these gifts.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.189 align:end position:100%
- Oh, no, I--
I didn't buy them.

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.757 align:end position:100%
They call me
a cheap bastard.

00:00:24.757 --> 00:00:26.859 align:end position:100%
I'm regifting them
because a magical tree elf

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:28.428 align:start size:69% position:31%
gave them to me, so...

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:30.162
- A magical tree elf?
- Mm-hmm.

00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:31.764
- I think there's a mix-up.

00:00:31.764 --> 00:00:35.234
You only rented us one room,
and it's three of us.

00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:37.903 align:end position:100%
- I don't have
the mental capacity

00:00:37.903 --> 00:00:40.173 align:start size:81% position:19%
to deal with your problems

00:00:40.173 --> 00:00:42.475 align:end position:100%
and also kick it
with this

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:45.544 align:end position:100%
very beautiful,
magical tree elf

00:00:45.544 --> 00:00:47.046 align:end position:100%
that I'm kicking it
with right now.

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:48.681 align:start size:28% position:72%
She is...

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:50.383 align:start size:25% position:75%
Bla-dow!

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:51.450 align:end position:100%
- Really?
Like, for real?

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.019 align:start size:66% position:34%
'Cause I would like--

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:54.287
I would love to see her,
if I could.

00:00:54.287 --> 00:00:56.389
Like, you could take me
to the tree.

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:58.925 align:end position:100%
- And, Leonard,
I wish you could,

00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:01.461 size:88% position:56%
but I'm not sure if you can.

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:02.261
- Why?

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:03.296 align:start size:56% position:44%
- Because you need

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:04.430 size:88% position:56%
to possess a childlike mind,

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.999 size:84% position:58%
which luckily I do possess,

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:08.434 align:end position:100%
mostly because I read
at a middle school level.

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:11.371 align:end position:100%
Have you ever read
"James and the Giant Peach"?

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:13.305
- The only peach I like
is cobbler.

00:01:13.305 --> 00:01:14.473 align:end position:100%
- Don't worry
about giant peaches.

00:01:14.473 --> 00:01:16.042 align:start size:81% position:19%
Just worry about your set,

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:20.446 align:end position:100%
and enjoy your stay
at Turtle Bay!

00:01:20.446 --> 00:01:23.182 align:end position:100%
Like "Jurassic Park,"
but I said "Turtle Bay"!
