00:00:00.486 --> 00:00:03.482
- It has a very strong meaty aroma to it.

00:00:03.482 --> 00:00:06.899
Almost like, it almost smells like liver.

00:00:07.848 --> 00:00:10.515
Rub that in the sauce.

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.302
(upbeat music)

00:00:17.396 --> 00:00:18.723
Good morning everyone,

00:00:18.723 --> 00:00:22.185
it's Mark Wiens with
migrationology.com in Rome, Italy.

00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:24.888
We had a quick breakfast at the hotel.

00:00:24.888 --> 00:00:26.584
Ying is already taking a nap.

00:00:26.584 --> 00:00:27.829
(laughing)

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.297
We're all packed up and
we are checking out.

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:33.412
We're gonna walk over to the metro,

00:00:33.412 --> 00:00:36.568
take the metro to Termini station.

00:00:36.568 --> 00:00:39.714
Then we're gonna take
the bus to the airport

00:00:39.714 --> 00:00:42.684
and today we are flying
to Stockholm, Sweden.

00:00:42.684 --> 00:00:45.434
(peaceful music)

00:00:49.404 --> 00:00:51.797
Thank you to the Marriott Grand Flora here

00:00:51.797 --> 00:00:54.116
in Rome for hosting us.

00:00:54.116 --> 00:00:57.134
This was a very short, short trip to Rome.

00:00:57.134 --> 00:01:00.536
It barely even a taste of what Rome

00:01:00.536 --> 00:01:02.536
and of course what Italy has to offer.

00:01:02.536 --> 00:01:05.371
But it has definitely wet my appetite

00:01:05.371 --> 00:01:08.443
and I am really hoping
to come back to Italy

00:01:08.443 --> 00:01:11.762
in the future to travel to
many of the other regions

00:01:11.762 --> 00:01:13.963
in Italy for the food.

00:01:13.963 --> 00:01:16.102
But that was a really good short trip.

00:01:16.102 --> 00:01:18.685
(upbeat music)

00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:35.596
That just took about 15 minutes.

00:01:35.596 --> 00:01:38.672
We have arrived to Roma Termini Station

00:01:38.672 --> 00:01:42.208
and the buses, actually
they're exactly where we got

00:01:42.208 --> 00:01:44.154
off the bus when we came from the airport.

00:01:44.154 --> 00:01:47.238
It's kind of on the
side of Termini station.

00:01:47.238 --> 00:01:50.147
(upbeat music)

00:01:50.147 --> 00:01:54.230
- (speaking in foreign language)

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:04.150
You just kind of choose the
bus that leaves the quickest

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.192
and so we got on a bus,
put our bag downstairs.

00:02:07.192 --> 00:02:09.722
You buy the ticket right
before you get on the bus.

00:02:09.722 --> 00:02:13.779
It cost four Euros and our
bus leaves in about 15 minutes

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:15.798
to the airport.

00:02:15.798 --> 00:02:18.381
(upbeat music)

00:02:35.723 --> 00:02:38.427
That's the check in for the other airline.

00:02:38.427 --> 00:02:42.359
We got checked in to our flight
but it was complete chaos.

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.444
We're flying with SAS but they have been

00:02:44.444 --> 00:02:47.196
kind of completely unhelpful,
not really helpful at all.

00:02:47.196 --> 00:02:49.982
She put a tag on our bag but

00:02:49.982 --> 00:02:52.728
then said to bring it to the elevator

00:02:52.728 --> 00:02:54.867
and then just continued talking

00:02:54.867 --> 00:02:57.357
and didn't tell us any information.

00:02:57.357 --> 00:03:00.638
Finally, after standing in the
wrong line a number of times,

00:03:00.638 --> 00:03:03.888
we finally got our bag to the elevator,

00:03:06.066 --> 00:03:07.458
and I don't know where our bag went,

00:03:07.458 --> 00:03:09.316
and now we are trying to
get through immigration

00:03:09.316 --> 00:03:11.733
but it's just out of control.

00:03:16.593 --> 00:03:18.723
This is just extremely hectic.

00:03:18.723 --> 00:03:21.540
Basically everything that
can go wrong is going wrong

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.879
and so we got to our gate

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.889
and now they've changed our gate

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.912
somewhere like kind of far away,

00:03:27.912 --> 00:03:30.314
so we're going to our gate now.

00:03:30.314 --> 00:03:32.463
This is such a disorganized airport

00:03:32.463 --> 00:03:34.005
and everyone's just running around

00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:35.650
like they don't know what they're doing,

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.967
including us (laughs).

00:03:38.967 --> 00:03:40.021
- [Flight Attendant] Welcome aboard,

00:03:40.021 --> 00:03:41.290
when you have found your seat.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.657
- This is gonna be about
a three hour flight

00:03:43.657 --> 00:03:45.157
from Rome to Stockholm.

00:03:45.157 --> 00:03:47.907
(peaceful music)

00:03:52.634 --> 00:03:54.568
We sat in the plane for about an hour

00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:56.497
before we took off.

00:03:56.497 --> 00:03:59.317
I guess the airport was
really backed up with planes,

00:03:59.317 --> 00:04:00.997
but we are now in the air

00:04:00.997 --> 00:04:03.087
and it is time for lunch.

00:04:03.087 --> 00:04:05.594
This is quite the fusion, little lunchbox.

00:04:05.594 --> 00:04:07.669
Sesame chicken with apple kimchi,

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.086
black rice, and ginger creme.

00:04:11.791 --> 00:04:14.138
Oh and then it does say
taste of Scandinavia inspired

00:04:14.138 --> 00:04:16.551
by the world.

00:04:16.551 --> 00:04:18.718
Got the lid.

00:04:20.685 --> 00:04:23.334
Open my utensils.

00:04:23.334 --> 00:04:25.751
I'll begin with this chicken.

00:04:31.568 --> 00:04:33.397
Oh that's pretty cold.

00:04:33.397 --> 00:04:35.125
I'm not sure what this is.

00:04:35.125 --> 00:04:37.304
It's like, oh I think that's the creme.

00:04:37.304 --> 00:04:40.814
And then a lot of salad down here.

00:04:40.814 --> 00:04:43.314
Oh and that's mixed with rice.

00:04:51.044 --> 00:04:54.107
That's like the consistency
of whipped cream

00:04:54.107 --> 00:04:57.440
but it kind of tastes like cream cheese.

00:04:58.353 --> 00:04:59.983
It's like a whipped cream cheese,

00:04:59.983 --> 00:05:02.508
is what it tastes like to me.

00:05:02.508 --> 00:05:03.734
And then I'm not sure,

00:05:03.734 --> 00:05:04.899
I guess that's all salad.

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:08.061
Salad mixed with rice, maybe cabbage.

00:05:08.061 --> 00:05:11.144
Mmm, it is actually quite refreshing.

00:05:12.628 --> 00:05:14.874
It does taste kind of good

00:05:14.874 --> 00:05:17.207
but I am also really hungry.

00:05:28.243 --> 00:05:30.688
That is oddly quite refreshing.

00:05:30.688 --> 00:05:33.271
(upbeat music)

00:05:42.068 --> 00:05:43.681
With the exception of being awake

00:05:43.681 --> 00:05:46.493
for a few minutes to eat that small lunch,

00:05:46.493 --> 00:05:50.813
I basically just dozed off
and slept the entire flight.

00:05:50.813 --> 00:05:52.579
Welcome to Sweden.

00:05:52.579 --> 00:05:55.746
This is my very first time to be here.

00:05:57.638 --> 00:05:59.174
We have decided to take the bus,

00:05:59.174 --> 00:06:01.570
which will take us very
close to where the hotel is

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.197
but there is also a train option

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:05.990
and lots of bus options to get

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.073
from the airport to Stockholm center.

00:06:11.373 --> 00:06:12.678
Will you pass to Fridhelmspan?

00:06:12.678 --> 00:06:13.624
- Yes.

00:06:13.624 --> 00:06:15.400
- Okay, can we buy tickets on this?

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.109
- Love your videos man.

00:06:17.109 --> 00:06:20.800
- Oh thank you. Alex,
hi, nice to meet you.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.967
- [Ying] Nice to meet you.

00:06:27.683 --> 00:06:30.014
Right as you exit from the terminal

00:06:30.014 --> 00:06:31.389
there are a bunch of buses

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:33.406
and they all go to
different parts of the city.

00:06:33.406 --> 00:06:36.500
We are going to an area
that's called Fridhemsplan

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.402
which is, I think it's
pretty close to the center,

00:06:40.402 --> 00:06:42.558
but this bus will go directly there.

00:06:42.558 --> 00:06:45.058
(funky music)

00:06:59.793 --> 00:07:02.062
That bus ride took just about 30 minutes

00:07:02.062 --> 00:07:05.812
and we are at a bus stop
called Fridhemsplan.

00:07:06.896 --> 00:07:09.265
I think I was pronouncing
that wrong earlier.

00:07:09.265 --> 00:07:10.348
Fridhemsplan.

00:07:11.867 --> 00:07:13.393
I think that's how you say it

00:07:13.393 --> 00:07:14.808
and our hotel, we are staying

00:07:14.808 --> 00:07:17.456
at the Courtyard Marriott in Stockholm,

00:07:17.456 --> 00:07:19.403
should be about a five
minute walk from here

00:07:19.403 --> 00:07:22.822
if I can figure out how to get there.

00:07:22.822 --> 00:07:24.091
Let me check the map.

00:07:24.091 --> 00:07:25.341
Oh here we are.

00:07:26.772 --> 00:07:28.811
I think we need to just
keep on going straight.

00:07:28.811 --> 00:07:30.636
Stockholm is a really nice city.

00:07:30.636 --> 00:07:34.224
It's so clean and also it
looks so well-functioning,

00:07:34.224 --> 00:07:36.807
and also it's so green as well.

00:07:39.641 --> 00:07:41.889
- I just gonna stop my car,
I wanna take a picture.

00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:42.722
- [Mark] Yes, definitely.

00:07:42.722 --> 00:07:43.555
- I love you!

00:07:43.555 --> 00:07:44.388
- Definitely, nice to meet you.

00:07:44.388 --> 00:07:46.054
- I'm gonna stop here.
- Yes, sure.

00:07:46.054 --> 00:07:47.097
- I watch you all day.

00:07:47.097 --> 00:07:48.460
- [Mark] Thank you.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.431
- [Ying] Hello, nice to meet you.

00:07:50.431 --> 00:07:52.822
- Shout out to Danny. Nice to meet you.

00:07:52.822 --> 00:07:55.655
And we're almost to our hotel now.

00:07:59.197 --> 00:08:02.110
Yeah, service is great. Friendly.

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:05.333
Everything in Sweden is so spacious.

00:08:05.333 --> 00:08:07.166
There's so much space.

00:08:08.954 --> 00:08:12.146
An awesome start already
to our time in Stockholm.

00:08:12.146 --> 00:08:13.974
We checked into the hotel.

00:08:13.974 --> 00:08:15.707
Dominica was very nice

00:08:15.707 --> 00:08:18.282
and we got all these welcome snacks.

00:08:18.282 --> 00:08:19.688
They gave us all these welcome snacks.

00:08:19.688 --> 00:08:21.369
This is a bag of potato chips

00:08:21.369 --> 00:08:22.597
and Ying and I are so hungry.

00:08:22.597 --> 00:08:26.038
We haven't really eaten much today.

00:08:26.038 --> 00:08:27.893
(chips crunching)

00:08:27.893 --> 00:08:30.738
Oh yeah, those are
really good potato chips.

00:08:30.738 --> 00:08:32.405
Nice, spacious room.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:38.415
I think everything is
spacious in Stockholm so far.

00:08:38.415 --> 00:08:40.918
Check out our view,
we're on the 11th floor.

00:08:40.918 --> 00:08:43.418
(funky music)

00:08:47.144 --> 00:08:50.243
And then over here into the bathroom.

00:08:50.243 --> 00:08:54.411
Oh, I will be needing this
coffeemaker pretty soon

00:08:54.411 --> 00:08:55.902
or immediately.

00:08:55.902 --> 00:08:57.485
And then, bathroom.

00:09:02.127 --> 00:09:06.012
It's so spacious (laughs).

00:09:06.012 --> 00:09:09.318
They got us a bottle of
wine, a bag of fruit,

00:09:09.318 --> 00:09:13.428
some macaroons, and I'm gonna
try the next bag of chips,

00:09:13.428 --> 00:09:16.761
some Swedish sour cream and onion chips.

00:09:24.774 --> 00:09:26.977
Oh yeah, sour cream and onion.

00:09:26.977 --> 00:09:29.710
One of the best flavors of potato chips.

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:32.543
(chips crunching)

00:09:34.431 --> 00:09:37.264
Yeah, I'm really hungry right now.

00:09:39.476 --> 00:09:41.226
Sweden is so stylish.

00:09:47.072 --> 00:09:48.844
(coffee brewing)

00:09:48.844 --> 00:09:50.550
- [Ying] Is this okay?

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.963
- Thanks to Ying, she finally figured

00:09:52.963 --> 00:09:55.796
out how to use the coffee machine.

00:09:59.268 --> 00:10:00.819
I need that espresso.

00:10:00.819 --> 00:10:03.234
And we are really, really hungry

00:10:03.234 --> 00:10:04.274
as I've already mentioned,

00:10:04.274 --> 00:10:06.711
so we're gonna go out to eat now.

00:10:06.711 --> 00:10:09.211
(funky music)

00:10:16.369 --> 00:10:18.286
(beep)

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:26.212
We are walking back to the
metro stop Fridhemsplan

00:10:26.212 --> 00:10:29.736
and we are gonna take the
metro to a restaurant.

00:10:29.736 --> 00:10:32.445
I thought for dinner tonight we would go

00:10:32.445 --> 00:10:33.630
to a restaurant called Pelikan.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:36.663
It's a little ways away but a
couple of you recommended it

00:10:36.663 --> 00:10:38.754
for awesome Swedish food

00:10:38.754 --> 00:10:41.198
and for classic home style Swedish food,

00:10:41.198 --> 00:10:43.097
so I thought this would
be a fantastic idea

00:10:43.097 --> 00:10:45.865
and a great first meal in Stockholm.

00:10:45.865 --> 00:10:49.615
So that's where we're
heading now for dinner.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:55.375
We're gonna take the green
line all the way to Skanstull.

00:10:55.375 --> 00:10:57.712
So we ended up, we're at the metro now.

00:10:57.712 --> 00:11:00.795
We bought the access card and the man

00:11:01.654 --> 00:11:04.843
at the information desk was
really nice and friendly.

00:11:04.843 --> 00:11:07.892
He said we could just
buy one of these cards

00:11:07.892 --> 00:11:10.649
for both Ying and I and then we just have

00:11:10.649 --> 00:11:14.366
to go take the metro on a group access

00:11:14.366 --> 00:11:17.449
and then we put six rides on the card

00:11:18.593 --> 00:11:21.890
and I think it's 20 per person per ride

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.640
if I heard correctly.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.180
(funky music)

00:11:34.449 --> 00:11:37.382
We just got off the metro
at Skanstull station

00:11:37.382 --> 00:11:39.700
and now walking over to the restaurant.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.256
The weather here is amazing.

00:11:41.256 --> 00:11:44.923
It's very cool, I could
almost use a jacket.

00:11:48.488 --> 00:11:51.738
Roasted reindeer and pelikan meatballs.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.806
This is an awesomely
classic heritage restaurant

00:11:58.806 --> 00:12:00.028
and on the menu it says

00:12:00.028 --> 00:12:04.347
that they've been serving
Swedish cuisine since 1733.

00:12:04.347 --> 00:12:07.196
How long at this location?

00:12:07.196 --> 00:12:10.535
- From 1962, but this
one has been restaurant

00:12:10.535 --> 00:12:13.331
from the beginning from 1904.

00:12:13.331 --> 00:12:14.170
- Oh, okay.

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:15.809
This restaurant, Pelikan restaurant,

00:12:15.809 --> 00:12:17.492
they've been serving food since 1733

00:12:17.492 --> 00:12:19.273
but they've changed a number of locations.

00:12:19.273 --> 00:12:21.035
They started off in the middle of the city

00:12:21.035 --> 00:12:23.382
and then in the middle of the 1900s,

00:12:23.382 --> 00:12:25.453
sometime, they moved to this location.

00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:29.268
This location, though, has
been a restaurant since 1904

00:12:29.268 --> 00:12:32.944
and I don't think much
has changed since then.

00:12:32.944 --> 00:12:36.137
This is beautiful, everything
from the tiles on the floor

00:12:36.137 --> 00:12:39.180
to the tables and the chairs.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:40.616
The chair that I'm sitting on,

00:12:40.616 --> 00:12:43.085
these arm rests are wonderful.

00:12:43.085 --> 00:12:46.396
And then it just has a really high ceiling

00:12:46.396 --> 00:12:49.381
and it almost has like an open hall,

00:12:49.381 --> 00:12:52.427
kind of cafeteria feel to it.

00:12:52.427 --> 00:12:54.427
But retro and authentic.

00:12:59.407 --> 00:13:01.188
I'm gonna start with a cracker.

00:13:01.188 --> 00:13:03.021
Is it butter?

00:13:05.249 --> 00:13:08.332
Spread a good dose of this onto that.

00:13:12.747 --> 00:13:13.914
Mmm.

00:13:17.133 --> 00:13:18.882
Wonderful cracker.

00:13:18.882 --> 00:13:21.299
It's like grainy and starchy.

00:13:23.358 --> 00:13:24.742
The starter has arrived

00:13:24.742 --> 00:13:27.499
and I saw it on the menu
and I just had to go for it.

00:13:27.499 --> 00:13:30.269
Steak tartare, the minced
meat is on the bottom.

00:13:30.269 --> 00:13:32.221
The raw minced meat, an egg,

00:13:32.221 --> 00:13:34.601
and I think that's mustard on
top and then surrounded by,

00:13:34.601 --> 00:13:35.885
I don't know what this is,

00:13:35.885 --> 00:13:39.591
but diced up onions, capers, some herbs.

00:13:39.591 --> 00:13:43.091
I'm going to just sort of break that yolk.

00:13:44.739 --> 00:13:47.105
Oho, steak tartare.

00:13:47.105 --> 00:13:49.657
Oh, yes. I love it.

00:13:49.657 --> 00:13:53.824
Mix it up, mix up that meat
with the egg and the herbs.

00:13:56.724 --> 00:13:57.974
Oh yes.

00:14:00.576 --> 00:14:04.159
Oh, I'm a huge fan of
any kind of raw meat.

00:14:09.411 --> 00:14:11.205
Okay, I think that's good.

00:14:11.205 --> 00:14:14.038
I'm not even totally sure how to,

00:14:14.038 --> 00:14:17.240
maybe I should just mix in
the onions and the capers.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.669
Think I should just mix it all?

00:14:18.669 --> 00:14:19.580
- [Ying] I guess so.

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.655
- I think so, and this white.

00:14:21.655 --> 00:14:24.072
I'm just gonna mix it all up.

00:14:28.312 --> 00:14:30.312
I can't wait any longer.

00:14:42.898 --> 00:14:45.911
That's as good as I
was expecting it to be.

00:14:45.911 --> 00:14:48.199
Oh, that beef just melts in your mouth.

00:14:48.199 --> 00:14:51.162
Oh and then that mustard in there.

00:14:51.162 --> 00:14:55.543
That is like, you can
taste the horseradish.

00:14:55.543 --> 00:14:57.716
I think coming from that mustard.

00:14:57.716 --> 00:15:00.077
Oh that's beautiful.

00:15:00.077 --> 00:15:02.585
And then you got the little
crispy capers and onions

00:15:02.585 --> 00:15:04.418
and the herbs as well.

00:15:05.537 --> 00:15:07.537
Wow, that's sensational.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.720
I'm loving every single bite of this.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.947
I tasted one of the little
white strips on its own

00:15:19.947 --> 00:15:23.743
and I think that is the
little strips of horseradish

00:15:23.743 --> 00:15:27.170
because it has a wonderful taste to it.

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:29.137
So maybe it's not coming from the mustard.

00:15:29.137 --> 00:15:33.303
Maybe that taste is coming
from those little white strips.

00:15:33.303 --> 00:15:37.470
It's just an extraordinary
blend of delicious though.

00:15:43.447 --> 00:15:45.102
So perfectly awesome.

00:15:45.102 --> 00:15:48.031
That was an insanely
good start to this meal

00:15:48.031 --> 00:15:50.489
and it went down so easily.

00:15:50.489 --> 00:15:53.686
I didn't even take a breath between bites.

00:15:53.686 --> 00:15:55.254
The horseradish was really nice.

00:15:55.254 --> 00:15:57.657
It did kind of go up my nose a little bit.

00:15:57.657 --> 00:15:59.397
Cleared out my nose a little bit.

00:15:59.397 --> 00:16:00.912
Probably the most well-known

00:16:00.912 --> 00:16:03.525
of all Swedish dishes are meatballs.

00:16:03.525 --> 00:16:05.749
These are huge meatballs in size

00:16:05.749 --> 00:16:09.395
and then it comes with a
gravy sauce all over it

00:16:09.395 --> 00:16:12.257
and like covers the entire plate.

00:16:12.257 --> 00:16:13.830
And then on the side are some pickles

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:16.586
and also I think those
are the lingonberries.

00:16:16.586 --> 00:16:19.567
I think the only way to
begin is to topple off

00:16:19.567 --> 00:16:22.588
that first meatball or maybe
I should just slice it on top

00:16:22.588 --> 00:16:26.088
and see if it holds its pyramid formation.

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:30.636
Oh we gotta get a close-up
of inside, though.

00:16:30.636 --> 00:16:34.219
Wow, that's like very
smooth on the inside.

00:16:36.374 --> 00:16:39.923
And I'm going to go ahead
and dip that into the gravy

00:16:39.923 --> 00:16:42.056
and get some of those berries,

00:16:42.056 --> 00:16:46.082
maybe try to maximize some
more gravy and berries

00:16:46.082 --> 00:16:47.332
on top of that.

00:16:54.188 --> 00:16:56.796
The meatball has a very smooth texture.

00:16:56.796 --> 00:16:59.398
It's very, very fine minced meat.

00:16:59.398 --> 00:17:01.768
And then it's salty.

00:17:01.768 --> 00:17:03.846
The gravy is very smooth.

00:17:03.846 --> 00:17:06.829
And then I really liked
it with those berries

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:09.364
because it gives it a
little bit of a contrast

00:17:09.364 --> 00:17:12.316
from the saltiness of the meatballs.

00:17:12.316 --> 00:17:15.485
Gives it a little bit of
a sweet, fruity taste.

00:17:15.485 --> 00:17:16.432
That is really good.

00:17:16.432 --> 00:17:18.266
That is comforting.

00:17:18.266 --> 00:17:20.657
And that was a big bite,
I had my first bite.

00:17:20.657 --> 00:17:24.243
I'll go for a little bit this time.

00:17:24.243 --> 00:17:26.660
The gravy is really good too.

00:17:30.155 --> 00:17:32.816
The mashed potatoes are served
on the side in a little dish.

00:17:32.816 --> 00:17:36.399
I think I'll add some
of this to the gravy.

00:17:37.828 --> 00:17:39.135
Put it right down there

00:17:39.135 --> 00:17:41.385
and then mix it with gravy.

00:17:45.524 --> 00:17:48.531
Kind of like milky and very, very smooth.

00:17:48.531 --> 00:17:52.698
I just wanna taste what that
gravy tastes like on its own.

00:17:56.395 --> 00:18:00.296
The gravy has a very like
sticky texture to it.

00:18:00.296 --> 00:18:04.667
It's almost like syrupy

00:18:04.667 --> 00:18:08.417
and it has a little bit
of a sweetness to it,

00:18:10.406 --> 00:18:14.259
almost like burnt or roasted molasses.

00:18:14.259 --> 00:18:15.185
When I saw this on the menu

00:18:15.185 --> 00:18:17.051
I just could not resist ordering it.

00:18:17.051 --> 00:18:19.384
This is the roasted reindeer

00:18:21.044 --> 00:18:23.304
and I don't think I've
ever had reindeer before.

00:18:23.304 --> 00:18:25.470
It is, I'm not sure what it's sitting on.

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:28.257
Some kind of a loaf-like base

00:18:28.257 --> 00:18:30.900
and then strips of the
reindeer with mushrooms

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:35.313
and it looks like shaved
apple on the very top.

00:18:35.313 --> 00:18:36.685
Let me taste a piece.

00:18:36.685 --> 00:18:40.907
Oh it has a very strong meaty aroma to it.

00:18:40.907 --> 00:18:43.240
It almost smells like liver.

00:18:44.498 --> 00:18:46.331
Rub that in the sauce.

00:18:57.437 --> 00:19:01.762
I know I say this a lot,
but that is so tender.

00:19:01.762 --> 00:19:03.966
It does kind of taste like liver.

00:19:03.966 --> 00:19:07.383
It has a liver, like iron-y flavor to it.

00:19:09.386 --> 00:19:12.866
And then it tastes
very, very lean as well,

00:19:12.866 --> 00:19:15.044
like there's almost no fat in it.

00:19:15.044 --> 00:19:17.044
Very, very lean, liver-y

00:19:18.242 --> 00:19:22.325
and it just slightly
disintegrates in your mouth.

00:19:23.575 --> 00:19:25.908
Wow that's awesome, awesome.

00:19:29.707 --> 00:19:30.540
It's really good.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:31.977
Oh, and what is this on the bottom here?

00:19:31.977 --> 00:19:33.977
Let me try some of that.

00:19:38.756 --> 00:19:41.439
Oh, I think that's mashed potatoes

00:19:41.439 --> 00:19:43.917
but it has a very sour taste to that.

00:19:43.917 --> 00:19:46.589
Maybe there's some cream in there.

00:19:46.589 --> 00:19:50.756
Get another piece of this
reindeer with mushrooms this time.

00:19:54.968 --> 00:19:58.385
Oh, the tenderness of that reindeer, wow.

00:20:01.698 --> 00:20:02.963
It is amazing.

00:20:02.963 --> 00:20:05.380
I'm gonna add on some pepper.

00:20:12.307 --> 00:20:14.530
This is some wonderful
looking pepper, too.

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:16.612
Nice, that coarse grind.

00:20:16.612 --> 00:20:18.798
And I want to taste what are these strips.

00:20:18.798 --> 00:20:20.559
It looks like a red apple.

00:20:20.559 --> 00:20:23.170
Oh, I'm using two knives.

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:26.337
Okay, let me try some of these strips.

00:20:33.018 --> 00:20:35.433
It's very, very crisp.

00:20:35.433 --> 00:20:37.915
It's like crisper than an apple,

00:20:37.915 --> 00:20:38.912
but it has an apple taste.

00:20:38.912 --> 00:20:39.863
I think it's apple,

00:20:39.863 --> 00:20:42.280
but maybe like pickled apple.

00:20:46.207 --> 00:20:50.457
It literally just starts to
disintegrate in your mouth.

00:20:50.457 --> 00:20:51.929
Oh and with that pepper.

00:20:51.929 --> 00:20:54.584
Ying and I just finished with
dinner at Pelikan restaurant.

00:20:54.584 --> 00:20:56.185
I've had some Swedish dishes,

00:20:56.185 --> 00:20:58.011
or I've tasted some Swedish dishes before,

00:20:58.011 --> 00:20:59.155
outside of Sweden,

00:20:59.155 --> 00:21:00.830
but this is my first trip to Sweden,

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:03.353
and I can say that this is my very first,

00:21:03.353 --> 00:21:07.091
was my very first full Swedish meal.

00:21:07.091 --> 00:21:08.566
That was fantastic.

00:21:08.566 --> 00:21:10.374
Especially the meatballs were good,

00:21:10.374 --> 00:21:13.279
but that beginning steak tartare,

00:21:13.279 --> 00:21:16.612
and then that reindeer meat was awesome.

00:21:17.903 --> 00:21:20.333
But it was a great,
well-rounded restaurant.

00:21:20.333 --> 00:21:23.382
It wasn't cheap, but
really delicious food.

00:21:23.382 --> 00:21:26.780
And I think we're off to a fantastic start

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:28.652
here in Stockholm.

00:21:28.652 --> 00:21:30.607
I'm gonna end the video
for today right now.

00:21:30.607 --> 00:21:32.317
Thank you all very much for watching.

00:21:32.317 --> 00:21:33.905
Please remember to give it a thumbs up

00:21:33.905 --> 00:21:35.250
if you enjoyed it

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:38.040
and also make sure you
subscribe for lots more food

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.930
and travel videos.

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:41.892
And I will see you on the next video.

00:21:41.892 --> 00:21:43.942
Thank you again for watching.

00:21:43.942 --> 00:21:45.980
Nice like, tree-lined street.

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:49.313
Very close to also the Piazza di Spagna.

00:21:51.196 --> 00:21:55.181
I already put the cartridge
of coffee in here.

00:21:55.181 --> 00:21:58.098
And coffee time.

00:21:59.642 --> 00:22:00.892
Does that work?

00:22:02.645 --> 00:22:04.812
I think that's gonna work.

00:22:07.954 --> 00:22:10.287
(clicking)

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.298
(buzzing)

00:22:15.298 --> 00:22:18.298
Whoa, it's like something's burning.

00:22:19.546 --> 00:22:20.379
Uh oh.

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:26.088
Well, uh oh.

00:22:26.088 --> 00:22:29.332
We've got some red lights flashing

00:22:29.332 --> 00:22:30.914
Okay, that didn't work at all.

00:22:30.914 --> 00:22:33.156
I hope I didn't burn this machine.

00:22:33.156 --> 00:22:35.530
But I did put water in the back.

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:39.026
We just got off the metro
