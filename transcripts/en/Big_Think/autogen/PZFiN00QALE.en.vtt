give them new ideas what they think

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559
give them new ideas what they think
 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.740
give them new ideas what they think
about that idea and most times nine

about that idea and most times nine
 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.869
about that idea and most times nine
times out of ten people's reaction will

with something keeps an idea alive and

with something keeps an idea alive and
 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.850
with something keeps an idea alive and
that's very important in terms of

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860
that's very important in terms of
 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.649
that's very important in terms of
getting people in the mindset for change

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659
getting people in the mindset for change
 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.600

don't shut something down before you

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610
don't shut something down before you
 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.000
don't shut something down before you
give it a fair chance the second thing

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010
give it a fair chance the second thing
 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.760
give it a fair chance the second thing
that I think holds us back is our

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770
that I think holds us back is our
 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.140
that I think holds us back is our
assumptions and I talked a lot about

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150
assumptions and I talked a lot about
 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.929
assumptions and I talked a lot about
this in my book kill the company is that

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939
this in my book kill the company is that
 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.399
this in my book kill the company is that
we have a lot of assumptions around how

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409
we have a lot of assumptions around how
 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.830
we have a lot of assumptions around how
things should work have always work need

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840
things should work have always work need
 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.080
things should work have always work need
to work we've always tried things that

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090
to work we've always tried things that
 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.600
to work we've always tried things that
way and I think one of the problems is

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610
way and I think one of the problems is
 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.890
way and I think one of the problems is
our assumptions hold us back from

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900
our assumptions hold us back from
 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.620
our assumptions hold us back from
actually attacking problems and what I

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630
actually attacking problems and what I
 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.660
actually attacking problems and what I
mean by this is often we look at

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670
mean by this is often we look at
 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.819
mean by this is often we look at
problems as very big very large and

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829
problems as very big very large and
 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.020
problems as very big very large and
that's because we have a lot of

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030
that's because we have a lot of
 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.480
that's because we have a lot of
assumptions about that problem and we

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490
assumptions about that problem and we
 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.399
assumptions about that problem and we
teach people how to break down a problem

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409
teach people how to break down a problem
 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.100
teach people how to break down a problem
into truths or many assumptions and

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110
into truths or many assumptions and
 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.179
into truths or many assumptions and
attack those individual assumptions and

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189
attack those individual assumptions and
 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.590
attack those individual assumptions and
turn them on their head if you can

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600
turn them on their head if you can
 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.789
turn them on their head if you can
actually take your assumptions and

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799
actually take your assumptions and
 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.830
actually take your assumptions and
change them you can start to see again

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840
change them you can start to see again
 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.319
change them you can start to see again
more possibilities for change we did a

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329
more possibilities for change we did a
 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.660
more possibilities for change we did a
case study with several companies but

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670
case study with several companies but
 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.580
case study with several companies but
one primarily down on Wall Street and

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590
one primarily down on Wall Street and
 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.590
one primarily down on Wall Street and
what was interesting about it is we work

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600
what was interesting about it is we work
 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.469
what was interesting about it is we work
together to come up with a new way to

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479
together to come up with a new way to
 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.880
together to come up with a new way to
instill change in an organization you

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890
instill change in an organization you
 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.770
instill change in an organization you
know most companies when they first of

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780
know most companies when they first of
 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.389
know most companies when they first of
all when they hear about a change

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399
all when they hear about a change
 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.100
all when they hear about a change
program now they they just want to turn

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110
program now they they just want to turn
 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.890
program now they they just want to turn
off right everyone has changed fatigue

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900
off right everyone has changed fatigue
 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.390
off right everyone has changed fatigue
the reason for that is most change

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400
the reason for that is most change
 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.820
the reason for that is most change
initiatives simply don't work and we

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830
initiatives simply don't work and we
 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.559
initiatives simply don't work and we
wanted to go about it in a new way so we

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569
wanted to go about it in a new way so we
 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.009
wanted to go about it in a new way so we
tested all kinds of things from tools

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019
tested all kinds of things from tools
 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.199
tested all kinds of things from tools
that were amazing to techniques that

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209
that were amazing to techniques that
 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.479
that were amazing to techniques that
were horrible and failed but what came

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489
were horrible and failed but what came
 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.280
were horrible and failed but what came
out of a research that we did with

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290
out of a research that we did with
 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.110
out of a research that we did with
several companies over many years but

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120
several companies over many years but
 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.319
several companies over many years but
one intently over eight weeks was this

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329
one intently over eight weeks was this
 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:35.509
one intently over eight weeks was this
change cannot be put on people the best

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519
change cannot be put on people the best
 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.460
change cannot be put on people the best
way to instill change is to do it with

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470
way to instill change is to do it with
 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.830
way to instill change is to do it with
them create it with them the second

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840
them create it with them the second
 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.780
them create it with them the second
thing is is that change of course has to

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790
thing is is that change of course has to
 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.030
thing is is that change of course has to
be supported from the top down it must

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040
be supported from the top down it must
 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.979
be supported from the top down it must
be supported from the top down but where

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989
be supported from the top down but where
 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.410
be supported from the top down but where
change happens is from the middle out so

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420
change happens is from the middle out so
 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.809
change happens is from the middle out so
the people that are sitting in what what

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819
the people that are sitting in what what
 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.759
the people that are sitting in what what
you do every day which is meetings and

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769
you do every day which is meetings and
 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.559
you do every day which is meetings and
emails the people that are doing those

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569
emails the people that are doing those
 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.900
emails the people that are doing those
things every day more than they'd like

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910
things every day more than they'd like
 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.550
things every day more than they'd like
those are the ones that are going to be

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560
those are the ones that are going to be
 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.199
those are the ones that are going to be
creating the change they're the ones

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209
creating the change they're the ones
 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.360
creating the change they're the ones
that have to be in power to do it

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370
that have to be in power to do it
 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.190
that have to be in power to do it
the third thing is is that I don't think

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200
the third thing is is that I don't think
 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.470
the third thing is is that I don't think
it should be a 12-step program people

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480
it should be a 12-step program people
 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.170
it should be a 12-step program people
are beyond tired of 12-step programs

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180
are beyond tired of 12-step programs
 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.110
are beyond tired of 12-step programs
they need a toolkit an undemanding kit

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120
they need a toolkit an undemanding kit
 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.910
they need a toolkit an undemanding kit
of tools that they can use when they're

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920
of tools that they can use when they're
 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.039
of tools that they can use when they're
stressed out when something happens
