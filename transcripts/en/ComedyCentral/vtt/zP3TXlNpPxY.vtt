00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:02.602
Oh, what up my baby?

00:00:02.602 --> 00:00:05.004
Madonna, Rhianna, Ilana!

00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:06.772
I'm the king of America!

00:00:06.772 --> 00:00:07.973
Hello, Garol.

00:00:07.973 --> 00:00:09.275
I'm nuts for nuts.

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:10.610
I'm not sure if I'm in
the right place.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:11.845
You are.

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:13.312
Okay.

00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:15.381
I was cyber bullied within
an inch of my life last night.

00:00:15.381 --> 00:00:17.383
Eight thousand dollars!

00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:19.085
Just now, a child in South
America died of starvation.

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:20.286
Would you like another?

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:21.521
You know what, I would.

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:22.855
Yeah.
I'm gonna lose a flip flop.

00:00:22.855 --> 00:00:24.090
You're wearing a dog hoodie.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.725
Is there a pocket on the back?

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:29.061
This is not Billy Joel's
go-to Dave 'N Busters. Okay?

00:00:29.061 --> 00:00:30.596
I am a doo doo ninja.

00:00:30.596 --> 00:00:31.864
What does that even mean?

00:00:31.864 --> 00:00:34.066
Will you look at
that gorgeous tush?

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.401
Talking about my butt
?

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:36.702
Yeah.
Yes.

00:00:36.702 --> 00:00:37.970
Yas queen. Yas queen.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.840
Star of Ugly Betty,
Judith Light.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.274
Oh my God.

00:00:42.274 --> 00:00:43.543
Oh my God, I'm kissing Abbi.

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:44.911
Oh, come on. Deeper.

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:46.445
Mom, I can't. You're ...
The noises.

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:47.646
Lobster rolls!

00:00:47.646 --> 00:00:49.382
Man, I feel like a smoothie.

00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:52.551
Manuka honey!
So reasonably priced.

00:00:53.085 --> 00:00:54.587
I'm a little baby.

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:58.057
Baby, you bird. I will not buy
a Sodastream full price, Bevers.

00:00:58.057 --> 00:00:59.392
I will not do it.

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:00.727
Drop it!

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:02.429
I'm sorry I got you maced.

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.865
We look exactly alike.

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:07.099
That's what's so hot about it,

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:08.801
it's like hooking up
with yourself.

00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:10.035
Bazinga.

00:01:10.035 --> 00:01:11.271
Fist.
Uh huh!

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:12.972
Dude, that's the street.

00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:15.508
Hope you like stevia.

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:16.810
This is amazing.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.110
Yeah.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.346
I make dolls out of human hair.
Who's thirsty?

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.082
I know you from your ass,
better than I know your face.

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:25.551
But we all know who's
the star of the show, here.

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:27.787
This dog is sexually
harassing me.

00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:29.021
Oh my God!

00:01:29.021 --> 00:01:31.090
Abbi! Abbi hold on tight.

00:01:31.623 --> 00:01:35.094
So a horse dude
and a dude dude cannot -

00:01:35.094 --> 00:01:36.662
What a bitch.

00:01:36.662 --> 00:01:39.765
Aren't you a hot diggity dog
and a scallywag to boot.

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:42.301
I'm sorry! Trey,
I did not just fart.

00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:43.669
Okay, that's a woman's fart.

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:45.137
Oh. Is it, Kirk?

00:01:45.137 --> 00:01:46.939
I told you when we met
that I hate music.

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.207
How you doing?

00:01:48.207 --> 00:01:50.309
This Haliburton fat
cat lunch is on me.

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:51.710
I have a girlfriend.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.345
So do I, she's right here
with the ugly hat on.

00:01:53.345 --> 00:01:54.580
Get in that box!

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.649
No, you have some explaining
to do.

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.384
Butt clenched,
I like 'em nervous.

00:01:58.384 --> 00:01:59.685
Oh, what the-

00:01:59.685 --> 00:02:01.821
You still have
your performance bib, right?

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:04.089
Maybe we really are witches.

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:05.324
Of course we are.

00:02:05.324 --> 00:02:07.494
We're gigantic humongous witches
.
