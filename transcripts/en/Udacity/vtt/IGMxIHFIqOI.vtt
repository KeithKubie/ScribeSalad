00:00:00.078 --> 00:00:02.966
Let's our first bit of
interactivity to this demo.

00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:06.210
LibGDX provides a very simple
way to check if a key is

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.156
pressed using Gdx.input.isKeyPressed and

00:00:09.156 --> 00:00:12.717
passing in a constant from
the keys class like Keys.Z.

00:00:12.717 --> 00:00:14.287
If we do this check every frame,

00:00:14.287 --> 00:00:17.271
then we can make some change to
the world based on this input.

00:00:17.271 --> 00:00:20.101
In this demo the ball
radius is determined by

00:00:20.101 --> 00:00:23.546
multiplying a radiusMultiplier
by a BASE_RADIUS.

00:00:23.546 --> 00:00:25.396
So we can see, if z is pressed,

00:00:25.396 --> 00:00:29.113
we grow the radiusMultiplier
by the RADIUS_GROWTH_RATE.

00:00:29.113 --> 00:00:29.998
If x is pressed,

00:00:29.998 --> 00:00:33.684
then the radiusMultiplier is
shrunk by the RADIUS_GROWTH_RATE.

00:00:33.684 --> 00:00:38.101
Also, we check that the radiusMultiplier
doesn't go below some minimum value.

00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:42.250
That way, we don't end up with
invisible balls of negative radius.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.875
Let's give this a try.

00:00:43.875 --> 00:00:45.780
So, here's our demo again.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.656
And now, if we hold z, the ball
grows bigger and bigger and bigger.

00:00:50.656 --> 00:00:53.938
And if we hold x,
the ball shrinks and shrinks and

00:00:53.938 --> 00:00:56.270
shrinks until it's just a point.
