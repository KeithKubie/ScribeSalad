00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:14.020
Nobody is really quite sure how the tradition
of waking up NASA astronauts with pieces of

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:19.070
music got started; NASA itself only notes
that “Wake-up calls are a long-standing

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.130
NASA tradition.”

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.750
However, archivist and historian Colin Fries,
who has painstakingly tracked down every example

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.710
of a song or clip played by NASA in such a
scenario going all the way back to 1965, is

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.989
fairly confident that the earliest example
of such a wake-up call occurred during the

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.300
1965 Gemini 6 mission on December 16th, likely
as a joke.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.600
During this mission, astronauts Walter Schirra
and Tom Stafford were woken up by a recording

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.570
of singer Jack Jones and Hello Dolly.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.530
According to Fries, earlier missions in the
Gemini program and the manned missions of

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.730
the earlier still Mercury program were too
short to require the need for wake-up calls.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.780
This musical wake-up call quickly became a
regular occurrence intended as a way of bolstering

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.430
morale while allowing astronauts a few minutes
to wake up slowly before having to respond

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.650
to ground control.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.960
Over the years, wake-up calls became one of
NASA’s most beloved traditions, with the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.479
role of picking the songs given to the mission’s
Capsule Commander (CAPCOM)…

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.080
Yes, just to be clear, not only do these people
get to put CAPCOM for NASA on their resume,

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.729
but they can also add in “Space DJ”.

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.310
The songs chosen over the years have been
wildly eclectic, ranging from classical music

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.790
by composers like Bach and Beethoven to the
latest hits of Metallica and the Beastie Boys.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.789
These songs are largely chosen in accordance
with the tastes of the astronauts aboard whatever

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:39.789
craft.

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:43.740
Towards this end, before a mission, the individual
tasked with handling communication with those

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.939
in orbit (the aforementioned CAPCOM) will
often ask family and loved ones of the astronauts

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:54.060
if there’s a particular piece of music said
individual might like to hear while in space.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.610
Thanks to the extensive records NASA keeps,
we not only know every song played for astronauts

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.640
in orbit since 1965, we also have the astronaut’s
responses to some of the more unusual choices

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.640
played.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.340
For example, for a 2008 mission aboard the
Space Shuttle Atlantis, officially designated

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.070
as STS-123, CAPCOM played a brief snippet
of the theme song from the presumably epic

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:23.730
film Godzilla VS Space Godzilla as well as
part of the Blue Oyster Cult song, Godzilla,

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.750
for Japanese astronaut Takao Doi, signing
off by saying:

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.750
Good morning Endeavour.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.110
Doi san, ohayo gozaimasu, from mission control
here in Houston, take on today like a monster.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.380
An amused Doi responded that he was “happy
to hear Godzilla,” before himself signing

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.800
off to get to work.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.110
According to Fries’ extensive archives,
Godzilla’s iconic theme song is apparently

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.000
a popular choice for Japanese astronauts,
as are the themes from other well-known films

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.980
like Star Wars, Star Trek and Rocky.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.660
Predictably, songs with a space theme are
also popular choices, with David Bowie’s

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.390
Space Oddity and Elton John’s Rocket Man
being noted as some of the most commonly played.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.810
Given the inevitably varied tastes of astronauts
taking part in missions, the choice of songs

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.510
has caused some good-natured friction between
them.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.730
A notable example is the song Wild Blue Yonder–
better known simply as The Air Force Song,

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.410
chosen as many astronauts come from the Air
Force.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.410
This has led to complaints from members of
the Navy taking part in missions when it’s

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.090
played multiple times.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.090
On another occasion, the aforementioned Steve
Robinson found himself with something of a

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.590
dilemma on his hands when a superior insisted
he play Wild Blue Yonder, while the wife of

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.330
one of the astronauts asked him to play a
Barry Manilow’s, A Little Traveling Music,

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.180
Please; stuck between a rock and a hard place,
Robinson’s solution?

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.990
I played ’em back to back.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.840
I thought they would cancel each other out…

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.340
The only complaints were from the navy guys
on the crew.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.150
But I’m not sure if they were complaining
about the Air Force Song or Barry Manilow…

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.290
In addition to songs, NASA has, at various
points, played private messages recorded by

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.290
the astronauts’ loved ones (including the
occasional singing of “Happy Birthday”

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.300
where applicable) and even occasional messages
from celebrities.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.900
Notable examples of the latter include personalised
greetings from William Shatner, Paul McCartney

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:17.120
and Elton John, a skit performed by Jim Henson
involving Miss Piggy, and even a song sung

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.970
by Darth Vader set to backing music from The
Beatles.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.150
Perhaps best of all was the crew of Atlantis
on November 25, 1991 being woken to none other

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.440
than Patrick Stewart stating (with Star Trek:
The Next Generation theme music playing in

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.490
the background),

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.630
Space: the final frontier.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.660
This is the voyage of the Space Shuttle Atlantis.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.250
Its ten-day mission: To explore new methods
of remote sensing and observation of the planet

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.250
Earth…

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.590
To seek out new data on radiation in space,
and a new understanding of the effects of

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.710
microgravity on the human body…

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.510
To boldly go where two hundred and fifty-five
men and women have gone before!

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.920
Hello Fred, Tom, Story, Jim, Tom, and especially
Mario — this is Patrick Stewart, choosing

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.930
not to outrank you as Captain Jean-Luc Picard,
saying that we are confident of a productive

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.610
and successful mission.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:08.790
Make it so.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.060
Finally, while it’s noted that ultimate
control over the playlist in space is down

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.980
to the discretion of CAPCOM alone, it’s
generally agreed not to wake up astronauts

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.800
with too startling of music.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.020
This said, some CAPCOMs have chosen to ignore
this for their own amusement, such as Commander

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.990
Chris Hadfield once waking up the crew with
an extra loud U2 rendition of the Mission:

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.450
Impossible theme song.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:36.500
In another somewhat jarring instance, in 2001
the crew of mission STS-98 was woken to perhaps

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.370
the most annoying song in the history of music-
Who Let the Dogs Out.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.990
(And, in fact, Rolling Stone named it the
third most annoying song in history behind

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:51.990
My Humps, by Black Eyed Peas, and- mother
of god- Macarena, by Los Del Rio. *shudders*)

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.240
Why was Who Let the Dogs Out chosen for the
crew of STS-98?

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.380
Kenneth Cockrell, the pilot for the mission,
was previously a member of mission STS-69

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.320
in 1995, with the crew of that mission nicknamed
the Dog Crew II.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.530
As for today, with the retirement of the Space
Shuttle program, this wake-up call tradition

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:16.010
has partially been left in the dustbin of
history, though occasionally is still observed

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:21.110
on the International Space Station, and presumably
will be reinstituted as a regular activity

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:52.090
once NASA begins sending people to space themselves
again.
