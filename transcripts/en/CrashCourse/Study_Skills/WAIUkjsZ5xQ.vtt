00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600
Hi, I’m Thomas Frank, this is Crash Course Study
Skills, and I’ve got some bad news for you.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:11.080
You know that little voice in the back of your head
that’s telling you it’s impossible to read all 847 pages
your teacher assigned you last week?

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.940
It’s right.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.220
To counter that with some good news, though:
that’s ok!

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.780
Today we’re going to be diving deep into how
you can make the most out of the time you spend
on reading assignments,

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.080
both by learning how to boost your reading speed
and how to remember more of what you read.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:32.020
[Theme Music]

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.620
First, I want to jump right in and ask the
same question that you probably ask yourself
every time you look at a syllabus:

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.420
“Do I actually need to do all this reading?”

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.320
While some of your teachers might object,
the answer is no, and that’s because your
time isn’t limitless.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.300
In a perfect world, you’d be able to pour
over every detail of every book in the world
and become smarter than Jimmy Neutron.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.670
But in this world, you’ve got other things competing
for space in your schedule, like homework,
extracurriculars, and marathoning Jimmy Neutron.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.700
There are other reasons, as well – like,
sometimes you’ll see a lot of overlap between what’s
in the book and what you’ll hear in lectures.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.600
So, how do you know what reading to actually
do?

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.300
Cal Newport’s book How to Become a
Straight-A Student provides a pretty good
framework for answering that question.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:16.250
He divides assigned readings into two groups;
assignments from the class’s favored source, which is
usually the main textbook, and supplemental readings.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.020
You should generally do all the readings from each
favored source, but you can afford to be a bit more
selective when it comes to the supplemental readings.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.720
Cal provides a hierarchy for prioritizing them, 
where readings that make an argument take
precedence over descriptions of events or people,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.120
which in turn are more important
than anything that provides context –
like press clippings or speeches.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.840
What I’ll add to that, though, is that every
class is different.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.100
Sometimes you’ll find that everything in
the textbook is mirrored in the lecture slides,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.800
and other times you’ll still need to look through
the reading assignments, but skimming for important
main concepts and vocab terms will suffice.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:51.520
And, of course, some classes will require you to barricade yourself in your room with 6 week’s rations and those freaky eye things from A Clockwork Orange to hold your eyes open.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.930
But by carefully paying attention and gauging
each one, you’ll be able to make smart decisions
about what to read, skim, or skip.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.890
Now, aside from doing some triage on your reading
assignments, the other main way to get through them
faster is to learn how to read more quickly.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.040
We have to be careful here, though, because
this is where the term “speed reading”

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.560
starts getting thrown around and you get people
claiming they can teach you to read 1000 words
per minute or more.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.700
Sadly, that just isn’t possible.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.820
As much as I’d love to be able to plow through
an entire book over my morning coffee,

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.720
we humans have some hard-wired limits on
how far we can push our reading speeds.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.940
On to the Thought Bubble!

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.440
Let’s have a look at the eye.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.520
Your visual range is made up of three areas,
the fovea, parafovea, and periphery.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:36.640
Of these, only the fovea has a high enough density of
cones, the type of photoreceptor cell in your eye that can
perceive small details, to make out text on a page.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.280
Since the fovea is pretty small, your eyes
read text by making quick jerky movements
called saccades.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.700
In between each of these saccades is a
small pause called a fixation,

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.500
and this is when the eye intakes the 1-2 words
it’s currently focused on and sends them to your
prefrontal cortex for processing.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.560
Both saccades and fixations take time to do,
which essentially sets a speed limit on how
fast you can visually process text.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.180
And that’s just for recognizing
the actual letters and words;

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.580
there are other factors that contribute to a
lower speed limit for how quickly you can
read text and comprehend it.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.160
The main one is your working memory constraints.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.400
Just like the RAM in a computer, your working
memory can only process so much at once.

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:17.129
Right now, cognitive science quantifies that
at about 4-7 bits or “chunks” of information,

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.980
which we’ll talk about more in the next
video on how your memory works.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.660
For now, it’s enough to say that you need to give
your working memory time to deal with each chunk
that comes in before feeding it another one,

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.800
and you do this by pausing frequently
while you’re reading.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:36.160
Additionally, even skilled readers spend about
15% of their reading on regressions, in which
the eye moves backwards to re-read text.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.720
That time is split between small regressions
due to saccades that went too far the first time, and
larger ones that are needed for comprehension.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.860
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.560
Now, your speed is helped by the fact that
you naturally skip words when reading,

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.720
and your brain is incredibly good at
knowing which ones to skip while still
retaining good comprehension.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.779
Studies have shown that while reading, your
eyes fixate on about 85% of the content words

00:03:55.779 --> 00:04:00.170
– the words that carry the actual ideas
– and only about 35% of the function words,

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.580
which are the “glue” words like “the,
and, if,” etc.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:12.960
But even with the speed boost that comes from this intelligent word skipping, research has shown that skilled, college-level readers can expect to read from anywhere between 200-400 words per minute.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:19.220
For the vast majority of us, anything beyond
400 is getting into skimming territory, where your
comprehension starts dropping real quick.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.580
“But what about speed reading techniques?”
you might ask.

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:29.160
The people that run those speed reading seminars and claim they can read at 2,000 words per minute say that there are techniques out there for breaking past that normal speed range.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.680
Like increasing the amount of text you process
during each fixation, flashing words in one spot rapidly,

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.300
and eliminating “subvocalization”
– that voice that reads “aloud” in your
head when you read silently.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.680
Sadly, each of these techniques has been tested
scientifically and shown to be ineffective.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.800
For one, increasing the size of each fixation
through “training” would be pretty tough,

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.100
since you would literally have grow more cones
in your eyes.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.600
And if you figure out how to do that, I
recommend not telling anyone unless they
say they’re from the X-men.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.220
Additionally, this idea still wouldn’t do
anything about your working memory constraints,

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:06.920
which is the main problem that also plagues Rapid
Serial Visual Processing, or RSVP, a technique that
involves flashing words rapidly in one spot.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:14.420
The idea here is to eliminate the need for saccades,
but it breaks down because it doesn’t allow the brain
to intelligently skip function words or to do any
regressions.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:20.580
This has the dual effect of overtaxing your
working memory and not allowing you to go back
over a line you didn’t understand the first time.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.800
And finally, eliminating subvocalization is
a misguided idea because that inner voice
is actually quite important.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.900
As the researcher Elizabeth Schotter noted:

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.360
“Attempts to eliminate inner speech have been
shown to result in impairments in comprehension
when texts are reasonably difficult

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.560
and require readers to make inferences.”

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:43.540
At this point it might seem like I’m the bad guy, and
that your only hope is to get on Amazon and buy those
Clockwork Orange eye things, but there is hope.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.280
Like any other skill, you can become better
at reading.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.560
The main way to do this is to simply practice.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.840
Read often, read widely, and make sure the
material is suitably difficult.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:59.140
Those dense chapters in your psychology textbook aren’t going to get any easier if you practice on One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish – though that is a great book.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.840
Another problem that might bring down your
reading speed is daydreaming.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:10.640
When I’m reading, I’ll sometimes get lost thinking about a specific sentence and end up staring into space, which wastes a ton of time and makes the other people around me wonder if I’m dead.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.560
If you have this problem as well, you can
set a time goal for the chapter;

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.920
when I do this, I don’t always finish on time,
but it does help me stay focused.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.480
Finally, when you’re reading books that don’t
require you to comprehend every word, you can speed
things up with the pseudo-skimming technique.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.880
Skim the text while keeping an eye out for
main ideas, vocabulary terms, and anything
else important.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.360
When you notice one, slow down and read the
entire paragraph that encompasses it.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:37.140
A good way to spot these is to pay special attention
to the first and last sentence of each paragraph,
as well as any bolding, italics, or other formatting.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:42.260
Looking out for those little bits of formatting will
also help you to remember what you read, which
is what we’re going to shift our focus to now.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:48.500
One of the most common ways that students attempt
to remember what they read is through highlighting –
which, to be fair, is useful if done right.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:53.740
The problem is that it’s really easy to
highlight too much since everything seems
important when you’re first reading it.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.240
And this works against you because it’s
easy to believe that you “know” the things
you’ve highlighted.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:04.210
When you look back through your book later on, you’ll
see them, think, “Oh yeah, I remember highlighting that!”
and you might decide that you’ve memorized it.

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.240
But there are two ways to remember something:
You can recall it, or you can recognize it.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.740
The danger with highlighting is that it becomes
very easy to mistake recognition –

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:17.640
which requires a cue – with true recall, which
involves pulling the memory from the depths
of your brain’s archives all on your own.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.099
The more you highlight, the greater this danger
becomes.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:24.280
So if you do decide to highlight your book,
be very selective about what gets highlighted.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.000
A better idea might be to adopt what Cal Newport
calls the Morse Code Method.

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:29.259
Here’s how he explains it:

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:35.540
First, if you come across a sentence that seems
to be laying out a big, interesting idea, draw a quick
dot next to it in the margin of the book.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:42.800
Secondly, if you come across an example or
explanation that supports the previous big idea,
draw a quick dash next to it in the margin.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:49.400
This lets you avoid slowing down while reading,
which enables you to smoothly move through and
comprehend the whole text before going back to review.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.260
Once you do, the dots and dashes will allow
you to take smarter notes on what you’ve read.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.300
Speaking of notes, it’s finally time to
talk about active reading.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:04.040
This is the process of truly engaging with the text
instead of passively just running your eyes over it, which
will help you retain a lot more of what you read.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.900
Lots of study books and teachers explain active
reading in terms of a system called SQ3R,

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.190
which stands for Survey, Question, Read, Recite,
and Review.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.320
Surveying is essentially pre-reading.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.200
Before you start an assignment, skim over
the whole thing quickly.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.340
Look over the beginning overview, the headings,
and any review questions at the end of the chapter.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:25.820
Doing this primes your brain in advance,
which will help the most important information
stick out later.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.240
You can actually see how well priming works
right now.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.420
Close your eyes for a few seconds and concentrate
on a specific color.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.860
When you open them, you’ll easily notice
that color in the environment around you.

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.720
Surveying does the same thing with text.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:41.160
Questioning simply involves writing out
some questions that come to mind before
starting the reading.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.580
I actually do this quite often before researching
my video topics, as it helps to – again

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:48.940
– prime my brain to pick out the important bits
and not spend too much time off in the weeds.

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.980
Reading...well, that’s reading.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:55.780
That leads into reciting, which is a catch-all
word for either taking notes or summarizing
what you’ve read.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:59.560
Now, if you had infinite time, you could do
both, but since you probably don’t,

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.660
I’ll note that summaries will be more useful for
big concepts you need to understand intimately,

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.420
and more detailed notes will be better for
fact-heavy readings.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.840
We’ll cover effective review strategies
in a future video.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:14.960
For now, I’ll wrap up by mentioning that
I don’t think you need to follow SQ3R perfectly
in order to get the benefits of active reading.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.680
In fact, I don’t recommend many rigid,
acronym-based systems at all.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.300
Except for, maybe, SCAR: Stop Complaining
And Read.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.400
