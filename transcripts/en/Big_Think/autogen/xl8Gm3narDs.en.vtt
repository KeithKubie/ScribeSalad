along and we do now have the ability to
do a man-made virus and we certainly

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979
do a man-made virus and we certainly
 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.929

antidote for yourself so the question is

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:01.859
antidote for yourself so the question is
 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:03.440
antidote for yourself so the question is
is there going to be anybody both

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450
is there going to be anybody both

the impossibility bottom line is we've

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460
the impossibility bottom line is we've
 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.900
the impossibility bottom line is we've
got the tools good part is we've had

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910
got the tools good part is we've had
 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.740
got the tools good part is we've had
atomic bombs for many decades now and we

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750
atomic bombs for many decades now and we

and dystopia generally they they turn
 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.600
and dystopia generally they they turn
out to be pretty much almost the same

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610
out to be pretty much almost the same
 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.100
out to be pretty much almost the same
thing and the other one is what you call

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110
thing and the other one is what you call
 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.309
thing and the other one is what you call
them an apocalypse so one is about

controlled societies the other is about
total breakdown and you're talking about

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569
total breakdown and you're talking about
 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.520
total breakdown and you're talking about
the total breakdown thing it seems to be

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530
the total breakdown thing it seems to be

so that they often come at turns of

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569
so that they often come at turns of
 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.740
so that they often come at turns of
centuries but they also often come when

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750
centuries but they also often come when
 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.940
centuries but they also often come when
people have have suddenly realized that

the same set of assumptions that they

the same set of assumptions that they
have been going on for the last little

warming is here and is already having
consequences and we're going to have to

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910
consequences and we're going to have to
 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.080
consequences and we're going to have to
either adapt to those consequences or

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090
either adapt to those consequences or
 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.909
either adapt to those consequences or
they're going to be some pretty horrific

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919
they're going to be some pretty horrific
 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:47.300
they're going to be some pretty horrific
social consequences social and

social consequences social and

social consequences social and
environmental consequences which turn
