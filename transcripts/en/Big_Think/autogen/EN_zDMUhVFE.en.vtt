well you know athletic injuries have
 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.030
well you know athletic injuries have
really increased in incidents over the

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.910
20s maybe the early 30s and then you
would consider replacing it now I see my

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920
would consider replacing it now I see my
 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.470

to so there has been a great growth in

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820
to so there has been a great growth in
 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.970
to so there has been a great growth in
the athletic participation and you add

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980
the athletic participation and you add
 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.680
the athletic participation and you add
to that what's also done is it's not

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690
to that what's also done is it's not
 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.570
to that what's also done is it's not
just men that are doing it it's women

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580
just men that are doing it it's women
 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.010
just men that are doing it it's women
women are actively involved in athletics

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020
women are actively involved in athletics
 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.460
women are actively involved in athletics
so we've now seen kind of a blurring of

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470
so we've now seen kind of a blurring of
 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.440
so we've now seen kind of a blurring of
the lines between who gets what kind of

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450
the lines between who gets what kind of
 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.200
the lines between who gets what kind of
injury now now it's true men are tend to

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210
injury now now it's true men are tend to
 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.110
injury now now it's true men are tend to
be much more involved in contact sports

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120
be much more involved in contact sports
 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.190
be much more involved in contact sports
so there's certain types of injuries

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200
so there's certain types of injuries
 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.050
so there's certain types of injuries
there but women are more and more

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060
there but women are more and more
 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.700
there but women are more and more
involved in athletics and we found that

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710
involved in athletics and we found that
 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.270
involved in athletics and we found that
certain aspects of of women's anatomy

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280
certain aspects of of women's anatomy
 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.410
certain aspects of of women's anatomy
predispose them to certain injuries for

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420
predispose them to certain injuries for
 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.930
predispose them to certain injuries for
instance anterior cruciate ligament

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940

injuries in soccer players or other
 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.810
injuries in soccer players or other
cutting type sports there's there's

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820
cutting type sports there's there's
 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.610
cutting type sports there's there's
differences in the female anatomy that

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620
differences in the female anatomy that
 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.770
differences in the female anatomy that
has led to an increased incidence of

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780
has led to an increased incidence of
 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.919
has led to an increased incidence of
what we call non-contact ACL tears

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929
what we call non-contact ACL tears
 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.350
what we call non-contact ACL tears
anterior cruciate ligament tears whereas

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360
anterior cruciate ligament tears whereas
 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.479
anterior cruciate ligament tears whereas
in men oftentimes it has to do with a

contact and what we understand that the
 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.819
contact and what we understand that the
more we can hopefully develop trends to

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829
more we can hopefully develop trends to
 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:30.000
more we can hopefully develop trends to
to prevent it

successful hip or knee replacement is
certainly possible but their risk
