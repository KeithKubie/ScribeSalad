00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.910
What does it take to break a bone?

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.170
Like, really…

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:10.250
Could I do it with my bare hands?!

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.080
Hello there skeletal-based humans!

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.840
Amy here for DNews.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.270
Recently it came out that during the filming
of the latest Star Wars movie, a hydraulic

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.400
door broke Harrison Ford’s leg.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.730
This got us wondering: how much force does
it take to break a bone?

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.250
As it turns out that question is a lot more
complicated than it sounds.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.149
Adults have 206 bones that come in a lot of
shapes and sizes, so some bones are going

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.600
to be a lot easier to break than others.

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:38.949
The largest bone in your body, your femur
or thigh bone, is a lot harder to break than

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.960
the long slender clavicle, or collarbone,
which one of the more commonly broken bones.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.269
Part of this has to do with the of muscle
around a bone that supports the bone and absorbs

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:50.049
some of the impact from a hit.

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:54.219
Your femur encased in all your leg meat, and
that can take more of a hit than your rib.

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.320
Dr Cindy Bir of the University of Southern
California estimates that a force of 3,300

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.469
newtons has a 1 in 4 chance of cracking the
average person’s rib, while their femur

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.700
typically takes more force to break: around
4,000 newtons.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.470
There isn’t a set number for what force
will break a bone like a rib because how the

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.460
force is applied makes a difference.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.490
A blow perpendicular to the bone is going
to do more damage than when that same force

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.600
is applied almost parallel, and that’s because
of how bones are built.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.159
Your bones are actually made up of two types
of bone tissue: cancellous bone and cortical

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.159
bone.

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.109
Cancellous bone is the spongy inner material
and usually contains red bone marrow that

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:32.920
makes red blood cells.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.189
Cortical bone, also called compact bone, makes
up the outside.

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:40.909
It’s dense, hard, stiff, and accounts for
80% of your skeleton’s mass.

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.500
This outer layer is made up of columns of
of collagen and calcium phosphate, like bundles

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.700
of twigs.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.150
Collagen provides the soft framework in the
bones and calcium phosphate adds the strength.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.460
Because these columns run vertically, they
give your bones strength down their length.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.039
Bones are great at taking compressing forces
like when you jump but can’t deal too well

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.530
with shear forces like when someone hits you
with a car.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.330
Certain people might also just have stronger
bones, depending on their diet, age, and lifestyle.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.070
Your bones are dynamic: they’re constantly
being broken down in a process called resorption,

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.620
and rebuilt.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.870
Because a big component of them is calcium,
a diet low in calcium means your bones will

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.680
probably be a bit more brittle.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.200
And just like with muscle, putting stress
on your bones through exercise can make them

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.200
stronger.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.400
That’s why astronauts come back from space
with reduced bone density: floating around

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.980
up there means their bones aren’t getting
the same stress they would on earth.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.610
But even if your diet and exercise routines
are great, there’s no fighting age.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.000
Our bones reach a peak density around age
30 and then begin to decline when the resorption

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.220
of bone happens faster than formation.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.189
Eventually this can lead to osteoporosis,
a condition where bones are weaker and can

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.569
fracture more easily, sometimes even under
normal use.

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:59.560
In the US, an estimated 55% of people over
50 have osteoporosis.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:10.879

So put on your headphones and get ready to
experience videos in a whole new way!

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.769
So, when I said the human body has 206 bones,
I bet some of you said dudes can have 207.

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.400
Way to be immature, and no they can’t.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.549
But other animals can!

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.110
Laci talks about penis bones here.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.610
Have you ever broken a bone?
