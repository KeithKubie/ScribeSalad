00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.980
Line AC is tangent to
circle O at point C.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.950
So this is line AC, tangent
to circle O at point

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.640
C. What is the
length of segment AC?

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.850
What is this distance right over
here, between point A and point

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:17.350
C?

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.550
And I encourage you
now to pause this video

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.290
and try this out on your own.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.500
So I'm assuming you've
given a go at it.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.580
So the key thing
to realize here,

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.280
since AC is tangent to the
circle at point C, that

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.770
means it's going to be
perpendicular to the radius

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.710
between the center of
the circle and point C.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.480
So this right over
here is a right angle.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.700
And the reason
why that is useful

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.660
is now we know that triangle
AOC is a right triangle.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.576
So if we know two
of its sides, we

00:00:49.576 --> 00:00:50.950
could use the
Pythagorean theorem

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.660
to figure out the third.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.260
Now, we clearly know OC.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.700
Now OA, we don't
know the entire side.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.760
They only give us
that AB is equal to 2.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.410
But the thing that might
jump out in your mind

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.820
is OB is a radius.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.190
It's going to be the same
length as any radius.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.967
So this is going
to be 3 as well.

00:01:10.967 --> 00:01:13.050
It's the distance between
the center of the circle

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.920
and a point on the circle, just
like the distance between O

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.300
and C. So this is
going to be 3 as well.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.220
And so now we are
able to figure out

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.760
that the hypotenuse of
this triangle has length 5.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.620
And so we need to figure out
what the length of segment AC

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.190
is.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.773
So let's just call
that, I don't know.

00:01:33.773 --> 00:01:38.470
I'll call that x.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.430
And so we know that x
squared plus 3 squared--

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.340
I'm just applying the
Pythagorean theorem here--

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.800
is going to be equal to the
length of the hypotenuse

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.594
squared, is going to
be equal to 5 squared.

00:01:52.594 --> 00:01:54.010
And I know this
is the hypotenuse.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.090
It's the side opposite
the 90-degree angle.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.530
It's the longest side
of the right triangle.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:09.650
So x squared plus
9 is equal to 25.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.900
Subtract 9 from
both sides, and you

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.020
get x squared is equal to 16.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.940
And so it should jump
out at you that x

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.810
is going to be equal to 4.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.440
So x is equal to 4.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.860
x is the same thing as
the length of segment AC,

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.657
so the length of
segment AC is 4.
