00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.340
When you think of “dependence” and “relapse”
you’re probably more likely to think of

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.000
heroin than marijuana.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.680
But could weed be addictive?

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.349
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.420
Nearly half the country has legalized medical
marijuana, and with more people using it,

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.660
there are more concerns about potential health
effects.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.020
Amongst those health effects is...addiction.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.170
A scary word, but a public health problem
that comes with many drugs and mind-altering

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.170
substances.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.050
A new study released in the Journal of Addiction
Medicine has found that yes, marijuana can

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.050
be addicting.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.550
The study included 127 adolescents who were
undergoing outpatient treatment for substance

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.969
abuse - and for most of them, marijuana was
their drug of choice.

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.510
Out of those who used marijuana, 84% of them
qualified as having “marijuana dependence”,

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.809
which the researchers defined as increased
use of marijuana, increased tolerance of marijuana,

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.440
and unsuccessful attempts to stop using it.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.890
40% also experienced symptoms of withdrawal
when they stopped, and were more likely to

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.899
have problems at school, work, or home.

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.620
Those symptoms looked much like other drugs
in a state of withdrawal: anxiety, irritability,

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.650
trouble sleeping, and depression.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.710
Interestingly, this group experiencing symptoms
were also more likely to have symptoms of

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:09.710
mood disorders.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.610
They evaluated all the data based on self
reports right away and at 3, 6, and 12 months

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.610
later.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.360
It’s an interesting study, but some of the
data from the report has me confused.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.280
For instance, while increased usage of marijuana
could mean addiction, that isn’t necessarily

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.840
a defining characteristic.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.190
And if those experiencing withdrawal have
symptoms of mood disorders, where does the

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.750
possibility of an previously existing disorder
come into play?

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.350
Fortunately this isn’t the only data we
have -- there are other studies this is building

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.350
on.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.870
A 1999 report from the Institute of Medicine
also found signs of marijuana dependence in

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.650
about 9% of users.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.850
Past studies have also demonstrated physical
and psychological withdrawal symptoms in both

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.410
people and animals.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.740
Firing back at the new release, the National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.810
has stated that while a small percentage may
suffer drug dependence at some point in their

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.150
lifetime, it’s the context of a person’s
life that matters.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.060
They also said that withdrawal from marijuana
is relatively short-lived, and that it should

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.480
not be regulated as a Schedule I drug on par
with heroin.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.439
Health advocates at Brown University state
that no one would argue that marijuana is

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:13.299
as addictive as alcohol or cocaine...but we’re
finding marijuana has addictive properties

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.299
for some people.

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:18.459
And the idea that marijuana can’t be addictive
makes it harder for those who are affected

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:19.900
to get help and support.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.209
Let me know what you think about the addiction
debate down below and we’ll see you next

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.220
