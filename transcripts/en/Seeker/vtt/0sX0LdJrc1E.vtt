Hey guys, Amy here, feeling a little awkward
on DNews today…

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:18.550
And if you’ve ever walked into a situation
and felt super awkward, you’re not alone.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.070
But what exactly is it that makes us feel
awkward?

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.980
Assistant professor of psychology at the John
Jay College of Criminal Justice at the City

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.510
University of New York is among the few scholars
who have actually run tests to understand

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.510
awkwardness.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.891
His set up was simple: He put three undergraduate-aged
people in a room facing one another over a

00:00:35.891 --> 00:00:37.019
plate of cookies.

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:40.899
At one point, a fourth person walked in and
instructed the trio to do something simple

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:43.600
like introduce themselves, then left the room
again.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.430
The participants did, then left.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.430
That’s it.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.750
The session was recorded, and participants
ranked their feelings of awkwardness while

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:50.780
they watched the footage.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.269
The results from an admittedly small test
group, were pretty telling.

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.390
Each participant recorded feeling most awkward
during specific social situations, like when

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.420
they didn’t know what they were supposed
to do upon entering the room, when social

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.140
norms were broken by someone accidentally
interrupting someone else, and when a social

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.770
standard was broken by someone flubbing their
words resulting in a pause in the conversation.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.850
Participants also said they felt very awkward
when a negative judgement was passed, even

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.450
if it was just someone making a face, and
when their names or some detail about them

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.450
was forgotten.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.399
Taken together, these results suggest that
it’s our situations that make us feel awkward,

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:23.399
not ourselves.

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.009
It’s the fear of not being accepted and
worrying that our words and actions will make

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.639
us fail or fall out of favour with those around
us.

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:33.320
It’s different from shyness, which is a
far more introspective feeling, though both

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.380
lead us to withdraw into ourselves.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.020
And as you might expect from that understanding
of awkwardness, participants in Clegg’s

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.799
test reported the lowest levels of awkwardness
when the social situation was conducive to

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.780
being accepted, like when participants were
sharing common interests, helping each other,

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.429
or generally being positive.

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:52.720
Joking about the awkward situations did wonders
to alleviate the awkward as well.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.889
So I guess the only way to combat that awkward
feeling is to, well, try not to care what

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:57.999
people think about you?

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:59.420
Easier said than done?

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.420
Maybe.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.069
What do you guys to combat feeling awkward?
