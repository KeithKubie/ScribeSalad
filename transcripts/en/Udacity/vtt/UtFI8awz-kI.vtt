00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We apply Newton's Law -- F = m * a.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The mass is 1 kg ; the acceleration is 9.81 m/s².

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So in total, we have about 10 kg times m/s²,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
which is 10 N.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This gives you an idea about this unit of 1 N.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The weight force of a mass of 100 g

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.690
is almost equal to 1 N.
