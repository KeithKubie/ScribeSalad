00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.293
- So, excited to have
Drew Houston in here,

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.137
very well known figure amongst
kind of our team out here.

00:00:10.137 --> 00:00:14.790
And for those who are maybe
watching this video later,

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.440
founder of Dropbox, how many
how many billions of people

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.273
do have using?

00:00:19.273 --> 00:00:21.236
I know, it's more like
hundreds of millions only.

00:00:21.236 --> 00:00:24.250
- 300 million.
- And only 300 million people

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.120
- using it file sharing what
we'll talk more about that.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.540
But, the way I view these things,

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.420
it's definitely for our
team to kind of meet

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.850
and talk to really interesting
people in Silicon Valley

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.680
and beyond but also for
kind of just the general

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.660
Khan Academy user base out
there to kind of get exposure

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.100
to really interesting people
in Silicon Valley and beyond.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.780
And with that lens, I always
think of kind of myself

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.480
when I was 12 or 13 years old

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.430
and when I used to watch
like Johnny Carson,

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.830
and I always used to wonder, like,

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.240
how do you know who are these people?

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.490
How do they do that, like
what about like major in

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.240
in order to become that person.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.850
And so I kind of want to have
a little bit of that land.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.600
So I'll start there.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.563
When you were a kid,

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.910
kind of what did you see
yourself doing or becoming?

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.860
And how did you try to set that up?

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.330
- So my path started
when I was really little.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.123
So my my parents had PC Junior.

00:01:17.343 --> 00:01:19.563
So my very first computer
when I was really little.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.710
So first I would just
play computer games on it

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.450
but a couple years later,
when my dad got showed me

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.360
how there's a thing on
the computer called Basic.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.080
And so I was lucky, they
showed me how to write

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.470
so my first lines of code and
I was like a really little.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.303
- Like how little?

00:01:38.303 --> 00:01:39.560
- I was five.
- That's good.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.226
- Yeah my son needs to get in line.

00:01:42.226 --> 00:01:44.309
(laughs)

00:01:45.546 --> 00:01:47.740
- And it turns out,

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.650
when you're little like
that you have a lot of

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.070
free time on your hands.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.800
And so, I was always like
playing on the computer

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.650
and I really loved playing games.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.110
And so that was actually why
I want to learn programming

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.890
is to learn how to make
games, how these things worked

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.330
and like I want to insert
of my exploration of

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.817
how the computer worked,
I would figure out like,

00:02:08.817 --> 00:02:11.300
oh, there's like this...

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.510
There's like files

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.770
and like, okay then when I save a game.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.930
Like I can go into that file

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.622
and like give myself like 32,767 lives,

00:02:20.622 --> 00:02:23.320
it's like, all these
little things like that.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.730
- And if only I could
access this file from home

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:26.843
and kindergarten.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.893
- Moving this floppy drive around, yeah.

00:02:32.393 --> 00:02:33.470
So I thought it was
gonna be computer games.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.470
That was what I would does
was interested in beginning

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.121
as then as far as a job
I start up babysitting,

00:02:41.121 --> 00:02:42.810
- Really?
- So I was very good at it

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.000
like watching I was like 12 near 11

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.730
and like I would, the parents would leave

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:49.963
I put the kids to bed.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.340
And I like as regular watching like HBO

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.130
and like, this is like a requirement.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.150
I can only like babysit for, like,

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.760
families that had like
good TV and like Pringles

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.135
and things like that.

00:03:02.135 --> 00:03:04.027
- Then if they didn't
do that is a red flag,

00:03:04.027 --> 00:03:06.880
or your focal point was their cable.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.450
- Exactly.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.648
And then like, trying to like.

00:03:09.648 --> 00:03:11.910
And then sometimes I'd be
like watching something

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.480
probably, like I shouldn't be watching.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.880
They'd be like, shooting
or like bad words.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.830
And I was very good like
listening from when the lock

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.274
went in there the key were in the lock.

00:03:21.274 --> 00:03:22.380
- Oh yes.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.780
- Anyway, this has nothing to
do with starting a company,

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.830
- Some time it will.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.620
- But then I got a little
bit of an upgrade on

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.830
the job front, I was beta testing a game.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.546
And an online game was maybe 14.

00:03:35.546 --> 00:03:37.950
And they were taking
forever to build the game.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.120
And so I started getting
restless and curious

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.500
and started poking around
under the hood of this game

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.810
and I found all these security holes.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.040
I found all these vulnerabilities.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.480
Anyway first you discover these things.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.430
You're like, oh, my God, oh, my God.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.330
I started impersonating,
like the developers

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.980
and things like that and sort of making

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.770
like a little bit of
trouble but then I'm like,

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.190
I sent him an email and
like guys you're really

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.790
you should fix this, you should fix this.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.188
And you shouldn't have done this this way

00:04:04.188 --> 00:04:05.021
you should have done this way.

00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:07.810
And I'm like, really getting into it.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.323
And they're like, well,
do you want to work here?

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.410
And so I ended up working
remotely as an engineer are like

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.760
they're like, do you
want to fix those bugs?

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.740
And I'm like okay.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.500
And then this is the first
kind of startup adventure

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.770
first experience of many where my stock up

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.730
since we were worth nothing.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.860
- Yes this 14 years old.
- That's 14.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.500
- 14 years old.
- And this is part time remote

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.220
- but it was like a
cool thing to talk about

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.653
and like, biology class.

00:04:35.627 --> 00:04:37.260
Anyway I had to get my dad to sign

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.270
all the employment paperwork
and things like that.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.910
So, but that was the path of

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.400
this I was literally working on a game.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.190
But then fortunately there as we learn

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.822
there's a lot of other things in life.

00:04:48.822 --> 00:04:50.700
Beyond like, Unreal Tournament,

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.630
which are really interesting.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.463
- Beyond what?

00:04:53.463 --> 00:04:54.930
- Unreal Tournament or
Starcraft at apoint.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.630
- Unreal Tournament yes that's it.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.890
- That's a little later on, like

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.250
PC era was like more like
the Sierra games like

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.083
- Yes.
- Kiddy Quest

00:05:04.083 --> 00:05:07.270
- for something that, you
guys weren't born yet.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.700
- For me it was Pong.
- Okay.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.469
- Yeah, that was I'm a little older.

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:13.405
- We're losing up.

00:05:13.405 --> 00:05:14.456
(laughs)

00:05:14.456 --> 00:05:16.756
- Yes I'm little bit we
have a little overlap.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.100
And then you go to MIT

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.630
many of us have been there as well.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.478
And I watched your commencement speech.

00:05:24.478 --> 00:05:26.800
(audience laughs)

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.140
I watched your commencement
speech, which was great.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.480
It helped that the guy before
you really set a new low

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.190
in terms of commencement speech quality,

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.000
but your speech was really I thought,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.833
a really powerful speech.

00:05:39.833 --> 00:05:42.520
And I think it kind of
hit this issue of like

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.583
you didn't plan on being,

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.360
Drew Houston to Dropbox founder,

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.130
but you did think you were
gonna be an entrepreneur.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.450
I mean, it seems like
while you were in college,

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.770
you were constantly
thinking about starting

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.770
a business of some kind.

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.161
- Yes, and your speech was great, too.

00:05:59.161 --> 00:06:00.972
- I wasn't fishing for that.

00:06:00.972 --> 00:06:02.590
- No no it was.
- It feels good though,

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:03.900
- I like it.
- You're sort of like,

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.250
- there's no instruction
manual for these things

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.510
I'm like, you start like
googling excessively for

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.960
like every commencement
speech ever given before.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.560
Anyway, so but no, I did plan to be...

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.190
I always was excited about doing something

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.250
that was my own thing, whether
it's making a computer game.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.270
And originally, as I
learned more about business

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.050
and starting a company I
was always just turned out

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.790
that I joined startups as an
engineer or like an intern,

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.190
when I was little, and then
just didn't never really left.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.470
- And you just keep doing
that while you were in college

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.648
I mean, you already had
that kind of experience.

00:06:36.648 --> 00:06:37.481
- Yeah.
- So you're starting stuff.

00:06:37.481 --> 00:06:39.350
Like when your freshman year, summer year,

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:40.230
were you doing stuff?

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.480
- So the the game company unfortunately

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.803
folded pretty quickly.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.650
But that then give me that experience

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.880
and let me get a job at a local company.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.774
There's another startup

00:06:52.774 --> 00:06:55.280
but it was kind of an MIT founders,

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.850
so there's kind of a relation there.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.410
But yeah, and the summers
I would taking classes

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.090
and then every summer I would go work at

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:05.003
first couple years of just the company

00:07:05.003 --> 00:07:06.270
that I worked at in high school.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.570
So they are like maybe, half hour away,

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:09.720
half hour outside of Boston.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.760
- Yeah and the one thing
that I think is mysterious

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.360
for everyone and even
sometimes when people ask me

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.490
I don't have a clear answer

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.100
'cause it's still a
little bit mysterious is

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:21.760
how do you stumble on this thing
that just kind of takes off

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.830
like wildfire that just...

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.450
And you have an interest right man,

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.830
you actually started kind
of a little bit closer

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.040
to kind of what we do here
kind of your first startup

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.700
which I think you
started your junior year?

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.340
- Yeah.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.527
- Was around SAT it was called accolade.

00:07:35.527 --> 00:07:36.470
- Right?

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:40.580
So my, you never know where
these things are gonna go.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.900
'Cause I mean, I think anybody
who grows up programming

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.920
or whether it's programming
or something else,

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:46.923
like there's always tinkering with things

00:07:46.923 --> 00:07:50.220
it's all just one project after another.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.400
And for and then the first
one I want to start a company

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.490
I took my junior year off from MIT.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:59.230
So I took it took a year leave,

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:01.580
which ended up being a
really great experience.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.100
And I promised my parents
I would come back and I did

00:08:06.612 --> 00:08:11.090
but so the SAT at the time was changed,

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:12.910
there was like all this
change happening right.

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:14.720
There emerging in the writing section,

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.480
it's going from 1600 to 2400.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.210
Now, I know there's all kinds
of other stuff happening.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:24.340
But this was back in the day where

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:26.480
to study for the SAT,

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.520
you'd have to show up at
some like horrible classroom

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.310
and like eight in the
morning on a Saturday

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:33.080
to listen to some like 17 year old

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.950
who didn't want to be there either.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:36.860
And all it was just reading out of a book.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.330
Like this was the state of
the art in like SAT prep

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:40.930
and we're like guys like the internet.

00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:42.797
It's not like the internet
as been here for like

00:08:42.797 --> 00:08:43.847
a little while, it's like it's
been here for a long time.

00:08:43.847 --> 00:08:46.280
And why are we still, it's
like how my parents studied

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.113
for the SAT.

00:08:47.113 --> 00:08:51.470
And so I teamed up with actually
one of my former teachers

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:54.220
from high school and we
started building a new kind of

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:58.545
course an online course for
the what was then the new SAT.

00:08:58.545 --> 00:09:01.110
- And what's your lesson I
mean, what 'cause you too,

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:02.797
I guess not do that at some point

00:09:02.797 --> 00:09:04.430
but you worked on it for some time.

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:05.263
You did.

00:09:05.263 --> 00:09:06.096
- It was interesting.

00:09:06.096 --> 00:09:08.240
So I started working on 'cause I'm like,

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.340
here's like an opportunity.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.330
Here's something that my
Co-founder and I knew really well.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.493
I mean, I just, I don't know,

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.340
I treated the SAT...

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:20.810
Like one of the things I
really like to do is like

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:24.040
reverse engineer, like how
things work, take things apart.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.580
So whether that's, more
typical stuff like the kind of

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.460
tinkering that kids do, or like

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:36.802
the finding all the security
problems in that game.

00:09:36.802 --> 00:09:41.397
When I start working on the
SAT like I had to study for it,

00:09:41.397 --> 00:09:43.720
I was like, how does this thing work?

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:47.170
And so you can as yo know
they're always like little tricks

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:48.880
and little patterns you
can take advantage of

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.220
and I'm like, okay, the only
the really hard thing about

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.090
the verbal section is the vocab

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:57.520
'cause like you can, in
general you can teach someone

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.640
how to do a sentence completion
without really teaching him

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.290
it's the words that are hard.

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:04.720
So, when I was 16, I
wrote all this software

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.280
to do kind of flashcards
and adapt and remember

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.100
which ones I was getting right

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.200
and which ones I was getting wrong

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.830
and things like that, 'cause
I didn't want it was too lazy

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:15.960
to like cut out all the paper flashcards

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.510
and I'm like this is so stupid.

00:10:18.425 --> 00:10:21.230
And so I had done that code
actually was kind of on

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.620
the shelf for five years.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.880
And then and then when the SAT changed

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.370
and I had a friend of
mine, who was a teacher

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:29.614
who had his own SAT course.

00:10:29.614 --> 00:10:31.720
And we had this whole shtick going

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.230
I was at MIT, he had
graduated from Harvard,

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:38.260
like as a result of all this

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.120
like reverse engineering
SAT and studying a lot for

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:40.953
I got to 1600.

00:10:40.953 --> 00:10:43.370
So I was like, we had all
like the boxes checked

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:45.280
for the parents and we're
like, we know how this works.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.190
So that it was really
just seeing an opportunity

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:49.970
and being like, you
don't attach too much of

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:51.793
an outcome around it.
Like I didn't have a goal,

00:10:51.793 --> 00:10:53.010
like I need to make this
much money or whatever,

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:54.880
it's sort of like another
interesting project.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.580
And probably the best
part of that was really

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:00.100
just having an excuse to learn about

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.970
business in like a rigorous way.

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:05.280
So and what I mean a rigorous
way I mean like I didn't know

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.360
anything about sales
or marketing or finance

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.500
or like any of these subjects

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.840
and they all seem very
like remote and mysterious

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.970
and so to combat this I
would just go on Amazon

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:18.480
and type in like sales and then like find

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.660
like the top three rated
or most popular sales books

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.470
and just like read them and repeat that.

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:24.460
- And you find that valuable?

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.300
- Like reading.
- And it's super useful.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.850
- Okay, reading is like
one of the probably

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:30.390
the most important, reading
my business is probably

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:31.680
the most important thing

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.590
that's prepared me for running Dropbox.

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:37.390
- And then what was it and
you talk a little bit about

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:38.710
it in your commencement speech

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:40.660
but I find this transition is kind of

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.091
the most interesting one is

00:11:42.091 --> 00:11:44.870
you were working on this
for two years I think

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.590
in through graduation.

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:50.080
What kind of you know, as hard
as you're told to persevere

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.560
and keep working on
something don't give up

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.670
but at some point, maybe you are kind of

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:54.655
putting good time after bad.

00:11:54.655 --> 00:11:55.488
- Yeah.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.150
It was super interesting at
the beginning 'cause like

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.083
and when you first get to work,

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:07.620
you get down to such an
important orders of business of

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:08.823
like, all right.

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:13.550
I got to Photoshop a logo
and print out business cards

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:15.630
as a founder on them
and other very important

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:16.920
and then hand them out to people

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.120
so that they know that I'm a founder now,

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.197
it's like this is like the stuff you.

00:12:21.197 --> 00:12:22.459
- And I still do that.

00:12:22.459 --> 00:12:24.542
(laughs)

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.744
- But then, what you realize
is after that kind of

00:12:28.744 --> 00:12:31.160
after you're like Incorporated
and you get your like

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.690
facts back from the
Delaware Secretary of State,

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:36.713
and these things all seem
very official and important.

00:12:36.713 --> 00:12:40.930
After you're like, day number 74 of like

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:42.700
I gotta take out the trash.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.950
Like we got to erase the whiteboard

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:46.410
and like all this.

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:48.740
You're like actually,
this is a lot of work.

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.320
And which it was good, but...

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.250
So I think with my first company,

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:58.420
neither of us knew what
we were doing at all

00:12:58.420 --> 00:12:59.770
and so we're bootstrapping it.

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:02.960
And there's just a lot of kind
of manual labor around like

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:07.637
we were too cheap to get like employees.

00:13:07.637 --> 00:13:08.470
(laughs)

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:10.280
And we didn't have any money.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.857
So, who's gonna write the
math questions is like me

00:13:13.857 --> 00:13:16.750
and I just still remember
having to like force myself

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.570
to like write these math questions

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:21.210
and draw these diagrams
and be like, all right,

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.200
so where did the train
leave from last time?

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.680
Okay, this train leaves, Sacramento

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.100
and so I'm like, God,
at some point honestly,

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:31.766
I can't do this.
- We have people who do that.

00:13:31.766 --> 00:13:33.427
So it's actually quite fun to do that.

00:13:33.427 --> 00:13:34.260
- Yeah.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.407
(audience laughs)

00:13:35.407 --> 00:13:37.163
- Seriously I find that I do.

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.253
- And so but today.

00:13:44.089 --> 00:13:46.100
(audience laughs).

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.377
I feel your pain.

00:13:47.377 --> 00:13:49.585
(laughs)

00:13:49.585 --> 00:13:50.840
No, no,

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.550
but the problem wasn't really the work

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:57.260
it was just more like we're
putting a lot of effort into it

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.410
and not seeing a lot of return.

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:02.000
So it was for me, it wasn't

00:14:03.638 --> 00:14:06.513
it's kind of lost some of
the variety of the work.

00:14:08.288 --> 00:14:11.920
And so I just got kind of...

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.140
It just became harder and harder.

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.390
I felt like I had to push myself

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:17.010
like so much like it.

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:21.240
And, it just became something I dreaded,

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.380
it became something where
I'd have to trick myself into

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:24.660
like making progress.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.800
And I'm like, and then I start,

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.670
it's this like negative spiral, right?

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:32.363
'Cause you're like, you
start resenting the work,

00:14:32.363 --> 00:14:33.950
you start getting mad at yourself

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:35.760
'cause you're like why am
I not more disciplined?

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.020
Your like, why is like
why and it's just like,

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.600
then which makes you present it even more

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.640
and thinks there's something
wrong with yourself

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.360
like all this like stuff in your head.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:47.220
And then what happened was,
I had a friend of mine,

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.230
who started a company and did things

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:51.350
a little bit more properly,
like he had a Co-founder

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:54.030
who he's like, really good friends with.

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:56.500
They raise money, they could
just set up the company

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.230
like a good normal company

00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:59.840
and then they were just having a blast.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.770
They were Working every waking hour

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:05.090
but like there was having
fun like every minute

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:06.800
this is what it looked like and felt like.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.510
And so I was like, at
first I'm like oh man

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:10.700
maybe I'm really defective.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.710
Like look, these guys are
having no problem with this.

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:14.515
But then what happened
was I actually started

00:15:14.515 --> 00:15:16.500
I would find these little side projects

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.250
and I start working on a poker bot.

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:20.290
Again, reverse engineering

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.140
like people said this is impossible

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:23.300
I'm like it as possible.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.800
And so I was really good at the security

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.810
and kind of reverse engineering part of it

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:30.500
and could do enough of the
AI but it was like this,

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.200
I was just possessed.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.320
Like, I would be like
dragging my computers

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.006
around everywhere.

00:15:36.006 --> 00:15:39.210
Like my parents would ask had
me come up to New Hampshire

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:40.110
'cause we like a little place

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:42.910
like this place on a lake
where you're like, supposed

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:45.150
to get away from technology the next thing

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.010
I'm like putting like
three monitors on like

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:48.950
the kitchen stove 'cause
there's not enough room

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:50.730
and like working on this thing.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:53.130
And so but it turned out
I mean, you never know

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:55.110
how these things are
gonna sort of all line up.

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:58.030
But then when I was working
on I was still working on

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:00.730
the SAT prep company and my friend Adam

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:02.150
who I mentioned moved
out to San Francisco.

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:03.940
And next thing I know he's
two years younger than me

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:06.100
but the next phone call I get from him,

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:08.340
he's like, hey, I've raised
five million dollars.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:11.960
And like, I was like
that's a lot of money.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.470
Like that number has
like two commas in it,

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:14.596
like what the hell.

00:16:14.596 --> 00:16:15.773
And this is like,

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:19.770
my little brother in our
fraternity I'm like, oh, my God.

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:24.410
And so, but it just
turned out that in part

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:27.030
it was sort of the setup was there, like

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:29.590
I really loved algorithms
and distributed systems

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:30.884
and I studied computer science

00:16:30.884 --> 00:16:32.970
and like, these are my favorite things.

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:34.870
And so it sort of sort of fertile ground.

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:36.950
And then, one time I lost,

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:38.050
I left my thumb drive at home

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:41.433
and so I couldn't get any
work done for my company.

00:16:41.433 --> 00:16:44.900
And the sort of non PR, like
the director's cut version of

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:47.203
sort of the Dropbox origin story.

00:16:48.593 --> 00:16:52.110
So as taking a ride on the Chinatown Bus,

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:54.480
the Fung Wah from from Boston in New York

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.170
and I left my thumb drive behind

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:57.230
and I'm just like, I hate I'm like

00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:59.370
what do you do in these situations

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:01.520
that you're like, Oh,
I hate my thumb drive.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.683
I'm like, I hate myself.

00:17:02.683 --> 00:17:05.090
I'm so like, stupid.

00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:07.230
I'm so disorganized,
like I keep doing this,

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:10.220
why can't I be better and
just the self flagellation.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:11.800
And that's like, there's
nothing else to do

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.410
for like four and a half hours

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:15.900
but but I had this three gigabyte

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.920
Linux virtual machine image,

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.750
they need to keep in sync
across all these computers.

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:22.650
'Cause I have worked
on a laptop sometimes,

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:24.670
sometimes a desktop,
sometimes another computer

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:28.000
and like nothing, there are
a million things that claim

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.900
to solve this problem and
none of them actually did.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.590
And so it was really personal frustration

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:34.030
that led me to open up the editor

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:35.540
and start writing some code

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:36.790
that eventually turned into Dropbox.

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:40.590
Although I had no idea that
would be the case at that time.

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:42.510
- And I mean, I think this
is an important moment

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:44.980
because a lot of times
when you read about Dropbox

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.810
you say, oh, yeah, he
had the idea of having

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:49.910
sharing files across multiple devices

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:51.484
and all that but whenever
I realized now that

00:17:51.484 --> 00:17:55.290
what's amazing isn't the idea
is that you very old idea,

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:58.050
in fact, almost anyone
who's worked on data storage

00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:00.050
or anything has for the last 40 years.

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:01.740
has been trying to do this.

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:05.970
And so to me the power of
or almost the audacity of

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:08.070
what is this was like a big problem

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:11.500
that a lot of really smart
people had kind of tried to do

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.520
as you mentioned maybe
even launch companies on it

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.440
didn't have really complete solutions.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.460
What was kind of going on in your head

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.373
that convinced you that know, like,

00:18:19.373 --> 00:18:21.300
I think the past that I'm
about to take on this problem

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.400
is going to be the one that works.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.370
- Well, it was just so clear from trying

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.790
all the other things that like,

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:30.590
all like 100 things that
claim to solve this on paper

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:33.090
but in like in practice,
they never really worked.

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:36.100
And there at school at MIT,

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.790
they have that you sometimes
you like a campus network

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:42.670
or an sort of hardcore
Unix kind of way of solving

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:45.110
this problem, but like
for a Windows computer

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:48.880
or like a MacBook like there's
just you're stuck carrying

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.400
around a thumb drive and
emailing yourself stuff

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.689
and that was your point I was more just

00:18:53.689 --> 00:18:55.390
amplify the frustration.

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:57.120
I'm like, guys, this is not a new idea.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.580
We've thought about this is like the 60s

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:02.630
like why does hell am I
forced to do this like

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:04.513
really made me upset.

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:07.540
And then, there's some
conviction of it like,

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:10.800
look that the problem with
like the online drives

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.660
is like these very
specific technical things

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:15.383
where it's like it's all a big hack where

00:19:15.383 --> 00:19:18.060
the way the online drive the
AI drives and extra drives

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.390
and for every letter there's been a drive

00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:24.160
for all of them that they all worked on

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.141
the same basic principle
which was like, okay,

00:19:26.141 --> 00:19:29.320
we're gonna trick your applications

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.036
and operating system into
thinking that instead of like,

00:19:32.036 --> 00:19:35.320
when a program write
something to the disk,

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:38.110
instead of running it to the
disk on the inside the laptop

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:40.490
it actually intercepts it
sends it over to the internet

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:42.660
to server somewhere and gets it back.

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:46.320
So, at first glance like
this is a great idea

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.920
will work with everything
it's not that hard.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.770
But the problem is, you're
sent like if the server is

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:54.850
100 milliseconds away,
instead of five milliseconds

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:56.763
away like your hard drive or less.

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:00.690
Then you get all these
inexplicable problems

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:03.530
because like millions of millions
of millions lines of code

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:05.410
are all written with assumption
that this thing is like

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:07.033
five, 10 milliseconds away.

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.470
And I'm going into detail on this,

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:12.440
but it just like this there's like no way

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.230
you can ever make that work.

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:16.890
Like it's just like laws of physics

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:18.920
and so you need a completely
different approach.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.009
And sort of a hybrid where like, okay,

00:20:21.009 --> 00:20:24.980
you have big and cheap
and fast storage locally

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:27.530
and on a server it's but
it's like two swimming pools

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:29.920
connected by a straw, right?

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:33.940
And so first use the straw well,

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:35.690
and two like make it so that,

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:38.420
you're not waiting for the swimming pool

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:39.300
to make it back and forth.

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.140
Like, use it efficiently do
that in the background syncing

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:42.973
right, so.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:47.230
And then it just turned
out no one had gotten

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:48.120
the technical part, right.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.700
But then there's also like a user

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:52.830
there's like a design piece
of like how do you design

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:54.020
the interface, how do you make this.

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.850
What's a metaphor that
people can understand.

00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:58.950
And then there's like
an academic piece of it

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:02.600
which like the algorithms
and how do you move the files

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.480
around and things like
that and store them.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.860
But then there's like
a lot of grungy kind of

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.930
operating systems work.

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:10.452
Where how do you make it so that you work,

00:21:10.452 --> 00:21:13.280
the fat 32 file system.

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:16.210
Every other file system
when it stores in the next

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:17.550
to the name of the file it stores like

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:19.590
when the file was modified.

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:22.633
And it's a timestamp and its
resolution of one second.

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.247
There's actually more
detailed now but just listen.

00:21:26.247 --> 00:21:28.120
And then he likes just randomly

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.490
some random operating system
some some random hard drive

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:31.670
you can have a fat 32,000 that's stores

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:35.530
that modification time with
a resolution to two seconds.

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:36.850
And it's like, none of
the other ones do that

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:37.683
but that one does.

00:21:37.683 --> 00:21:39.490
And suddenly, there's
all this weird complexity

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:42.720
to the code or like Windows
XP Service Pack three,

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.830
there be bugs were like
the Swedish version of that

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:48.507
not the Norwegian version, the
Swedish version of this way

00:21:48.507 --> 00:21:50.358
and we're just like
cause Dropbox to crash.

00:21:50.358 --> 00:21:53.890
And so part it says two things.

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:57.500
One is a fundamentally different approach

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.850
from what some of the other guys are doing

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:01.960
and then two is the a lot
of just like that kind of

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.400
obsession like the same thing,

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.760
the same way I was like obsessed with like

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:09.620
making a very well crafted
like SAT question about

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.510
quadrilateral and making
the diagram look like

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:13.740
the actual list is like
that then obsessing

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:15.950
over making really fast, reliable

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:19.631
and fixing that obscure
bug with Swedish windows.

00:22:19.631 --> 00:22:21.930
- And when did you realize this,

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:23.340
you start on this you see a problem,

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:26.380
you start tackling and it is
an audacious problem to tackle.

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:28.450
What did you say, this is real this is

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:29.870
like I have a solution here.

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:32.680
Like this is already better
than what's out there industry.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.620
- So first was when I just made something

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.592
that worked for myself.

00:22:36.592 --> 00:22:39.100
And I'm like, I could actually use it

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:40.350
like I would put save something

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:41.780
and it would like show
up on my other computer

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:43.980
and I'd be like, finally.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:46.260
And then but it really
started to take shape

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:49.182
once I made a video a
demo video of Dropbox

00:22:49.182 --> 00:22:50.810
like a three minute little

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:52.352
it's it's still online somewhere

00:22:52.352 --> 00:22:53.650
or you can find it.

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:56.790
And I put it on Hacker News.

00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:58.600
There's this new site for startups

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.350
and it just got a ton of it
was like top of Hacker News

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:02.540
for like two days.

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:05.383
Like, these are the old days
so it was easier to do that.

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:08.390
But that gave me like, a ton of...

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:10.490
I mean, I'd already decided to quit my job

00:23:11.325 --> 00:23:12.158
it's complicated.

00:23:12.158 --> 00:23:15.610
So I just graduated, I
was working as an engineer

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:18.850
at a startup and I was
moonlighting on my SAT prep thing

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:19.920
that was the other thing.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.320
So like you're asking why,

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.730
like why did I kind of get frustrated.

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:27.750
It's like we my Co-founder
wasn't gonna quit his job

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:29.060
I wasn't really either.

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:31.133
The thing was never
really going to succeed

00:23:31.133 --> 00:23:33.300
but also wasn't gonna die.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:36.230
So like it just got kind of frustrating

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:38.740
But anyway, so Dropbox really

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:42.360
the first real turning point
was when I put the video up

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.764
and then Arash my Co-founder
saw it on Hacker News,

00:23:45.764 --> 00:23:49.700
like a week later, we got
introduced through mutual friend.

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:52.090
So I got a Co-founder from it, Paul Graham

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:56.040
Arash my Co-founder and
then our first investor

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:59.500
Paul Graham saw the video
and emailed me saying

00:24:00.342 --> 00:24:02.980
'cause we just I just
applied solo to Y Combinator

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:03.813
with the idea.

00:24:05.785 --> 00:24:07.060
- And that's one for this
was your second interaction

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:08.660
with Paul Graham.

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:11.260
- I had a complicated series
of interactions before.

00:24:13.114 --> 00:24:15.480
So Y Combinator is kind of
like a planet college, right?

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:17.970
Lots of people want to
get in not enough spots,

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:19.440
you have this very competitive dynamic.

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:22.460
And so actually, the sort
of admission system was

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.370
how I thought about
getting into Y Combinator.

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:29.370
And so I had actually been
flown out to California

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.210
to hang out with some other
Y Combinator founders.

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:34.800
And I also want to pitch Paul on Dropbox.

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.010
And so I showed up at Y
Combinator a little early

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:39.480
before one of the dinners
and walked into his office

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:42.051
and asked if I could show him Dropbox

00:24:42.051 --> 00:24:44.804
and he was very angry about that,

00:24:44.804 --> 00:24:46.603
visitors are not welcome.

00:24:48.253 --> 00:24:50.300
But the problem with that is like imagine,

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:51.860
we all remember playing the school.

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:53.280
Imagine having like five minutes

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:54.930
with like the dean of admissions

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:58.120
and the one thing that
they learn is that like,

00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.020
you're an asshole.

00:24:59.020 --> 00:24:59.970
(all laughs)

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:00.803
All right.

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:02.543
I know I'm so--

00:25:02.543 --> 00:25:05.020
- No that's cool yeah, we keep it real.

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.640
- Sorry to all the 12
year olds watching this

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.093
- don't say that.
- Yes.

00:25:12.861 --> 00:25:14.550
- But that first video was like huge

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:15.760
in terms of getting started.

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:17.600
- Yeah and then you get started

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:21.709
and I mean, and what
year was this was 2007?

00:25:21.709 --> 00:25:23.770
- 2007.
- 2007.

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:26.310
- And then it's just been kind of...

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:27.897
I mean, I actually I don't
think I've ever seen it.

00:25:27.897 --> 00:25:31.310
I mean you guys have got to
be one of the fastest growing

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:34.023
organizations maybe in
the history of the Valley.

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.230
- Also, it's been growing quickly.

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:39.230
I don't either they're all
like people are setting

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:40.670
all kinds of records these days

00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:43.090
but but the company in terms of headcount

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:44.810
has grown really fast.

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:47.780
And then the user base has
grown from 2009 we're like

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:49.780
a million users now we're over 300.

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:52.920
- And I mean, what are your,

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.590
kind of in in hindsight are
now that you can look over

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:57.750
the last seven years.

00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:59.880
I mean, what it been
and I almost view this

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.050
we were talk a little bit about this one

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:02.430
before we did this is

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:06.300
what would you have told yourself

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:08.050
when you if it was an 80% organization

00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:10.210
or 90% organization that to kind of

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:12.300
like either ease your
stress or let you know

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:15.960
that something's coming or
ways to manage it as you grow?

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.420
- Well, I think there's a lot

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.540
and it's hard to kind of
boil it down to, like pithy,

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:23.970
like phrases of like oh, this
is how you build a company.

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:26.270
It's like how do you play basketball?

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:28.250
Like I wanted to take a
while to explain, right?

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:31.140
So, but I think the...

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:32.050
I don't really know how to play

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:34.000
I'm not very good at basketball.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.175
- I am, but I'm not I'm kidding.

00:26:37.175 --> 00:26:38.008
- Alright.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:42.860
So what I would say is,
some of the earliest

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:45.200
most helpful advice that we got was really

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.140
to focus on the people we
brought into the company

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.153
like make sure everybody's
like really, really talented.

00:26:49.153 --> 00:26:52.250
Like, that's probably the best like hack

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:53.840
you can do to make everything
else easier, right?

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:57.600
'Cause, put a good person
between you and all your problems

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.433
right.

00:27:00.233 --> 00:27:03.285
And our angel investors and
some early folks were like,

00:27:03.285 --> 00:27:05.330
there's kept drilling that into our heads

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:08.453
like make sure the talent bar
is really high be very choosy.

00:27:09.527 --> 00:27:12.780
And I think just sort of an attitude

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:16.210
of really trying to systematically train

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:17.970
to like, understand like, okay, well,

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:20.350
here's what I'm dealing with today

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:22.290
but I'm gonna talk to people
who are maybe six months ahead,

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:23.930
a year ahead, five years ahead.

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:25.980
And like what are they dealing with?

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:28.980
I asked as quick as I
was talking to their CEO

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.720
eight thousand person company.

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:33.030
I'm like, all right, we're
approaching 1000 people

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:34.300
at Dropbox.

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:36.770
What am I going to see between 1000, 2001?

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:37.730
What should I watch out for?

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:40.230
Like what would you put in place now,

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:42.170
so that as you've done all these things

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:43.680
and grown the company.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.242
What do you wish you could do today?

00:27:45.242 --> 00:27:50.010
So a lot of what I do is
sort of think about that

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:53.010
and sort of all you have to
be able to see around corners

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:54.780
and one way to do that is reading.

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:57.773
One way to do that is having
mentors and getting advice.

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:01.730
And then the other the thing
that gives you some calm is

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:06.730
that what you read on TechCrunch
or in the press generally.

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:10.260
When someone tells a story of a company,

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.090
they're like, oh, yeah
Dropbox it started out

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:14.510
with not a lot of users then
later they had a lot of users

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:15.547
and they did great.

00:28:15.547 --> 00:28:18.084
(audience laughs)

00:28:18.084 --> 00:28:20.030
And they just have this sort of this like

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:22.620
this narrative arc that they just,

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:24.278
they're like well the real truth is

00:28:24.278 --> 00:28:26.160
this complicated stuff happened?

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.060
And this was actually really hard.

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:28.280
They're like yeah, no, okay.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.180
Two kids, two MIT kids in
a dorm room have an idea

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:32.600
they've been...

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:35.310
And so, the truth is like
it's actually very complicated

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:37.610
and hard but that all
kind of gets glossed over

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:40.462
but when when you read like profiles

00:28:40.462 --> 00:28:42.660
there's a lot of books that
have been written about

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:45.850
their lately that the
everything store is a book about

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:47.100
Amazon it's a great book.

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:50.720
Steve Jobs biography,
Google, Apple, Microsoft,

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.140
Facebook, all these Intel like Oracle.

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:55.470
Like I've read as much as
many kind of profiles on

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:57.470
tech companies and other companies

00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:59.940
as I could get my hands on
over these companies have

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.027
last a few decades.

00:29:01.027 --> 00:29:03.710
And what you learn is that

00:29:05.526 --> 00:29:06.790
there's enough that once
you sort of look behind

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:09.103
the curtain there's nothing
that's that magical.

00:29:11.018 --> 00:29:12.850
And that's important
for people to understand

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:14.420
because you may think like oh,

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:16.160
I don't know anything about business.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:18.990
So I should just go like not,
I'm never gonna be good at it

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:20.420
because I've never been good at it.

00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:22.060
And that's just something
as I should go get

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:26.330
like a business guy or
person like to do that stuff

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:27.831
'cause I'll never be good at it

00:29:27.831 --> 00:29:29.610
but it's actually something you can learn.

00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:34.020
And so I think that
mindset of like in a week

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:36.040
you can probably limited
in terms of what you can do

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:38.210
but like think about playing an instrument

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:39.700
or becoming a doctor like any these things

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:42.010
it's like all of us can realize like yeah,

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:45.040
it's a lot of work but I can
sort of see a path from A to B.

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.830
Turns out like most things
you want to learn have

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:48.093
that kind of potential,

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:51.060
whether it's public speaking

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:54.570
or building a company
or any of those things

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:59.438
if you have the attitude that like that

00:29:59.438 --> 00:30:00.330
and you give yourself time

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:01.750
like you can actually pick these things up

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:02.950
there's nothing that magical about them.

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:05.100
So and that's one thing
from these profiles.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.610
And then the other thing 'cause
you see in the early days

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:09.040
they make all these like really crazy

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.337
stupid mistakes and
like do all these things

00:30:11.337 --> 00:30:12.880
that are like really, really wrong.

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.660
And then that's also
therapeutic is like you realize

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:17.810
all these companies
were like a total mess.

00:30:19.406 --> 00:30:21.210
And actually, I see Albert in the corner

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:23.460
Albert is early Dropboxer.

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.000
Albert can tell you how what
a mess really Dropbox was.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.860
And so what you read about

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:29.550
is actually not reflective of reality.

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:31.060
It's a much mess here

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:34.130
and kind of less glamorous process.

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:36.630
- Yeah and I'm about to open
it go into some questions

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:39.370
that from the team but
just my last question is

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:44.150
where do you see kind of
Dropbox in five, 10, 50 years,

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:47.723
the end of your life what do
you hope Dropbox has done?

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:49.974
- 50 years.

00:30:49.974 --> 00:30:51.610
I don't know if anybody's made it's like

00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:53.141
self driving boats yet.

00:30:53.141 --> 00:30:55.060
- That would be an innovation.

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:58.640
- I mean, you can't
really look that far out,

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:03.320
but we've realized and
what we we talk a lot about

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.540
is we have this opportunity

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.700
where now we have a lot of resources,

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.510
a lot of really talented people,

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:11.070
we can solve these really big problems.

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:16.070
And then what we're really
working on is building this home

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.580
for everybody is most
important stuff, right?

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:20.660
'Cause you think about
your house 20 years ago

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:22.420
like you'd walk into your house

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:24.300
it'd be like, you know mail on the table

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:25.320
you'd go in your living room,

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.050
all your photos are on your kitchen,

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:30.210
your photos are on your
refrigerator, right?

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:32.320
And you go down the hall
and your briefcase has

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.330
like your documents
and like all that stuff

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:35.581
is now on servers or in your Dropbox.

00:31:35.581 --> 00:31:37.540
And so we need this like new kind of home.

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:40.390
So we we think all the time about like

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:43.770
how can we save hundreds of
millions of people from like

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:44.950
these things are really painful

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:46.580
and annoying about technology.

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:48.450
Like all these little paper
cuts like forgetting your thumb

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:50.490
like the equivalent of like these little

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:52.490
thumb drive problems are
like everywhere, right?

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:54.700
And so how do we find the biggest ones

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.537
and solve them at massive scale.

00:31:56.537 --> 00:31:59.521
And so and then,
specifically we started out

00:31:59.521 --> 00:32:01.440
with this app that you
put on your computer

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:03.660
or your phone that gives you
this like Dropbox folder.

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:06.000
But really what you want is

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.740
what you're using that folder for is often

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:09.065
you're putting photos in there.

00:32:09.065 --> 00:32:11.220
You're getting work done,
you're collaborating

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:12.280
with other people.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:15.550
And so we were, we're
starting to dig into some of

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:16.860
those use cases, a little more things.

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:19.460
Like we just launched a
photo app called Carousel,

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:21.960
which is like if the
gallery on your phone had

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.513
like every picture you've ever taken.

00:32:23.513 --> 00:32:26.530
And if you could text
like 100 or 1000 photos

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:27.885
and videos at a time.

00:32:27.885 --> 00:32:29.963
That's what Carousel lets you do,

00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:33.420
for some reason that had
not really existed or no one

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:35.990
like everybody has this
problem just no one solved it.

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:38.430
- Yeah awesome. So I'll go
into some of these questions.

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:39.887
The first one this is this is from Marcia,

00:32:39.887 --> 00:32:41.220
you can raise your hand
Marcia if you're here.

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:42.053
Where is Marcia?

00:32:42.053 --> 00:32:43.659
I don't know, where is Marcia?

00:32:43.659 --> 00:32:44.492
- [Woman] She training remotely.

00:32:44.492 --> 00:32:45.380
- Oh, she's remotely.

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.180
So what's your typical workday like?

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:50.660
- Probably the biggest thing
I spend time on is recruiting.

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:54.660
And so there's, often there'll
be some kind of fire drill

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:57.330
at night where it's like,
okay we're acquiring a company

00:32:57.330 --> 00:32:59.310
or there's some candidate
and we're fighting

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:03.660
with Google or some
startup to try to get them,

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:04.980
there's a tug of war.

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:07.990
And like I'm often
finding myself down here

00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:12.610
like gone big game hunting
for people to join Dropbox.

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:15.470
So I'll be like in the Google campus

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:17.900
or if you see me in one of this companies

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:19.227
you know what I'm doing.

00:33:19.227 --> 00:33:20.520
(audience laughs)

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.350
And so recruiting is the biggest thing.

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:24.980
And then the probably
the next biggest thing

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:28.210
is just meetings some small numbers

00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:30.510
with people on my team
around certain projects.

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:33.291
So every six months, we
pick like a dozen things

00:33:33.291 --> 00:33:36.410
that are really important
that we wanna get done

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:40.350
and then I'll be spending time

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:42.270
with them like, okay, here's
this, here's a new stuff

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:43.820
we're gonna do in collaboration

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:48.100
answering questions like
that, what is Dropbox?

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:49.410
Like what should it be in five years?

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:50.767
What will it be in 50 years?

00:33:50.767 --> 00:33:52.917
And what kind of place
do we want to create

00:33:56.198 --> 00:33:59.170
and then there's this
is much longer tail of

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:00.940
all kinds of other stuff
or there is like partners

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:05.940
or customers or just other things.

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:06.973
- Yeah.

00:34:06.973 --> 00:34:08.520
- It's a hard question
to answer succinctly.

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:10.330
- Yeah, that's pretty good.

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:11.310
I'm just show up at the--

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:13.790
- I had I made something that downloads

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:16.320
my Google Calendar and
I wrote Python script

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.800
that downloads my Google
Calendar into Excel spreadsheet

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.493
and like triage is my time.

00:34:20.493 --> 00:34:21.570
- [Khan] Automatically?

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:23.696
- Well it's not you have to supervise,

00:34:23.696 --> 00:34:26.590
you have to triage stuff or
you have someone help you

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:27.423
triage other stuff.

00:34:27.423 --> 00:34:30.510
but then I had these like
rolling charts of like

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:32.740
how I spent the last week
or the last four weeks

00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:33.790
or the last 12 weeks.

00:34:35.425 --> 00:34:36.550
'Cause a lot of people say--

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:38.250
- That's a product I'll use that.

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:39.083
- All right.

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:42.840
- That's interesting you get
data analytics on your time.

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:43.673
That's good.

00:34:43.673 --> 00:34:45.850
- It is, it's super important.

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:47.763
So I did that more.

00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:50.030
Like one of the most
important things you need

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:52.323
to think about like as your
job gets more complicated

00:34:52.323 --> 00:34:54.940
there's just more stuff
competing for your time.

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:57.640
It's really important
understand where it goes

00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.040
that's a book called

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:01.280
The Effective Executive by Peter Drucker,

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:05.130
it's like any book on management
will like focus on that.

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:08.100
So, but there's another thing
is like no one's created

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:09.570
a tool where you can see
where your time goes.

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:12.513
It's like everybody, a lot
of people have that problem.

00:35:16.094 --> 00:35:21.094
So I have been at times very
like rigorous about that.

00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:22.360
- Very cool.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:23.790
And so I have a question from Dylan.

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:25.920
And Dylan is right over there.

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.200
So what are some of the most interesting,

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.920
unexpected, fun, technical challenges

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.680
that you and your team have
faced in the process of

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:33.453
scaling Dropbox to hundreds
of millions of users?

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:36.980
- So I think it's just fundamentally

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:38.490
the challenge of Dropbox itself.

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:41.760
I mean, we're trying to
build like the file system

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:42.660
for the internet.

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:46.944
And so how do you connect
a billion devices, right.

00:35:46.944 --> 00:35:50.340
And so that comes along with all kinds of

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:53.770
technical challenges where
people are saving a billion files

00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:54.900
every day on Dropbox.

00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:59.160
And so, that's more than
there are Tweets on Twitter.

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:00.910
And this is not like Little
hundred, 40 characters

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:02.860
it's like you're like wedding photos.

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:04.033
- Pictures yeah.

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:07.700
- You connect nothing, you
can't have a bad day, right?

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:11.170
So even just the core service

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:13.740
but then as you branch
out then there's all these

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:16.550
interesting things with,
how do we make a...

00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:24.880
There's sort of far afield
things like computer version

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.920
like how do we infer photos or something

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:29.370
you may how do we organize
your photos for you.

00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:30.303
Search.

00:36:31.758 --> 00:36:34.510
Pretty much every kind of
lay like client software,

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:37.470
we have big data, we have data science,

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:41.640
we have a bunch of infrastructure stuff.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:44.400
Every permutation,
every possible platform.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.360
If people are like really
into like hardcore algorithms

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:47.740
we need like that.

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:49.890
If we have people really deep into systems

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:52.330
we like unlimited need for
that much storage stuff.

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:54.534
I mean, it's really all over the map like

00:36:54.534 --> 00:36:58.260
it feels like any permutation
of technical challenge.

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:00.690
We have it at least in Software.

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:02.630
- Yeah, absolutely.

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:05.050
And I think we have time for one more.

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:06.500
So this from Joel.

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:07.333
Where is Joel?

00:37:07.333 --> 00:37:08.220
There is Joel right there.

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:09.630
So he'd like to hear about Hack Week.

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:11.760
And this is where we've
had a little bit of

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.020
we want to do more of this.

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:16.040
How did it get started
and has any what new stuff

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:16.873
has come out of it?

00:37:16.873 --> 00:37:18.140
Has anything actually been privatized?

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:22.064
- And so Hack Week is basically
something we do every year

00:37:22.064 --> 00:37:24.640
where you guys have probably
heard of a hackathon

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.280
or do like a one day hacking event

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.750
but we're like all right,
let's take this to 11

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:31.760
we'll do a whole week.

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:35.170
And because sometimes
Dropbox would have been hard

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:37.769
to prove that in a day but
actually the first prototype

00:37:37.769 --> 00:37:40.571
had something reasonably
working in a week.

00:37:40.571 --> 00:37:44.273
And so it's something we do, really,

00:37:45.713 --> 00:37:48.750
to sort of get back to the
spirit of like where we started

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:50.763
where there are no constraints.

00:37:50.763 --> 00:37:52.450
A lot of people were telling us that

00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:53.330
what we were doing was...

00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:56.480
A lot of investors told me that Dropbox

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.800
it's a stupid thing to get into have a yet

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:02.350
another storage company or all
the other ones that failed.

00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:03.690
But like it just doesn't
matter like instead of

00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:06.320
like talking or debating
like actually write code

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.100
and just if you do it
right, like you can change

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:10.180
how people think.

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:13.835
And so a ton of things have
made it into the products

00:38:13.835 --> 00:38:16.860
from having to account having a personal

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:19.200
and business account and
Dropbox that was a huge project

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.176
that started out as a Hack Week project.

00:38:22.176 --> 00:38:26.220
One of my Hack Week projects was the new

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.400
and the way you do notifications
are like those sort of

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.470
the menu bar and Dropbox
is not like the native

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:32.692
and then you can see like what's changed

00:38:32.692 --> 00:38:35.470
and have a different UI around that.

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:37.260
Things like a bunch of security stuff.

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:39.804
So two factor authentication was something

00:38:39.804 --> 00:38:44.280
that started there a lot
of how you can like rewind

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.760
your files or undo things
that was at Hack Week project.

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:49.540
And then a lot of other stuff
which maybe didn't make it

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:51.850
one to one later like
make it pound for pound

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:52.683
into the product.

00:38:52.683 --> 00:38:55.960
But even just like when
we watch people build

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:58.020
like all these apps on top of Dropbox

00:38:58.020 --> 00:38:59.310
like that informed like someone made

00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:03.110
like a Jukebox kind of music
player as a separate app

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:05.440
and it just sort of like plants a seed

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:09.540
that may manifest itself years
later in something like oh,

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:11.370
well now instead of just
having the Dropbox app,

00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:13.470
you have all family of apps.

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:15.300
Like Carousel , Mailbox, Dropbox.

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:18.700
So that it's really just a time for A

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:20.670
just to work on anything except

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:22.560
what you're supposed to be working on.

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:25.261
B like kind of unleash
people and remember kind of

00:39:25.261 --> 00:39:28.230
like lift the constraints of day to day.

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:31.720
And three it's to change
how people think about
