00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
JAMES CLEWETT: Today's video is
going to be all about the

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.040
National Lottery.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.330
And if you're a number freak
like me, then the National

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.305
Lottery is great because it's
that two times a week when all

00:00:11.305 --> 00:00:14.420
the people at home get
to share in my

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.870
enthusiasm for numbers.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.470
So what I want to do today is
talk a little bit about some

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.400
of the probabilities involved
in the National lottery.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.390
So before we start, I think we
should choose some numbers for

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.860
our lottery.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.720
So our first number is going
to be the number 14.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.510
That's my birthday.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.880
Then I think we'll have
the number 19.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.480
That was a nice, good year
for me, 19 years old.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.100
We'll have a few in the 30s--

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.590
31, and 33, and 34.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.030
OK, and then one more, 45.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.010
So I've chosen the number 14
for my birthday, the number

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.670
19, and then, a few in the 30s,
number 31, 33, and 34,

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.200
and number 45.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.060
So now, what are the odds of
us picking those same six

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.560
balls out of our homemade
lottery kit?

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.710
First of all, to start with,
there are six balls in here

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:04.790
which are winners for us.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.720
And there are 49 balls
just like the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.680
national lottery game.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.110
OK, so I'm going to look away.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.470
And I'm going to select.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.100
And it's number 19,
a 6 out of 49.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.990
OK, so we put that
one to one side.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.560
But now they're only 48 balls
left in the basket.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.450
And we've got five winners
left in the box.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.252
OK, let me give that
a good stir around.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.770
And it's the number 45.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.630
Put that one to one side, and
again, now, we've got one less

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:39.540
ball in the box.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.120
So we're down to 47 balls and
just four winners now.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.480
Give them a good stir.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.670
It's the number 31.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.700
And that one, again, goes to
one side with our other

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.590
winning balls.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.250
Just 46 balls left in here
now, and only 3 winners.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.300
There it is.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.082
The number 14.

00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:07.540
OK, again, put that
one on one side.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.860
Give ourselves a little stir.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:17.335
Now there's only 45 balls left
and just two winners.

00:02:17.335 --> 00:02:18.410
There it is.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.720
The number 33.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.920
OK, so we've got one winning
ball left in the bucket.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.321
So give it a stir.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.140
There it is.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.720
The number 34.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.690
OK, so my chances of picking out
the number 34, were just 1

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.020
from 44 balls.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.840
And there we have it.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.680
What were the odds of me
winning the lottery and

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.650
retiring to become a part-time
physicist?

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.820
Well, let's have a look at it.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.540
The chance of getting the first
number was 6 in 49.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.300
Then it's a completely
independent event, so we can

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.000
just multiply that by the chance
of getting the second

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.980
number, which is 5 in 48.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.740
So I can just just
multiply that.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.450
Then we multiply that
by the chance of

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.740
winning the third number--

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.700
the top line we can
do in our head--

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.140
is simply 720.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.870
The bottom line--

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:12.750
I'm going to cheat--

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:13.990
I'm going to use a calculator.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:22.345
49 times by 48 times by
47 times by 46 times

00:03:22.345 --> 00:03:26.780
by 45 times by 44.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.490
And that's the number 10
billion and change.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.280
So we're going to write down
our 10 billion here.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.610
So that gives us our final
answer in math speak, if you

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:45.690
like, of 7.151 times
10 to the minus 8.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.050
That number doesn't really mean
anything to most of us.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:04:03.640
And so I'm going to write
this as 1 over 13983816.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.860
So the odds of winning the
lottery are one part in

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.840
13,983,816.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.750
Or in real money, about one
part in 14 million.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.680
I play the lottery
at Christmas.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.029
Actually, I find it's been
really good fun.

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:19.790
So I tend to spend
about a fiver a

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.029
year on lottery numbers.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:25.270
And for that one week that
I've bought a ticket, I

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.610
daydream about all the really
cool things that I'm going to

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:29.650
do if I win the lottery.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.070
So how much is that worth?

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.430
I don't know.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.350
I really enjoy it.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.320
I really enjoy just
the process of

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.880
owning a lottery ticket.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.020
But I know--

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.170
I'm reasonably numerically
grounded--

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.210
I know that my chances
of winning are very,

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.350
very close to zero.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.890
I think my chances of being
struck by lightning are

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.490
something like seven times
higher than my chances of

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.220
winning the lottery.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.150
So I'm kind of hoping
that doesn't happen.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.900
So we've won the lottery.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.160
We've matched six balls.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.410
That's absolutely fantastic.

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.010
But it doesn't really explain
why every time I've bought a

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.160
lottery ticket, I've not matched
any balls at all.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.300
So what's the probability of
buying a lottery ticket and

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.120
matching no balls?

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.720
So let's go back to the numbers
that we selected.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.460
So we had 14--

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.560
OK, so this were our
magic numbers.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.550
So what are the odds of
selecting a first number which

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:21.060
doesn't match?

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.060
Well, there are 43 balls
in there, out of

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.520
49 which don't match.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.770
So I'm going to select one.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.480
It's number 38.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.360
OK, so that doesn't match.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.705
I don't want that one.

00:05:33.705 --> 00:05:35.030
Give it a stir.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.900
Now remember, here we go.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.160
That's the number 35.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.180
And, again, it doesn't match.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.508
Give them a stir.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.490
It's the number 25.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.140
Again, no use to me.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.110
41 out of 47.

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.584
OK, so the next one.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.356
Number 23.

00:06:01.356 --> 00:06:03.230
Getting a little annoyed
with this.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.570
That's no good to me either.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.550
So the chance of pulling
out a nonwinner there

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.210
were 40 out of 46.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.446
OK.

00:06:12.446 --> 00:06:13.696
Do another one.

00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:19.702
I've got the number 41.

00:06:19.702 --> 00:06:20.660
No use.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.590
OK.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.810
So the chances, again--

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.830
39 out of 45.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.241
And our last ball--

00:06:29.241 --> 00:06:31.190
BRADY HARAN: Hang on, what do
you think it's going to be?

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.810
JAMES CLEWETT: Well,
I don't think it's

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:33.470
going to be a winner.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:34.822
That's for sure.

00:06:34.822 --> 00:06:37.690
Uh, give it a stir.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:38.940
I hope it's not a winner.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:43.640
Number 43.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.560
OK, so we've got no
balls at all.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:45.930
Rubbish.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:46.780
Right.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.860
The chances of a nonmatch--

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.710
38 out of 44.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:56.730
If we calculate this number
through-- again I'm going to

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:57.980
turn to my calculator.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:02.120
OK?

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:09.070
So our probability of picking
no matches whatsoever is 4

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.310
billion divided by 10
billion, which is--

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:13.020
sorry--

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:18.940
43%, 43.59649%.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.260
Somebody is spending a pound
a week playing the lottery.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.770
And for that pound a week,
they're getting hope and

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.405
excitement and a Saturday
night buzz.

00:07:28.405 --> 00:07:31.250
I think that's great
value to be honest.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:32.050
So that's fine.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.680
But if I hear of somebody who's
spending 10, 20 quid a

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.460
week buying lottery
tickets, stop.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.710
Please stop.
