1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,690
Now when you're looking down and it's
an utter whiteout and you're looking at

2
00:00:03,691 --> 00:00:06,660
your compass and you're
dragging this shit behind you,

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,230
like are you doing anything in your mind?

4
00:00:10,231 --> 00:00:13,770
Are you like singing songs?
Are you, what are you doing?

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,260
Um,
there's a couple of different things,

6
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:19,350
but really what ended up happening is I
started to be able to trigger these flow

7
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:21,390
states. So, you know,

8
00:00:21,391 --> 00:00:25,500
as a lifelong professional athlete
through different capacities in my life,

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,290
you know, I've tapped into that. You know,
I was a swimmer when I was a little kid,

10
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:29,430
so swimming laps in a pool,

11
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:32,580
sometimes I would like kind of just
happen to this like timeless space where,

12
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,450
you know, maybe 30 minutes would go by
in, in two minutes or something like that.

13
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:39,510
But I never really knew how I got
there. Just, it's sometimes tap into it,

14
00:00:39,511 --> 00:00:42,420
sometimes not, you know, the zone flow,
state, whatever you want to call that.

15
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:43,860
But in Antarctica,

16
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,060
I went in with this sort of attention
about intention of exploring that space in

17
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:48,894
my mind.

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,960
And so as I got more and more into
these wideouts outs into these compass,

19
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:55,110
in staring at this compass,
staring at this expansive landscape,

20
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,640
I started to find ways to actually
trigger that flow state in my mind.

21
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,070
So it got to the point where I
could for several days at a time,

22
00:01:02,071 --> 00:01:04,230
be in this deep flow state. So, you know,

23
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:07,800
my day was about 17 hours every day
between getting up, boiling my water,

24
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:10,650
getting out of my tent, and those
crazy conditions, packing my sled,

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,560
dragging it for 13 hours,
setting my tent back up in these storms.

26
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,250
But I got into this sort of sequence
of being so present with each step,

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,370
each next sequence that it ended up
being in this really timeless spaceless

28
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,390
place in my mind of true high-performance
that was almost like the most deepest,

29
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,400
peaceful, meditative state that
I can possibly imagine. It was.

30
00:01:29,401 --> 00:01:33,120
It was very profound and beautiful,
uh, to get there in my mind. Wow.

31
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,480
No.
Are you boiling this water in your tent?

32
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:42,310
Yeah. So my Ted Boyle. Yeah. So kind of a
slightly different white gas fuels stove.

33
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:43,830
So, not the canisters
where you could throw away,

34
00:01:43,831 --> 00:01:47,470
but like gas that you could refill
the stove but a stove with fuel. Um,

35
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,310
basically the way my tent was, you
saw the outer layer, the tent there.

36
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:54,300
There's actually an inner part that's a
tent so that there's a vestibule where

37
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,480
basically there's snow inside the
doorway but not outside, outside.

38
00:01:57,481 --> 00:02:02,280
So I would shovel that snow from inside
of the tent vestibule into my pot and be

39
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:04,050
able to melt the water that way.
Um,

40
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:08,430
I drank about six liters of
water every single day, um,

41
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,640
when I was out there, which no, it's
just a lot of snow, a lot of antiques,

42
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:12,600
a few hours to melt that.

43
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:15,840
But people don't realize this in order
cause actually the largest desert in the

44
00:02:15,841 --> 00:02:20,190
world. Um, so it's actually very dry. It
doesn't snow very often, but when it does,

45
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,490
of course never melt in the South
Pole was at 9,000, 300 feet.

46
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:27,270
So not only am I in this desert,
but I'm at altitude doing this thing.

47
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,153
So

48
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,630
did you train it out to two? Did you use
like one of those tents to sleep in or,

49
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,250
yeah, so there's a, this gym that Mike
and I train out of, it's called evolution,

50
00:02:40,251 --> 00:02:42,160
healthcare and fitness in Portland.
Um,

51
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,320
they actually have an altitude room
there so that it's not even a tent,

52
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:48,510
but they actually have a full, a
full room where you can, you know,

53
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,300
got rowing machines.
It's got treadmills.

54
00:02:50,301 --> 00:02:52,860
It's got all that stimulated
up to about 14,000 fees.

55
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:58,070
It's about 400 square feet, high
ceilings, big. I mean, it's not like cute,

56
00:02:58,071 --> 00:02:59,860
but it's a big enough. Yeah,
it's like a proper room.

57
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:03,010
I've been in some of those tents before
when I was racing triathlon many years

58
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,600
ago, a lot of people were
starting to sleep in those tents,

59
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,580
but black people have a hard time and
then they get warm and stuff like that.

60
00:03:07,581 --> 00:03:11,440
I know a lot of fighters use them
as well. Um, but, uh, but yeah,

61
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,570
it was pretty cool to have a full
room that you can actually, you know,

62
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,610
be in and move in properly,
um,

63
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,770
for just simulate some of the
high intensity stuff. Yeah.

64
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,760
And so it would take you hours
every day to make your water? Yeah,

65
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:24,610
I would say I was boiling water for
about three, four hours per day.

66
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:27,420
So about an hour or two in the morning,
hour or two in the evening. Uh,

67
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,210
it takes a lot of energy to boil, you
know, frozen snow when it's that cold out.

68
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,070
Um,
she had to carry to carry a lot of fuel.

69
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:35,170
That was the other really
heavy composed sled.

70
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:40,210
It's like hundreds of hours of
fuel. Yeah. So I took about, uh,

71
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:45,220
17 liters of fuel. So that's what, six
gallons or something like that. Oh, wow.

72
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:48,010
How'd you know that that
was going to be enough? Uh,

73
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:51,760
I did some practicing
beforehand. Um, I, I,

74
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:56,290
in 2016 I did another world record project
where I climbed the tallest mountain

75
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,300
on each of the seven continents,
seven summits,

76
00:03:58,301 --> 00:03:59,860
as well as when to the
north and South Pole,

77
00:03:59,861 --> 00:04:02,250
but much smaller polar expeditions a week,
uh,

78
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,270
basically crossing the
last degree of latitude.

79
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,930
And so when those expeditions Alpha was
on Everest during that time to not only

80
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:11,050
et Cetera, all of that in 139 days, um,

81
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,290
but I did that and that kind
of helped me get a sense of it.

82
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:17,470
But honestly it was also best
guess based on talking to people,

83
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:20,320
different experts in the field,
you know, diving into that.

84
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:22,330
But you never know is it going
to be enough or too little?

85
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,320
I'm here on the side of too
much. When you, when, when
you finally got to the end,

86
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:30,700
how much did you have left? So my final
push, I actually, I woke up on uh,

87
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,480
the morning of Christmas Eve 24th of
December this past year and it looked,

88
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:38,860
I was 77 miles from the finish
and I've been going at that point,

89
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,350
at the beginning of the trip I was
only going nine, 10 miles per day.

90
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,530
Towards the end I started going on
about 20, 25 miles per day. So I said,

91
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:48,220
you know what, like I'm about three
days out. And then I thought to myself,

92
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,460
maybe if I could push really hard these
next two days, I could do it in two days,

93
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:53,440
like two 15 plus hour days.

94
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:58,000
Like really get into it and started
looking at my fuel and food supplies and

95
00:04:58,001 --> 00:05:01,600
like they were pretty low. I had had
enough fuel, a few, a few liters of fuel,

96
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,460
but I actually only had
about a day or two of food,

97
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:06,160
like real substantial food left.
Um,

98
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,670
and so I woke up and I was like,
all right, let's go for this.

99
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,550
And in the actually deepest
talk about flow states,

100
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:15,850
that was the deepest flow state of my
life. I woke up in one hour in that day,

101
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:19,960
it's Christmas morning now I wake up
and I'm just locked in and I just came.

102
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:23,140
I didn't tell anyone back home,
didn't tell my wife who was tracking me.

103
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,940
They had this gps tracker
where they could follow me.

104
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:28,090
But I was just in my mind I was like,
you know what? Not not three days,

105
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:30,280
not two days.
I'm going straight for it.

106
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:35,550
And so I did a final 32 hour continuous
push on day 54 77 miles straight,

107
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:40,990
drag in my sled all the way to get to
the finish line in one continuous push.

108
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:45,800
No music, no nothing. Just like in my
head in this, in this crazy flow state of,

109
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:49,840
of, of, I don't know, high performance.
Um, and it was, it was like,

110
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:51,700
it was a crazy final push to get there,

111
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:55,180
but a made it right before the
food and fuel ran out. Oh my God.

112
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,880
And then there's, there's no
one there of course. Right.

113
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,620
You crossed the finish line.
You're like, done this.

114
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:04,110
No one in the world has ever
done this. Applause. Nope. Zero.

115
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,360
And so what do you do when you get to the
end? You said, hey, I'm done. Come get me.

116
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,790
Yeah. Yeah. How long does it
take for them to come get you?

117
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,980
It took me a week to
get out of Antarctica.

118
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:16,880
Totally took actually me four
days to get out of there. Um,

119
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,130
but there's a crazy
other component to this,

120
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,370
which is no one in the world had ever
done this before. And like I said,

121
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:24,410
a few really talented people.

122
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:28,340
Some of the best explorers in the world
had tried recently. One guy died. Um,

123
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:31,370
and it just so happened there's a really
specific season when you can attempt

124
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:34,850
this. But another guy was attempting
this at the exact same time as me.

125
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:39,050
I'm a British, a British guy who's a
equivalent of a navy seal, you know,

126
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:40,430
British special forces,

127
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:45,350
the living most experienced
guy in Antarctica is actually
pulled 3000 plus miles

128
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:47,330
and an article now on various expeditions.

129
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:52,010
And so we got dropped off one mile away
from each other to begin this thing.

130
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,470
And um,
obviously I was the first,

131
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:58,460
I did win this race head to head and at
the finish line I waited for him for a

132
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,030
few days cause I wanted to congratulate
him cause he did ultimately finished.

133
00:07:01,031 --> 00:07:04,430
But you can only imagine I would vote.
Going back to that first hour, I was like,

134
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:07,550
it's impossible. It was also like, it's
impossible. And both the, by the way,

135
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:11,380
this navy seal dude who knows more
about Antarctica, me, he's often going,

136
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:15,240
I can see him in the distance just
like leaving me in the dust. Um,

137
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,320
but fortunately after day six
I caught up to him, you know,

138
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,770
I waved to him in this weird
like passing of the torch moment.

139
00:07:21,771 --> 00:07:25,010
Like I was passing him and then I never
saw him again until I finished and I

140
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:28,030
finished about a 70 miles ahead of him,
about two and a half days ahead of them.

141
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,750
That's going to suck
for him. Imagines, look,

142
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,420
I got this mother Fucker, I brought
it home for America, man. You know,

143
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:40,190
appreciate that. We all will
appreciate that, but still,
that's going suck for him.

144
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,810
Yeah.
So I actually,

145
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:44,840
even though I finished in the first
thing I could have kind of wanted to do,

146
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:47,150
I haven't had, I haven't
had a shower. I haven't,

147
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,600
I actually to save weight so I could
get as much food and fuel with my sled.

148
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,820
I brought no extra clothes,
no extra pair of underwear,

149
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:56,710
like literally no extra pair of
underwear, no prepared. So I grow.

150
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,450
Where are you shitting out there?
Everyone wants to know this,

151
00:07:59,451 --> 00:08:02,840
so let's just get it all the
table. Thank you for asking. Um,

152
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:08,620
I basically, I described that vestibule
situation. So one side I cook in, right?

153
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,300
If the wind is calm, I get out of
my tent, dig a hole and you know,

154
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:15,890
go shit in a whole basically. But when
it's real windy, like those storms,

155
00:08:15,891 --> 00:08:17,990
I just watch like you're going to get
frost bite if you try to, you know,

156
00:08:17,991 --> 00:08:20,270
bend over, pull your pants
down when it's minus 80 hours.

157
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,510
So in the vestibule of my tent,
not the side I'm cooking on,

158
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:27,020
but the other side where I'm still
inside covered, I dig a hole in there.

159
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,330
That was my morning routine.
Get up at 6:00 AM,

160
00:08:29,331 --> 00:08:32,750
start boiling my water at one side
of my tent and it's not glamorous.

161
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:36,560
It's not a pretty thing at debate.
Actually, to me, this is very cool,

162
00:08:36,561 --> 00:08:40,910
but also not glamorous. Um, within one
degree of latitude of the south pole.

163
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:44,180
So the last degree of latitude at 89
degrees to south poles at 90 degrees,

164
00:08:44,181 --> 00:08:48,380
it's basically 69 miles or 60 nautical
miles circumference around the south pole.

165
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,080
Antarctica being as pristine as it is,

166
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:53,420
they have all these laws about
environmental conservation,

167
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:54,500
which to me is amazing.

168
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,670
Being someone who loves and is
a great steward of the land,

169
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:00,930
they actually say you can't even leave
your human waste in holes here even

170
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:02,190
though there's nobody out there.
They're like,

171
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:06,540
we want this to be completely
protected area. And so yes,

172
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:09,660
usually my sled was getting lighter
most of the time cause I was eating food

173
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,800
everyday and burning fuel.

174
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:13,380
But in that last degree of latitude
to the south pole and crossing it,

175
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,610
I was shitting in a bag,

176
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:19,980
wrapping it up and putting it in my
sled and having to carry it with me. So,

177
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,800
um, yeah. Wow. It shows discipline.

178
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:28,080
She was something a lot of people have
been like, hey yeah, put it in a book.

179
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:32,980
Fuck you crazy assholes.
One's up there.

180
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,060
Who cares if I take a shit up there?
It was tempting, but you know,

181
00:09:36,061 --> 00:09:39,420
so I grew up in the going out in the
outdoors and just is leave no trace

182
00:09:39,421 --> 00:09:42,330
principle that I, you know, I really
love. And in particularly Antarctica,

183
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,470
one of the things about Antarctica,

184
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:46,800
it's one of those places where I imagine
you've traveled far and wide and your

185
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:49,830
life and there's some few places,
at least in my mind, where you just,

186
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,040
you can't put it into words until
you've stepped off there. And for me,

187
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,710
this was my second time and an
article on both times. You know,

188
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,900
this big cargo ship basically
lands you on the continent.

189
00:09:57,901 --> 00:10:00,360
Then you get into smaller plan to get
dropped off to where I needed to start on

190
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:03,420
the edge of the continent.
But both times stepping off the plane,

191
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,370
I'm just shit eating grin ear to ear on
my face because I just am like, Whoa,

192
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:11,100
what is this place? Even the second
time seeing it, I felt that I'd like,

193
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:13,860
my cheeks were sore
because I was just smiling.

194
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:18,450
So big of just the pristine beauty,
the blank canvas. The amine,

195
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:22,590
you look out on the land and like human
footprints haven't touched 98% of the

196
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:26,610
continents, something like that. I mean,
it's untouched and so shitting in a bag,

197
00:10:26,611 --> 00:10:31,200
if I had to do that to do my
part, to keep it that way, uh,

198
00:10:31,201 --> 00:10:35,530
I wasn't shit. Did you drag, uh,
at the end it was about three.

199
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,570
You reuse the bags.

200
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:42,150
One per day for at that section is about
120 miles. It took me, I don't know,

201
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:45,380
a week or so to cover that
distance. So, um, yeah, added,

202
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,700
added weight to my sled rather
than subtracting during.

203
00:10:47,701 --> 00:10:50,610
That was the middle part of the journey.
Red around the 30th and 40th day.
