[inaudible]

2
00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.290
<v 1>joining me today as a writer and columnist that quill that magazine as well as a</v>

3
00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:12.940
philosophy major at Columbia University common use.
Welcome to the Rubin report.

4
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.440
Thanks for having me on dude.

5
00:00:14.441 --> 00:00:19.420
I had to change my shirt because your shirt looked so pressed and starched and

6
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:20.343
professional.

7
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.190
<v 2>It's ironic because I normally dress like a complete slob.</v>

8
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.710
I wear the same black hoodie every single day.

9
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.190
But I thought Ruben report you have to bring a game.

10
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.050
<v 1>Let's do it.
I should've worn a tie,
but here we are.
Alright.</v>

11
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.200
There's a lot of reasons that I want to talk to you.
Uh,
you were Sorta,

12
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.671
I think put on,

13
00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:42.671
put on my map and put on sort of the IDW map and the map of all of the people

14
00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:47.420
that care about the issues that we talk about here,
uh,
about,

15
00:00:47.421 --> 00:00:50.420
what was it about five or six months ago,
something like that.

16
00:00:50.421 --> 00:00:53.070
Something like that.
Your piece,
I want to get the exact title right,

17
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.380
was the high price of stale grievances.
And that was in [inaudible].
And you know,

18
00:00:57.381 --> 00:00:59.500
I just had Claire on the show last week.
Uh,

19
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.790
so we're going to talk about a lot of things you've been writing about.

20
00:01:01.791 --> 00:01:05.870
I want to talk a little bit about what it's like to be a student at a,

21
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.910
at a university these days,
especially on the,

22
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.680
that leans pretty far left and all sorts of stuff.
First,
just uh,

23
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.140
tell me a little bit about yourself,
where you're from,
how you grew up.
Well that,

24
00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:15.974
that kind of stuff

25
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.490
<v 2>from Montclair,
New Jersey,
uh,
which is just 30 minutes outside New York City.</v>

26
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.000
Nice suburb.
Um,
uh,
you know,

27
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.010
I had a pretty typical middle upper middle class upbringing and a great parents.

28
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.790
Um,
and uh,
out of,

29
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.170
out of high school I was going to a music school actually I was dead set on

30
00:01:37.171 --> 00:01:41.070
being a jazz musician and I still play drums,
Josh trombone.
Nice.

31
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.940
But along the line I ended up shifting paths and uh,

32
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.050
going into philosophy and enrolling at Columbia where I have two more years.

33
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.970
How do you go from jazz to philosophy?
There's probably some rely on merit.

34
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.740
I don't know that there is.
Honestly.
I think,

35
00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.770
I think I just loved both of them and realized at a certain point that just

36
00:02:01.711 --> 00:02:06.540
going to school for music was limiting.
Um,
so yeah.
Yeah.

37
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.960
<v 1>So you said a middle class or upper middle class.
Did you have,</v>

38
00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:13.410
did your family have any particular political beliefs where you guys,
politico,

39
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.470
<v 2>any of that?
My,
my mother was nearly a Marxist.
She,
um,</v>

40
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.671
she,

41
00:02:19.671 --> 00:02:23.570
I remember her talking to me about Marx and Durkheim when I was three and four

42
00:02:23.571 --> 00:02:27.740
years old.
She,
she came from the South Bronx,
immigrant,

43
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.060
Puerto Rican family,
very,

44
00:02:29.061 --> 00:02:34.061
very poor in the 70s when the South Bronx was the picture of crime and uh,

45
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.920
just decay.
And she,
she was very smart woman,

46
00:02:39.921 --> 00:02:43.280
ended up getting a,
trying to get an anthropology degree,

47
00:02:43.281 --> 00:02:48.200
but she passed away of cancer while she was getting it.
But no,
she,

48
00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:49.040
she,
I was,

49
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.100
I was exposed to two Marx and Durkheim and uh,

50
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.650
some other are other Marx's thinkers when I was,

51
00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.490
I could have told you their names when I,
five years old.
Wow.

52
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.320
My Dad has a bit of a libertarian,
but I got less of his,
his,

53
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.720
he was working much at the time.
So yeah.
So that,

54
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:10.780
that's a real mixed household of the politics though.

55
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.500
Did you sort of lean one way or the other?
Yeah,

56
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:18.700
I always leaned heavily left if I,
if I leaned anywhere at all.

57
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.440
Yeah.
I mean as early,
Eh,
my,

58
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.510
the beginning of my political identity was definitely anchored around identity

59
00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:31.610
politics and especially black identity politics.
Uh,
you know,

60
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.240
I was 24,
it was at 2013,

61
00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:37.270
2014 when black lives matter started cropping up.

62
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.720
I was at that point very much enthusiastic about that movement I was posting on

63
00:03:43.151 --> 00:03:47.020
Facebook.
I haven't seen a police shooting,
uh,

64
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:48.280
to the effect that this is,

65
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.080
this is proof that the system is rigged against black people so that that's more

66
00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:57.340
or less what I was politically as of maybe five years ago.

67
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.440
So yeah,
that,
that was very much in my upbringing.
It was in the water,

68
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.240
uh,
in my,
in my social environment and intellectual environment growing up.

69
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.310
How much of that is part of the whole thing of just being around a certain set

70
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:16.870
of young people that believe a certain thing so that you all sort of believe it

71
00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:20.740
together,
whether it's ultimately true or not.
Yeah,
I think,

72
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.660
I think we're social animals and,

73
00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:27.661
and were heavily incentivized psychologically to not break ranks with the norms

74
00:04:28.391 --> 00:04:30.460
of our social group.
So if,
if,

75
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.020
if those norms are that you have to believe in the god Vishnu,

76
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.880
Shiva,
than most people are going to grow up believing those things.

77
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.100
And it takes a kind of a rare personality to,
to be a contrarian in that context.

78
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.600
And if the norms are you have to believe in,
in,
in,
and systemic racism,

79
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.530
you have to believe that America is a unique evil.
Uh,

80
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.110
then people will grow up believing those things.
And likewise,
if the norm is,

81
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.060
uh,
you know,
uh,
um,

82
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.480
abortion is murder and there is only one God and it's the Christian God and

83
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.040
homosexuality is a sin than most people in that context will,

84
00:05:10.041 --> 00:05:14.320
it will end up believing those things.
So,
yeah,
I mean I,
my,

85
00:05:14.321 --> 00:05:15.430
as far as my upbringing,

86
00:05:15.431 --> 00:05:20.431
I think I can remember meeting precisely one Republican and he was my fifth

87
00:05:21.491 --> 00:05:26.491
grade history teacher and he was such a good history teacher that,

88
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:27.131
you know,

89
00:05:27.131 --> 00:05:31.150
in this public school that it kind of made up for the fact that he was a

90
00:05:31.151 --> 00:05:34.780
republican because all the parents who want their kids to get ahead wanted them

91
00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:39.340
in his class.
Right.
Yeah.
So you know,
it's something there,
there,
yeah.
Yes,
yes.

92
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.820
But I guess,
yeah,
long story short,
it was very much of an echo,

93
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.020
very much an echo chamber.
Very ideologically siloed.
Yeah.
Okay.
So,

94
00:05:47.021 --> 00:05:50.980
so far your story I think sounds pretty consistent with a lot of what's going on

95
00:05:50.981 --> 00:05:54.100
with,
with young people.
How old are you now?
2122 okay.

96
00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:58.160
So you said in 2013 so only about five years ago.
He's,
you're 17

97
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.090
<v 1>you're sort of in this thing,
this is the beginning of black lives matter.</v>

98
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.630
When did you start realizing that perhaps it wasn't as much of a positive as it

99
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:09.710
had sort of been laid out to be?

100
00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.511
<v 2>Well,</v>

101
00:06:10.511 --> 00:06:15.511
I think it's hard to reconstruct one's own narrative after the fact.

102
00:06:15.851 --> 00:06:20.440
But I remember one thing being significant,
which was when,

103
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.170
uh,
Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson.

104
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.530
I remember being in my first year of college taking,

105
00:06:26.531 --> 00:06:31.531
taking a class at Julliard and we were talking about this killing and it was

106
00:06:32.921 --> 00:06:35.470
just obvious from the point of view of most in the class,

107
00:06:35.471 --> 00:06:36.580
including the professor,

108
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:41.970
that this was just another in a long line of examples of black men being

109
00:06:44.501 --> 00:06:48.400
brutalized in a country that fundamentally does not want them to succeed,

110
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.810
to succeed.
And I don't know what like what it was.

111
00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.010
It may have been because you know,
I had a roommate who was from,

112
00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:57.910
from Arizona,

113
00:06:57.911 --> 00:07:02.911
from a very different kind of political climate who was skeptical of this.

114
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.180
And I didn't even know how one could be skeptical of this.

115
00:07:07.181 --> 00:07:10.000
It was so jarring to meet a person.
I liked that,

116
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.860
or many people I liked that were skeptical of the things I took for granted.

117
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.540
<v 1>Yeah.
Were you guys able to get into it?</v>

118
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.390
Because that's always one of the big problems here is that people can't do this

119
00:07:19.391 --> 00:07:20.530
stuff with their friends anymore.

120
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.710
<v 2>The thing is,</v>

121
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.340
I think we were such good friends at that point for a political reasons that,

122
00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:29.480
you know,
no,
no amount of politics was gonna was gonna destroy that.

123
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:34.510
But I think I just spent one night reading the complete testimony from,

124
00:07:35.751 --> 00:07:39.350
from,
uh,
from Michael Brown's friend and from the police officer.

125
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:43.970
And I came away thinking,
well,
if the police officer's telling the truth,

126
00:07:43.971 --> 00:07:46.880
then that was a justified shooting.
If his friend is telling the truth,

127
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.610
then it was unjustified.
But the,

128
00:07:49.611 --> 00:07:53.330
I don't know who was telling the truth and no one in my class knew either,

129
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:56.600
but everyone had the same opinion so that,
I mean,

130
00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:58.250
I remember that being significant.

131
00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.290
<v 1>I remember,
remember speaking up about that,</v>

132
00:08:01.291 --> 00:08:04.110
like when was the moment that you were kind of going,
all right,

133
00:08:04.111 --> 00:08:06.080
I've got to say something about this.
I'm not sure.

134
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:07.700
<v 2>I'm not sure that I spoke up about it.</v>

135
00:08:07.701 --> 00:08:11.510
I'm not sure I would've had the confidence to speak up about it.
Yeah.

136
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:15.500
<v 1>Were there a couple of other things after that cause I find it to be one of</v>

137
00:08:15.501 --> 00:08:20.501
these things that once you see this thing for what it is that then it sort of

138
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.270
happens very quickly.
I think a lot of people that watch this show,

139
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.550
I've acknowledged that because I think it's a lot of former former lefties or

140
00:08:28.551 --> 00:08:29.540
whatever you want to call it,

141
00:08:29.541 --> 00:08:33.260
that kind of see one moment like you just laid out and then they start looking

142
00:08:33.261 --> 00:08:36.020
at other things and going,
wait a minute.
Maybe that's not how it is.

143
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:39.620
Maybe that person's not racist just because I disagree with them on this or

144
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:40.813
whatever the case may be.

145
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:45.100
<v 2>I guess I can,
I can put the two other quick moments.
One was,
uh,
once I,</v>

146
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.960
once I arrived at Columbia,
I heard of this Guy John mcwhorter,
who I,

147
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:52.780
I had no reason to believe anything about at the time,

148
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:55.380
but I just went,
I don't know,
a whim.

149
00:08:55.381 --> 00:08:59.430
I went to the library and just search his name and pick the first book I could

150
00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:01.500
find.
And it was called authentically black.

151
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:07.250
And it's a series of essays he wrote in the early two thousands about the fact

152
00:09:08.701 --> 00:09:13.410
that it's viewed as authentically black to con constantly pointing the finger at

153
00:09:13.411 --> 00:09:16.560
white people for any given problem in the black community.

154
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.460
Whether or not the evidence bears that out.
And,
uh,

155
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:24.480
because it's viewed as authentically black and there's this incredible taboo on

156
00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:27.710
anyone who thinks differently.
And I was reading,

157
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:31.530
I was reading these essays and I remember thinking,
Oh my God,
this is,

158
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.430
this is right.
And I've never heard a black person say this out loud,

159
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:39.900
but it's,
it's obviously right.
And I didn't know you could say that.

160
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:43.470
I remember that that moment being significant,
but still the,
I mean,

161
00:09:43.471 --> 00:09:48.260
these subjects are so hard to talk about.
I,
I do remember doing a,

162
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:53.310
at some point doing MTMA and this is where the most people have their break.

163
00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:00.760
Yes.
Um,
I guess this maybe makes the,

164
00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:04.260
the red pill analogy a little too literal.
There you go.

165
00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:08.200
But I do remember,
I mean,
because you know,

166
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:09.690
I don't,

167
00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:15.120
I don't enjoy being the black person at odds with most black people around me

168
00:10:15.121 --> 00:10:20.121
are getting accused as I sometimes do of being self hating or an uncle Tom.

169
00:10:20.611 --> 00:10:21.930
Like I don't enjoy that.
That's,

170
00:10:21.931 --> 00:10:25.530
that's very much a cost of what I'm doing psychologically.

171
00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:27.210
But I remembered,

172
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:32.240
remember doing Mtma and I was talking to a black friend of mine about race

173
00:10:33.361 --> 00:10:37.370
issues and you know,
if you've ever done MTMA you know,

174
00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:42.330
just puts you in this totally clear headspace where you love everyone around you

175
00:10:42.331 --> 00:10:44.490
so much and you love yourself.

176
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:50.450
And I remember we were talking about race issues and I was articulating more of

177
00:10:51.181 --> 00:10:56.181
the kind of points of view that I articulate now and it felt so silly that I had

178
00:10:57.691 --> 00:11:01.590
ever had a hangup talking about these things in any other context.

179
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:05.730
And you know,
after that I just,
I felt like,

180
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:11.340
like there's no reason I can't try to approximate that more and more often.

181
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:16.610
Of course it's much harder when you're sober.
But the analogy though,

182
00:11:16.611 --> 00:11:20.400
or the metaphor of the red pill,
it really has some value here.

183
00:11:20.401 --> 00:11:25.320
How did that conversation end up?
I mean,
the Mtma laced conversation,

184
00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:30.110
I feel like all,
all MTMA laced conversations go well.
Yeah.

185
00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:33.720
I mean something has to be,
yeah,
it is.

186
00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.510
I just,
yeah,
I think,

187
00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:41.540
I think if we add more and more enter conversations with a mindset of the person

188
00:11:42.691 --> 00:11:46.650
I'm talking to has reasons to believe what they believe in,

189
00:11:46.651 --> 00:11:50.490
they're coming from a good place,
then a lot of conversations can go well.

190
00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:51.151
That said,

191
00:11:51.151 --> 00:11:54.850
I've had a lot of conversations with people since then that have gone extremely

192
00:11:54.851 --> 00:11:57.940
well.
Sorry.
Extremely poorly.
Yeah.
And um,

193
00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:00.520
have ended quite bitterly.

194
00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:01.021
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

195
00:12:01.021 --> 00:12:03.930
And I want to get to some of that and some of the things that people call you

196
00:12:03.931 --> 00:12:06.300
and all that,
so,
okay.
So you have these,
you know,

197
00:12:06.301 --> 00:12:10.170
a couple of successive moments of,
of waking up.
Um,

198
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.560
when did you finally start talking about this stuff?

199
00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:17.500
<v 2>You know,
I think,
um,
I,</v>

200
00:12:17.501 --> 00:12:20.680
I talked about it here and there with friends and family,
but,

201
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:26.110
and I had been trying to write about it a bit for the school newspaper and just

202
00:12:26.111 --> 00:12:29.710
writing on my own,
but not publishing over the past year.

203
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.010
But I think what,
what,

204
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.270
what did it was when Kanye tweeted,
uh,
I liked the way,

205
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:41.710
I love the way Candace own thinks when he tweeted that something about that

206
00:12:41.711 --> 00:12:46.711
moment was so inspiring to me to see someone who nobody on earth would question

207
00:12:48.371 --> 00:12:49.810
their quote blackness.

208
00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.890
Because in many ways Kanye is viewed as,

209
00:12:53.891 --> 00:12:58.690
as the picture of blackness.
However one cashes out that term,
um,

210
00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:03.580
to just to see him break ranks,
to see him break,
break the taboo,

211
00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:06.300
even though he did it in a way that,
you know,

212
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:11.130
even though he's not an intellectual,
he said crazy things about slavery that,

213
00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:14.740
that aren't true and endorse someone who I don't,

214
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:18.520
I don't see myself as having very much in common with namely,
namely Candice.

215
00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.150
It just,
the fact that he was willing to break the taboo at all,

216
00:13:22.151 --> 00:13:27.151
someone of his platform was so inspiring to me that that's when I started

217
00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:30.250
writing for Colette.
Yeah.
So what was,

218
00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.590
was this the first piece you put out for court?
I think that was the very first,

219
00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.830
that was the very first piece.
Okay.
So the title of the piece,
as I said,

220
00:13:36.831 --> 00:13:41.410
it was high price of steel.
Yeah.
This one was different.
This one was,
um,
uh,

221
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.230
this one was about Kanye and Candice.
This was right.
Right.

222
00:13:44.231 --> 00:13:47.470
So this one got more traction.
The one that you're,
uh,
sorry.

223
00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.150
<v 1>Okay.
So I think this is so I don't think I was,</v>

224
00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:54.320
you are on my radar right from that one.
Although that probably that whole thing,

225
00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:57.610
the whole kind of thing just sort of broke in such a crazy way though.

226
00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:01.670
There were so many pieces written.
Um,
okay.
So let's back up then.

227
00:14:01.671 --> 00:14:04.160
So then when you write this piece about Kanye in Kansas,
now,
you know,

228
00:14:04.161 --> 00:14:07.880
Kansas is a friend of mine.
She's been on the show.
Uh,
I like her.

229
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:10.820
She has some tactics that are,
that are not my thing,

230
00:14:10.821 --> 00:14:15.350
but that that's her thing and I can disagree with people and all that.
Um,

231
00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:20.660
your basic feeling though,
this was a net good no matter what.
Um,

232
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:24.380
are there risks though in,
uh,
you know,

233
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:28.670
taking somebody like a Kanye and having that be the moment that wakes up people

234
00:14:28.671 --> 00:14:31.340
because you don't know where he's ever going to go with things where it's just

235
00:14:31.341 --> 00:14:32.630
the action itself.
Enough

236
00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.530
<v 2>I get,
I guess time will tell.</v>

237
00:14:34.531 --> 00:14:38.730
I think it is inconvenient that Kanye,

238
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.030
I love his music and,
and I've been a fan for a long time,

239
00:14:42.031 --> 00:14:46.410
but he clearly has some narcissistic element to his personality.

240
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.500
He,

241
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:52.500
he's clearly not someone who deeply researches the subjects that,

242
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.500
that he sometimes talks about.

243
00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:59.960
So he kind of took a very blunt sledge hammer to a taboo,
which I appreciated.

244
00:14:59.961 --> 00:15:01.760
But there are,
there are serious downsides to that.

245
00:15:01.761 --> 00:15:06.020
Namely when he says that slavery was slavery was a choice.

246
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:10.850
Something that ignorant seems to discredit his taking the sledge hammer to the

247
00:15:10.851 --> 00:15:14.630
taboo when I do think they're separable in principal.
I also think

248
00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:17.430
<v 1>when he said,
you're talking about when he said that on TMZ,
right?
Yes.</v>

249
00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:19.730
And his counter argument to that was that he means that it's,

250
00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:22.590
it was sort of a mindset.
Yeah.
I think was his counter.
Yeah.

251
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:26.060
<v 2>Right.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
So it just,</v>

252
00:15:26.061 --> 00:15:30.710
that that sound byte reads so awfully because it seems so uninformed regardless

253
00:15:30.711 --> 00:15:34.190
of what his,
his intent was there that it can,

254
00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:39.220
it can seem to discredit that he did a good thing on the net on net balance.

255
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:43.310
Yeah.
And yeah,
I also,
I,
you know,
I have,

256
00:15:43.311 --> 00:15:46.240
I have reservations about cat cat as owners as well.
I've,

257
00:15:46.241 --> 00:15:50.720
I've seen her a reason in ways that I think don't make much sense,

258
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:55.700
although I have some points of agreement with her too.
But like I said,
I think I,

259
00:15:55.710 --> 00:16:00.710
I think there is a taboo that is incredibly strong right there.

260
00:16:00.921 --> 00:16:04.870
There are lots of black people who agree with some version of,

261
00:16:04.871 --> 00:16:09.871
of my takes on race and are absolutely mortified to say so because there's this

262
00:16:10.701 --> 00:16:11.510
massive taboo.

263
00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:15.560
<v 1>Yeah.
And that's also why for again,
whatever my disagreements are with Candace,</v>

264
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:20.390
it's like I see her as someone that's trying so desperately to break something.

265
00:16:20.391 --> 00:16:22.040
The very thing that you're talking about.

266
00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:26.990
So it's like if she's using tactics that maybe I wouldn't use or you know,

267
00:16:26.991 --> 00:16:31.580
tweets in a,
in a more hostile way at people or whatever that I would do.

268
00:16:31.581 --> 00:16:35.510
It's like I don't know that I am the one that shouldn't be telling you how to

269
00:16:35.511 --> 00:16:38.990
behave in that regard.
Yeah.
Does that make sense to you?

270
00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:40.561
<v 2>Not so much.</v>

271
00:16:40.561 --> 00:16:45.561
Only because I feel like there are a lot of people who might like what Candice

272
00:16:46.531 --> 00:16:50.940
says on race.
For example,
someone Candace says,
you know,
to go,

273
00:16:50.941 --> 00:16:52.320
it goes to a college and says,

274
00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:57.000
[inaudible] sees all of all of these black students reminding her of the history

275
00:16:57.001 --> 00:17:01.860
of Jim Crow,
which they didn't even experience and using that as,

276
00:17:01.861 --> 00:17:05.400
as as a rhetorical weapon.
And Candice says,
listen,

277
00:17:05.401 --> 00:17:09.450
you were born in 1990 right,
I completely agree with that.
That is,

278
00:17:09.451 --> 00:17:11.520
that is a message that needs to be hammered home,

279
00:17:11.521 --> 00:17:16.050
which is that histories in the past.
And we have to be getting past history.

280
00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:20.880
But you know,
when she says that you're on the democratic plantation,

281
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:25.650
I think that is a kind of exaggeration that is not useful because people with a

282
00:17:25.651 --> 00:17:27.270
different set of intellectual priors,

283
00:17:27.271 --> 00:17:32.190
we'll just hear that and be immediately closed off to,
to whatever else she says.

284
00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:33.340
And you know,

285
00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:37.740
I've also heard her just reason in ways on Joe Rogan for example,

286
00:17:37.741 --> 00:17:39.270
when he pressed her on climate change,

287
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:44.990
you kind of appealing to a sort of feeling over facts kind of way of thinking,

288
00:17:46.771 --> 00:17:51.060
which is actually quite characteristic of far left.
But yeah,
she,

289
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:55.200
I think she also gets treated unfairly and she gets assumed to be a sellout.

290
00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:58.590
Um,
which I think is,
is,
is,
is ridiculous,

291
00:17:58.591 --> 00:18:01.590
ridiculous assumption to make about people in general unless they make it

292
00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.710
absolutely clear that they are.
So I'd be,
you know,
she's,

293
00:18:04.711 --> 00:18:07.530
she's someone I would be happy to talk to at some point,
but

294
00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:10.700
<v 1>I'm happy to set that up if you'd like to make it happen.
Okay.</v>

295
00:18:10.701 --> 00:18:11.870
So you write this piece.

296
00:18:11.871 --> 00:18:14.300
Now this is the first public piece that you've written about this stuff.

297
00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:18.940
Did you have any idea what kind of reaction you were in store for?

298
00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:23.440
<v 2>No.
No.
Walk me through that moment.
Um,
yeah,</v>

299
00:18:23.441 --> 00:18:28.441
I think it got retweeted by Christina Hoff Summers and Jordan Peterson and Sam

300
00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:34.240
Harris and some other people and it really,
really blew up.
And uh,

301
00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:38.500
yeah,
I that was psychologically distressing because,

302
00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.750
you know,
I'm a normal person,

303
00:18:40.751 --> 00:18:44.900
so when I go from having 50 Twitter followers to 10,000 and yeah,

304
00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:46.990
in a week or something like that,

305
00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:52.420
that is a pretty life deranging moment.
And uh,
it was,

306
00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:55.300
it was just kind of physical stress,

307
00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:59.260
a low level physical stress all day and not sleeping as much,
but you,
you get,

308
00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:04.000
I think you get,
you'd be surprised what you can get used to.
Um,
so

309
00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:04.681
<v 1>we were,</v>

310
00:19:04.681 --> 00:19:08.640
you shocked were you were getting defense from and where are you were getting

311
00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:12.270
outrage from or I assume you expected it at least at some level.

312
00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:14.370
<v 2>Yeah.
No,
I don't think I was shocked by that.
I mean,</v>

313
00:19:14.371 --> 00:19:19.371
I knew at this point I knew at this point exactly who would be very pissed off

314
00:19:20.341 --> 00:19:25.320
by,
by my,
my opinions.
And at this point I had resigned myself to,

315
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:29.790
to be to those people being pissed off at me.
And No,
I'm not,
I mean,

316
00:19:29.791 --> 00:19:32.970
I'm not surprised that they're quote IDW types,
uh,

317
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.350
liked my work because I like a lot of their work.
Um,
so no,

318
00:19:37.351 --> 00:19:39.450
I guess that wasn't,
that wasn't so surprising.

319
00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:43.330
<v 1>Yeah.
So when you then wrote the piece,
the high price of state,</v>

320
00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:45.490
the high price of steel grievances,

321
00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:49.150
which was also in quilt that you started with a quote from felonious monk that I

322
00:19:49.151 --> 00:19:51.730
thought was sort of worth diving into here,

323
00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:54.730
they tried to get me to hate white people,

324
00:19:54.731 --> 00:19:57.250
but someone would always come along and spoil it.

325
00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:02.710
There's something about that quote that strikes me as so relevant to what's

326
00:20:02.711 --> 00:20:07.711
going on right now that we are not looking at people as individuals and that

327
00:20:07.961 --> 00:20:08.860
every time you do,

328
00:20:08.861 --> 00:20:13.570
you will be pleasantly surprised because most people are not walking around in

329
00:20:13.571 --> 00:20:15.280
this state of hate.

330
00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:20.420
<v 2>Yeah,
yeah.
No,
I think it's striking.
I mean,
I,
and I,
I,
I,</v>

331
00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.580
I,
um,
juxtapose that quote with another from the New York Times,

332
00:20:25.581 --> 00:20:28.670
from a New York Times op Ed published last year,
uh,

333
00:20:28.671 --> 00:20:33.671
which argued that black children should be taught to fear white children based

334
00:20:34.191 --> 00:20:38.030
on the history of racism in this country.
Uh,
and the quote was,

335
00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:41.900
as against our gauzy national hopes,
I will teach my boys,

336
00:20:41.901 --> 00:20:46.220
my black boys to have profound doubts that friendship with white people as

337
00:20:46.221 --> 00:20:50.770
possible.
Right?
So that got published in The New York Times in 2017.

338
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:54.970
Uh,
you know,
Sarah Jon got hired,
uh,
having,

339
00:20:54.971 --> 00:20:59.971
having written incredibly nasty tweets about white people in 2018 by the New

340
00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.010
York Times,
right?
It's,
it's,

341
00:21:03.011 --> 00:21:05.920
it's disturbing to me that you can't,

342
00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:11.080
you can't really find at this point on the left,
even on the mainstream left,

343
00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:16.740
just the simple articulation that a person's race does not matter to their moral

344
00:21:19.211 --> 00:21:24.160
worthiness to their intellectual worthiness.
It is,
it is an irrelevant character.

345
00:21:24.161 --> 00:21:27.730
You can't find the language of,
of,

346
00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:32.760
of appeals to colorblind humanity virtually anywhere on the left at this point.

347
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.790
Um,
that,
that is disturbing to me.

348
00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:41.450
<v 1>How shocking is it to you?
Because I think people are still kind of shocked,</v>

349
00:21:41.451 --> 00:21:41.631
you know,

350
00:21:41.631 --> 00:21:45.830
I've been banging this drum for quite some time and I think I see people waking

351
00:21:45.831 --> 00:21:49.520
up to it now and I'm like,
man,
how didn't you see this?
You know,
these,

352
00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:53.330
these last couple of years because it's so obvious to me that we've gotten here.

353
00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:54.080
Yeah,
yeah.

354
00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:58.550
<v 2>No,
it is shy.
Me,
I,
I do remember growing up,
you know,
in the,</v>

355
00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.960
in the public school system,

356
00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:04.580
in my town we would have Martin Luther King Day assemblies is very diverse town,

357
00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:09.110
maybe 25 30% black and 60% white.
And we would,

358
00:22:09.111 --> 00:22:11.510
we would get the,
you know,
the,

359
00:22:11.511 --> 00:22:16.511
I have a dream speech style ethic around what it means to be a human and how

360
00:22:17.571 --> 00:22:20.540
important or unimportant one skin color is.

361
00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.820
And it seemed like such a,

362
00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:27.770
it seems like there's such a good argument to me and it is the best argument

363
00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:31.520
with regard to people's,
you know,
the,
the assumed,

364
00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:33.493
I guess

365
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.500
w w w what I mean to say here is that I've been in spaces at Columbia for

366
00:22:39.501 --> 00:22:43.190
example,
or conversations where my being black,

367
00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:46.400
it was obvious to me that there was an assumption of,

368
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000
of moral worthiness or have a kind of heightened moral knowledge that I would

369
00:22:53.571 --> 00:22:56.930
have as a black person that a white person wouldn't have.

370
00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.740
And you know,
I think,
I think,

371
00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:02.870
I'm not the first to make this analogy of course,

372
00:23:02.871 --> 00:23:07.610
but the real religious analogy and the analogy to original sin is pretty apt.

373
00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:12.170
Um,
because it,
I mean the,
the way though,

374
00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:16.670
this has a lot to do with black history also because the way I,
the way I see it,

375
00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:20.720
they're kind of two ways to study history.
There's the conventional way,
which is,

376
00:23:20.721 --> 00:23:22.190
you know,
you study World War One,

377
00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:26.510
you study the causes and consequences read different takes on,
on,

378
00:23:26.511 --> 00:23:30.230
on the significance.
And once you've studied,
all you need to know,

379
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:32.210
you move on to the next topic.

380
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:37.310
But then there's a religious way of studying history,
which is,

381
00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:42.230
it's not enough to know the facts.
We have to go somewhere on Sunday,
every,

382
00:23:42.231 --> 00:23:44.480
you know,
every single week and learn,

383
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:49.190
talk about same stories over and over again.
So this is,
you know,
it's,

384
00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:52.790
it's the difference between how an atheist learns about the life of Jesus and

385
00:23:52.791 --> 00:23:56.540
how a Christian learns about the life of Jesus Jesus and relearn it every week

386
00:23:56.541 --> 00:23:59.000
for the rest of their life.
In my view,

387
00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:02.330
how we're looking at the history of race relations in this country,

388
00:24:02.331 --> 00:24:03.350
the history of racism,

389
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:08.030
we are more and more putting it in the religious category of history where,

390
00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:09.380
you know,

391
00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:14.380
I can read a piece about the history of lynching in the New York Times almost

392
00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.850
once every two or three months.
Right.
And let me,

393
00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:22.820
lynching is a decades old crime at this point.
And Avi,
I mean,
Jesus,

394
00:24:22.821 --> 00:24:27.290
Great.
Obviously it was a,
a heinous staying on,
on this country's legacy,

395
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.341
you know?

396
00:24:28.341 --> 00:24:33.230
But then the number of deaths that that is is the highest amount quoted in New

397
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:36.920
York Times with regard to how many black people were lynched in this country is

398
00:24:36.921 --> 00:24:39.890
around 4,000,
right.
Every single year.

399
00:24:39.891 --> 00:24:44.420
Twice that many black people die of homicide.
And I,

400
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:47.360
you just don't even hear about that in the New York Times.

401
00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:49.270
<v 1>So what do you make of the fact then?</v>

402
00:24:49.271 --> 00:24:52.350
So this is something that like a Sean Hannity,
he'll talk about,
he'll,

403
00:24:52.351 --> 00:24:54.800
he'll say that exact thing and now if you say,

404
00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:58.900
and then people will say that somehow that makes him racist cause he's focusing

405
00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:01.150
on black on black crime or something like that.

406
00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.910
So how do we have that conversation then?

407
00:25:03.911 --> 00:25:06.640
Because I think partly what's happening is the outreach,
you know,

408
00:25:06.641 --> 00:25:10.270
someone mentions it,
he happens to be someone obviously on the right.
Uh,

409
00:25:10.271 --> 00:25:12.680
I don't know what his intentions are.
I don't know the guy,
but he's,

410
00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.620
he's at least talking about it.
What you just said,

411
00:25:14.621 --> 00:25:18.490
people aren't talking about it.
Yes.
But then pays a heavy price to talk about it.

412
00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:22.120
That then has the chill effect that it's like people are like,
all right,

413
00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:23.500
I'm not going to talk about it.

414
00:25:23.501 --> 00:25:28.501
So we can look at the crime statistics in Chicago every week and you should care

415
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.320
about these statistics where there's people are white or black or whatever,

416
00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:33.460
but people are just like,

417
00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.490
I don't want to touch it because I don't want these labels.

418
00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:40.700
<v 2>Yeah,
it is,
it is decidedly.
I mean this is one of the reasons why,</v>

419
00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:42.370
you know,
I'm,

420
00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:47.370
I don't see myself as a natural ally to a canvas Owens for example,

421
00:25:47.871 --> 00:25:52.430
because there are so many other things that she says that,

422
00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.250
uh,
you know,
that,
that I don't agree with.

423
00:25:55.280 --> 00:26:00.280
And I guess it's the Sean Hannity problem too because if you can't criticize a

424
00:26:02.211 --> 00:26:04.780
Sean Hannity or Candice Owens for all of the things that,

425
00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:08.660
that they're saying that are unjustified by the evidence,

426
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:12.920
it's Candice Kaye Candice's case.
It might be climate change or,

427
00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:17.690
or whatever it is,
um,
for Sean Hannity could,
could be other things.

428
00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:23.590
Then I guess you just have to be able to make these subtle distinctions.

429
00:26:24.651 --> 00:26:27.200
But at the end of the day,

430
00:26:27.201 --> 00:26:32.201
homicide is the leading cause of death for young black men aged 15 to 34

431
00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.680
according to the CDC.

432
00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:38.220
It is not the leading cause of homicide for any other race or,

433
00:26:38.221 --> 00:26:40.190
or age group.
Um,

434
00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.720
can we talk about that?
I mean,

435
00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:49.860
is it the case that we're where we're so close to white people turning the hoses

436
00:26:51.001 --> 00:26:55.650
on us again
to the Sean Hannity is and,

437
00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:59.560
and they're supposedly deplorable.
Um,
yeah.

438
00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:04.860
Followers that that were just so the threat of white supremacy is so ever

439
00:27:05.731 --> 00:27:10.731
present of resurgent white supremacy that we can't talk about the leading cause

440
00:27:11.221 --> 00:27:14.490
of death among young black men,
that,

441
00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:17.310
that that is not sustainable.
Amy,
the,

442
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:22.230
the fundamental problem I see with how the left in general thinks about race is

443
00:27:22.231 --> 00:27:27.231
that the concerns about race and racism are totally unattached to the degree to

444
00:27:31.441 --> 00:27:34.350
which black people are suffering on any given issue.
Right?

445
00:27:34.351 --> 00:27:37.560
So we're talking about the leading cause of death for young black men.

446
00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:42.180
And I never read about this in the New York Times and I,
and I know that I won't,

447
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:46.200
right?
So this is,
this is a problem that is central.
It is.

448
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:50.500
It is bigger than the problem with police violence.
It is bigger than you know.

449
00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:52.640
Then the problem of microaggressions,

450
00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:57.680
it is bigger than the problems of of systemic bias and yet there is,

451
00:27:59.521 --> 00:28:02.660
there's virtually no concern for this on the left because the,
the,

452
00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:07.720
the way I see many progressives think about race issues is a perpetrator side

453
00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:14.010
concern,
which is if the perpetrators of the problem are white,

454
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:15.270
that it's worth talking about.

455
00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:18.900
If the perpetrators of the problem happened to be black and it's not,

456
00:28:18.901 --> 00:28:19.530
we're talking about,

457
00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:23.490
the problem with that is that it's untethered to any concern for the level of

458
00:28:23.491 --> 00:28:25.500
suffering on this side,
on the victim side.

459
00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:30.950
<v 1>Do you think it's a fair estimation to see this is the new racism in a weird</v>

460
00:28:30.951 --> 00:28:34.640
way,
like it's,
it's almost uncomfortable to say it,
but I had a,

461
00:28:34.641 --> 00:28:36.830
an educator in the UK here in the summer,

462
00:28:36.831 --> 00:28:39.770
Katherine verbal sing and that's basically what she said,

463
00:28:39.771 --> 00:28:41.870
that these people are now the racists,

464
00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:46.820
that the racist ideas of the day are actually coming out of the left now.

465
00:28:46.821 --> 00:28:49.670
I don't want to use the same tactics.
Right.
I don't want to sit here and be like,

466
00:28:49.671 --> 00:28:51.680
they're all racist and blah,
blah,
blah,

467
00:28:51.681 --> 00:28:53.630
because we know that that doesn't really get us anywhere.
Yeah.

468
00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:56.090
The general idea of that,

469
00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.720
do you think that that's a fair way to frame [inaudible]

470
00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.960
<v 2>things?
I wouldn't frame it.
I mean,</v>

471
00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:05.760
the way I would frame it is that there is a kind of racism on the left and it's

472
00:29:05.761 --> 00:29:10.680
the kind of racism where the New York Times higher hires a writer who says that,

473
00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:14.820
who celebrates the idea that white people stopped breeding.
Right.

474
00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:19.380
And doesn't apologize for it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No concern with how that,

475
00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:24.440
how that's going to translate to no white people in this country who have vastly

476
00:29:24.511 --> 00:29:28.110
less privileged than the,
you know,
the tech writer at the New York Times.

477
00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:31.510
<v 1>And what about that statement that they issued defending her?
Yeah,</v>

478
00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:34.960
you saw that where it said something about the hate she gets as a young Asian

479
00:29:34.961 --> 00:29:35.830
woman and it's like

480
00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:39.440
<v 2>what?
That that's now a new thing that you can,</v>

481
00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:43.710
that you get to be racist because gotten trolled online.
Well,
you know,

482
00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:47.620
I mean that,
so coming back to the question that is that that is,

483
00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:50.140
I'm happy to call that a kind of racism for sure.

484
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:55.060
It's the only reason I would say there I wouldn't go as far as to say they are

485
00:29:55.061 --> 00:29:58.930
the new racist is because there are still racist on the other side and I fully

486
00:29:58.931 --> 00:30:03.700
expect there to always be some amount of racist in society and some amount of

487
00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:08.530
racist incidents like the way this is another problem with the way many on the

488
00:30:08.531 --> 00:30:11.300
left think about race is that they,

489
00:30:11.301 --> 00:30:14.080
they tend to view the problem of racism.

490
00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.990
Kind of like we view the problem with smallpox,

491
00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:22.080
which is to say something that can be fully eradicated down to the very last

492
00:30:22.211 --> 00:30:23.110
person who has it.

493
00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:28.060
And then we can put a date on the time when smallpox is no longer a problem

494
00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:30.130
forever.
Whereas I,

495
00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:35.190
and I would argue anyone who's really thinking rationally about this problem

496
00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:40.420
should view racism as more,
more like a problem like murder,
right?

497
00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:44.890
Like the murder rate in New York City's to be 10 times higher than it was today.

498
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:50.190
Just 20 years ago it was,
it was absolute carnage.
So the,
the rate is,

499
00:30:50.191 --> 00:30:51.610
it's come down tenfold.

500
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:56.710
New York is notoriously safe at this point is something like 200 murders,

501
00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.660
two or 300 murders last year.
Right.

502
00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:03.010
What would it take to get the murder rate down to zero to the point where there

503
00:31:03.011 --> 00:31:06.220
was not a single murder in New York City,
you'd probably have a murder everybody.

504
00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:07.740
Yes.
You have to get,

505
00:31:07.741 --> 00:31:12.741
I mean you have to embrace a totally totalitarian vibe from the top down.

506
00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:16.360
It could be done,
but it would not be worth what it took to get there.

507
00:31:16.361 --> 00:31:20.470
You'd hit diminishing returns.
So I view the problem of reducing racism,

508
00:31:20.471 --> 00:31:24.370
reducing racist incidents against black people as a problem,

509
00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:26.260
like homicide rather than smallpox,

510
00:31:26.261 --> 00:31:30.040
which is to say you can certainly reduce it and we have massively,

511
00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:34.090
but there was a point at which in a country of 350 million,

512
00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:38.160
there will always be enough people who are racist to,

513
00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:42.730
to justify a certain amount of racist incidents and to fight it beyond that,

514
00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:45.310
endlessly you hit diminishing returns.

515
00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:49.120
<v 1>Yeah.
And also that it's depressing and it kind of sucks,</v>

516
00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:52.780
but people can be racist.
Like privately,

517
00:31:52.781 --> 00:31:54.490
you can be racist now.

518
00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:59.700
You can't discriminate against people and there's all sorts of reasons that you

519
00:31:59.711 --> 00:32:04.270
can't bring that into public life,
but in your own mind,

520
00:32:04.271 --> 00:32:07.780
in your own home,
you can be,
I would prefer people not be,

521
00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:11.890
but that they're trying to eradicate like something that's actually just part of

522
00:32:11.891 --> 00:32:13.180
the mind.
Yeah.
You want to,

523
00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.960
you want to educate people enough so that they hopefully won't hold those views,

524
00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:20.500
but that is the diminishing returns because you're literally going to be in

525
00:32:20.501 --> 00:32:21.990
people's houses at that,

526
00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:27.310
<v 2>right?
Yeah.
I mean,
yeah,
it's a,
it's a question of not.
Yeah.
I mean,</v>

527
00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:29.600
I guess there's a question of what your view of human nature is.

528
00:32:29.601 --> 00:32:34.601
This comes down to very fundamental pillars of one's a political ideology,

529
00:32:35.061 --> 00:32:39.950
which is do you have a kind of Utopian view of human nature where there's

530
00:32:39.951 --> 00:32:42.470
nothing tragic about us,
nothing flawed about us,

531
00:32:42.471 --> 00:32:47.471
and all of the flaws come from bad ideas in the culture and humans are naturally

532
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:52.670
poised to be just perfectly selfless until we get ruined by society.

533
00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:56.240
They see that,
that I think there's no reason to believe that at this point,

534
00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:56.660
right?

535
00:32:56.660 --> 00:33:01.660
Like chimpanzees and murder and like there were animals in the animal kingdom.

536
00:33:02.061 --> 00:33:07.061
It's not to say that where our human nature is fundamentally evil either it's,

537
00:33:07.331 --> 00:33:11.270
it's clearly there's a,
there's a wide range of potential there,
but there's no,

538
00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:15.200
no reason to assume that we're evolved to be not racists or that were evolved to

539
00:33:15.201 --> 00:33:17.330
be,
um,
you know,

540
00:33:17.331 --> 00:33:22.331
woke perfectly woke or that it's possible to get to a point where everyone in

541
00:33:23.271 --> 00:33:28.271
society has been fully purged of every ounce of evil in their heart.

542
00:33:29.001 --> 00:33:33.920
I mean,
that is such a utopian outlook.
And like I said,

543
00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:37.130
the,
the,
to the extent that you're fixated on that goal,

544
00:33:37.131 --> 00:33:40.420
to the exclusion of the costs of your fixation,
you,

545
00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:42.170
once you hit diminishing returns,

546
00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:45.920
you will be fighting a fight that is a net bad for society.

547
00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:46.570
<v 1>All right,</v>

548
00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:51.490
let's talk about systemic racism or at least the idea of systemic racism.

549
00:33:51.491 --> 00:33:56.470
So I think you've seen the video of me about two or two and a half years ago

550
00:33:56.471 --> 00:33:59.050
with Larry elder and I brought up systemic racism.

551
00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:03.220
Larry elder proceeded to commit a hate crime on me,
a white man.

552
00:34:03.221 --> 00:34:06.570
He beat me senseless with statistics.
Yeah.

553
00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:11.800
And I came to a fight not ready to fight basically.

554
00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:16.420
And that was definitely one of my red pill moments,
so to speak.

555
00:34:16.450 --> 00:34:20.590
I was not prepared.
I heard new information.
I did research after that.

556
00:34:20.591 --> 00:34:24.640
Subsequently,
I've had many people on this show and many conversations,
uh,

557
00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:29.860
that have led me to more of Larry's original premise.
Um,

558
00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:33.910
so I guess first when you,
when you saw that moment,
uh,

559
00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:36.040
was that the first time you'd ever seen me do anything?

560
00:34:36.041 --> 00:34:37.900
Cause that's what a lot of people telling me.
And I'm like,
oh,

561
00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:39.880
<v 2>I don't think it was the first time.
But I think,</v>

562
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000
I mean I don't envy anyone who is debating Larry elder on anything.

563
00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:46.450
He's,
he's pretty devastating.

564
00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:51.200
<v 1>It must have been kind of refreshing though when you saw this moment where he</v>

565
00:34:51.201 --> 00:34:55.100
laid it out and you know there was no counter cause there is no counter.
Right,

566
00:34:55.101 --> 00:34:55.650
right.

567
00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:58.140
<v 2>Well yeah,
he,
he,
what he did with you there is he,</v>

568
00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:03.440
he went through each specific venue in which supposedly there is this big

569
00:35:04.651 --> 00:35:09.651
systemic racism problem where the system is rigged in such a way that it doesn't

570
00:35:10.051 --> 00:35:14.610
require any individual in the system to be racist in order for the system to

571
00:35:14.611 --> 00:35:19.500
spit out racist outcomes.
That's essentially the idea of systemic racism.

572
00:35:19.501 --> 00:35:22.920
So he went,
he went with you through,
he said,
just name,

573
00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:27.950
name a place in society where you think systemic racism exists and he just di Ba

574
00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:33.630
ba basically destroyed each one with the specifics of,
of the case.

575
00:35:33.631 --> 00:35:38.430
And I'm not going to do a better job than he did there and he's capable of
doing.

576
00:35:38.431 --> 00:35:43.431
But there's a bigger picture way to test this systemic racism hypothesis,

577
00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:48.500
which is to take two populations where it's,

578
00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:51.390
it's a very messy crude science experiment.

579
00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:55.980
But to take two populations where you're holding systemic racism,
constant,

580
00:35:56.340 --> 00:36:00.480
namely black Americans like myself and black immigrants,

581
00:36:00.481 --> 00:36:03.960
especially black immigrants from the West indies and their children.

582
00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:06.780
They're talking about immigrants from Jamaica,
Barbados,

583
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:10.890
other places in the West indies and specifically their children.

584
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:12.300
They're American born children.

585
00:36:12.301 --> 00:36:16.260
So these are people you could not tell apart from black.

586
00:36:16.261 --> 00:36:19.440
Like you couldn't tell if I didn't tell you that I wasn't the child of a

587
00:36:19.441 --> 00:36:23.820
Jamaican immigrant or something.
Right.
And you find the,

588
00:36:23.821 --> 00:36:28.290
the thing about these is that these two populations differ in many ways.
Some,

589
00:36:28.291 --> 00:36:31.920
some,
some ways are very hard to quantify,
but they differ culturally.

590
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:35.140
They differ for all kinds of reasons.
Um,

591
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:39.510
because partially because the kind of immigrant who gets out of a Jamaica

592
00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:43.350
differs systematically is going to be disproportionately intelligent,

593
00:36:43.351 --> 00:36:44.730
disproportionately hardworking,

594
00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:48.690
whatever the traits are that get you from Jamaica to New York,

595
00:36:48.691 --> 00:36:53.691
say that's a cluster of attributes that that makes that population differ.

596
00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:57.300
But there's,
there's one thing that is not different,

597
00:36:57.301 --> 00:37:02.301
which is they're subjected to whatever level of systemic racism exists.

598
00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:07.250
So Thomas Soul has done good work on it.

599
00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:10.470
Back in the 70s,
he showed that,
uh,

600
00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:14.700
second generation west Indian west Indians living in the same city as black

601
00:37:14.701 --> 00:37:18.930
Americans were earning 58% more,
right?
So they're,

602
00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:23.580
they're both being treated to whatever degree badly by white people there.

603
00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:24.690
Whatever this,

604
00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:28.890
whatever system you want to suppose is holding people back is equally affecting

605
00:37:28.891 --> 00:37:30.420
both of them.
Uh,

606
00:37:30.421 --> 00:37:35.421
the Columbia sociologist van Tran has a great essay in which,

607
00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:39.210
uh,
um,
this,
this difference is brought out.

608
00:37:39.211 --> 00:37:41.670
You find neighborhoods of,

609
00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:46.470
of black Americans right next to neighborhoods of black west Indians in New
York.

610
00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:51.340
They're equally segregated from white people.
So it gets rid of,
you know,
this,

611
00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:54.600
the,
the idea that being segregated by seller,

612
00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:59.630
living around people who only look like you is inherently a,
um,

613
00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:02.130
uh,
a disadvantage.
Um,

614
00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:06.250
it gets around the policing issue because these populations are being police.

615
00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:09.690
The police can't tell the difference between a second generation west Indian
and,

616
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:11.063
and a black person.

617
00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:16.070
It gets around whatever level of systemic racism is or isn't in,

618
00:38:16.241 --> 00:38:18.960
in the pipeline with regard to schools.

619
00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:22.710
And you find wildly different outcomes.
You find,
you know,

620
00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:24.750
rate of high school graduation,

621
00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:29.700
much higher for black west Indians of rate of enrollment in college,

622
00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:30.563
much higher.

623
00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:35.770
We may rate of professional occupations much higher crime,
lower,

624
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.220
right.
So this suggests to me that there are,

625
00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:44.480
that the role of systemic racism tool to whatever degree it exists is,

626
00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:48.670
is minimal at this point.
Uh,
and the,
the,
the,

627
00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:53.200
there's a whole narrative built around the idea that this is the primary

628
00:38:53.201 --> 00:38:57.470
obstacle facing black people.
And it's worth noting.
I don't,

629
00:38:57.530 --> 00:39:01.730
I don't think most black people actually believe this because I mean there,

630
00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:05.890
there are various poles to site here,
but there's,
there's one from Pew that,

631
00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:10.930
that asked black people without high,
without college educations has,

632
00:39:10.931 --> 00:39:14.950
has raised.
How has your race held you back at all in life?
60% said no.

633
00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:19.480
That's a recent pew poll.
Another Gallup poll asked his bias,

634
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:23.110
the main issue facing you in,
in,
in jobs and housing.

635
00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:27.760
60% again said no.
The,
uh,
the Harvard sociologist,

636
00:39:27.761 --> 00:39:31.540
Ethan Foss has done extensive polling of the black community and found that

637
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:33.790
disconnected black youth,

638
00:39:33.791 --> 00:39:38.260
which are black youth without who aren't in schools and don't have a jobs.

639
00:39:38.261 --> 00:39:41.860
The people on the lowest rung of society,
something,

640
00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:45.940
something around 30% of them think the system is rigged and 70% don't.

641
00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:47.011
So what,

642
00:39:47.011 --> 00:39:50.170
what we're getting is we're getting the voices of black people who believe the

643
00:39:50.171 --> 00:39:54.250
systemic racism narrative promoted to the,

644
00:39:54.251 --> 00:39:58.660
to the most powerful,
uh,
media positions in our country.

645
00:39:58.661 --> 00:40:02.530
So we're getting the impression that this is a uniform view and it's not.
Right.

646
00:40:02.531 --> 00:40:05.600
So this is sort of the Jesse Jackson's Al Sharp.

647
00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:10.000
They get moved up because they're given sort of simple answers.
So I guess it,

648
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:12.550
it Harkins the question then I can ask this either way.

649
00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:17.290
What is it that the west Indian immigrants are doing right?

650
00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:21.490
Or what is it that the other folks are doing wrong?
Yeah,

651
00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:26.770
I mean you can answer that in either direction.
Sure.
Well,
partly,
I mean,

652
00:40:26.771 --> 00:40:31.670
part of it is just immigration selection factors that I mentioned,
right?
So the,

653
00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:36.250
the kind of Jamaican or Barbadian who makes it off the island to New York did

654
00:40:36.251 --> 00:40:40.080
likely to be disproportionately hardworking,
disproportional,

655
00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:44.050
disproportionately x for whatever x factor is.

656
00:40:44.051 --> 00:40:46.300
And so in that sense,

657
00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:49.420
the direct comparison can be misleading,

658
00:40:49.421 --> 00:40:54.220
but it just analyzing why these two populations differ.

659
00:40:54.221 --> 00:40:58.930
You Find West Indian immigrants,
uh,
more likely to come from a two parent home.

660
00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.660
Um,
you know,
more likely to have,

661
00:41:01.661 --> 00:41:06.661
have had a more classically socially conservative upbringing,

662
00:41:06.701 --> 00:41:10.990
which is,
you know,
you don't talk back to your parents.
Parents are rather strict.

663
00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:16.280
There are downsides of course,
to that style of parenting.
But,
um,

664
00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:21.410
it basically what I'm saying is that there are cultural factors that are

665
00:41:21.431 --> 00:41:25.890
important that differ between these two groups.
Right?
And you find if there,

666
00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:27.880
there,
there are many,
I mean this is,

667
00:41:27.881 --> 00:41:31.000
this is where the conversation for many people get to especially uncomfortable,

668
00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:33.920
right?
It's the idea that every culture,

669
00:41:33.921 --> 00:41:37.940
every subculture is identical in the behave behavioral patterns that are

670
00:41:37.941 --> 00:41:41.280
inculcated and wherever there is some were,

671
00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:43.970
wherever there is a disparity in some outcome,

672
00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:48.710
it's not possible that culture accounts for some or most of,
of that disparity,

673
00:41:48.711 --> 00:41:50.180
which I think is very silly idea.

674
00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:54.150
<v 1>Well,
it's completely nonsensical.
Yeah.
Cultures are different.</v>

675
00:41:54.151 --> 00:41:57.400
Different people in different groups put different emphasis on certain things.

676
00:41:57.401 --> 00:41:59.640
So I'm a little more on families and but more on education,
so,

677
00:41:59.641 --> 00:42:03.360
but more on sports or whatever the hell,
whatever the hell it is.

678
00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:06.630
So when you hear Larry elder make the argument,
you know,

679
00:42:06.631 --> 00:42:11.560
something around until 1972,
the black family had a higher rate of,

680
00:42:11.561 --> 00:42:13.140
of staying in marriages.

681
00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:17.580
And then he lays out the reasons that he believes policies of the Democrats

682
00:42:17.581 --> 00:42:21.900
destroyed,
all that.
That,
that obviously resonates with you,
right?
Because you're,

683
00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:23.490
you're giving me some piece of this,

684
00:42:23.491 --> 00:42:28.491
both answers I think resonate or went back to family rates of marriage and some

685
00:42:29.011 --> 00:42:32.640
sort of conservative ideals.
Well,
yeah,
I mean that's a very complex,

686
00:42:32.641 --> 00:42:35.430
people hate when you talk with,
when anyone talks about this about family,

687
00:42:35.431 --> 00:42:37.810
people just absolutely hate it.
It is the fact

688
00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:39.340
<v 2>that black,
the,</v>

689
00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:44.350
the rate of two parent homes and marriages was pretty similar to the white rate

690
00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:48.370
until the 60s.
Um,
it is,
it is a,

691
00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:52.040
it's a matter of scholarly dispute as to what was the cause it,

692
00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:54.250
I think it's certain at this point there was no one,

693
00:42:54.251 --> 00:42:57.250
cause welfare state may have had something to do with it,

694
00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:02.340
but I think it may have just been changing norms in the culture.
What?

695
00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:04.410
Cause we're seeing the same thing happen in,
in,

696
00:43:04.411 --> 00:43:08.110
in the white working class as well now with the decline of,

697
00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.360
of two parent homes to a lesser extent than,

698
00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:15.140
than has happened in the black community.
Um,
yeah.

699
00:43:15.141 --> 00:43:19.980
So,
so I guess what,
yeah,
so I mean we could talk about some of the,

700
00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:25.060
the most important behavioral patterns that are different between a black

701
00:43:26.561 --> 00:43:30.980
families and white families and Asian families.
Um,
I mean there,

702
00:43:30.981 --> 00:43:33.280
there are some statistics that I,
I just,

703
00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:37.270
I don't see any way in which this could possibly be explained by systemic
racism.

704
00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:38.133
For example.

705
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:43.950
One is that if you ask 13 year olds if they've had their first sexual experience

706
00:43:44.321 --> 00:43:47.470
yet,
you get 9% of of white saying yes,

707
00:43:47.471 --> 00:43:50.290
you get 21% of black people saying yes.
Right?

708
00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:52.510
So it's more than a two fold difference there.

709
00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:56.860
And that has everything to do with family dynamics with,

710
00:43:56.861 --> 00:43:58.750
with there not being two parents in the home.

711
00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:04.080
It is a development issue more than it is an issue of treatment by white people.

712
00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:07.220
Right.
I have another piece in Colette,
uh,

713
00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:11.290
called black American culture and the racial wealth gap where I talk about

714
00:44:11.291 --> 00:44:15.070
spending differences and you,
you,
you know,
Nielsen,

715
00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:17.830
the marketing firm has done,
done research on this,

716
00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:22.630
found that the average black woman is more likely to own a luxury vehicle than

717
00:44:22.631 --> 00:44:23.530
the average white woman,

718
00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:28.630
despite the fact that the average black family has one 10th,
the wealth of,

719
00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:32.670
of,
of the average average white family spending patterns on,

720
00:44:32.671 --> 00:44:37.671
on jewelry and expensive clothes are very different in the black community.

721
00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:42.990
Um,
whatever you want to say about these from an ethical a,
this is not,
I mean,

722
00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:46.320
I'm not good enough.
Want to make an ethical judgment is,
I mean,

723
00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:50.250
I'm not finger wagging at people saying do x,
don't do y.
I'm saying

724
00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:52.381
there are,

725
00:44:52.381 --> 00:44:57.381
there are entire books written by respected left wing scholars about issues

726
00:44:59.011 --> 00:44:59.630
like,
you know,

727
00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:04.630
wealth or income or that just don't mention a single one of these facts as if

728
00:45:06.271 --> 00:45:08.460
it's not relevant.
Right.

729
00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:10.390
<v 1>So what's,</v>

730
00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:14.880
what's the through line then or the connection between all of this and the

731
00:45:14.881 --> 00:45:18.090
welfare state?
Because the more that I've explored these ideas,

732
00:45:18.091 --> 00:45:22.070
the more that I am starting to buy that.
That almost is the,

733
00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:27.060
the real problem here that we've given a certain amount and then it's just human

734
00:45:27.061 --> 00:45:30.480
nature.
People don't want to stop being on the Dole.

735
00:45:30.481 --> 00:45:33.390
That has nothing to do with race.
You could give it to anyone,

736
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:35.850
but in this case we happened to be talking about black Americans,

737
00:45:35.851 --> 00:45:39.710
but I can give you just one simple example,
which is my sister lives in a,

738
00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:41.730
in Manhattan,
not that far from you actually,

739
00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:44.220
and she's in a building that's part subsidized.

740
00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:47.790
So there's a lot of black people in the building that had been there for

741
00:45:47.791 --> 00:45:52.440
generations now that are,
they're subsidized.
My sister and her husband,
two kids,

742
00:45:52.441 --> 00:45:55.080
they're not rolling in dough.
They're paying full market price,

743
00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:57.300
but the people that are in the subsidized housing,

744
00:45:57.570 --> 00:45:59.520
it's almost impossible for them to leave.

745
00:45:59.521 --> 00:46:02.160
I don't even blame them because they're paying next to nothing.

746
00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:06.360
And if they wanted to work more,
they'd probably,
and then get off the subsidies.

747
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:07.223
The subsidies,

748
00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:09.810
they probably have to leave the building in the first place and go live

749
00:46:09.811 --> 00:46:14.160
somewhere worse.
So we end up with this horrific catch 22 that again,

750
00:46:14.161 --> 00:46:16.320
I don't believe,
I don't put this on race.

751
00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:19.830
It just seems to be affecting people of a certain race more.

752
00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:21.940
<v 2>Yes.
I think,
I mean,</v>

753
00:46:21.941 --> 00:46:26.210
I think it's clear that there was a point in,
in,

754
00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:30.220
in the late sixties and seventies where the welfare state was clearly

755
00:46:30.221 --> 00:46:35.221
incentivizing counterproductive behavior disproportionately among black people.

756
00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:40.360
Um,
I mean,
the reason I yeah,
I,
I,
I,
I don't,

757
00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:43.120
I think we need a welfare state.
I think there's,

758
00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:46.360
there's really no free market.

759
00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:49.980
There's no capitalist economy in the world that doesn't have one because they're

760
00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:52.490
just,
and you know,

761
00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:55.990
people's jobs are being taken by automation and that's only going in one

762
00:46:55.991 --> 00:46:56.824
direction.

763
00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:02.280
And we clearly need a welfare state and we need one that doesn't incentivize,

764
00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:07.620
uh,
you know,
counterproductive behavior.
And we haven't always had that.
And Yeah,

765
00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:10.260
<v 1>when you say [inaudible],
you mean some sort of social safety net?</v>

766
00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:11.580
That's what I'm heard.
Yes,
correct.

767
00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:13.140
Because I think people would you say welfare state,

768
00:47:13.141 --> 00:47:14.900
I think people have a different sort of,
kind of

769
00:47:15.130 --> 00:47:16.210
<v 2>perhaps.
Yeah.
I mean it's social.</v>

770
00:47:16.211 --> 00:47:20.530
I mean something that catches the people who can't really can't help themselves,

771
00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:24.940
who can't trade their skills for money in the market.
Yeah.
Yeah.

772
00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:26.080
<v 1>I'm with you.
So,</v>

773
00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:31.110
so then how do we untether the issue of people that are now stuck in that

774
00:47:32.081 --> 00:47:34.800
machine where every time you talk about it,
you're called a racist?

775
00:47:34.850 --> 00:47:35.990
<v 2>No,
I mean this is,
yeah,</v>

776
00:47:35.991 --> 00:47:40.991
it is extremely pernicious because I think it's clear that the welfare state,

777
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:45.650
the way it was rolled out in the sixties and seventies had bad effects for black

778
00:47:45.651 --> 00:47:47.030
people.
Right?
It's,
it's,

779
00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:52.060
it's hard to fully explain the decline in two parent homes without noticing

780
00:47:53.301 --> 00:47:54.160
that,
you know,

781
00:47:54.161 --> 00:47:59.161
a black mother in the early seventies stood to lose money by getting married to

782
00:47:59.541 --> 00:48:03.830
a guy.
Right.
Because of the perverse incentives of the welfare state.
That said,

783
00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:09.760
it's not just because the welfare state was one of the causes of the decline of

784
00:48:11.181 --> 00:48:14.300
the black family doesn't imply that taking it away would repair it.

785
00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:19.040
So I think,
I think that is something like Charles Murray,
for example,

786
00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:23.300
the big book in the 80s that made him big losing ground,

787
00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:26.600
which criticized the welfare state very much along these grounds,

788
00:48:26.601 --> 00:48:30.140
but I think even he has acknowledged that at this point,

789
00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:34.490
removing it once you've set it all into motion,

790
00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:39.610
it's not obvious that removing it is a cure,
which is,
which is tragic,
but

791
00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:42.860
<v 1>true.
Yeah,
it's,
it's a real tragedy because then it's like,
I mean,</v>

792
00:48:42.861 --> 00:48:46.130
this is where you would definitely have a difference of opinion with Candice

793
00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:49.670
worked.
Her argument is rip the Bandaid,
rip the Bandaid,

794
00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:51.740
let the pieces fall where they may,

795
00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:55.430
I don't know what her policy is on that and helping the poorest of the poor or

796
00:48:55.431 --> 00:48:58.100
whatever.
Like are you literally going to be kicking people out of their houses?

797
00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.990
I don't know what the answer to that is,
but I think there's,

798
00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:05.660
there's a growing feeling I think at least of a certain set of people that it's

799
00:49:05.661 --> 00:49:06.380
not working.

800
00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:10.190
You're acknowledging why it's not working and these little bandaid fixes

801
00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:14.040
seemingly only make it worse.
Yeah.
It's,
I think it's a very complex issue

802
00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:15.270
<v 2>because there are,
there are some,</v>

803
00:49:15.271 --> 00:49:20.190
there are some elements of the social safety net that I think economists agree

804
00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:22.650
are working.
Like the earned income tax credit,

805
00:49:23.010 --> 00:49:25.380
which actually incentivizes you to work.

806
00:49:25.650 --> 00:49:27.990
It helps the worst off people in society without,

807
00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:33.560
it basically corrects the massive mistake of welfare in the Lyndon Johnson era.

808
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:37.740
Um,
but yeah,
no,
it's,
it's a complex issue.

809
00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:40.450
<v 1>Yeah,
sure.
So I hate to talk about race this whole time.</v>

810
00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:44.260
It's like kind of annoying.
I know it's what you mostly write about.

811
00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:46.300
What else is kind of on your mind,

812
00:49:46.301 --> 00:49:48.910
like what are the other issues that you care about?
I mean,

813
00:49:48.911 --> 00:49:51.470
we can keep going on that,
but I always feel like it's like,
it's,

814
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:54.100
that's also a sort of tragedy of all of this.

815
00:49:54.310 --> 00:49:58.510
It's like your whole world view is to move past all this and yet because of that

816
00:49:58.511 --> 00:50:01.390
you get thrust into the conversation.
It's a weird,

817
00:50:01.391 --> 00:50:05.470
a weird psychological condition,
I suppose.
Yes,
it is.

818
00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:09.250
Does that just drive you crazy in general?
Yeah.
I mean I don't,
before we move on,

819
00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:10.113
I am racist.

820
00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:15.500
<v 2>I find inherently interesting.
Yeah.
I think it is like when I have,</v>

821
00:50:15.501 --> 00:50:18.080
when I have a free moment to,
to read a book,

822
00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:23.090
I'm not ordering the race book because,
but,
but at the same time,

823
00:50:23.091 --> 00:50:26.570
it is a topic that's loomed so large in our politics.

824
00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:32.080
And so much of what is said makes so little sense that I,

825
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:35.450
it,
it,
it just gets to me.
So I have to say something,

826
00:50:35.451 --> 00:50:38.150
but it's not something I enjoy.
I mean what,

827
00:50:38.151 --> 00:50:42.140
what I really enjoy is a philosophy and science.

828
00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:47.450
Um,
so,
so when I have free moments,
I,
I tend to read things in those,

829
00:50:47.451 --> 00:50:50.030
in those Janrus.
Yeah.
While you're working for the right lady,

830
00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:52.670
Claire over there collect cause that that's what she cares about too.

831
00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:57.740
So actually we can shift a little bit.
So,
uh,
you attended an event,
uh,
that,

832
00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:00.890
uh,
there's an IDW group in New York put together.

833
00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:02.960
I was put together in like two or three days.

834
00:51:02.961 --> 00:51:07.550
It was me and Eric Weinstein and Faisal Machar and Melissa Chen who were just

835
00:51:07.551 --> 00:51:11.470
kind of doing like IDW one on one stuff.
And you,

836
00:51:11.471 --> 00:51:14.000
you asked me an interesting question during the Q and a,

837
00:51:14.001 --> 00:51:16.760
so I'll let you present the question and then I want to hear your answer

838
00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:19.530
actually before I repeat my answer.

839
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:25.100
So my question was essentially there are a lot of people who really don't like

840
00:51:25.101 --> 00:51:26.450
the intellectual dark web.

841
00:51:26.451 --> 00:51:31.451
I think it's just a bunch of cranks who are playing footsie with the alt right

842
00:51:31.641 --> 00:51:35.960
and this objectionable way.
Um,
and totally dismiss the whole thing.

843
00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:39.570
But then there,
there,
there are many other people who think,
well,
you know,
I,

844
00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:42.910
I like,
I like half of the people in the,
in the intellectual dark web,
you know,

845
00:51:42.911 --> 00:51:46.160
I don't maybe like the other half,
but I think it's,

846
00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:48.680
they have a kind of nuanced take on it,

847
00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:51.530
but they're really what,

848
00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:56.270
where one loses them is the fact that,
you know,

849
00:51:56.280 --> 00:52:00.610
you've had Stefan Molyneux,
Molly,
I dunno how to provide some new [inaudible].

850
00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:02.570
Right?
So this,
this,

851
00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:06.980
this character that people view as objectionable to whatever degree.

852
00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.170
I don't know.
I don't follow him.

853
00:52:09.171 --> 00:52:13.570
So I don't know whether they should or shouldn't view him that way.
But you know,

854
00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:17.810
or Sam Harris has had Charles Murray on the podcast,
which you know,
many,

855
00:52:17.811 --> 00:52:21.050
he just has a terrible reputation on the left,

856
00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:24.850
largely undeserved or Joe Rogan had Alex Jones done.
Exactly.

857
00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:27.740
We can do this ad infinitum.

858
00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:34.210
And it seems like that is is the last place where people who might otherwise see

859
00:52:36.681 --> 00:52:41.150
this phenomenon as good get off the ship.
Yeah.
Or I've,
I've had,

860
00:52:41.151 --> 00:52:45.410
I think I've had conversations with people where that was kind of the last

861
00:52:45.411 --> 00:52:50.240
trench to Diane in terms of criticizing the phenomenon.
So my question was,

862
00:52:50.241 --> 00:52:53.900
what do you like,
what do you think about this,
do you think?
I mean,

863
00:52:53.901 --> 00:52:57.350
this is also a criticism that Barry Weiss raised in her,
in her piece about it.

864
00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:01.670
So I guess my answer to that would be,

865
00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:08.080
I'm,
I mean,
well,
do you know this Guy Daryl Davis?
He,
he,
he's a,

866
00:53:08.081 --> 00:53:10.700
a black guy who did a documentary,
can't remember the name of it,

867
00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:12.470
where he met with the white supremacist.

868
00:53:12.471 --> 00:53:17.150
He met with Ku Klux Klan members as a black person.
Yeah.

869
00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:20.540
And just hung out with them,
talk to them about various issues,

870
00:53:20.541 --> 00:53:22.220
became friends with them.
Right?

871
00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:27.030
So imagine the psychological courage this to sit across from someone who

872
00:53:27.031 --> 00:53:30.210
literally thinks you are an inferior kind of human being.

873
00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:35.840
And to put that aside and just expand your circle of empathy to include them

874
00:53:36.271 --> 00:53:39.600
preemptively,
incredibly inspirational.
So,

875
00:53:39.601 --> 00:53:44.601
and he ends up getting over 200 Ku Klux Klan members to renounce their

876
00:53:45.031 --> 00:53:49.140
membership and he keeps their robes in his closet as a kind of trophy of having

877
00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:51.660
d radicalized them.
Okay.

878
00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:56.970
And then he gets harshly criticized from black black lives matter for having,

879
00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.290
having done this,
um,
which is,
which I found,

880
00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:04.500
I find to be the most galling irony in the world because we're talking about a

881
00:54:04.501 --> 00:54:09.501
person who has done more to reduce racism in this society than almost anyone I

882
00:54:09.691 --> 00:54:14.390
could name in black lives matter,
right?
He is,
he is gone like a,
you know,

883
00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:16.200
many,
many progressive activists,

884
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:20.400
they tend to go to the spaces that are actually most progressive already and try

885
00:54:20.401 --> 00:54:21.840
to make them even more progressive.

886
00:54:21.841 --> 00:54:25.980
So they show up on the university campuses already the most progressive places

887
00:54:25.981 --> 00:54:30.030
on planet earth and then accused them of being systemically racist.
Right.

888
00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:32.670
So we're talking about a guy who actually went into the trenches.

889
00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:34.950
He plays the belly of the beast exactly.

890
00:54:35.130 --> 00:54:39.810
And was successful in d radicalizing people from white racism.

891
00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:42.090
Um,
the,
the point,

892
00:54:42.091 --> 00:54:46.200
the point I'm making here is not not to compare obviously Charles Murray or

893
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:49.140
Stefan to,
to a Ku Klux Klan member.

894
00:54:49.170 --> 00:54:54.170
My point is we ought to be expanding the range of people were willing to talk to

895
00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:56.670
and disagree with.

896
00:54:57.570 --> 00:55:02.570
And I think that in so far as you're able to challenge people or just expose,

897
00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:08.760
expose people's ideas,
I think that in the long run,
as uncomfortable as it is,

898
00:55:08.761 --> 00:55:12.630
an counterintuitive as it is,
tends to,
tends to be better.

899
00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:17.160
So I'll just repeat it quickly,
but that in essence,

900
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:20.660
that last portion especially really was my answer.
Now first enough,

901
00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:24.240
some of us Rogan me in San particularly,
we interview people.

902
00:55:24.241 --> 00:55:26.970
So we can't say we're for,
you know,

903
00:55:26.971 --> 00:55:30.540
plurality of ideas and we want to talk to people we disagree with and all that.

904
00:55:30.541 --> 00:55:32.220
And then only talk to people we agree with.

905
00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:35.700
So that means we are going to talk to some of these characters without getting

906
00:55:35.701 --> 00:55:40.170
into any of the specifics of the people that I've had on the show.
Of course,

907
00:55:40.171 --> 00:55:44.190
sometimes somebody you may not ask the right question here or there.

908
00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:46.710
I'm not even,
I'm not even saying that that's what I did or didn't do.

909
00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:50.100
But you have like,
otherwise we're not taking any risks.

910
00:55:50.130 --> 00:55:54.510
And the group of people that will talk to will become infinitely smaller and

911
00:55:54.511 --> 00:55:57.930
smaller and smaller.
And also we'll be sort of,
um,

912
00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:00.900
we'll be hostages to people that don't like us in the first place.

913
00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:03.240
And that's what I'm more concerned about.
It's like,

914
00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:08.520
I don't want people who don't want any conversation to be happening at all to

915
00:56:08.521 --> 00:56:11.490
have ownership over who I'm going to talk to.
Yeah.
Now,

916
00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:16.110
on any specific moment,
could any of us do something a little bit differently?

917
00:56:16.111 --> 00:56:19.380
Sure.
But in essence,
yeah,
you're asking about the gatekeeping that,

918
00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:23.620
that Barry was talking about.
Yeah.
I don't even know that it's,
it's for to say.

919
00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:24.010
And as

920
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:25.330
<v 1>I said before,
you know,
we don't even have,</v>

921
00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:27.970
it's not like we're walking around with laminated cards and we'd go to a secret

922
00:56:27.971 --> 00:56:32.020
meetings.
I'm right.
But I think the best sunlight is the best disinfectant.

923
00:56:32.021 --> 00:56:36.370
I just,
I just fundamentally believe that.
And as far as I know,

924
00:56:36.371 --> 00:56:39.550
no one was hurt by any of the interviews that I've done.
And I think I've,

925
00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:43.500
I've helped a lot of people that were maybe into some of those ideas.
You know,

926
00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:45.340
that was the one that people were giving me a lotta.

927
00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:49.540
That's the day I said Daryl Davis phenomenon.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So,
yeah,
nobody's lost.

928
00:56:49.541 --> 00:56:52.650
I mean,
that's what I really believe.
And maybe that's a little,
um,

929
00:56:52.930 --> 00:56:56.580
rose colored glasses of me.
But I believe that,
you know,
when,

930
00:56:56.581 --> 00:57:00.550
when people were giving me crap for doing Alex Jones to like,

931
00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:02.830
forget what he thinks about things for a moment,

932
00:57:03.550 --> 00:57:06.400
clearly hundreds of thousands or millions of people are watching this.

933
00:57:06.610 --> 00:57:10.900
I came on on a live show.
I said,
whatever.
I believe I didn't lie about anything.

934
00:57:10.901 --> 00:57:12.400
I said the same thing as I say here.

935
00:57:12.670 --> 00:57:14.710
And then I got emails from his people saying,
you know,

936
00:57:14.711 --> 00:57:16.260
I never heard a decent liberal talk before.

937
00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:19.060
Now I watched your interview with Bret Weinstein.
It's like,
wow,

938
00:57:19.061 --> 00:57:23.050
that's pretty cool man.
So I just think perhaps we,

939
00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:25.120
and I mean you and I in this case,

940
00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:29.950
we just have a little bit more tolerance for,

941
00:57:30.010 --> 00:57:33.370
I don't think if someone hears something it's going to immediately infect them

942
00:57:33.371 --> 00:57:36.400
and then they're going to take that infection and infect other people.

943
00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:39.640
But I think a lot of people operate in that prison.
I think so.
I mean,
uh,

944
00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:42.790
one of the reasons I asked this question at the event is I was glad you did by

945
00:57:42.791 --> 00:57:44.860
the one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's because,
for example,

946
00:57:44.861 --> 00:57:49.740
Charles Murray has retweeted some of my pieces and you know,

947
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:50.021
I've,

948
00:57:50.021 --> 00:57:55.021
I've gotten into exchanges with some of my critics where I've,

949
00:57:55.210 --> 00:58:00.210
I've kind of talked them down off of the ledge of me being a sellout or

950
00:58:01.570 --> 00:58:02.800
convinced them that I'm,

951
00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:07.860
I'm operating in good faith and the trench there dying and criticizing me is,

952
00:58:08.441 --> 00:58:13.180
well,
Charles Murray retweeted you and he is x,

953
00:58:13.181 --> 00:58:17.470
y and Z.
Therefore,
I think a,
that's just,

954
00:58:17.770 --> 00:58:19.510
that's like two layers of Ad Hominem.

955
00:58:19.870 --> 00:58:22.210
Ad Hominem is attacking you instead of your belief,

956
00:58:22.450 --> 00:58:26.080
but attacking someone else instead of your belief.
It's like,
that's a bit much.

957
00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:28.870
It's Ad Hominem twice over.
But we seem to be in this,

958
00:58:28.930 --> 00:58:31.560
in this place now where people like lists,
you know,

959
00:58:31.561 --> 00:58:35.440
the SPLC is making lists of people that are bad people.
You know,

960
00:58:35.441 --> 00:58:39.010
there was this alternative influencer graph that you probably saw.

961
00:58:39.011 --> 00:58:41.230
They tried to link together.
I didn't even know,

962
00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:44.290
probably 10 or 15 of the people on there and I don't,
you know,

963
00:58:44.291 --> 00:58:46.960
and I looked at the list after where they were including me in this like crazy,

964
00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:49.000
whatever it was.
White supremacists,
let's just say,

965
00:58:49.210 --> 00:58:51.040
not only did I not know plenty of the people,

966
00:58:51.250 --> 00:58:54.680
several of them I have muted because they hate me.
So it's like,

967
00:58:55.010 --> 00:58:58.570
like you're just come together with anyone that has walked past you.
Oh,

968
00:58:58.571 --> 00:59:01.340
you shook hands with that guy.
You didn't know who he was.
Too Bad.
You're,

969
00:59:01.490 --> 00:59:03.940
you're screwed man.
Yeah,
that's it.
No,
I think,

970
00:59:03.941 --> 00:59:06.640
I think I was telling this to you before we filmed,

971
00:59:06.641 --> 00:59:11.050
but I think we live in a McCarthy era with regard to,

972
00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:16.000
especially racism,
but also other,
other isms.
Um,
I mean,

973
00:59:16.001 --> 00:59:20.800
I hope historians look back on it as that,
but you know,
we're getting,

974
00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:22.760
we're getting people fired

975
00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:27.020
<v 2>for,
you know,
for saying the n word in an anti racist context.
You know,</v>

976
00:59:27.021 --> 00:59:30.950
Papa John's for example,
the CEO of that got fired for saying the end.
Yeah.

977
00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:33.990
<v 1>And there was no pushback on that.
Yeah.
The Guy said it in the car.</v>

978
00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:37.490
<v 2>Excellent.
Anti Racist Razor.
Like recalling his,</v>

979
00:59:37.790 --> 00:59:42.230
the racist of his youth and the heinous things they would say.
Yeah.
Right.

980
00:59:42.231 --> 00:59:46.580
And it gets fired.
A guy gets his name taken off the gym of his local hometown.

981
00:59:46.790 --> 00:59:51.320
Just gets his reputation deep.
Sixed and right.

982
00:59:51.321 --> 00:59:54.670
So like this is happening.
It happened a month later to to,

983
00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:58.070
to this executive at Netflix who's in a,

984
00:59:58.071 --> 01:00:01.700
in a meeting about offensive words in Netflix is comedy context.

985
01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:05.480
So how do you have a meeting about offensive words without saying offensive

986
01:00:05.481 --> 01:00:09.650
words unless you're just going to be talking like alphabet soup entire time.

987
01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:14.160
So he says this fired.
So these are no,

988
01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:18.020
nobody upon reflection thinks that these people are racists.

989
01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:21.880
It is completely,
it is,

990
01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:24.500
it is analogous to McCarthyism in that sense.

991
01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:29.510
And the word racism has been denuded so fully of of its of its moral valence and

992
01:00:31.161 --> 01:00:35.610
its moral charge at this point that you know,

993
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:39.320
people,
you know,
we're,
we're caring less and less about actual racism too,

994
01:00:39.321 --> 01:00:41.330
is that that's a fear here.
Like once you,

995
01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:44.180
once you strip this word of all of this,
all its moral charge,

996
01:00:44.181 --> 01:00:46.430
then you have a boy who cried wolf scenario,

997
01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:50.840
which ends up backfiring spectacularly.
And I would argue that that is happening.

998
01:00:50.841 --> 01:00:55.430
We're seeing a surge on the,
on the far right as well.
Right.

999
01:00:55.431 --> 01:00:56.264
So I think

1000
01:00:56.550 --> 01:00:58.950
<v 1>that that was also my concern.
I mean,
before the election,</v>

1001
01:00:58.951 --> 01:01:02.520
I did plenty of videos about you gotta stop calling Trump Hitler.
Yeah.

1002
01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:06.030
Because if he is not Hitler,
and for all the reasons that people don't like them,

1003
01:01:06.031 --> 01:01:08.790
the guy's not Hitler.
And it's like you keep doing that.

1004
01:01:08.791 --> 01:01:11.570
You won't even realize when the real bad guys go.

1005
01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:15.090
And the people that would be sympathetic to your views will no longer listen to

1006
01:01:15.091 --> 01:01:17.640
you.
Yeah.
Because they'll view you as the boy who cried wolf.

1007
01:01:17.730 --> 01:01:21.930
<v 2>Yeah.
And Bill Mar del Mar called himself out for doing this for calling,</v>

1008
01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:26.220
you know,
Bush and Romney racists or whatever it was.

1009
01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:27.460
<v 1>Right.
He said that Romney,</v>

1010
01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:32.890
<v 2>yes,
yes.
Yeah.
And he called himself out for being hyperbolic so that when,</v>

1011
01:01:32.891 --> 01:01:34.360
when trunk Trump came along,

1012
01:01:34.361 --> 01:01:39.361
who actually has done clearly or has said clearly misogynous things is alleged

1013
01:01:40.331 --> 01:01:43.600
to have said some things that if he did say them are,

1014
01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:46.480
are clearly racist.
Yeah.
Um,

1015
01:01:46.810 --> 01:01:50.700
people don't care anymore because they've been so solid.
You know,
they've,

1016
01:01:50.701 --> 01:01:55.540
they've been called a racist a thousand times by the pundits at MSNBC.
And it's,

1017
01:01:55.560 --> 01:02:00.420
it's been true.
Maybe 10% of the times,
but not true.
Like for the,

1018
01:02:00.421 --> 01:02:04.030
the,
the funniest case it is to me was,
uh,
when,

1019
01:02:04.031 --> 01:02:06.970
when Trump called Omarosa a dog,
right?

1020
01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:12.000
At Wash u turn on NBC and Msnbc after this or,

1021
01:02:12.001 --> 01:02:13.120
or read the New York Times.

1022
01:02:13.330 --> 01:02:16.630
It is just obvious to those people that this is a racist slur.

1023
01:02:16.631 --> 01:02:20.220
He's called this black woman a dog.
This obviously racist.

1024
01:02:20.221 --> 01:02:24.900
And if you're defending it,
you're a racist too.
Okay.
And then you just,

1025
01:02:24.930 --> 01:02:27.750
if you have an internet connection,
yeah.
You look at the other people,

1026
01:02:27.751 --> 01:02:32.160
Trump has directly call the dog.
You find Mac Miller before he passed away,

1027
01:02:32.161 --> 01:02:35.910
of course you find,
um,
David Axelrod,

1028
01:02:36.270 --> 01:02:39.520
you find Adriana Huffington,
just,
you,

1029
01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:42.930
you find white person after white person that he is directly called the dog,

1030
01:02:42.931 --> 01:02:44.940
not said they did something like a dog,
cause he does,

1031
01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:46.690
he likes that construction too.
Right?

1032
01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:49.530
But he's called the white person after white person a dog.

1033
01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:52.290
There's no reason to believe that this was a racist incident.

1034
01:02:52.530 --> 01:02:56.460
And yet every pundit at Msnbc is saying that it is.

1035
01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:00.060
And anyone who likes Trump and you know,
watches Fox News,

1036
01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:03.690
they're getting these clips exported from MSNBC,

1037
01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:08.370
seeing themselves called as racist by called racist by implication or by

1038
01:03:08.371 --> 01:03:13.080
association.
And then seeing someone like Tucker Carlson who you know,
I have,

1039
01:03:13.081 --> 01:03:14.160
I have reservations about,

1040
01:03:14.161 --> 01:03:18.660
but seeing someone like Tucker Carlson make perfect sense about that.

1041
01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:23.660
Just destroy this view with simple logic and facts and imagine how,

1042
01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:28.200
how refreshing it is to have someone like Tucker doing that.

1043
01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:33.150
And obviously like you're,
you're going to get tired of being called a racist.

1044
01:03:33.350 --> 01:03:38.350
And when in cases when it's so obviously not true and there's just a lack of due

1045
01:03:38.581 --> 01:03:42.930
diligence,
there's a lack of any concern for,
for facts and for logic.

1046
01:03:42.931 --> 01:03:44.700
And that ends up having a very,

1047
01:03:44.890 --> 01:03:48.120
a bad effect on the other end because now Trump,

1048
01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:52.620
I mean there are some things Trump has said for which racism I think is the best

1049
01:03:52.621 --> 01:03:55.200
explanation.
I don't think he's a Klan member.

1050
01:03:55.710 --> 01:03:59.700
I think he's a very mild kind of New York racist of his era.
You know,

1051
01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:04.740
there their degrees of racism in other words.
But the point is,

1052
01:04:04.741 --> 01:04:09.660
it's like the,
the reason that Trump voters,
I think for the most part,

1053
01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:15.540
excuse him,
on some of the things he said is,
is not because,

1054
01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:16.890
not for the most part,

1055
01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:22.160
because of a random upsurge in racism that happened in 2016 but was it present

1056
01:04:22.741 --> 01:04:25.490
the past eight years?
You,
they're like,

1057
01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:29.130
there are counties that went for Obama twice that went for Trump.
It is,
it is.

1058
01:04:29.131 --> 01:04:33.990
I think it's largely because people are absolutely sick of being tarred as

1059
01:04:33.991 --> 01:04:37.830
racists.
Untethered to the facts of the specific cases.

1060
01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:40.690
<v 1>Yeah.
And then now we've got just the match made in hell.</v>

1061
01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:42.520
We've got a group that calls everyone racist.

1062
01:04:42.521 --> 01:04:47.521
The guy who you know is happy to bite them on every bit of it and use that as

1063
01:04:47.831 --> 01:04:50.920
fuel to get his base going.
And Yeah.
So what do you,

1064
01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:53.560
somehow I said we were going to shift out of race and we went right back to,

1065
01:04:53.561 --> 01:04:55.510
exactly.
Yeah.
All right,
we're going to try to finish up or something else.

1066
01:04:55.511 --> 01:04:59.020
But what do you,
what do you even consider yourself politically these days?
If I,

1067
01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:02.020
if I was trying to label you,
I mean I have a sense,
you know,

1068
01:05:02.021 --> 01:05:04.750
you're somewhere in that classical liberal situation,

1069
01:05:04.751 --> 01:05:08.320
but does that even matter to you?
Do you,
do you think of yourself a certain way?

1070
01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:10.740
<v 2>I think if you can be gender fluid,</v>

1071
01:05:10.741 --> 01:05:14.300
you should be able to be political fluid at this point.
Yeah.
I think,
uh,

1072
01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:14.980
I don't know,
white

1073
01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:18.220
<v 1>woman,
I,
I find your political views to quite appreciate</v>

1074
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:22.900
<v 2>that.
I appreciate that.
Um,
no,
but I think,
I mean,
it is,</v>

1075
01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:28.080
it is strange that like politics is a social construct,

1076
01:05:28.541 --> 01:05:29.680
political ideologies.

1077
01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:34.030
These are fully social constructs and it seems like we're getting more and more

1078
01:05:34.031 --> 01:05:38.230
rigid with the degree to which we take them seriously.

1079
01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:41.620
Um,
obviously one should take ideas seriously,

1080
01:05:41.621 --> 01:05:46.621
but I don't see anything to be gained from anchoring myself to conservatism or

1081
01:05:47.021 --> 01:05:51.700
liberalism or libertarianism,
even though I find wisdom in all of these three,

1082
01:05:52.350 --> 01:05:57.040
uh,
political ideologies.
Um,
so yeah,
I mean,
I think,

1083
01:05:57.070 --> 01:06:00.100
I think if,
if I can,
if I can make politically fluid of meme,

1084
01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:04.120
that would be,
that'd be great.
I will see what I can do.
All right.

1085
01:06:04.121 --> 01:06:07.000
Give me one other thing besides race,
what are you doing for fun?
These man,

1086
01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:11.290
I'm reading.
I'm reading a lot about,
I'm taking metaphysics,

1087
01:06:11.710 --> 01:06:15.780
taking philosophy of language in mind,
both of which I found fascinating.

1088
01:06:16.410 --> 01:06:21.250
All right.
You got a political future in front of you or,
Oh God,

1089
01:06:21.251 --> 01:06:25.090
no.
People often ask me that.
This law kinds me,
right?

1090
01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:28.870
People often ask me that.
No,
I would never go into politics.
Actually,

1091
01:06:28.871 --> 01:06:30.040
people assume that about me,

1092
01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:35.170
which I think is really interesting because I detest politics.
I hate it so much.

1093
01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:40.720
Um,
yeah.
No,
I don't.
I don't know.
I don't know why I give that vibe off,

1094
01:06:41.590 --> 01:06:45.070
but it's,
yeah.
I cannot see myself as a politician.

1095
01:06:46.030 --> 01:06:50.860
You're too same.
That's the problem.
It's been a pleasure,
man.
Likewise.
All right.

1096
01:06:51.130 --> 01:06:56.020
For more on Coleman,
follow him on Twitter at cold x,
man.

1097
01:06:56.910 --> 01:06:57.060
<v 0>Hmm.</v>
