00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.660
Last time, in the good Star Trek movie...

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.140
Oh no! Khan escaped from his prison?

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.140
A new toy called Genesis that creates life in two seconds

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.280
but still can't create a good Sonic game in years!

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.640
Kirstie Alley as a Vulcan?

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.800
She does well, but, that's just plain weird.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.440
Revenge is sought after and Shatner says Khan's name like he's passing a kidney stone.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.380
KIRK: KHAN!!

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.100
What's this? Spock is sacrificing himself for the crew?

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.540
It appears this Vulcan wants out of this franchise.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.880
Will he be sucked back by the fact that he's the most marketable character?

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.300
Stay tuned!

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.640
Same Star Trek time,
same Star Trek channel!

00:00:51.880 --> 00:01:00.880
[Kirk screams "Khan!" over and over to the opening theme of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.940
In continuing with Star Trek Month, we now take a look at Star Trek III: The Search for Spock.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.400
Now, out of all the odd-numbered Star Trek movies,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.660
this is probably the one that people say comes close to actually being pretty good.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.880
But it still lacks the epic rivalry of II or the clever comedy of IV and so on, and so on.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.880
Is it worth searching for? Let's find out!
This is Star Trek III.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.920
So we open up with a recap of the last movie and we discover a rather effective way to save money on your opening credits:

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.720
just play your previous movie backwards.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.900
Yeah. Who needs big special effects when you can simply push the rewind button on your last film?

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.180
We then cut to Kirk, who is still shaken by the loss of his Vulcan buddy.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.260
KIRK: With most of our battle damage repaired, we're almost home.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.920
Yet, I feel uneasy.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.120
I wonder why.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.160
CRITIC: Well, it's either the bean burrito that might be giving you indigestion,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.920
or the fact that your BEST FRIEND JUST DIED.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.240
I don't know, maybe it's the burrito!

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.700
KIRK: A hero's welcome, son, is that what you'd like?

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.060
Well God knows it should be.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.100
CRITIC: We then cut to elsewhere in space, where a Klingon, played by Christopher Lloyd,

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.580
is gathering info on the Genesis project.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.500
And apparently he buys his animals from Gozer's Pet Shop and Aquarium.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.740
(Growl)

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.220
That thing is so cute. I'm gonna name him Balzac.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.040
Hello Balzac! How you doin'?

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.520
And apparently he's so important to the story that he even gets his own scene.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.040
(Speaking Klingon)

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.720
(Growls)

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.860
Yeah, wasn't that vitally important?

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.680
I couldn't see the story moving forward unless we knew that Balzac got fed.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.100
It's the crux of the movie.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.580
Boy, she's sure taking that whole 
"gotta kill you" thing pretty well.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.540
Not even a plea or an escape plan or a, "darn."

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.920
She just fully accepts it.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.640
You know, if only more people were accepting of death.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.060
[Ominous music]

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.980
Oh God, it's probably what we've been waiting for.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.620
Okay, put it on screen.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.280
[STATIC]

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.120
Hi, Critic!

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.240
SciFi Guy?

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.820
Yeah! Well, who'd you think it was going to be?

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.360
Oh, no one, I thought it was going to be Linkara...

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.040
Anyway, what's up?

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.260
Well I got that copy of Star Trek V that you wanted.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.840
Oh that's right. I don't have a
copy of it because I only try to own good movies.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.300
Yeah well, you know, being a sci-fi nerd, it's kind of required by law that I own everything Star Trek,

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.340
even the really bad stuff like the Christmas special. (Shudders)

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.580
There's a Christmas special?

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.240
Yeah. It's only legally viewable in Amsterdam, so uh,

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.240
You want the movie?

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.960
Oh, sure, upload it to my computer.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.720
There ya go!

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.180
Let me tell you, your review of this I'm sure is going to be just as funny as mine.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.340
You're planning on reviewing it, too?

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.480
Well, yeah, it is kind of my shtick.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.160
Unfortunate.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.480
I know what that means, and I'm totally cool with it!

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.120
I mean, I'd totally love to die on your behalf.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.040
Indeed. Thrusters!

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.560
I think it's so awesome that you're gonna kill me like this! I mean, I can hardly wait.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.520
Just, zap me into oblivion!

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.540
You will be remembered with honor.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:37.660
FIRE!!

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.860
SCIFI GUY: Oh, wait wait wait. uh, before you do that, I am transferring my life savings into your bank account.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.580
Hell, I'm not going to need it anymore.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.940
Oh, well, thank you. That's very very kind of you.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.080
FIRE!!

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.500
SCIFI GUY: Oh, also, I should just let you know that I had

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.780
all of my family members sign up to be your personal slaves after my passing.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:54.780
Anything else I can do for you?

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.100
You know, wash your windows, shine your shoes?

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.920
Oh no, thank you, you've more than done enough,
SciFi Guy.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.860
God, your understanding of the situation is unbelievable!

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.680
Well, I know it's for a good cause.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.480
And, hey, just, good luck to you, man.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.120
You too, my friend, you t...

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.760
FIRE!

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:11.740
Ha!

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.720
CRITIC: So, the Enterprise returns to the spacedock,

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.120
when Chekov suddenly discovers a human life form in Spock's quarters.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.480
KIRK: I'm on my way.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.860
CRITIC: Lord knows the security team doesn't go in first.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.700
[Wimpy Voice] It's too scary!

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.400
They're only dressed for in case a 1940s football game breaks out!

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.260
But, it turns out, it's Dr. McCoy,

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.680
who is actually convinced that he, himself, is Spock.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.020
MCCOY: Help me, Jim. Take me home.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.760
KIRK: Bones, we are. We are home.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.380
MCCOY: Then perhaps it's not too late.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.400
CRITIC (as McCoy): You can still stop me from saying yes to Transformers 3.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.060
KIRK: Uhura, get the medics down here!

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.700
KIRK: As developed by doctors Carol and David Marcus,

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:08.000
Genesis, simply put, is life from lifelessness.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.760
KRUGE: Speak.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.640
MALTZ: Impressive.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.060
CRITIC: Oh my God, is that John Larroquette?!

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.680
It is! John Larroquette is a Klingon on Star Trek!

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.640
I, surprisingly, have little material for that.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:28.700
John Larroquette as a Klingon...what the hell am I supposed to do with John Larroquette as a Klingon?

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.900
I mean, it's strange enough to notice,

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.800
but doesn't really lead its way to many comedic possibilities.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.040
I'm kind of stuck.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.440
Um...

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.560
Here's a tribble in "Night Court."

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.420
DAN FIELDING: Oh, I'm hurt. Oh, I'm offended.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.280
What do you want, it's the best I can work with!

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.080
Meanwhile, Kirk is visited by Spock's father, who isn't too happy.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.700
SAREK: Why did you leave him on Genesis?

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.940
Spock trusted you, and you denied him his future.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.020
(As Kirk) Well, he wanted out of the franchise.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.860
KIRK: He made no request of me.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.000
He would not have spoken of it openly.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.080
Bring that which he gave you, his katra, his living spirit.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.140
KIRK: And how was I...
SAREK: Kirk.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.180
I must have your thoughts.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.220
CRITIC: So he does a mind meld with Kirk, but doesn't find the answers he's looking for.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.160
[Star Trek: The Original Series theme]

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.540
(as Sarek) Oh God, look at all the green-skinned whores.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.520
(as Sarek) Is this all your mind is filled with?

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.640
(as Kirk) The thoughts need a hobby.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.260
SAREK: It is not here.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.060
CRITIC: So if the mind of Spock isn't in Kirk, then where is it?

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:35.080
Well, how about in the mind of the guy 
WHO THINKS HE'S SPOCK?!

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.940
But, no, that'd be too obvious.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:42.160
We need clarification of this by going over to the nicely-shot-and-edited security camera footage.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:44.900
SPOCK: Remember.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:45.980
[DING!]

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.800
CRITIC: So, McCoy finds he's of two minds on everything,

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.420
but he figures a good old journey to the bar will shut up those voices in his head.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:59.220
Oh yeah, fuck Call of Duty. THESE are the games of the future!

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.440
Take a look, it's like seeing what will come.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.200
ALIEN: To your planet, welcome.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.880
I here am new.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.920
I name not important.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.040
You seek I.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.260
Message received.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.320
CRITIC (as McCoy): Are you, hitting on me?

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.880
MCCOY: How much and how soon?

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.540
ALIEN: How much is where.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:20.500
MCCOY: It's Genesis.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:21.940
ALIEN: Genesis?!

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:27.840
CRITIC: You know, maybe you could say your lines a little easier if you stop imitating the voice of Stitch.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.780
MCCOY: It's Genesis.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.140
ALIEN: Genesis?!

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.780
(as Stitch) Genesis?! Ikkiba!

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.380
SECURITY OFFICER:
Can I offer you a ride home, Dr. McCoy?

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.280
Where's the logic in offering me a ride home, you idiot?

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.800
If I wanted a ride home would I be trying to charter a space flight?

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.300
(Growls)

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:44.480
CRITIC: Now I think he just farted.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.240
You know, I think this guy's butt is where his mouth should be.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.780
I'm not entirely sure.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.140
SECURITY OFFICER: Federation security, sir. You're gonna get a nice long rest, doctor.

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.380
CRITIC: But Kirk and Sulu go to break him out, as they try to get into the Genesis...

00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.720
ALIEN: Genesis?!

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.280
CRITIC: ...planet,

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.920
which has just become forbidden.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.660
(Guard yawns)
SULU: Keeping you busy?

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.000
Don't get smart, Tiny.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.120
Don't call me Tiny.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:21.220
CRITIC (as Sulu): Anytime you want to use the word "tiny" just use the word "Takei" instead.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.620
KIRK: The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.660
CRITIC: So a good chunk of the gang steal the Enterprise with Starfleet not far behind.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.940
CHEKOV: Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this wessel.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.660
CRITIC (as Kirk): Well I have no idea what a "wessel" is, so I can't surrender it.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:39.960
STYLES: Kirk, if you do this you'll never sit in the captain's chair again.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.660
Well technically his contract has him for three more movies, so that's very unlikely.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.920
STYLES: Prepare for warp speed, standby transwarp drive.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:53.960
[Over-the-top cartoony vehicle sound effect]

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:58.580
[WAH WAH WAH WAAAAAH!]

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:04.900
SCOTTY: Souvenirs, from one surgeon to another. I took them out of her main transwarp computer drive.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.440
Ah, yes, and the over-the-top cartoony vehicle sound effect?

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.800
(as Scotty) Well that was just for laughs.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.820
(Normal voice) We then cut to the Genesis...

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.040
ALIEN: Genesis?!

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:13.720
...planet.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.900
As Kirk's son David and...not...Kirstie Alley

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:21.160
look over their Commodore 64 graphics and notice that a life form is down there.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.880
So, they head on down to check it out.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.380
ELMER FUDD: Wabbit twacks!

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.520
After traveling for a while they finally come across the life form -

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.960
which makes no sense, wouldn't they just beam to its exact location -

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:35.080
and they see that the life form is in fact a younger version of Spock,

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.700
with no memories and no means of speech.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.820
Kind of like Courtney Love after a few drinks.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.960
But then the evil Klingons come in to ruin the day.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.280
(Speaking Klingon)

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.160
(Speaking Klingon)

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:52.960
(as Kruge) Now who are we gonna eat?!

00:10:55.900 --> 00:11:00.700
TORG: If it's prisoners you want, there are life signs on the planet, perhaps the very scientists you seek.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.040
CRITIC: So the Klingons beam themselves down to the planet where the others are.

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:07.100
Several miles away from where the others are.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.660
You know, the logic behind teleporters doesn't make much sense.

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.100
And here's a fun little development:

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.640
it turns out Spock is going through pon farr,

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:18.120
which Star Trek history suggests that Spock has to mate with something in order to survive.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.520
GEORGE TAKEI: Ohhh myyyy.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.200
CRITIC: Well, this can only mean one sizzling conclusion:

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:28.860
[70's porn music]

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.800
Oh yeah. Time to do the Spock-er.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:37.440
[70's porn music continues]

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.620
Oh yeah, rub those fingers, caress those thumbnails! Mmm...

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:45.140
[70's porn music continues]

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.660
Oh yeah, touch those knuckles! Rub them all over!

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:52.560
[70's porn music continues]

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.400
Now rub the inside of her wrist and gently work your way around to...

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.300
[porn music stops]
y-you know, this isn't very sexy.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.840
I mean, is this really all we see?

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:05.020
This is Star Trek! We've seen Kirk make out with God knows how many ladies,

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:09.640
and yet for Spock we get sort of
 this half-assed E.T. sex?!

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.240
I'm sorry, I thought we'd get something more steamy!

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:21.440
Uh, Spock, when a pretty lady asks you to finger her, this isn't what she means.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.200
(Speaking Klingon)

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.240
SAAVIK: Spock!

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.140
CRITIC: But the Klingon cockblockers come in and ruin the...

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.240
oh let's face it, they didn't ruin anything.

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:32.320
KRUGE: I've come a long way for the power of Genesis...

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.840
ALIEN: Genesis?!

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.200
KRUGE: ...and what do I find?

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.300
A weakling human,

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:40.380
a Vulcan boy,

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.520
and a woman.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.840
(as Kruge) Sounds like the beginning of a joke at a sci-fi con.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.620
TORG: Federation starship approaching.

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:48.100
KRUGE: Bring me up.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.200
So Lloyd goes back up to his ship and gets ready for battle.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.240
KIRK: That distortion, see it?

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.280
SULU: Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.

00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:02.580
(Speaking Klingon)

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:09.340
CRITIC: Ever notice, by the way, that all his Klingon pronunciation is very similar to a cat puking up?

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.380
(Speaking Klingon)

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.860
(Critic making cat puking sounds)

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:21.220
CHEKOV: Shields non-responsive.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:22.640
KIRK: Scotty?

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:27.200
SCOTTY: The automation system's overloaded. I didn't expect to take us into combat, ya know.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.840
CRITIC: Oh yeah, because STEALING A STARSHIP and being hunted down by the entire Federation

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.760
would EVER put you in a situation where you need to defend yourself.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.080
So the Klingons fire at them,

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.400
they fire at the Klingons,

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:43.160
both are unable to use their weapons, and they find themselves at a stalemate.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:47.940
And this leads to probably one of the most senseless, disturbing,

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:54.060
yet emotional death scenes that has ever come out of any Star Trek film.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:56.840
BALZAC!!

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.840
NOOOOO!!

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.780
KIRK: Precautionary, Mr. Chekov.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.360
Screenwriting bastards, you killed my Balzac.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:12.560
Oh!

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.660
Screenwriting bastards, you killed my Balzac!

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:19.040
Oh!

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:20.540
You...

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:24.260
murdered and maimed a totally pointless character!

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:26.000
Oh!

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:27.440
Oh!

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:32.860
Oh and Kirk's son gets killed as a means to force him to surrender,

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:33.940
it's very tragic but,

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.000
you screenwriting BASTARDS, you killed my Balzac!

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.420
YOU KILLED MY BALZAC!

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:40.640
Oh!

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.560
Nobody told me this was gonna be like Marley &amp; Me in space!

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.180
I'm sorry, I...

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:48.040
I need a minute to recover from this.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.960
Here's some products whoring themselves out for your pleasure.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.600
(Whispering) Screenwriting bastards, you killed my Balzac.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.560
Oh my Balzac!

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:06.720
Ok.

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.840
I think I'm fi...I think I've recovered.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:14.340
So, as you can imagine, nothing can top the...

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.240
dramatic explosion that was...

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.040
the death of dear Balzac.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:26.020
They've reached the height of dramatic tension, people. There's no way they're gonna top it.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:33.600
Best we get is the blowing up of the starship Enterprise as soon as the Klingons get on board.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.820
And the heroes watch from the planet. Ooh!

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:37.460
BUT WILL IT BRING BACK BALZAC?!

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.400
Actually, the blowing up of the Enterprise is pretty epic.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.280
And they give it a lot of weight, too.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:47.320
I especially like the buildup when Lloyd puts together what the self-destruct countdown means.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.700
TORG: The ship appears to be deserted.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.080
KRUGE: How can that be?

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:50.960
They're hiding.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.920
But the bridge seems to be run by computer.

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.020
Let me hear it.

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:55.600
COMPUTER: Nine...

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:56.840
eight...

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:57.840
seven...

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:58.460
[POP]

00:15:58.460 --> 00:15:58.980
[POP]
six...

00:15:58.980 --> 00:15:59.480
[POP]

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.620
[BOOM!]
five...

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:01.800
KRUGE: GET OUT!
four...

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.300
GET OUT OF THERE!!
three...

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:03.800
two...

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:13.220
KIRK: My God, Bones.

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:15.860
What have I done?

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.560
MCCOY: What you had to do.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:19.780
What you always do.

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.620
Turn death into a fighting chance to live.

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.080
You could sum up his whole career with that line.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.420
So they find Spock and not-Kirstie Alley and try to save them.

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:32.480
However, they're still without a ship, and the planet's about to blow.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.360
So, he makes a deal with Lloyd.

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.160
KIRK: I have what you want.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:39.740
I have the secret of Genesis.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:41.080
ALIEN: Genesis?!

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.500
You're gonna have to bring us up there to get it.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:46.800
CRITIC (as Kruge): Bite my pointy AquaTread tire head.

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.580
KRUGE: Drop all weapons!

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.480
(Speaking Klingon)

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:57.900
CRITIC: So he beams most of the team aboard, but leaves himself, Kirk, and Spock on the planet.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.840
KIRK: You fool, look around you!

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.940
The planet's destroying itself!

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.300
KRUGE: Yes, exhilarating, isn't it?

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.840
If we don't help each other, we'll die here.

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:07.800
Perfect.

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:09.880
Then that's the way it shall be.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:16.400
CRITIC (as Kruge): Oop. Ok. Sorry, I wasn't meaning to attack you, but then the ground raised up, and,

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.820
well, I just decided to own it.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:24.880
(Normal voice) Uh, yeah.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:29.340
I think all the straps on Shatner's girdle would break if he pulled that stunt off.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.480
Ooh, all four of his balls!

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.800
DOC BROWN (high pitched): 1.21 jigawatts!

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.240
(Screams)

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.060
CRITIC: So he hangs him off a cliff, and finally does him in.

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:42.880
KIRK: I...

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.900
have HAD...

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.820
enough of YOU!

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.680
(Screams)

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.200
CHARLIE WILCOX: I was frozen t...

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:56.040
CRITIC: They take control of the Klingon ship and take Spock home to the planet of Vulcan.

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.900
There, on a Siegfried &amp; Roy stage,

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:02.700
they talk about making the transition from McCoy's mind back into Spock's.

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:06.300
T'LAR: What you seek has not been done since ages past,

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.540
and then, only in legend.

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.600
Your request is not logical.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.640
SAREK: Forgive me, T'Lar.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:15.680
My logic...

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:18.180
is uncertain...

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.120
where my son is concerned.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:26.300
CRITIC: Well, I guess the all-logic-based society says logic only holds weight SOME of the time,

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.300
and they decide to do the transition.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:32.200
Spock wakes up ok and walks around in a robe from a (as Kirk, mockingly) spaaaa.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.620
SPOCK: I have been...

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.720
and ever shall be...

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:39.300
your friend.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:40.980
KIRK: Yes.

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:42.420
The ship...

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:44.480
out of danger?

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:46.020
You saved the ship.

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.840
I blew it up later, but, eh.

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:49.480
SPOCK: Jim.

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.820
Your name...is Jim.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.940
CRITIC: So Spock gets his memory back,

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:58.100
Takei cops a feel,

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.100
and we're not-so-subtly told the adventure continues.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:06.120
For the needs of the franchise outweigh the needs of not kicking a dead horse.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.500
So that's Star Trek III: The Search for Spock.

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:09.540
And honestly?

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.720
I don't think it's that bad.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.760
I mean, ok, it's not as good as some of the others,

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.420
and it does drag at times, but,

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.400
it's still got some big death scenes,

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.640
some strong moments,

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:22.180
and it does feel very operatic at times.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.400
I think the major thing missing is that,

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:28.540
it needed a villain along the lines of Khan to really complete it, and

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.400
even though Lloyd is a lot of fun,

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.900
and he's a pretty good bad guy,

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.620
the character is just sort of a one-note nut.

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:37.940
I think a really strong rivalry would've made it a lot more epic.

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.140
Overall, though, I think it's still pretty good.

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:42.520
I can see how others may find it boring, but

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.040
I think the strong stuff still stands out.

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.580
