WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.310
Moitai Muay Thai,
Thai boxing,
even it,

2
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.450
that is the only time I've never heard of that.
Nope.
You're so,
you're so,
uh,

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.840
what are you white?
Yeah,
you're white.
You're also like a,
a non jock.

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.580
Well,
I was a jock my whole life.
What,
what'd you do?
I played a football.
Oh,

5
00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:20.270
that's right.
I really feel 12 forever and tracking a bunch of stuff.

6
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.150
Then you fuck with,
then I stopped.
Did you fucking body up at all?
Uh,
no.

7
00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:28.620
Not too bad.
My shoulders a little bit.
My shoulder's a little,
but uh,

8
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.040
that's pretty much it.
My,
my knees,
you know,
like I run a lot now.

9
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.270
I've been running all that for the last couple of months and uh,
on,

10
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.280
I just want to be in better shape when they feel better.
I dropped like burn off,

11
00:00:40.281 --> 00:00:45.000
say 15 pounds.
Yeah,
exactly.
I was like,

12
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:49.740
maybe,
maybe.
Yeah.
Your face looks thinner,
man.
Yeah,
it looks good.

13
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:51.950
You have drafted a bunch.
That's awesome.
Thanks man.
Yeah,

14
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.750
it's a cool thing once you get going,
right?
Yeah.
Get that momentum.

15
00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:55.710
That's what's up.
Well,
you know,

16
00:00:55.711 --> 00:01:00.540
it's really was up was I was kind of cruising along and just like lost five

17
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:02.190
pounds and just kinda like hanging around.

18
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.550
And then I realized I'm working out like this workout that I'm doing is,

19
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.400
we've been a warm up when I was an athlete,

20
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.340
like this wouldn't even have been a warm up.
And I'm like,
oh,

21
00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:16.170
that was pretty good.
And I was like,

22
00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:19.580
I have to stop being a sissy and try and really push it a little more.

23
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.940
Just get a trainer,
Eh,
I don't like intimacy.
Oh,

24
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.400
that's real.
Well you know what else you can do?

25
00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:30.960
There's actually apps where you can follow an app and the APP will put you

26
00:01:30.961 --> 00:01:34.920
through a workout.
Oh yeah,
yeah.
Several of them now.
They're really good.
Oh cool.

27
00:01:34.921 --> 00:01:37.940
A bunch of really good ones.
I don't have any affiliation with any of them,

28
00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:42.240
so got not naming any of them,
but yeah,
you can.
Um,
you can even get a yoga one.

29
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.890
You get a 90 minute yoga one and just do yoga and it talks you through the

30
00:01:46.891 --> 00:01:49.410
poses.
It's great.
Yeah.
I used to do yoga all the time,

31
00:01:49.411 --> 00:01:50.750
but I feel like I've got to,
uh,

32
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.450
I feel I have to shift it into lifting weights again.
Like,

33
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.200
cause I've just been dropping now,
but I just feel like,
you know,
a little bit.

34
00:01:58.201 --> 00:01:59.550
I don't want to be,
yeah.
I don't want,

35
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.460
I don't want to be the guy like at the pool with no arms.
You know what I mean?

36
00:02:05.461 --> 00:02:10.290
So many people have motivated themselves by going to the beach or the pool with

37
00:02:10.291 --> 00:02:13.850
very little clothes on,
like thought about fuck summertime.
Fuck.

38
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.380
People are going to know.
Yeah,
exactly.
I reveal my secrets.

39
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.690
People going to know what disgusts me about,
yeah.
This is my glove.
Look at it.

40
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.060
This is my laziness.
Luck.
This is what I did all entire,

41
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.090
this is my poor food choices right here.
Look it.
This is drinking upper,

42
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.920
the upper part.
Yeah.
This is the part,
right on the sides.
But I really just,

43
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.210
but then when I started getting after and being like,
don't be such a sissy,

44
00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:43.980
like workout,
try and push it.
Then you want it.
Then I wanted to do it more.

45
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.200
Then I got into it.
Then I'm like,
all right,
let's go.

46
00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:50.070
Now I'm going further and going quicker.
But uh,

47
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.030
this is all been cardio.
All Cardio.
What about just body weight stuff?

48
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.060
Like you know,
I mean it's not a bad idea to start it off with body weight.

49
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.260
First of all.
Pushups.
Yeah,

50
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.110
because you haven't really done much like that in awhile.
Yeah.

51
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.550
It's Chin ups,
push ups in the body.
Weight squats really don't need much else.

52
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.330
Really.
No really.
I've been doing more pushups.

53
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.080
Depends a ferocious workout in with change,
grip pushups,

54
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.770
Chin ups,
body weight squats.
Just to just those things.

55
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.640
Does that mean I have to get them of those Chin up bars?
It goes in the doorway.

56
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.640
Yeah.
Get a real one though.
Cause those things fall on.
People don't,

57
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.540
the ones that hang folks listen to me.
Yeah.
Those ones that hang on the door,

58
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.390
the door Jamb,
I used to work construction.

59
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.800
Those fucking things are not designed for you hanging on.

60
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.780
Now you have little tiny nails and that's the one that people like me probably

61
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:40.240
installed them and sometimes you don't hit a stud.

62
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.700
You see that little tiny nail is going right into the fucking dry wall and

63
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.670
you're hanging that thing over there and it's pulling on that sucker.

64
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.971
Messed my shoulder up.

65
00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:52.090
I'll be best that fuckers that drill into the side of the door.

66
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.510
You know what I'm saying?
The ones that they go right in the side.

67
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.990
They screw it this way.
Go into the four screws on each side.

68
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.140
That'll hold your weight.
All right.
That'll hold your way.
I'll get that.

69
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.640
That one work,
cause it's put,

70
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:06.290
you're pulling down on the wood to the way those things are.

71
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.720
It's like sitting on the wood.

72
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.630
You know those ones that hopefully the top of the door.
Yeah.

73
00:04:10.631 --> 00:04:12.370
Shit is a recipe for a broken neck.

74
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.730
I feel like that thing was in like every eighties movie.
Yeah.

75
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.810
I mean I'm sure they have good ones that do that.
I'm sure that,
yeah,
sure.

76
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.290
But you should really check out your fucking moldings first.

77
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.610
Just moldings a pull and I just lay on the ground and do some pushups.
Yeah,

78
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.720
but real chin up bar man.
A real chin up bar is made.
If you just got one in,

79
00:04:30.721 --> 00:04:33.760
in a park,
just go to the fucking park.
It's your outside.

80
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.110
They'll a lot of parks have like those,
yeah.
Bars.
A little setups.

81
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.310
We could do counseling.
Yeah.
Nobody knows joke.

82
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.130
How many tools are great for working out.
I know.
They seem too simple.

83
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.110
They seem like,
oh ladies west go over there.
I go to Nautilus.
I don't need this.

84
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.400
Right,
exactly.
I do my leg extensions on Norell's.
I got my membership.

85
00:04:54.401 --> 00:04:59.170
I use once a month.
Bodyweight Squat seem easy when you do three.
Yeah.

86
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.860
But when you do a hundred and become very fucking hard,
right?

87
00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:06.550
When you get to like 70 and you're like,
Whoa,
shit in rid of that burn baby.

88
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.430
And you start counting down in tents.

89
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.030
And I remember doing pushups when we played football and you would do,
you know,

90
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.230
200 who will be like 200 and break them on a row,
no break coming up doing a row.

91
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.210
They would,
we do like 30 and then split them up and uh,
you know,

92
00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:25.650
there was a big time workout and now I'm doing like 25.
I'm like,

93
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.990
I'm good for a couple of days.
Sorry man.

94
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.260
It is getting anywhere more than 30 pushups.
It's like woo.

95
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.170
Shit starts getting crazy.
Yeah.
Yeah.

96
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.700
It was a lot of pushing.
Yeah.

97
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.470
To like your body has to be conditioned for that and if it's not,

98
00:05:41.471 --> 00:05:45.220
it lets you know you're like dirty arms start shaking.

99
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.170
The funniest part is hockey.
Around 19 though,
you get to like 1819 like,
Bro,

100
00:05:50.171 --> 00:05:52.690
I'm feeling fucking smooth.
It's so funny.

101
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.290
Whatever number you have in your head is where you start to,
right?

102
00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.460
If you say I'm doing 20 you start shaking at 18 if you say I'm doing 25 you

103
00:06:00.461 --> 00:06:03.790
don't start shaking until 23 you know,
it's a real mental thing.
