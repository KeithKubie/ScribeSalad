00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.690
Researchers at the University of Bradford
are developing a simple universal blood test

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.550
to diagnose cancer.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.100
And a baseball team in Korea now allows fans
to cheer through a computer and have it physically

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.470
represented at the stadium by a robot.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.470
Vsauce!

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.630
Kevin here - this is Mind Blow.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.480
Jibo is the first robot that will be a part
of your family.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.019
Designed by famed roboticist Cynthia Breazeal,
Jibo is an interactive companion and helper.

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.940
It comes with several apps including one that
takes pictures using a facial tracker, a personal

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.430
assistant that keeps your schedule and provides
reminders, a telepresence app for long distance

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.540
communication and even a storyteller that
uses sound effects and graphics to entertain

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.540
kids.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.760
The crowdfunding campaign aims to create a
community of developers using Jibo as a platform

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.440
in order to maximize the potential of the
social robot planning to roll out in 2015.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.560
One of the longest pieces of dinosaur coprolite
recently sold at auction for $8,500.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.250
Coprolite is fossilized poop.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.320
In related news, newly discovered tracks add
to the theory that T-Rexes hunted in packs.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.609
Which is terrifying.

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:16.259
The world’s largest laser is helping researchers
study planet formation by crushing diamonds.

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.119
The 30 foot long laser along with 175 other
lasers combine to exert 50 million times the

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.380
amount of Earth’s atmospheric pressure on
a single diamond and they're doing this to

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.939
learn what the core of huge planets like Saturn
might look like.

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:36.130
Sense is a bedside monitor and smart alarm
that kind of turns sleeping into a video game.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.520
It uses a sensor clipped onto a pillow to
monitor the bedroom environment and how well

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.861
you slept and gives you a score - so if the
room is pitch black you gain points but if

00:01:45.861 --> 00:01:49.619
a car alarm woke you up at 3 am - you lose
points.

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.600
With the smart alarm function if you’re
supposed to be up at 9:30 but you’re awake

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.380
at 9:15 - it’ll go off early so you don’t
fall back to sleep.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.450
Waking you up at the optimum time.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.469
The recently unveiled Mercedes Benz Future
Truck 2025 drives itself.

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.560
It’s equipped the Highway Pilot assistance
system that drives completely autonomously

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.130
up to 85 km/h.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.290
The prototype was tested on a stretch of the
Autobahn near East Germany and responded perfectly

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.950
to traffic but it retains a steering wheel
for critical maneuvers.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.580
And they hope to have them on the road by
2025.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.580
Largest aquatic insect recently found in China
with a 21 cm wingspan.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.780
That’s 8.2 inches.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.610
A new study shows that fist-pumping transmit
significantly fewer bacteria than shaking

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.690
hands.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.840
And nearly twice as many bacteria are transmitted
during a handshake compared to a high-five.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.600
Researchers say the fist bump could substantially
reduce the transmission of infectious diseases

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.150
between people.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.840
Finding Rover is an app that uses facial recognition
to help find lost dogs.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.340
Users take a front-facing photo of their dog
and if someday it gets lost the app scans

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.660
all the missing dogs in the area.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.810
Conversely you can help return lost dogs by
snapping a photo and matching the face and

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.290
getting the owner’s contact info.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.040
Researchers at Carnegie Melon have created
a camera-filled dome that recreates full 3-D

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.310
motion scenes.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.480
The two-story geodesic dome features over
500 cameras capturing 100,000 different points

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.560
in motion at any time without the need for
physical markers.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.260
This could be a huge upgrade to motion capture
for movies and video games and even eventually

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.540
be used in sporting events and concerts by
taking advantage of the crowd’s cell phone

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.540
cameras.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.570
Finally, Center Of The Sun is synced with
glitch animation representing the life cycle

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.700
of an Olmec sun god.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:57.750
I’m gonna leave you with a Macgyver robot
that uses environmental objects as tools - and

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:41.270
as always thanks for watching!
