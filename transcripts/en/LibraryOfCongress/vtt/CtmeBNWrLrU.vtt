00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.480
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: Welcome
everybody to another Thursday at 3.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.720
Many of you are familiar faces
now; some of you are new.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.930
Today it's a great pleasure

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.160
to welcome Chet Van Duzer
back to our division.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.380
He's a familiar fellow to many
of us here in the library.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.820
We were trying to remember

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.670
when he first started showing
up at the reading room.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.210
I think it was around 2010.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:55.840 position:56%
In 2011, he was the Kislak Fellow in
the Kluge Center doing work on maps

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.910 position:56%
and the benefit, of course, for
those of us who are in reading rooms

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.430
and reference stations when
Chet is around is a simply query

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.500
for a book turns into a
small workshop from Chet.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.960
So we've learned a great deal
and he's not only a great scholar

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.830
but also a natural teacher and many
of us appreciate that opportunity.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.250
So over the years we've
managed to become equally expert

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.110
in the books that he's written.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.320
Floating Island: A
Global Bibliography,

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.320
a book on Schoner's 1515 Globe.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.410
A lovely book on the
1507 and 1516 Ptolemy map

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.060
and just a few years ago we heard
a talk from him about Sea Monsters

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.720
in Medieval and Renaissance Maps.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.450
A book that many of us have on our
shelves actually at the moment.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.750
So today he's talking about
some of his recent work.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.470
Chet's work is always seemed to be
involved around what maps tell us

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.530
in terms of understanding
the perception of the world

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.690 position:56%
that surrounds people both the known
and the unknown world and oftentimes

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.010
in a very kind of humane
way he's looking at maps

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.670
to understand people's
perceptions of the world.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.330
My notion of his talk today which
is about looking at several copies

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.660
of Ptolemy's Geography, although
I don't know what was wrong

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.180
with just looking at ours.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.260
[Laughter] Has led him to
some conclusions that, again,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.540
has arrived at some
kind of impression

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.840
of what these contributors, these
annotators to the geography have

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.370
to tell us about the perception of
the world both known and unknown.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.310
So, we're really thrilled to have
you back and to give your talk.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.110
So please welcome Chet Van Duzer.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:42.610
[ Applause ]

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.960
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: Well, thank you,
Mark, and thank you all for coming.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.560
I don't think I need to say
that manuscript annotations,

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.580
notes made by the readers and users

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.480
of early modern books
are wonderful evidence

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.440
as to how those works
were received and used.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.600
So I'll be looking today at the
annotations in 4 different copies

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.670
of Ptolemy's Geography to here
at the Library of Congress

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.000
and to other institutions.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.300
[Laughter] So I'll
begin by a few words

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.920
about what Ptolemy's Geography is.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.580
It was written in the Second
Century AD in Alexandria, Egypt,

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.160
which was then culturally Greek.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:30.510
It consists of 2 principle parts;
instructions on how to make maps

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.220
and a database of about
8,000 placenames

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.920 position:56%
with their latitudes and longitudes.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.280
So the information
needed to fill the maps.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.410
We don't necessarily see
a Ptolemaic map everyday

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.820
so here's a Ptolemaic
world map, manuscript,

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.030
and just to orient ourselves
a little bit here is Europe,

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.250
Africa and Asia.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.070
So when Ptolemy's Geography
was rediscovered in Byzantium

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:07.290
in about 1300 and then
diffused from Byzantium to Italy

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:14.200 position:56%
and then reproduced in a profusion
of manuscripts and printed editions,

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.720
it was realized that Ptolemy's
data was at that point more

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.870
than a thousand years old.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.780
And so while on the one hand there
was this great respect for Ptolemy

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.350
and his geography, but on the
other hand there was this series

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.770
of various different
attempts to supplement

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.470
or update or correct Ptolemy.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.540
And just to look at one example
of that, a visual example.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.110
So on this Ptolemaic world
map, the northern edge

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.670
of the map is what the
edge of a map should be.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:54.540 position:56%
It's the limit of knowledge, but
there are other Ptolemaic world maps

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.000
where that is not the case.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.120
Here the geography spills
over the northern border.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.850
So this is one visual example of
the way in which cartographers

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.100
and editors of the
work sought to update

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.490
and supplement Ptolemy's Geography.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.410
And I would like to consider
the annotations as another way

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.990
in which readers and users

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.670
of the book supplemented
Ptolemy's Geography in particular

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:27.130
as I said Ptolemy's Geography
is mostly this huge database

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.890
of 8,000 placenames with their
latitudes and longitudes.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.890
He offers very little in the
way of description and a lot

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.950
of readers felt that want.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.750
They wanted more in
the way of description.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.230
In studying the annotations
in Ptolemy's Geography,

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:49.290
one gets the sense that a desire
for more descriptive information

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:55.650
about the world was an important
motivating factor in the placement,

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.990
the writing of annotations
in the book.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.330 position:56%
So these are the 4 copies I'll look.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.500
One at the Lilly Library, 2
here at the Library of Congress

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.320
and the last one at Princeton.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.620
So beginning with the
Lilly Library copy.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.640
I begin not with the Lilly
Library copy but with a,

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:23.860
the map of the British
Isles from the 1513 edition,

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.830
which it's the same edition but
that's not the Lilly Library,

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.910
but without any annotations,
without any hand coloring

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.370
and without any other
graphic editions

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.720
which we'll see in a moment.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.720
Switching now to the same map
in the Lilly Library copy,

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.440 position:56%
we can see that first of all it's
hand colored; that's not so unusual.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.310
There is also the addition of 2
ships, which is unusual in the sort

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.420
of supplementary decoration
of Ptolemy maps.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.670
And a fairly extensive
program of annotation.

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:01.580 position:56%
And I'll look at this one annotation
which is just north of Ireland.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.880
Here it is.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.280
I've transcribed the text below
and the annotator is talking

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.640
about the conversion of the
British Isles to Christianity.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:16.170 position:56%
And you'll notice at the end he
specifies the latitude and longitude

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.700
of the middle of this region

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.350
and at the very end he
says secundum Schoner.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.070
So very helpfully indicating
the source

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.380
that isn't often the
case with annotations.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:34.880
By Schoner he means Johann
Schoner who was the creator

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.610
of this printed globe of 1515.

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:42.920
He also made a manuscript globe
in 1520, which is in the National,

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.890 position:56%
German National Museum in Nuremberg.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:50.780
To accompany his globe
Schoner printed this pamphlet

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:55.570
which in an interesting way
is similar to the annotations

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:57.960
that occur in copies
of Ptolemy's Geography.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.930
Supplementary information,
descriptive information

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:04.190
that he did not have
room for on the globe.

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:06.380
And it turns out that the annotator

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.120
in the Lilly Library
told me was cribbing,

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.680
was copying his information
from this pamphlet.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:17.010
So he found a source that offered
precisely the supplementary

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:20.770
descriptive information he wanted
and copied that information

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:27.360
into this copy of Ptolemy making
it a more complete reference work

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.320
if you will to the world.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.640
So here's the passage in question.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.270
I've transcribed the 2.

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:36.590
The wording is not identical
but it's very similar.

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:40.360
In particular at the very end,
it's skipping over the Latin

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:45.640 position:56%
and you can see that the coordinates
indicated are the same 7 degrees,

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.290
30 and 57 degrees.

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:53.280
To look at another example
this is the third map of Africa

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.680
in the 1513 Ptolemy
at the Lilly Library.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.980
The annotations are faint but
they're 4 of them on this map,

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:06.140
and I'll focus on this
one here at the bottom.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:09.210
Here is the transcription.

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:14.540
He's talking about the location
of 2 people in Africa with respect

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:21.490 position:56%
to the Red Sea and the fact that the
people called fish eaters eat fish.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:24.710
One helpful thing about
identifying the source

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:28.360
that an annotator was using
is that it can be helpful

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:32.550
in this case filling
information that's been cropped.

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:36.440
So the book was rebound at some
point, information was cropped,

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.340
and I was able to supply missing
words because I knew the source

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.480
that the annotator was using.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:47.480
So here's the passage
in Schoner's pamphlet

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:54.620
and here is a comparison
between the 2 texts.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:59.320
An interesting feature here is that
the coordinates are not the same,

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.040
and I think what's happened is

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.020
that Schoner was supplying
the coordinates of the center

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.320
of the whole region

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.180
and the annotator is supplying
the coordinates of the center

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:13.640
of the area where those
2 people live.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:18.040
That's my best guess.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.340
So in that case, the scheme

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.260
of annotation is pretty
simple to understand.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.950 position:56%
The annotator found a reference work

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:27.050
that contained supplementary
descriptive information

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:28.350
that was to his liking.

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:31.540
He copied some of that
information into the book.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:36.330
Let's look now at the 1513 Ptolemy
in the Thacher Collection here

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.740
at the Library of Congress.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.510
Here's the title page.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:43.110
In this case, a later
user has scratched

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:46.210
out the name of an earlier owner.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:53.090
Here is Book 2 Chapters
10 to 11 in that copy.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:58.640
There's an extensive program
indicating the modern equivalence

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:03.990
of classical placenames and
there is also the addition

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:08.070
of descriptive texts such as
the one I've highlighted here,

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:12.220
and it is at the very
beginning of Chapter 11

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:15.360
of Book 2 of the geography.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.500
So zooming in here we have the
text, I transcribe it on the right,

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.500
he's talking about the name
of Germany and the names

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.590
of different peoples
that live in Germany.

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:30.980
The source of these
annotations is the 1535 edition

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.520
of Ptolemy's Geography.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:38.840
So, the desire for additional
descriptive information

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.650
in Ptolemy's Geography
was not confined

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:45.380
to Ptolemy's Geography was not
confined to manuscript annotations.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:47.390
People editing the work
and making printed editions

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:50.250
of it also added supplementary
descriptive information.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:54.410
The 1535 edition has
supplementary material

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:56.940
by Michael Servetus,
the Spanish polymath.

00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:04.650
So if we look at the corresponding
passage in the 1535 edition,

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:09.390
that is Book 2 Chapters 10 to
11, again right at the beginning

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:14.210
of Chapter 11 we have supplementary
marginal information that's been

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:19.680 position:56%
added by Servetus that is not
information that comes from Ptolemy,

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.360
and it's precisely
the same information.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.530
He's talking about the
name Germany and the names

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:27.340 position:56%
of the peoples that live in Germany.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:35.120
To look at another example at the
beginning of Book 7, Chapter 1 in,

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.110
again, the 1511 copy
here at the Library

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:43.580 position:56%
of Congress, here is the annotation.

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.440
He's talking about the River Ganges

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:50.600
and once again he's
taking this information

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:55.500
from the 1535 Ptolemy again
right at the beginning of Book 7,

00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:00.660
Chapter 1 in the 1535 edition
we have this printed marginal

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:04.950
information, which is also
about the River Ganges.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:09.620
It's almost exactly the same
word for word as the annotation

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:17.780
in the 1511 copy of the
Geography here at the library.

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:23.600
So once again we've had the
annotators found a printed book

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.420
that contains exactly the type

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:29.910
of descriptive information he
was interested in and he's added

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:36.780
that information to
the book by hand.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:43.730 position:56%
Moving on to another case this is
the 1486 Ptolemy here at the Library

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:46.590
of Congress and also in
the Thacher Collection.

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:50.220
Here is the opening of the book.

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:54.250
So it's hand colored.

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:59.010
And here is the 10th map of
Greece, 10th map of Europe,

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:03.590
which is of Greece, and we can
see a fairly extensive program

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:08.860 position:56%
of annotation not so different from
what we've seen before but, in fact,

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:14.690
the program in this book is much
more extensive as we can see here

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:19.430
so very extensive notes added
at the bottom of both pages.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:22.860
These being the pages following
the fourth map of Africa

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:27.130
and following some maps is
the entire page is filled

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:31.240
with supplementary
descriptive information.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:36.010
So to look at one example here
we have the first map of Europe,

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:40.450
which is the British Isles and
zooming in on the annotation

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:45.200
and translating in the Year
180 after the birth of Christ,

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:49.820
the King of Britain, named
Lucius, converted to Christianity.

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.250
The island was later called
Anglia because it was conquered

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.300
by the Anglos although at the
time there were already Christians

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:59.250
in Spain and France but not all
of Spain or France was Christian

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:03.730
like England was called a wholly
Christian country and the flamines,

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:07.080
the priests of the Roman
religion, converted to bishops

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.810
and the archflamines
into archbishops.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:13.900
This was when Eleuterus was Pope
in Rome and Commodus Antonius,

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:17.570 position:56%
son of Marcus Aurelius, was emperor.

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:21.530
So a type of information
very different from a catalog

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:24.360
of placenames with their
latitudes and longitudes.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.090
More detailed descriptive
historical information.

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:32.650
In particular here relating to
Christian history and the spread

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:34.950
of Christianity in Europe.

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:42.350
So this particular book has a very
extensive program of annotation,

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:45.780
and I'll just indicate some of
the annotator's favorite subjects.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:50.170 position:56%
So Christian history,
unsurprisingly, Alexander the Great.

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:53.520
Many of the annotations
relate to Alexander the Great

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.560
as a mythological figure.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.660
The Seven Wonder of the World,

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:03.230
information about the wonders have
spreads throughout the annotations.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:09.540
And spices, a pretty substantial
discourse on the spices of Asia.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:14.200
So looking at one other
specific annotation

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:19.330
in this book this is a page
following the third map of Africa

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.160
and reading the text at
the top Pindar the Theban

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.380
who flourished during
the first Olympiad said

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.230
that water exceeds the
other elements just

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:28.880
as gold exceeds the other metals

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.090
because you can barely remove
something without the help of water

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:34.180
as it is known by the
various virtues it has

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:35.480
in different parts of the world.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:40.330
Athenaeums says that the waters
of the Nile are extremely fertile

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:44.470
and Pliny, Galen and Seneca
say that women even come

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:48.500
to bear children every 7 years by
virtue of the waters of the Nile

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:53.760
which make them fertile for which
reason the poet parmenon calls the

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:58.100 position:56%
Nile the God of Egypt, which is well
known for Juan de Pineda in his book

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.900
On Christian Agriculture.

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:04.690
So here again the annotator is
very conveniently indicating one

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:13.730
of his sources which is this
book Juan de Pineda's Agricultura

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:19.080
Christiana, which was
published in Salamanca in 1589.

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:22.340
What that tells us is that
the annotations were made

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:26.930
about 100 years after
the book was printed.

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:30.660 position:56%
They were also made in Spanish
rather than Latin, which is unusual,

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.600
but I think the fact that
they were made 100 years

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:36.280
after the book was published
is really impressive.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:40.010
It's a real testament to
the continuing interest

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:43.960
in Ptolemy's Geography
even as, for example,

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:47.330
other cartographic
material became available

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:53.160
such as Abraham Ortelius' Theatrum
Orbis Terrarum, the first atlas

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:58.270
in the modern sense of the word
which was first published in 1570.

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:02.430
It's also perhaps evidence
of the expense of a copy

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:08.890
of Ptolemy's Geography given that
it was seen to make more sense

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:12.680
to add material to a copy that
was a 100 years old rather

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:18.060
than buying a new one.

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:19.660
Another page of annotation

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:24.030
in the same book it has extensive
supplementary material about China

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:27.050
and the Philippines but
interestingly nothing

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:31.820
about the New World appears in
the annotations in this copy.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.660
Moving now to the fourth example,

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:38.710
which is the 1525 Ptolemy
at Princeton.

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:41.560
Here is the Ptolemaic map of Spain.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:45.260
You can see that there are
annotations almost everywhere.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:50.180 position:56%
It really is an extraordinary degree
of annotation and I think it's fair

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:51.540
to say the annotations are

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:55.860
of an extraordinarily
high level of interest.

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.970
Here's the Ptolemaic
world map that we can see.

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:03.950
I'll come back to this later,
but this is very careful layout

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:06.120
of the annotations on the page.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:14.310
And as in the Thacher 1486 copy
at the Library of Congress,

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:17.690
we have extensive supplementary
material added

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:24.210
to blank pages following the maps.

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:28.160
The copy again was printed in 1525,

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:32.390
the annotations were
composed in 1527.

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:37.590
At one point the annotator speaks
of a historical event in Hungary

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:43.290
which took place in 1526 as having
taken place the previous summer.

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:48.760
So it's nice to be able to date
the composition of the annotations.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:52.730
We can see this difference,
visual difference

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:54.030
in the 2 halves of the book.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:59.090
So we have the text block of
Ptolemy's Geography on the left

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:00.910
and the maps on the right.

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:05.120
The maps are annotated, the text
is not and it was quite clear

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.420
that a dealer at some point

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:10.090
in the book's history put these
2 halves together in order

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:12.610
to be able to sell a complete copy.

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:16.430
I'll return to that question
at the end of the talk.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:22.230
So the content of the annotations
in the Princeton 1525 Ptolemy.

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:26.150
So just to take a few examples
this is the third map of Africa.

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:31.310
Again we can see this very, very
extensive program of annotation.

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:34.820
I'll look at 3 spots
beginning with this one.

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:41.390 position:56%
The annotator says add and that's
instruction to a student telling him

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:48.360
to write in the book add that the
map above is defective for there

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:52.190
where I put this sign,
which I have circled,

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:57.200 position:56%
there is Aphroditopolites nome and a
land-locked metropolis between which

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:01.640
and Crocodilopolis towards
the Nile there was Lake Mirios

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.720
about which below.

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:08.070
So he uses a sign to indicate where
on the map this information applies

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:12.430
to and then he also indicates
he'll add more information

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:14.730
about this lake below.

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:17.140
So there is the sign
he's added to the map

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:24.780 position:56%
and the relevant location just above
Crocodilopolis and then continuing

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:28.860
with the text below
and this is quite long.

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:32.290
Add, again, an instruction
to the student, write this.

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:35.460
Add beside Crocodilopolis the fact

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:40.970
that its king built a labyrinth
towards that city of Psanietum

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:43.210
in which there were 6,000 homes

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:46.940
and the pyramids along its sides
were more worthy of admiration

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:50.390 position:56%
than the temple of Diana in Ephesus.

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:54.260
Nor was Like Mirios, above
which the labyrinth was located,

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:59.320
and which was created by men, any
less remarkable being 3,600 stadia

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:03.560
in circumference stretching north
and south and 50 paces deep.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:07.510
In the middle of it, there were 2
pyramids that rose 50 paces high

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:10.880
out of the water and extended
just as far into the depths.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:16.470
A pace of 6 feet or 4 cubits
while a foot is sixteen fingers.

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:19.970
So adding information
about units of measurement.

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:22.830
The lake was filled by six months
of diverting water from the Nile

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:26.200
and this is enough to
show the useless vanity

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.200
of the Egyptian kings.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:32.980
[Laughter] So, this annotator
has quite a strong character.

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:38.840
The 1525 edition already contains
supplementary descriptive material

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:43.310
and he is very comfortable
disagreeing with that material

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:48.000
and saying that the person who
composed that material is a fool

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.160
and in a general way we'd see
he's adding a lot of historical

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.090
and descriptive information
here exactly the sort of thing

00:22:56.090 --> 00:23:00.540
that is not found in
Ptolemy and I think one

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:03.560
of the other really outstanding
features of this book is

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:07.370
that the annotations were
composed for a student.

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:12.860 position:56%
So this is a program of geographical
education in the early 16th Century.

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:18.390
Look at another example,
the fourth map of Asia.

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:25.070 position:56%
He writes not far from Tripoli there
is a field that Strabo calls Macra

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:28.560
in which Posidonius says
a dead dragon was seen.

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:31.870
It covered half an acre and was so
thick that men mounted on horses

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:34.580
on either side could
not see each other.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:37.870
Its mouth was large enough to
receive a man riding a horse

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:40.770
and each scale of its skin
was larger than a shield.

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:45.960
So, we'll see that the
annotator is interested

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:51.590
in natural history information,
geographical information

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:54.270
and ethnographical information.

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:59.780
Another example from
Ptolemaic map of Greece.

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:06.380
Here he's drawn in 2
islands that Ptolemy omitted

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.130 position:56%
and writes Ptolemy omits this island

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:11.130
which is famous for
the grave of Homer.

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:13.940
So a couple of things here
despite his great respect

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:18.970
for Ptolemy he's very content to
disagree with him and correct him

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:23.800
and also his powerful
interest in classical culture.

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:27.780
So, the vast majority of
his annotations relate

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:33.260
to classical culture and not
so much to Christian history.

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:38.910
The map of the Atlantic
and the New World.

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:41.700
So that's South America
at the lower left.

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:45.660
Going back 1 page to the
page preceding the map

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:48.590
of the New World he has a
substantial annotation here

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:53.160
that says remark as I often said
that neither this route to the west

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.900
that is to the New World nor that
of the Portuguese around the top

00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:01.090
of Africa is new but had already
been done by other ancients,

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:05.160 position:56%
then abandoned and now finally in
our times taken up again as is clear

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.640
from Aristotle a most celebrated
witness and a noble author

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.340
for increasing one's confidence.

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:17.510
So, his respect for classical
antiquity was so strong

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:21.350
that he believed that the New
World had already been discovered

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:27.080 position:56%
in antiquity and he's also referring
to passages circumnavigating Africa

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.530
that were made in antiquity.

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:32.600
So the recent voyages and
discoveries of the Spanish

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.940
and Portuguese were in his
mind worth very little.

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:39.950
[Laughter] Looking at the map

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:44.760
of the New World he writes here
along these same lines we will

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:49.370
venture based on the excerpts from
Aristotle that I transcribed below

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:52.260
that the men and women found in
this new land were Carthaginians

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:56.750
by origin and that afterwards left
alone and deprived of communication

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:59.240
with other peoples
they became savages

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.960
and gradually lost their
customs and rites and the use

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:06.010
of clothing through long desuetude.

00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:09.950
So he's referring to a passage
in the pseudo Aristotelian work

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:15.020 position:56%
that says that the Carthaginians
discovered a very, very large island

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:20.290
in the Atlantic with navigatable
rivers and he believes that that's

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:22.390
where the people of the
New World came from.

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:26.960
So this is a great intellectual
question if all people descend

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:30.630
from Adam and Eve and Columbus
was the first encounter

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:34.280
with the New World where did the
people who were there come from?

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.240 position:56%
This is his answer to that question.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.930
He believes it was the
Carthiagian voyage alluded

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:42.390
to by pseudo Aristotle.

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:47.380
So, moving on to some evidence

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:51.750
of the annotators shall
we say sharp character.

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:53.990
Here we have the modern
map of France.

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:56.580
He's added this banner
across the top

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:58.370
and he does this on
a number of maps.

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:02.830
And he says this province produces
a great number of chicken farmers,

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:08.070
innkeepers, cooks, flute players,
gamblers, drunkards and fools.

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:18.340
[Laughter] So he has his sharp
opinions about a number of people.

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:21.350 position:56%
As I'll indicate later, he's Italian

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:25.900
but he has unlimited scorn
for Southern Italians.

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:31.790
[Laughter] The modern map of Spain.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.440
Here he says the best thing for
one's financial affairs is not

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:42.070
to take a loan from
a Catalan merchant.

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:44.740
[Laughter] The book has
quite a number of these,

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:52.170
of statements like this and it's
pretty outrageous statements.

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:58.060 position:56%
And so again he's not afraid to make
blanket criticisms of whole nations,

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:03.000 position:56%
he's not afraid to disagree with
Ptolemy, he's not afraid to disagree

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.100
with previous commentators
on Ptolemy.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:13.340
So, it's interesting to look
at which maps are annotated

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:17.990
and which maps are not because
they're not all annotated and what,

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:21.360 position:56%
it raises the question of whether
this program was perhaps incomplete.

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.510
Whether he intended eventually
to annotate all the maps

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:27.660
and didn't have time but
nonetheless some of them

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:29.820
in their current state
are not annotated.

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:33.720
So here we have the Ptolemaic map
of Taprobana in the Indian Ocean,

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:37.290
which is usually identified
with Sri Lanka.

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:39.190
He certainly, there's plenty

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:43.320
of classical material he could
have sited about Taprobana.

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:44.620
He did not.

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:49.570
I'm inclined to suspect that
that's because his focus really was

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:54.560
on the Mediterranean Basin and
where classical civilization was

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.400
most active.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.990
The modern map of the Holy Land.

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:06.070
It's a little surprising that
there's no annotation on this map.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.570
The modern map of Southern Africa.

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:14.690 position:56%
I think a lot of other annotators
might have eagerly written something

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:16.910
on this map about the
Portuguese voyages

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:20.270
around circumnavigating Africa.

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:22.830
Since he believed that this
had already been accomplished

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:27.660
in antiquity his lack of remark
here I think is understandable.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.550
So looking at the sources
of the annotations,

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:37.420
one of his favorite
works was this one,

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:44.670
Rhodiginus's Antiquarum Lectionum
which is this huge collection

00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:47.990
of notes on mostly
classical subjects,

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:51.350
but some modern themes as well.

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:55.800
The sheer amount of
information is encyclopedic.

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.240
Fortunately there's an index

00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:00.950
because without an index it
would be almost unnavigatable,

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:04.500
but it is a tremendously
rich resource in terms

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:10.900
of if one were somehow
interested in acquiring information

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:14.860
from classical sources without
going to the sources themselves,

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:17.630
this is a wonderful work for that.

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:21.240
The annotator does also cite
classical sources directly

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:27.940
so I guess in this, when he used
this book, he was saving time.

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.550
This is a similar work by Sabelico,

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:36.630
Rapsodie historiarum Enneadum
first published in 1516.

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:41.550
Again a tremendous mass of material
called from classical sources.

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:52.180
This is Pomponius Mela's the Roman
geographers study of the world

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:57.180
with the commentary of
Vadianus, the Swiss humanist,

00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:02.540
and he makes very heavy use
of Vadianus's commentary.

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:05.580
This book is on display here.

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:11.460
And the title page of
Giovanni's Pontano's Dialogi.

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:16.290
A lot of the insults that he makes

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:19.380
of various people's
come from this book.

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:22.400
So he wasn't just using phrases
he had heard on the street.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:23.700
He's a humanist.

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:27.530
He has a source for his insults.

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:32.990
[Laughter] And a few words about
the care spent on the annotations.

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:38.090
So here we have the
detailed annotations.

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:41.020
If you've looked at
annotated Ptolemy's,

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:44.250
one thing that is immediately
striking is that it's legible.

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:50.370
So a scribe was paid to write
these annotations into this book.

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:51.880
So immediately we're talking

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:57.220
about set aside all the time
spent perusing these works

00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:00.260
to choose the information
to put into the book.

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:03.530
On top of that, we have the
money spent on a scribe.

00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:07.060
So we're talking about a
very elite circle here.

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:11.180
Just for comparison
sake here's the sort

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:14.220
of handwriting you often
see in an annotated Ptolemy.

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:17.750
Yeah, sort of scribbling.

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:24.570
Here's a modern map of Eastern
India and the text following it.

00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:28.260 position:56%
Again, this profusion of information
added to the book and one

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:33.210
of the interesting features is how
carefully planned the whole program

00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:34.510
of annotations is.

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:39.500
He often refers in one
annotation to another one.

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:43.700
So zooming in a bit he says
in addition to what was said

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.670
on the four other maps of India,

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:48.830
I think it is worth adding a few
words here regarding the fertility

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:50.130
of that land.

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:53.580
So he's always very conscious
of what he's written elsewhere.

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:59.230
The Ptolemy map of the world,
which I showed earlier.

00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:02.390
The layout here is
really remarkable.

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:06.590
So symmetrically at the top and
bottom of a page we have quotations

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:09.590
from Vitruvius about the
inhabitants about the northern

00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:11.510
and southern parts of the world.

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:16.100
So, symmetric quotations
from the same author

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:20.800
and we have these triangular texts,
you know, and it didn't happen

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:24.100
by accident that the texts fits
perfectly in those triangles.

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:28.760
This whole thing had to have been
tried out before and he argues

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.890 position:56%
in these texts that the inhabited
lands form an effective large island

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:35.660
surrounded by the ocean.

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:40.900
So he has a title of the annotation
at the left on the Hyperboreans,

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:42.720
at the right on the Antipodes.

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:47.460
And those texts go down the
margins and then stretch

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:50.490
in toward the gutter and they're
stretching towards the gutter

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:51.790
exactly the same amount.

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:54.830
So the whole layout
of the annotations

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:57.540
on this map is very
carefully planned.

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.250
The purpose of the annotation.

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:04.750
So as I said, these were
annotations made for a student.

00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:11.220
In the third map of Africa
looking at the lower left

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:14.800
where I added the Nasamones
who were missing

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:18.990
so that you would know
the custom of this people.

00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:22.570
So you, addressing the student,
and we see here this interest

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:26.880
in ethnography and,
again, correcting Ptolemy.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.180
They were missing.

00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:30.820
Here I am I'm adding them.

00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:33.720
The Ptolemaic map of Greece.

00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:38.100 position:56%
The lower left this I have willingly
written so that you will know

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:41.540
that these provinces have many
products suited to the study

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:43.210
of the inhabitants that is things

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:44.790
that are revealing
about the inhabitants.

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:48.460
So, again, a strong
interest in ethnography.

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:53.280
Following the Ptolemaic
map of France.

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.570
Anyone investigating
the ancient customs

00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:58.020
of the French should be aware
that and so on and so forth.

00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:00.020
So there's an expectation that one

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:03.560
who is reading these annotations
would be interested in knowing

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:06.150
about the ancient customs
of the French.

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:13.260 position:56%
The eighth map of Europe about
which also see Book 1 of our Strabo,

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:17.400 position:56%
to whom you should have recourse for
such things rather than to others.

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:20.960
So advice to the student
about which classical authors

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:24.150
to consult on which subjects.

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:28.600
Ptolemaic map of Asia Minor.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:32.630
I've explained these things from
Alexander the Great here so that

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.900
by using them you can
understand what Pliny says

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:37.220
in Book 5, Chapter 29.

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:41.120
So this expectation that the
student will be constantly engaged

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.690
with classical authors.

00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:52.780
All the Alpine peoples are listed
by Pliny but you, the student,

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:54.760
list them with their modern names.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:57.840
Write their modern names beside
the ancient ones by conjecture.

00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:00.600
So he's giving an exercise
to the student write

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:03.380
out the classical place
names and try to figure

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:06.150 position:56%
out what the modern equivalents are.

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:11.950
This is the clearest example, the
clearest evidence that this was

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:15.400
for a student, that this
was part of an education.

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:23.190
So how does this program of
geographical education compare

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:26.670
with others that were available
in the early 16th Century?

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:29.660
The short answer it's far,
far more sophisticated.

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:34.770
It was in the early 16th Century
that works, that educational works

00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:40.130 position:56%
in geography began to be published
really and they're incredibly basic.

00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:44.380
So here's Peter Apian's
Cosmographicus liber of 1524.

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:46.390
Very close in time
to the annotations

00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:48.060
in the Princeton Ptolemy.

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:51.210
Asia is described in one page.

00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:59.480
He probably has one annotation
in Asia that's that long.

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:03.810
A long list of place names
with latitudes and longitudes.

00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:05.610
So memorization.

00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:11.620 position:56%
So we're not getting a lot of the
descriptive ethnographic rich detail

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:14.180
that the annotator
provides the student.

00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:19.210
Johannes Honter's Rudimenta
cosmographica first published

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:21.210
in 1530.

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:24.430
Just take a sentence at random.

00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:28.490
The most important cities
of Poland are, a list.

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:32.340
No actual details given
about any of them.

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:37.860
List of classical names
with modern equivalents.

00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:41.180
This at least is something similar
to what he designed his student,

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:46.500
the annotator of the
Princeton Ptolemy.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:49.920
What can we conclude
about the annotator?

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.190
Well, he was Italian.

00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:57.970
He uses Italian sources mostly
not exclusively but almost.

00:37:57.970 --> 00:38:02.280
He, there's an occasional Italian
word that slips into his Latin

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.180
and the banner across one map

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:08.250
of Italy reads [inaudible]
virtuous inherent in Italian blood.

00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:13.070
[Laughter] And there's plenty of
other evidence that he was Italian.

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:15.400
I do not know what city he is from.

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:18.960
He never puts a circle around
a city that is suggestive.

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:22.550
He does not say who he is.

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:28.270
It would be certainly
gratifying to know who he was.

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:32.220
It might be helpful in elucidating
some aspects of the program

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:35.540
of annotation, but
overall I find the content

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:40.180
of the annotations more
interesting than his identity.

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:42.630 position:56%
He tells us that he traveled widely.

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:47.660
He visited the Hungarian court
on commerce, he visited Augsburg.

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:49.210
He traveled to England.

00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:52.620
At one point he lists the
most important English

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:54.370
ecclesiastical writers.

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:57.070
He may have visited the
shrine of Thomas Becket.

00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:59.840
He has a description of it that is,

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:04.120
that doesn't appear
in any other source.

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:06.020
He also seems to have
traveled to Greece.

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:09.870
Some of the details he gives in
his annotations about the maps,

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:13.850
on the maps of Greece
he's detailed enough

00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:17.350
to have been written by
someone who is there.

00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:21.440
And his primary interest wasn't
European classical antiquity.

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:24.020
The maps of Asia are
very lightly annotated,

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:26.690
the modern maps are
lightly annotated,

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:28.380
which is a powerful
piece of evidence.

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:31.450
So he's really more
interested in ancient geography.

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:36.200
There was no annotation on
the map of the Holy Land.

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:40.950
He repeated argues against
the great antiquity of Egypt

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:45.270
and this is his way of asserting
the far greater importance

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:47.000
of Greece and Rome.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.480
And, again, he argues that recent
geographical discoveries merely

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:56.120
repeated the accomplishments
of the ancient.

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:58.340
So a few conclusions.

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.700
What is this book exactly?

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:06.210
So we know it was intended for
an advanced student of geography.

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:10.680
This is not for a beginner
by any means.

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:13.810
The annotations profess
an interest in ethnography

00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:18.400
and more broadly show the
richness of classical geography.

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.710
The hiring of a scribe
and careful arrangement

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:24.340
of the text indicate
a luxury production

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:29.320
and so I think the most
natural conclusion is

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:34.990
that this was a textbook if you
will for a very elite student.

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:41.530 position:56%
So there was a lot of time and money
available for this project and,

00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:44.770
again, we're talking about
a student more advanced

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:48.540
than would have been served by the
textbooks available at the time.

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:51.170
It's also at least possible
that this was a fair copy

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:53.380
for the annotator himself.

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:55.990
Hard to be certain.

00:40:55.990 --> 00:41:01.340
So as I said before what Princeton
has is really half the book.

00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:05.430
They have the annotated maps, which
at some point were put together

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:11.940
with the unannotated
text from another copy.

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:17.590
By remarkable stroke of good
fortune so here's that point

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:19.860
in the Princeton copy
where we have the,

00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:21.700 position:56%
you can see the physical difference.

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:25.370
Between the pages we have the
beginning of the annotated maps

00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:28.520
on the right and the
unannotated text on the left.

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:33.020
By remarkable stroke of good
fortune I was able to find

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:39.390
in a private collection in Brussels
just the text, not the maps,

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:44.620
annotated by the same hand.

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:45.920
&gt;&gt; Whoa.

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.300
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: So there is,

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:50.690
I mean the handwriting
is identical and, again,

00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:53.050
so what Princeton has is
just the annotated maps,

00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:58.290
what the collector has is
just the annotated text.

00:41:58.290 --> 00:42:03.410
The collector realized that
it didn't make any sense

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:07.440
for the 2 halves to be apart
and that Princeton would never,

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:11.080
ever, ever sell their half.

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:14.400
[Laughter] So he very
graciously has sold his half

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:15.900
of the book to Princeton.

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:21.460
And so now after while quite some
time apart and at least some time

00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:22.840
on different sides of the Atlantic,

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:28.030
they are now reunited,
which is very exciting.

00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:29.830
Thank you.

00:42:29.830 --> 00:42:38.140
[ Applause ]

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:39.440
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: We have
time for a couple of questions.

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:43.210
I also want to make an announcement
that Chet has volunteered

00:42:43.210 --> 00:42:55.500
to find any kind of missing
[inaudible] from our collection

00:42:55.500 --> 00:43:05.060
and bring it back to us preferably
by donation if at all possible.

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:09.510
[Laughter] But we do have time
for some questions and, Chet,

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:12.600
if you could describe
what's on the table

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:17.040
so everyone can see afterwards.

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:18.340
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: Sure.

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:23.560
So we have 3 Ptolemy's here.

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:29.890
We have the 1511 copy on the
left, which has the annotations

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:38.020
that were borrowed from the
1535 edition, which is right.

00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:42.390
And I've indicated
with arrows in the copy

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:48.110
on the left a manuscript
annotation which comes

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:57.120
from the printed text indicated
with an arrow on the right.

00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:01.610
Then we have the 1486 Ptolemy here

00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:07.630
which is the one extensively
annotated in Spanish.

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:12.120
And here we have 2 of the
most important sources used

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:16.350
by the annotator of
the Princeton copy.

00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:21.850
By good fortune both of these
copies are insult annotated

00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:24.740
and await study.

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:26.040
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation:
So questions for Chet?

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:28.090
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:33.850
This was just fascinating and
I have a question about the,

00:44:33.850 --> 00:44:36.530
I believe it was the Princeton
version that you mentioned here.

00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:42.500
It's such a colorful annotator here
who seems to have maybe traveled

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:45.920
in Greece and presumably this
is 1525 that he is doing this?

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:47.630
So presumably this is Greece under
Ottoman rule and I'm wondering

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:48.930
if anywhere in the
annotations he says anything

00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:50.230
about the origins of the Turks?

00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:51.530
Their rule of Constantinople
and the eastern half

00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:52.830
of the Ancient Roman Empire?

00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:54.130
You know whether he views
them as being destroyers

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:55.430
of civilization antiquity or if he
has a different take on the Turks?

00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:56.730
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: Great question.

00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:58.030
He does not anywhere say
any such thing and, yes,

00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:59.330
I'm not certain that
he went to Greece.

00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:00.630
A few of the things he says
incline me to think that he did,

00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:01.930 position:56%
and I might be willing to think that
he wouldn't mention the Turks just

00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:03.230
because his interest was
really in classic antiquity.

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:04.530
I'm not sure.

00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:05.830
It seems like that would be
a difficult subject to omit

00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:07.130
if one had been to Greece.

00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:08.930
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:18.250
[ Inaudible ]

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:22.210
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: So the
earliest surviving manuscript

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:28.130
of Ptolemy's Geography that does
have maps dates from about 1300

00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:32.610 position:56%
and it's in the Vatican Library, and
it's not certain but that may be,

00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:38.140
so the way Ptolemy's Geography was
rediscovered was that a scholar,

00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:43.660
Byzantine scholar Maximus Planudes
found a manuscript of the text

00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:45.740
of Ptolemy's Geography,
it did not have maps,

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:47.530
but what is Ptolemy's Geography?

00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:49.310
It is instructions
on how to make maps

00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:51.340
and the data to fill in those maps.

00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:56.610
So he did precisely that,
created a set of maps,

00:45:56.610 --> 00:46:01.400
and the Vatican manuscript from
about 1300 may be that manuscript.

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:04.930
If not, it's probably
very closely related to it

00:46:04.930 --> 00:46:10.210
but that's the earliest
one that we have.

00:46:10.210 --> 00:46:12.250
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:13.550
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: Yes?

00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:16.920
&gt;&gt; I was actually interested
in the decorative elements

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:18.730
and annotations [inaudible]
and wondering

00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:22.220
if you knew of a source for that?

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:24.530
[Inaudible] banner who saw
a banner later in the book

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:29.550
and looked somewhat like
that, but I'm most curious.

00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:34.640
And do you see that often in
annotations that they're framed

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:37.260
or they look like modelings.

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:39.060
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: Yeah,
it does look like moldings.

00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:41.900
I have not seen that elsewhere.

00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:44.780
One of the really curious
features of the book is that some

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:48.840
of the annotations have a single
border while some have no border,

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:50.600
some have a single border,
some have a double border

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:52.200
and some have a triple border.

00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:56.730
I have not been able to detect any
system for why those are singled

00:46:56.730 --> 00:47:00.470
out that way, and I would
love to figure that out.

00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:02.030
&gt;&gt; I just had a question.

00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:07.020 position:56%
In some sense particularly the
annotator is kind of blending genres

00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:09.210
in the sense that we have a
long established tradition

00:47:09.210 --> 00:47:11.950
of chronicles, right?

00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:15.990 position:56%
And you know Ptolemy himself is just
sort of interested in making maps.

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:20.130
So he wants to create this sort of
hybrid genre, and I'm just curious

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:23.990
if you have encountered, because it
looks like we have other examples

00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:26.420
of Ptolemy that have
been taken chronicle

00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:30.070
like information and
putting in the map.

00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:35.670
Do we ever find annotators of
chronicles putting maps, you know,

00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:38.170
do you get the reverse ever?

00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:39.470 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: You do sometimes.

00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:43.080
Not by annotators that I
can think of, but, you know,

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:46.480
to have a world map and a
chronicle is not unusual.

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:49.220
I can't think of any cases off hand

00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:52.650
of an annotator drew
a chronicle and a map.

00:47:52.650 --> 00:47:56.190
But one of the interesting
things just to reiterate

00:47:56.190 --> 00:48:01.560
about the 1525 Ptolemy this
annotator is the editor had already

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:05.720
added very extensive
descriptive text to the book

00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:08.990
and it's interesting that
someone would choose something

00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:13.560
that already had such extensive
supplementary information

00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:17.700
to add even more.

00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:24.700
&gt;&gt; You mentioned Lake Mirios
in Egypt and does such a lake

00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:27.550
by any name actually exist?

00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:30.410
And if so, what's your theory

00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:36.430
as to how this particular
annotator learned about it?

00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:38.250
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: I would
have to look at my notes

00:48:38.250 --> 00:48:41.440
to remember whether the
lake actually exist,

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:44.760
but I'm quite that that
information came from the larger

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:49.500
of the two books there, and I have,
in my notes I have the passage.

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:52.510
Yes?

00:48:52.510 --> 00:49:01.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:08.010
There's considerable disagreement
about that but something like 4th

00:49:08.010 --> 00:49:11.790
to 5th Century AD if
I recall correctly.

00:49:13.890 --> 00:49:19.680
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: We
got time for one more.

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:23.780
&gt;&gt; You mentioned that
the annotations

00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:33.600
of the 1525 Ptolemy were
approximately in 1527, right?

00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:40.140
And that was based on something
that happened in the year before.

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:41.440
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: Yes.

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:48.280
&gt;&gt; Was that about the Turks
attacking the country?

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:49.580
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: It was, yeah.

00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:51.930
Yeah, yeah.

00:49:51.930 --> 00:49:57.780
So that's as close as we get to a
mention of the Turks is something

00:49:57.780 --> 00:49:59.080
in Hungary rather than in Greece.

00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:00.380
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: The
Battle of Mohawks [phonetic].

00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:01.680
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:02.980
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: So before we
say thank you, we do have materials

00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:05.900
out here that we're willing
to show you in a minute

00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:08.670
if people can help us push
the benches in and reminder

00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:10.020
that the books are out so
that we can show them to you.

00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:11.430
There are too many of you to
allow you to actually page

00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:13.050
through the books, but we will
be happy to try and help you get

00:50:13.050 --> 00:50:14.350
through the materials if we can.

00:50:14.350 --> 00:50:16.150
Please, let's give Chet
another round of applause.

00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:23.290
[ Applause ]

00:50:23.290 --> 00:50:26.950
