question is about technology so I know

00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:21.440
question is about technology so I know
 

00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:24.940

you mentioned briefly about you know how

00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:24.950
you mentioned briefly about you know how
 

00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:27.310

think we better stop there and an answer

00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:38.990
think we better stop there and an answer
 

00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:40.590

and we'll draw to a close
 

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:44.910
and we'll draw to a close
okay I begin with climate change er

00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:44.920
okay I begin with climate change er
 

00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:50.200
okay I begin with climate change er
again we are also in Switzerland vicious

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:50.210

you can improve the good news is you can

00:53:02.830 --> 00:53:02.840
you can improve the good news is you can
 

00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:05.740
you can improve the good news is you can
improve and that's a potential I think

00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:05.750
improve and that's a potential I think
 

00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:09.100
improve and that's a potential I think
it's almost a combination of technology

00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:09.110
it's almost a combination of technology
 

00:53:09.110 --> 00:53:14.320
it's almost a combination of technology
it's also new for example in in

00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:14.330
it's also new for example in in
 

00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:17.560
it's also new for example in in
transport I think you can improve quite

00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:17.570
transport I think you can improve quite
 

00:53:17.570 --> 00:53:21.430
transport I think you can improve quite
heavily here also if you look at your

00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:21.440
heavily here also if you look at your
 

00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:22.350
heavily here also if you look at your
buildings

00:53:22.350 --> 00:53:22.360
buildings
 

00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:25.930
buildings
standards or buildings there could be an

00:53:25.930 --> 00:53:25.940
standards or buildings there could be an
 

00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:27.970
standards or buildings there could be an
example so we I think we with a lot of

00:53:27.970 --> 00:53:27.980
example so we I think we with a lot of
 

00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:30.610
example so we I think we with a lot of
countries there's now a platform to

00:53:30.610 --> 00:53:30.620
countries there's now a platform to
 

00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:33.460
countries there's now a platform to
change best practices good ideas and

00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:33.470
change best practices good ideas and
 

00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:37.750
change best practices good ideas and
also find the financing for that so the

00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:37.760
also find the financing for that so the
 

00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:39.970
also find the financing for that so the
ideas would be here but it ups it's up

00:53:39.970 --> 00:53:39.980
ideas would be here but it ups it's up
 

00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:42.460
ideas would be here but it ups it's up
to do to every country now to implement

00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:42.470
to do to every country now to implement
 

00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:45.200

develop the future it's not reached yet
 

00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:29.090
develop the future it's not reached yet
it's not implemented yet so we still

00:54:29.090 --> 00:54:29.100
it's not implemented yet so we still
 

00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:33.860

actually and therefore we have to also
 

00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:51.380
actually and therefore we have to also
think on other elements how we can how

00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:51.390
think on other elements how we can how
 

00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:54.110
think on other elements how we can how
we can find a way for the population who

00:54:54.110 --> 00:54:54.120
we can find a way for the population who
 

00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:55.970
we can find a way for the population who
lives in these areas because they are

00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:55.980

day they live in unstable situation you

00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:03.570
day they live in unstable situation you
 

00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:06.500
day they live in unstable situation you
have all over the world what more than 1

00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:06.510
have all over the world what more than 1
 

00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:09.580

billion children who knows nothing but
 

00:55:09.590 --> 00:55:12.830
billion children who knows nothing but
violence and instability so I think

00:55:12.830 --> 00:55:12.840
violence and instability so I think
 

00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:18.860
violence and instability so I think
again here we must be creative and find

00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:18.870
again here we must be creative and find
 

00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:19.780
again here we must be creative and find
solutions

00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:19.790
solutions
 

00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:22.730
solutions
sometimes it's face-saving for the

00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:22.740
sometimes it's face-saving for the
 

00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:26.270
sometimes it's face-saving for the
leaders faithful in solution that that's

00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:26.280
leaders faithful in solution that that's
 

00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:32.750

ok yes I can do and so here a lot of
 

00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:37.310
ok yes I can do and so here a lot of
fantasy and discussions to see why is it

00:55:37.310 --> 00:55:37.320
fantasy and discussions to see why is it
 

00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:40.310
fantasy and discussions to see why is it
not rational why is it so emotional and

00:55:40.310 --> 00:55:40.320
not rational why is it so emotional and
 

00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:43.390

such elements technology
 

00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:56.170
such elements technology
yes for example FinTech when it comes to

00:55:56.170 --> 00:55:56.180
yes for example FinTech when it comes to
 

00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:59.200
yes for example FinTech when it comes to
financing it could be a powerful answer

00:55:59.200 --> 00:55:59.210
financing it could be a powerful answer
 

00:55:59.210 --> 00:56:02.529
