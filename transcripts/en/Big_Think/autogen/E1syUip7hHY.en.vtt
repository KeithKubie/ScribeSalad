00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.240
Narcissism is one of the personality disorders.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.700
There are ten personality disorders such as
histrionic personality disorder, borderline

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.000
personality disorder and rigidity and so forth.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.199
Narcissism falls into that category and is
measured by sort of the presence of the three

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.940
classic behavioral traits.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.449
One is grandiosity, the next is entitlement
and the next is a lack of empathy.

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.439
And all three of these things sort of intuitively
describe the narcissist.

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.030
Grandiosity is a deeply felt belief that you
are better than other people, that you're

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.359
more skilled than other people, more gifted
than other people, and also that other people

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:49.350
are uneducable as somebody I know who was
a narcissist once said uncoachable, the belief

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.160
that you have so much to teach and other people
simply can't learn it.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.899
Entitlement is also self-explanatory.

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:04.879
It's the belief that raises, that rewards,
that applause, that attention, that love,

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.700
that romance, that anything it is you want
and need you are entitled to receive.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.240
Babies have that level of entitlement.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.360
It's the reason that babies aren't just frustrated
or disappointed when they're denied the cookie

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.579
or the extra ice cream there want, they're
actually outraged by it because they can't

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:27.700
believe in their wee baby brains that they're
actually being denied something they want.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.630
It's the difference between want and need
and narcissists don't get it.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.909
And the critical, perhaps most destructive
of the three elements is lack of empathy.

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.219
Because for all of us, for nearly anybody,
empathy is a break on our behavior; it's a

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:44.420
speed bump on our behavior.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.740
You see the way you're behaving, you look
at other people, you can read it in their

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.850
eyes and their body language and their voice.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.280
You get it intuitively that other people are
being hurt by your behavior and you empathize

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.390
with that and therefore don't do it.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.180
Narcissists are sort of anesthetized on that
front and as a result they don't have that

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.680
deterrence to their behavior.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.890
Narcissism, like a lot of a personality disorders,
exists on something of a continuum.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:19.020
And in my book I call it lowercase n narcissism
all the way up to capital N narcissism.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.660
Capital N narcissism is the truly clinical
kind; the kind that does go by the acronym

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.739
NPD for narcissistic personality disorder.

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:34.770
And it's for a condition that seems ubiquitous,
it actually afflicts in it's clinical sense

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:41.650
a small share of the population, perhaps one
to three percent of the population has narcissistic

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.269
personality disorder, which is pretty consistent
with the other personality disorders and fairly

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:52.770
consistent with anxiety disorders like OCD
and phobias as well.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.019
The problem is you move down that continuum.

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:04.459
And the closer you come to clinical narcissistic
personality disorder as you move down the

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.250
continuum the more destructive your behavior
is, even if you're functional.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.320
Even if you're moving through society and
have a family and have a circle of friends

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.800
and have a job, you're still the kind of person
who's going to get into a lot of scrapes,

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.400
a lot of dust ups, a lot of confrontent with
the people around you because you just don't

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.450
get that you're not entitled to so much.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:34.459
You just don't get that you're not as good
or as great as you think you are.

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.560
When you move further down the narcissistic
scale you get to the point that narcissism

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.879
can actually be a very good thing; it can
be very bracing; it can be a source or at

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:47.090
least a way of expressing creativity.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.840
As I say in the book, and I think has given
offense to some people but it's not intended

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.819
to, it's that even our greatest and most humble
people, Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King,

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.090
had to have had narcissistic components to
their personality.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.209
They gravitated toward attention, they gravitated
toward crowds.

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:14.159
If we believe that they didn't get a charge
out of standing before a crowd of half a million

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:18.820
people, or in the case of Gandhi millions,
and moving an entire nation with their words,

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.001
well we don't really understand human nature
then if that's what we think of.

00:04:22.001 --> 00:04:25.520
Of course they got a charge of it but they
were equally humble men.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.230
They were equally modest men.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:34.360
They understood that what felt good to them,
what energized them wasn't all there was to

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.360
it.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.690
Steve Jobs was a brilliantly creative narcissist,
he was also something of an abusive narcissist.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.190
No slur on his work but he was not a well
loved by the people he worked for even though

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:52.130
they agreed he was right; even though they
agreed most of his criticisms were on point

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.350
but he expressed them terribly.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.400
Bill Clinton was a self-destructive narcissist,
although he's so fatally charming, which is

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.440
also one of the narcissists' great traits
a sort of lethal charisma that we forgave

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.570
him a great deal.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:12.480
Ronald Reagan I think is a very, very good
example of perhaps the most highly functional

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.280
narcissist who's ever been in, at least in
our political system.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.530
Even if you don't like Reagan's politics,
even if you never voted for him you had to

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:28.570
acknowledge the fact that he seemed just like
a decent and genial and comfortable and amused

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:34.370
and amusing man who enjoyed being inside his
own skin, who enjoyed being around other people,

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.080
who just liked what he was doing in a very
uncomplicated way.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.030
But again, it was narcissism, healthy narcissism
that pushed him into movies, it was healthy

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.520
narcissism that pushed him into politics.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.930
Paradoxically our most narcissistic president,
you would think it would be JFK, you would

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.120
think it would be LBJ, a lot of people would
have thought it was Reagan, our most narcissistic

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.100
president was Chester A Arthur.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.020
He served one unremarkable term in the White
House.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.930
He had very little to do in that time.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.270
It was an era of peace and prosperity.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.720
The most he had to concern himself with really
was reforming the U.S. Postal Service and

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:16.360
figuring out how to spend America's then massive
$158 million budget surplus.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.560
But, as I say in the book, President Arthur
had a whole lot of other things on his mind,

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:28.150
such as the 1200 wagonloads of furniture and
accessories that he had removed from the White

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.850
House because they weren't to his liking.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:38.370
And the 1200 wagonloads of new things he had
brought in all under the supervision of Louis

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.370
Tiffany.

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.470
And yes that means that Tiffany.

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.990
He owned 80 pairs of pants.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:49.220
He changed his clothes three times a day in
order best to display his wardrobe.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.910
And he was known in his era as the dude of
the White House.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:59.520
Dude precedes our generation by many, many
years though we don't think it does.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.560
Among the other high scorers in narcissism
were Franklin Roosevelt, which is no surprise

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:10.300
given the fact that he thought himself capable
of winning four terms and did win four terms.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:15.300
Other high scorers were Lyndon Johnson whose
sort of monomaniacal pursuit of the Vietnam

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:21.480
War seems consistent with a narcissist's inability
to hear criticism or hear that he's doing

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.480
badly.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:29.230
The least narcissistic president, no surprise,
was Calvin Coolidge, silent Cal who came in

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:34.330
dead last in the Narcissistic Personality
Inventory Scale of presidents.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:40.610
He once famously said I think Americans want
a solemn ass as president and I'm going to

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:41.690
give them that.

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:44.170
So he succeeded in that.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:49.420
Barack Obama certainly would score high if
he were to sit down and take the Narcissistic

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.380
Personality Inventory.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:56.680
He sought the presidency after only two years
in the Senate.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:03.150
He clearly believed that he could achieve
high office, he did achieve high office.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:10.130
Unlike some narcissists he doesn't seem terribly
comfortable in the public eye, or at least

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.800
terribly comfortably mingling with people.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.680
Now Richard Nixon was profoundly uncomfortable
mingling with people.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.940
Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton are profoundly
comfortable.

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:24.110
Obama certainly seems at ease in a room full
of people, he seems at ease in a crowd, he

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:27.910
seems at ease one-on-one with people, but
at the same time there is a coolness and a

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.390
detachment to him that a lot of people criticize.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:36.190
So while he's certainly narcissistic, I don't
think he is really as far along the narcissism

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:39.340
scale as some of the other presidents.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:45.320
One thing that Al Gore told me one day when
I was talking to him about the presidency

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:53.250
was very enlightening about all people who
either become president or even seek the presidency.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:59.500
This conversation took place in 2008, early
2008 when there were still some constituency

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.910
in the democratic party hoping he would run
for president.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:09.700
And I asked him do you believe that if you
came to the conclusion that you were truly

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:15.220
the best person equipped to effectuate the
kinds of changes that you want to see the

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:20.390
country effectuate, particularly say environmental
issues, do you believe that you would then

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.710
have almost a personal obligation to run?

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:29.250
And he answered with sort of a laugh and said,
"Well, everybody who runs for president believes

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:30.250
that."

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:34.990
That's the threshold requirement for getting
into the race in the first place, the belief

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:37.450
that you are the best qualified person for
the job.
