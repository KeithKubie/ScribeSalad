00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.430
Every movie fan has their favorite genre,
be it action, adventure, horror, or award-winning

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.430
drama.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.350
But it�s the stories of those who take up
arms to defend a nation that can capture every

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.000
one of those strengths.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.130
War films combine all these elements into
tales of survival and heroism that, when done

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.869
right, can stand as lasting memorials for
decades.

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:32.700
Here are Screen Rant�s 5 Best Military Movies
of All Time.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.850
Black Hawk Down

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.611
When two American Black Hawk helicopters were
shot down in enemy territory in 1993, the

00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:42.989
rescue slowly turned from an hour long mission
into an overnight siege.

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.269
The Battle of " Mogadishu" would be re-told
in Ridley Scott�s Black Hawk Down, dropping

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:51.520
audiences into the confusion, the endless
firefights, and the incredible bravery that

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.019
managed to save the mission.

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.570
The battle made headlines at home, but the
movie showed that hearing about combat is

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:05.590
nothing compared to seeing it up close.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.590
Apocalypse Now

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.700
Francis Ford Coppola�s epic war story may
have been a nightmare to film, but he couldn�t

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.220
have known how influential Apocalypse Now
would eventually become.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.330
When an American army colonel goes rogue during
the Vietnam War, a soldier is given orders

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.130
to track him down, and kill him.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.050
The movie isn�t based on any real events
of the War.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.410
Instead it's an updated version of the story
found in the famous novel "Heart of Darkness."

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.810
Apocalypse Now has more to say about the horrors
of war and humanity in general than Vietnam

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:39.610
in particular, and it's seen today as one
of the greatest films ever made.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.180
Platoon

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.870
Unlike other war movie directors, Oliver Stone
actually served in the Vietnam War � making

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.000
Platoon a more realistic story, even if it
is fiction.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.750
The film was based on real battles and soldiers
he saw firsthand.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.660
Stone�s commitment to realism meant putting
the cast through real military training.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.841
He even launched explosive attacks while they
slept to leave them as worn out as he had

00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:05.630
been during the war.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.750
In the end, the movie�s story of one man�s
loss of innocence spoke to an entire generation,

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:22.010
and Platoon became a classic for military
fans looking for realism, not just spectacle.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.010
Full Metal Jacket

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.269
"Vietnam can kill me, but it can't make me
care."

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.280
The movie�s tagline tells you all you need
to know about its view of the Vietnam War,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.620
following a single platoon from basic training
to the actual combat.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.409
Director Stanley Kubrick focused almost entirely
on the insanity and dark humor war makes possible,

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:42.260
and he explored what killing can actually
do to the average person.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.220
Making the case that not every war is glorious
- or even rational � the movie�s message

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:55.420
is summed up perfectly by the Marines� unforgettable
battle song:

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.689
Saving Private Ryan

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:00.409
A squad of soldiers heading through World
War 2-era France to find just one private

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:04.620
sounds like a small story, but Saving Private
Ryan was anything but.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.829
The movie begins with a massive re-enactment
of the Omaha Beach assault.

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.209
Director Steven Spielberg used more than 1,000
extras to capture the scale and intensity

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.330
of the D-Day invasion in this 27-minute long
sequence; and it was just the beginning.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.319
The story that followed recreated the war
in detail, with many veterans stating it was

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.340
as close to the actual battles as possible.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.189
The movie renewed interest in the war, and
forever changed how it would be shown on film

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:34.120
� ensuring its place as arguably the greatest
war movie ever made.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.769
Conclusion

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:38.819
