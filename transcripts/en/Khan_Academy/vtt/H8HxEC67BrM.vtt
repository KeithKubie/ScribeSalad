00:00:00.297 --> 00:00:02.480
- [Kim] Hi, this is Kim from Khan Academy.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.350
Today we're learning more
about the takings clause

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:06.670
of the Fifth Amendment.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.775
In another video, we'll
discuss the other clauses

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:10.620
of the Fifth Amendment, those that deal

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.254
with self-incrimination
and due process of law

00:00:13.254 --> 00:00:15.660
but in this video, we're
concentrating on just

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.240
the last few words of the Fifth Amendment

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.511
which forbid the government
from taking private property

00:00:21.511 --> 00:00:24.743
for public use without just compensation.

00:00:24.743 --> 00:00:26.965
To learn more about the takings clause,

00:00:26.965 --> 00:00:29.480
I sought out the help of two experts.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.120
Richard Epstein is the Laurence
A. Tisch professor of law

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.860
and director of the Classical
Liberal Institute at NYU law.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.580
He's also a senior fellow
at the Hoover Institution.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.390
Eduardo PenÃ±alver is the
Allan R. Tessler professor

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.780
and dean of Cornell Law School.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.550
So Profess Epstein, can you
give us a little background,

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.780
just what is the takings clause?

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.170
- [Richard] Well there's a
rule in constitutional law

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.270
that the shorter the
provision, the more difficult

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.776
the interpretation and this
is a very short petition.

00:00:58.776 --> 00:01:02.270
It says, "nor shall private
property be taken for public use

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.706
"without just compensation,"

00:01:04.706 --> 00:01:08.160
and the first thing to
understand about the clause

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.100
is that it's in the passive
voice so it doesn't tell you

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.936
who's taking it and early
on, since this was part

00:01:13.936 --> 00:01:16.820
of the Bill of Rights,
it was said to apply only

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.180
to congress and not to
the states and then after

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.690
the Civil War through the 14th Amendment,

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.530
it was said to apply to the states.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.017
So now it applies to both the states

00:01:27.017 --> 00:01:28.990
and to the federal government.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.180
- [Eduardo] Many constitutions don't have

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.310
an explicit property protection clause

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.129
but there is a fairly strong
norm around compensating

00:01:39.129 --> 00:01:43.686
owners of private property
when you essentially commandeer

00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:47.012
their property for public
purposes and that seems

00:01:47.012 --> 00:01:48.443
to have been the motivation.

00:01:49.373 --> 00:01:51.840
I think the clearest reading of it is

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.450
that it's a provision of the
Constitution that makes clear

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.020
that when the federal
government takes your property

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.870
or when the states take your property

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.530
for some public use that
they have to make you whole

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.060
by giving you just compensation.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.460
- [Richard] Private property's
a pretty comprehensive term.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.610
Everybody understands that it means land

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.150
and the things you build on land.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.950
They also understand that
it tends to cover chattels,

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.520
that is things like books
and baseballs that you happen

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.452
to own and wild animals but it's also,

00:02:22.452 --> 00:02:24.147
it's much broader than that.

00:02:24.147 --> 00:02:26.213
It covers all sorts of intangible rights

00:02:26.213 --> 00:02:29.383
like patents, copyrights, trade secrets.

00:02:29.383 --> 00:02:32.710
These are very complicated
and generally speaking,

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.380
the government doesn't have any obligation

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.180
to create a patent but once
it gives you the patent,

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.730
it just can't take it from
you because the patent,

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.700
after conferred, it is
in fact a property right

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.640
and then it also may or may not cover

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.364
other kinds of intangibles
like good will which is

00:02:48.364 --> 00:02:51.160
the value associated with a business

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.500
knowing that your past
customers may come back

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.110
to you in the future.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.780
- [Eduardo] On the motives of the framers

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.389
for including this, talk about things like

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.759
the confiscation, mostly
of personal property

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:06.669
during the Revolutionary War
by the British government

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:10.350
that that was possibly a
motivation to make clear

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.620
that if in future scenarios,
if the government wanted

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.776
to take your property, it
would have to compensate you.

00:03:16.776 --> 00:03:20.400
Most historians don't think
there was a real problem

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.423
being addressed by this, a
problem of uncompensated taking

00:03:24.423 --> 00:03:27.398
of property by colonial governments

00:03:27.398 --> 00:03:31.670
during that period or
by the state governments

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.150
during the Articles of Confederation.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.540
- [Richard] The framers wanted a system

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.840
of what we'd call limited government

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.130
and so what the takings
clause essentially says

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.038
is yes we need your land for fort

00:03:42.038 --> 00:03:44.325
and it's really very important

00:03:44.325 --> 00:03:47.360
but if we're gonna take
it and use it for fort,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.620
that's a public use, we're
gonna pay you compensation

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.073
for the fair market
value of the land before

00:03:52.073 --> 00:03:55.160
the fort was put on and this is in order

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.810
to make sure that you
can't pick and choose

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.580
your victims and it's a way

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.390
of assuring government regularity.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.590
That's the first.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.070
Second thing is more economic,
less apparent at the time

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.998
of the framing, pretty apparent today,

00:04:06.998 --> 00:04:09.330
is that the government can take something

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.681
and not pay you compensation,
it's gonna overtake.

00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:16.040
So your land is worth 100
thousand dollars as a farm

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.790
but if you're gonna use it for a fort,

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.710
it's only worth 10 thousand dollars.

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:22.770
If you don't have to pay
the 100 thousand dollars,

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.060
well you may take it 'cause
you get 10 thousand dollars

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.894
worth of gain but if you have
to pay the fair market value

00:04:27.894 --> 00:04:30.185
of the property interest
taking, you won't do it.

00:04:30.185 --> 00:04:32.867
So essentially what it
does is it makes sure

00:04:32.867 --> 00:04:36.020
or at least improves the
odds that when the government

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.998
does take property, what
does regular, it will in fact

00:04:38.998 --> 00:04:41.048
improve overall social welfare.

00:04:41.048 --> 00:04:43.416
So you have a political function dealing

00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:46.706
with singling out and you
have an economic function

00:04:46.706 --> 00:04:49.040
dealing with the overall improvement

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.757
of government behavior from
an economic point of view.

00:04:51.757 --> 00:04:54.982
- [Kim] Okay so say I had a piece of land

00:04:54.982 --> 00:04:57.454
and the government decided
that they wanted it

00:04:57.454 --> 00:05:00.949
for some purpose, what
would be the legal process

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:04.464
for the government to go
about acquiring my land?

00:05:04.464 --> 00:05:07.751
- [Eduardo] Well the
process for eminent domain

00:05:07.751 --> 00:05:10.714
really varies by state but
typically there's some notice

00:05:10.714 --> 00:05:13.770
that the government
gives you that it intends

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.030
to take your property.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.430
The government goes to
court and gets an order

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.960
of condemnation to take
title of the property

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.070
and then often there's a requirement

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.765
that the government bargained with you

00:05:23.765 --> 00:05:25.495
about the value of the property.

00:05:25.495 --> 00:05:27.875
It will tell you what
it thinks the value is,

00:05:27.875 --> 00:05:30.920
the fair market value is
the standard that we use

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.086
for just compensation,
that's the value that

00:05:33.086 --> 00:05:36.823
a willing buyer would
pay to a willing seller

00:05:36.823 --> 00:05:38.370
for the land.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.184
It doesn't include things
like your sentimental value

00:05:42.184 --> 00:05:44.510
or anything like that so
it's just the market value

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:45.867
of the property.

00:05:45.867 --> 00:05:47.575
There's some back and forth

00:05:47.575 --> 00:05:49.560
through this required bargaining.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.540
If the government and the property owner

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.904
can't reach an agreement
then the government

00:05:53.904 --> 00:05:56.924
can go to court and get
the court to specify

00:05:56.924 --> 00:05:58.310
the value of the property
that will be paid

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.970
in compensation and
then the payment is made

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.040
and the deed is transferred
and the government

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.690
becomes the owner of the property.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.340
- [Kim] Interesting, so the government

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.750
has gone through this process
to try to acquire my land,

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.021
what if I'm a real holdout
and I just really don't want

00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:15.462
the government to get my
land, what happens then?

00:06:15.462 --> 00:06:17.940
- [Eduardo] Well you can
litigate the various pieces

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.180
of this and again, it depends
a little bit on the state law.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.700
So some states put more
procedural hurdles in the way

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:24.870
of the government.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.620
Other states make it
easier for the government

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.870
but under the Constitution,
there are really only two ways

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.080
you can resist the taking of your property

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.913
through eminent domain.

00:06:34.913 --> 00:06:38.730
One is by arguing that the
use that the government plans

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.130
to make of your property
doesn't count as legitimate

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.727
public use because the clause says,

00:06:43.727 --> 00:06:46.377
"nor shall private property
be taken for public use

00:06:46.377 --> 00:06:47.600
"without just compensation,"

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.960
and that public use language
has been interpreted

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.750
to be a limitation on the
power of eminent domain

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.750
and then you can argue, the
second thing you can argue

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.730
is that what the
government is offering you

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.318
in terms of just compensation
is not adequate compensation.

00:07:00.318 --> 00:07:03.350
And you can litigate
those through the courts

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.331
and that can slow the
process down quite a bit.

00:07:05.331 --> 00:07:08.030
Some states make it
easier for the government

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.443
by saying well the government
can actually just take title

00:07:10.443 --> 00:07:15.443
while you're litigating
and others make you go...

00:07:16.813 --> 00:07:20.290
Allow you to stop the condemnation process

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:24.470
and litigate in advance but
there's often what's called

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.270
a quick take procedure
which allows the government

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.942
to move more quickly
and put the litigation

00:07:29.942 --> 00:07:32.914
on the backend but the
public use, if it's found,

00:07:32.914 --> 00:07:35.050
if the use if found not
to be public, what you win

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:38.790
is an actual prohibition
on the taking itself.

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:39.810
You keep your property.

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:42.130
If you win on the just compensation side,

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:44.871
all you get is more money,
they still take your property.

00:07:44.871 --> 00:07:47.410
- [Kim] So you mentioned public use.

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:49.850
What counts as public use?

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:51.770
- [Eduardo] Well under the current law,

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:55.360
any use that generates a public benefit

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.191
is really a public use.

00:07:57.191 --> 00:08:00.900
The way the court has put it
is anything the government,

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.814
any purpose the government can pursue

00:08:03.814 --> 00:08:07.240
through any other means, it can pursue

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.890
through eminent domain.

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:12.290
So if the government wants to create jobs

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.841
or if the government wants to beautify

00:08:14.841 --> 00:08:18.377
or if the government
wants to remove blight,

00:08:18.377 --> 00:08:21.060
all those things are things
that we think it's legitimate

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.990
for the government to try to do.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:25.271
If it can do those things,
it can do them through

00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:27.278
the use of the eminent domain power.

00:08:27.278 --> 00:08:30.240
- [Kim] One thing that
strikes me as interesting

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.094
is just the fact that this clause

00:08:32.094 --> 00:08:36.021
is in the Fifth Amendment among things

00:08:36.021 --> 00:08:40.410
like double jeopardy or self-incrimination

00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:42.670
so why do you think the framers included

00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:45.940
this particular clause here as opposed

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.656
to elsewhere in the Bill of Rights?

00:08:47.656 --> 00:08:49.360
- [Richard] Well that's a great question

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.316
to which there's no obvious
answer but the one clause

00:08:51.316 --> 00:08:55.190
that is pretty close to it
is the due process clause

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:56.987
in the Fifth Amendment that says,

00:08:56.987 --> 00:08:59.177
"nor shall any person be deprived of life,

00:08:59.177 --> 00:09:01.531
"liberty or property
without due process of law."

00:09:01.531 --> 00:09:04.155
So if you start with the procedural stuff,

00:09:04.155 --> 00:09:07.150
somebody's gonna say well how do we know

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:08.662
that the procedures aren't fair?

00:09:08.662 --> 00:09:11.030
And if it turns out
that the government uses

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:14.061
a set of procedures that don't
give you adequate notice,

00:09:14.061 --> 00:09:16.342
you're always going to end up short

00:09:16.342 --> 00:09:19.024
on the amount of compensation
that you're gonna require.

00:09:19.024 --> 00:09:22.670
So bad procedures tend
to lead to bad outcomes

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:25.060
which tend to lead to property being taken

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:26.599
at less than full market value.

00:09:26.599 --> 00:09:29.662
So what happens is is
therefore very close linkage

00:09:29.662 --> 00:09:33.783
between the procedures used
under the due process clause

00:09:33.783 --> 00:09:37.553
and the substantive protection
that you have under takings.

00:09:37.553 --> 00:09:39.627
- [Kim] Any changes in the interpretation

00:09:39.627 --> 00:09:42.740
of the takings clause by
the Supreme Court over time?

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.540
- [Richard] Well there's
been a huge kind of switch up

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.520
and down and let me put
it the following way.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.920
In the beginning, there
wasn't much of anything

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.983
that was done with respect
to the takings clause.

00:09:52.983 --> 00:09:55.760
The first federal case to deal with it

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.398
was called Barron against
Baltimore in 1833 or so

00:09:59.398 --> 00:10:03.797
and it just simply said that
the clause does not allow

00:10:03.797 --> 00:10:07.560
for protection of Mr.
Barron against the city

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.890
of Baltimore because it only binds

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:12.520
the federal government,
it doesn't bind the state.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.584
After the Civil War, two things happen,

00:10:15.584 --> 00:10:19.190
a real distinction, the first
thing is you start getting

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:22.166
comprehensive regulation of the railroads

00:10:22.166 --> 00:10:25.333
and the rates they can charge
and then public utilities

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:27.610
and the rates that they can charge.

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:30.820
And then in 1921, there's a
case called Block v. Hersch

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.098
and it's a very close 5-4 decision

00:10:33.098 --> 00:10:36.530
but they sustain on the
grounds that it's a wartime,

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:39.390
a temporary two year statute
that limits the rents

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.770
that can be charged in Washington D.C.

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:43.645
at the end of the first World War.

00:10:43.645 --> 00:10:45.247
- [Eduardo] One of the biggest changes

00:10:45.247 --> 00:10:46.180
in the interpretation
of the takings clause

00:10:47.602 --> 00:10:48.470
was the extension of the takings clause

00:10:49.311 --> 00:10:51.491
to government situations
in which your property

00:10:51.491 --> 00:10:53.170
was not appropriated by the government.

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:55.830
So what we call the
regulatory takings doctrine

00:10:55.830 --> 00:11:00.830
which started in with the
case of Pennsylvania Coal

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:06.261
versus Mayhon in the 1920s
and then has now become

00:11:06.261 --> 00:11:08.320
much more, it was sort
of dormant for a while

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.699
but become much more
active since the 1980s,

00:11:11.699 --> 00:11:13.587
that's a doctrine that says,

00:11:13.587 --> 00:11:16.471
"if the government regulates
your use of property

00:11:16.471 --> 00:11:20.167
"excessively, then the
courts can treat that

00:11:20.167 --> 00:11:22.677
"in effect as a confiscation
of your property

00:11:22.677 --> 00:11:24.818
"and require the payment
of just compensation."

00:11:24.818 --> 00:11:27.400
That's maybe the most significant change

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.405
in the interpretation of
the clause in its history.

00:11:30.405 --> 00:11:32.640
So there continues to be controversy

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.980
about the public use doctrine
on modern commentators,

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.711
especially libertarians, who
want a very narrowly drawn

00:11:37.711 --> 00:11:42.310
account of public use and
disagree with the breadth

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:44.474
of the doctrine as I described it to you.

00:11:44.474 --> 00:11:47.680
So there's a lot of activism around that.

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.940
There's been some state
law that's been enacted

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.180
to try to raise the floor there.

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.742
The federal definition of
public use is just a floor

00:11:54.742 --> 00:11:56.840
and states can go beyond that and restrict

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.268
the power of eminent
domain more forcefully

00:11:59.268 --> 00:12:00.977
if they want to and they have.

00:12:00.977 --> 00:12:03.670
- [Kim] So we've learned
that the takings clause

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.567
of the Fifth Amendment
prevents both federal

00:12:05.567 --> 00:12:07.934
and state governments from
taking private property

00:12:07.934 --> 00:12:10.575
for public use without just compensation

00:12:10.575 --> 00:12:14.740
but there are a lot of
questions about what counts

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:18.284
as private property, public
use or just compensation.

00:12:18.284 --> 00:12:21.200
In recent years, debate
over the takings clause

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.340
has centered on whether
government regulations

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.000
about how a private
individual can use land

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.819
also constitute a form of
compensation and the extent

00:12:28.819 --> 00:12:31.980
of acceptable public uses for which

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.830
the government can seize property.
