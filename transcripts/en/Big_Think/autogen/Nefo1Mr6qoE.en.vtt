first place assume that we have
obligations<00:00:12.410><c> towards</c><00:00:12.740><c> robots</c><00:00:13.129><c> so</c><00:00:14.030><c> we</c><00:00:14.179><c> think</c>

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:14.509 align:start position:0%
obligations towards robots so we think
 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:16.840 align:start position:0%
obligations towards robots so we think
that<00:00:14.690><c> if</c><00:00:14.809><c> something</c><00:00:15.049><c> is</c><00:00:15.289><c> intelligent</c><00:00:16.010><c> then</c>

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 align:start position:0%
that if something is intelligent then

that if something is intelligent then
that's<00:00:17.570><c> that's</c><00:00:18.110><c> their</c><00:00:18.560><c> special</c><00:00:18.920><c> source</c>

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 align:start position:0%
that's that's their special source
 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
that's that's their special source
that's<00:00:19.400><c> that's</c><00:00:19.640><c> why</c><00:00:19.940><c> we</c><00:00:20.270><c> have</c><00:00:20.360><c> moral</c>

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 align:start position:0%
that's that's why we have moral
 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.780 align:start position:0%
that's that's why we have moral

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:22.790 align:start position:0%
obligations right and and why do we
 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.120 align:start position:0%
obligations right and and why do we
think<00:00:22.850><c> that</c><00:00:23.120><c> because</c><00:00:23.660><c> most</c><00:00:24.470><c> of</c><00:00:24.710><c> our</c><00:00:24.830><c> moral</c>

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 align:start position:0%
think that because most of our moral
 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.640 align:start position:0%
think that because most of our moral

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 align:start position:0%
obligations the most important thing to
 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.620 align:start position:0%
obligations the most important thing to
us<00:00:27.770><c> is</c><00:00:27.920><c> each</c><00:00:28.100><c> other</c><00:00:28.310><c> we're</c><00:00:29.030><c> trying</c><00:00:29.270><c> you</c><00:00:29.480><c> know</c>

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 align:start position:0%
us is each other we're trying you know
 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
us is each other we're trying you know
so<00:00:29.930><c> basically</c><00:00:30.440><c> morality</c><00:00:31.130><c> and</c><00:00:31.220><c> ethics</c><00:00:31.610><c> are</c><00:00:31.789><c> the</c>

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 align:start position:0%
so basically morality and ethics are the
 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.639 align:start position:0%
so basically morality and ethics are the
way<00:00:31.970><c> that</c><00:00:32.180><c> we</c><00:00:32.270><c> maintain</c><00:00:32.450><c> human</c><00:00:33.110><c> society</c>

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 align:start position:0%
way that we maintain human society
 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:35.650 align:start position:0%
way that we maintain human society
including<00:00:34.579><c> by</c><00:00:34.700><c> doing</c><00:00:35.000><c> things</c><00:00:35.150><c> like</c><00:00:35.300><c> keeping</c>

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 align:start position:0%
including by doing things like keeping
 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.810 align:start position:0%
including by doing things like keeping
the<00:00:35.810><c> environment</c><00:00:36.320><c> okay</c><00:00:36.560><c> you</c><00:00:36.920><c> know</c><00:00:37.040><c> making</c><00:00:37.730><c> it</c>

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 align:start position:0%
the environment okay you know making it
 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.560 align:start position:0%
the environment okay you know making it
so<00:00:38.030><c> we</c><00:00:38.180><c> can</c><00:00:38.329><c> live</c><00:00:38.540><c> all</c><00:00:39.170><c> right</c><00:00:39.320><c> so</c><00:00:40.360><c> one</c><00:00:41.360><c> of</c><00:00:41.390><c> the</c>

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 align:start position:0%
so we can live all right so one of the
 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
so we can live all right so one of the
ways<00:00:41.750><c> we</c><00:00:41.960><c> characterize</c><00:00:42.440><c> ourselves</c><00:00:43.040><c> is</c><00:00:43.190><c> as</c>

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 align:start position:0%
ways we characterize ourselves is as
 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.780 align:start position:0%
ways we characterize ourselves is as
intelligent<00:00:44.660><c> and</c><00:00:45.079><c> so</c><00:00:45.920><c> when</c><00:00:46.160><c> we</c><00:00:46.310><c> then</c><00:00:46.550><c> see</c>

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 align:start position:0%
intelligent and so when we then see
 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.100 align:start position:0%
intelligent and so when we then see
something<00:00:47.090><c> else</c><00:00:47.210><c> and</c><00:00:47.390><c> say</c><00:00:47.480><c> oh</c><00:00:47.510><c> it's</c><00:00:47.870><c> more</c>

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 align:start position:0%
something else and say oh it's more
 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
something else and say oh it's more
intelligent<00:00:48.649><c> well</c><00:00:48.920><c> then</c><00:00:49.070><c> maybe</c><00:00:49.250><c> it</c><00:00:49.430><c> needs</c>

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 align:start position:0%
intelligent well then maybe it needs
 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.540 align:start position:0%
intelligent well then maybe it needs
even<00:00:49.790><c> more</c><00:00:49.910><c> protection</c><00:00:50.450><c> alright</c><00:00:51.410><c> so</c><00:00:52.010><c> that</c><00:00:52.190><c> we</c>

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 align:start position:0%
even more protection alright so that we
 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
even more protection alright so that we
in<00:00:52.790><c> AI</c><00:00:53.210><c> we</c><00:00:53.600><c> call</c><00:00:53.840><c> that</c><00:00:54.020><c> kind</c><00:00:54.230><c> of</c><00:00:54.380><c> reasoning</c>

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 align:start position:0%
in AI we call that kind of reasoning

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 align:start position:0%
heuristic reasoning it's a good guess
 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
heuristic reasoning it's a good guess
it'll<00:00:56.870><c> probably</c><00:00:57.140><c> get</c><00:00:57.410><c> you</c><00:00:57.559><c> pretty</c><00:00:57.710><c> far</c><00:00:58.010><c> right</c>

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 align:start position:0%
it'll probably get you pretty far right
 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
it'll probably get you pretty far right
