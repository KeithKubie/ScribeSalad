00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.180
Let's see if we can
simplify 6 to the 1/2

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.540
power times the fifth
root of 6 and all

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.926
of that to the third power.

00:00:08.926 --> 00:00:10.550
And I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.650
and try it on your own.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.810
So let me actually color
code these exponents, just

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.684
so we can keep track of
them a little better.

00:00:16.684 --> 00:00:18.950
So that's the 1/2 power in blue.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.750
This is the fifth
root here in magenta.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:23.660
And let's see.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.810
In green, let's think
about this third power.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.050
So one way to think
about this fifth root

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.910
is that this is the
exact same thing

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.560
as raising this 6
to the 1/5 power,

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.140
so let's write it like that.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.460
So this part right over
here, we could rewrite as 6

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.270
to the 1/5 power, and
then that whole thing

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.520
gets raised to the third power.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.390
And of course, we have
this 6 to the 1/2 power

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.870
out here, 6 to the 1/2 power
times all of this business

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.290
right over here.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.319
Now, what happens if we raise
something to an exponent

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.694
and then raise that whole
thing to another exponent?

00:01:06.694 --> 00:01:09.110
Well we've already seen in our
exponent properties, that's

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.880
the equivalent of raising this
to the product of these two

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.080
exponents.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.720
So this part right over
here could be rewritten

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:27.850
as 6 to the-- 3 times 1/5
is 3/5-- 6 to the 3/5 power.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.100
And of course, we're multiplying
that times 6 to the 1/2 power.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.060
6 to the 1/2 power times
6 to the 3/5 power.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.810
And now, if you're
multiplying some base

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.980
to this exponent and
then the same base

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.750
again to another
exponent, we know

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.450
that this is going
to be the same thing.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.440
And actually we could put these
equal signs the whole way,

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.130
because these all
equal each other.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.050
This is the same thing as
6 being raised to the 1/2

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:06.012
plus 3/5 power,
1/2 plus 3 over 5.

00:02:06.012 --> 00:02:09.232
Now, what's 1/2 plus 3 over 5?

00:02:09.232 --> 00:02:11.410
Well, we could find
a common denominator.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.440
It would be 10, so that's
the same thing as-- actually

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.030
let me just write it this way--
this is the same thing as 6

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.600
to the-- instead of 1/2,
we can write it as 5/10.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:30.200
Plus 3/5 is the same
thing as 6/10 power, which

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.750
is the same thing-- and
we deserve a little bit

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.820
of a drum roll here, this wasn't
that long of a problem-- 6

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.770
to the 11/10 power.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.470
I'll just write it
all, 11/10 power.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.980
And so, that looks
pretty simplified to me.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.870
I guess we're done.
