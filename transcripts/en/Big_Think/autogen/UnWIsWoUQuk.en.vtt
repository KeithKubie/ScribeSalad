meaning and whenever I do that when I do
it all the time

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260
it all the time
 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.670
it all the time
it's as if you feel a gray cell being

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680
it's as if you feel a gray cell being
 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.460
it's as if you feel a gray cell being
born in your head little addition to

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470
born in your head little addition to
 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.850
born in your head little addition to
your store of knowledge and while all

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860
your store of knowledge and while all
 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.910
your store of knowledge and while all
your the other cells are dying in a kind

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:29.920
your the other cells are dying in a kind
 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.950
your the other cells are dying in a kind
of genocide of the aging process you can

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960
of genocide of the aging process you can
 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.120
of genocide of the aging process you can
restore it and that's what it feels like

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130
restore it and that's what it feels like
 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.220
restore it and that's what it feels like
and it's it it fortifies you

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:41.230
and it's it it fortifies you
 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.480
and it's it it fortifies you
