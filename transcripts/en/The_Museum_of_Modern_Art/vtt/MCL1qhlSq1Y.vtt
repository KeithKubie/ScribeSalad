00:00:03.142 --> 00:00:04.849
- This is "Young Couple,"

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:08.026
a lithograph from 1913 by Emil Nolde.

00:00:08.026 --> 00:00:11.854
Nolde is known as one of
the leading expressionists,

00:00:11.854 --> 00:00:15.122
a loose group of artists
working mostly in Germany

00:00:15.122 --> 00:00:17.854
in the early 1900s and 1910s.

00:00:17.854 --> 00:00:20.763
They worked to heighten the emotional,

00:00:20.763 --> 00:00:24.439
expressive impact of their subjects

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.322
by distorting the forms

00:00:27.322 --> 00:00:29.760
or exaggerating the color.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.890
Nolde's subject here is the
relationship between the sexes,

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.969
and this was a theme throughout his work.

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.426
He was looking for themes that would

00:00:39.426 --> 00:00:42.141
get to the core of human existence.

00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:44.325
It's interesting when you
look at the two figures

00:00:44.325 --> 00:00:45.811
what you see, there's a certain

00:00:45.811 --> 00:00:48.524
ambiguity in their relationship.

00:00:48.524 --> 00:00:51.180
The man is grabbing
the woman by the wrist,

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.448
and she sort of recoils almost,

00:00:53.448 --> 00:00:54.857
so we're not sure if she's actually really

00:00:54.857 --> 00:00:57.667
afraid of him, there's
some kind of threatening

00:00:57.667 --> 00:00:59.714
or dangerous situation there,

00:00:59.714 --> 00:01:02.780
or if it's just a coy little
game that they're playing.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.424
But what we have here are three variations

00:01:06.424 --> 00:01:08.154
of the same lithograph.

00:01:08.154 --> 00:01:10.948
A lithograph is made by drawing on a stone

00:01:10.948 --> 00:01:12.636
and then being printed.

00:01:12.636 --> 00:01:14.742
Nolde worked in a commercial print shop,

00:01:14.742 --> 00:01:17.641
so it was a shop that didn't
really work with artists.

00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:19.739
He got very, very experimental.

00:01:19.739 --> 00:01:22.851
Instead of just having the edition of 112,

00:01:22.851 --> 00:01:25.051
he would change the colors in each print.

00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:26.792
Within this edition of 112,

00:01:26.792 --> 00:01:30.398
there's actually 68
different color variations,

00:01:30.398 --> 00:01:32.325
and we're very lucky here at MoMA

00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:35.452
that we have three of those
because what it shows you

00:01:35.452 --> 00:01:40.042
is how he used the color,
he experimented with it,

00:01:40.042 --> 00:01:43.625
each time to create a
different emotional reading.

00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:46.760
By 1913, many of the
expressionists like Nolde

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.171
were creating their most
powerful, very important works.

00:01:51.171 --> 00:01:54.211
And then of course just
a year later in 1914,

00:01:54.211 --> 00:01:56.248
the war broke out in Germany.

00:01:56.248 --> 00:02:00.923
If the relationships changed,
the subjects changed,

00:02:00.923 --> 00:02:05.111
and the mood, which was
often somewhat exuberant

00:02:05.111 --> 00:02:07.568
in the early years of expressionism

00:02:07.568 --> 00:02:09.955
changed quite a bit after this moment.
