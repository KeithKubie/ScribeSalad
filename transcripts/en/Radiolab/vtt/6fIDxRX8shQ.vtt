1
00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.670
Yeah, this is Jad, Radiolab. So what you're about to hear, uh,

2
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.890
is a show we originally released about six, seven years ago.

3
00:00:09.891 --> 00:00:14.330
We decided to revisit it recently cause it's been on our minds a lot. Um,

4
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.740
let's just, I'll start it off and then I'll say more about it in a second.

5
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.010
<v 1>Oh wait, you're listening.</v>

6
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.850
<v 2>You are listening to radio lab radio from W N y.</v>

7
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.213
S. T. E. Yep.

8
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.850
<v 0>Okay. You Ready? Yup. All right. Let's open the show today.</v>

9
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.020
<v 2>Test, test, test on a sunny street corner. Okay. In New Jersey.</v>

10
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.810
So where are we now? We are on Washington Street,

11
00:00:45.811 --> 00:00:49.890
which is the main thoroughfare in Hoboken. It's a nice day in Hoboken.

12
00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:52.440
People are out and about after work cause that Sangria.

13
00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:55.980
What do you guys and we're here with the guy, his name's John Horgan.

14
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.770
I'm a science journalist. He's also a teacher. Oh it is hot. Yeah.

15
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.870
John is out today with our producer Lulu Miller doing what he often does,

16
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.000
which is to go up to someone who doesn't know research. We're doing a survey,

17
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.240
only take a minute at most minute I can give you that.

18
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.060
He asked them this one question as the question,

19
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.380
will humans ever stop fighting wars once and for all?

20
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.023
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

21
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.200
<v 2>no, because of greed</v>

22
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.500
<v 0>and one upsmanship to explain. John has been asking this question,</v>

23
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.700
will humans ever stop fighting wars for years? Because for him, this question,

24
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.000
it's not just about war, it gets it something really basic.

25
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.540
Do we feel we can change who we are?

26
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.673
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

27
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.550
<v 2>in any case, the first time it popped out of his mouth,</v>

28
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.970
it was 2003 and a friend had asked him to give a talk at a church just a few

29
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.200
days after the first invasion of Iraq,

30
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.300
<v 4>and so here I was in this church and I can remember that blued was very somber.</v>

31
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.510
I was determined to try to make people feel that, okay,

32
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.460
this is a setback, but still you've got to believe that peace is possible.

33
00:02:11.461 --> 00:02:13.200
And I tried to list all the reasons

34
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.570
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

35
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.580
<v 2>and as he was making his case and getting worked up,</v>

36
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.000
you looked at the 60 or so people who were there in the audience. He said,

37
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:25.560
all right, how many of you here believe that war will end some day?

38
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.490
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

39
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.190
<v 4>and I think one or two people raised their hands out of 68</v>

40
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.460
and John Thought, wait,

41
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.790
<v 0>is this really who you are?</v>

42
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.100
And so that's actually when I started reading as much as I can about all these

43
00:02:43.101 --> 00:02:48.101
things and dug up some surveys from the 1980s what he found was that about 20

44
00:02:48.591 --> 00:02:51.020
years ago, 80 people were asking this question,

45
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.030
do you think war will ever end taking surveys?

46
00:02:53.031 --> 00:02:55.280
Now granted they were not the most scientific of surveys,

47
00:02:55.281 --> 00:03:00.281
but what the results seem to indicate is that we used to be optimistic back in

48
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:04.090
the 80s only one and three thought that war is inevitable, huh?

49
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.080
As a minority. Yeah. Whereas today, well,

50
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:11.800
humans ever stop fighting wars once and for all.

51
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.860
If you take that question to the streets of Hoboken as we did, you'll find

52
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.710
<v 5>no, no, no, no, no, no.</v>

53
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.750
About nine out of 10 people say, no,

54
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.240
no, no, never. No, never. No.

55
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.851
<v 0>By the way,</v>

56
00:03:29.851 --> 00:03:33.810
we call up John again recently to ask them have the results changed cause he has

57
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.500
kept on doing this survey and he said, no. Uh, six years later,

58
00:03:37.501 --> 00:03:40.950
it's still roughly eight or nine out of 10. People say, no,

59
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.290
we'll never stop fighting wars. Same results right now, depressingly.

60
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.590
The worst part is that when he asked him the next question,

61
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.760
why do you think this? Invariably he gets something like,

62
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.510
I think there's a human nature's too for greed and to always want more.

63
00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.520
It's just human nature.

64
00:03:58.521 --> 00:04:00.590
A lot of people are big dumb animals and they're just going to keep fighting

65
00:04:00.591 --> 00:04:03.110
over useless things in their genes. It's just the way people,

66
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.270
<v 5>and I don't think we're ever going to learn. Why do you say that?</v>

67
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.190
I just think that it's too ingrained in our human nature, so,

68
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.150
<v 0>so, so, so, so we want to challenge that last statement</v>

69
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.720
<v 5>too ingrained in our human nature.</v>

70
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.301
<v 0>Okay.</v>

71
00:04:19.301 --> 00:04:22.930
We know some things have been handed down to us from our primate ancestors.

72
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.820
Violence. Maybe who knows. Question is, how ingrained is that stuff? Well, yeah,

73
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.250
I mean, if you think that we have inherited something yet,

74
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.150
where can we do about it?

75
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.560
Or are we stuck or can we change if we make the right choices? Yeah.

76
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.910
So what we've got for you this hour are three stories. We're choice,

77
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.830
individual choice challenges, destiny, right? Maybe we hope. Yeah,

78
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.210
I'm Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab stick around.

79
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:54.773
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

80
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.250
<v 0>alright, so here's the thing. This is now me and the present. Um,</v>

81
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.050
this show was initially inspired by, uh,

82
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.210
an anecdote that I'd read about in the New York Times. This Guy Martin Bunzl,

83
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.490
uh, was telling a story of when he was 18. It was in 1966, I believe.

84
00:05:10.491 --> 00:05:14.600
He was sitting on a plane and a guy next to him said it looks at the stewardess

85
00:05:14.601 --> 00:05:18.890
and then says, oh, not another negro stewardess or something like that.

86
00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.030
And, um, this guy, Martin Bunzl, who by the way, it's a philosophy professor,

87
00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:25.730
he says, thinking back on it, Huh?

88
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.760
That was an interesting thing because how'd that guy on the plane said that a

89
00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.350
few years earlier it would have been like commonplace.

90
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.550
Had he said it a few years later it would have been intolerable,

91
00:05:37.551 --> 00:05:40.850
but right then it was neither.

92
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.440
It was things were shifting and he said, you know,

93
00:05:45.441 --> 00:05:49.760
it was like this guy was shouting through an open window between worlds.

94
00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:51.080
That was his phrase.

95
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.320
He was shouting through an open window between worlds and that phrase totally

96
00:05:54.321 --> 00:05:58.160
lodged in my head and I've been thinking about that a lot these days,

97
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.790
this feeling that maybe the ground is shifting beneath our feet, not quite sure.

98
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.420
And that's actually what brought us back to this show, that feeling,

99
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:10.421
because each of the stories in this show kind of suggest that window between

100
00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:15.140
worlds. So what we're going to do is as we redo the show after a couple of these

101
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:15.411
stories,

102
00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:19.760
we're going to check in real quick and see whether we feel like we've passed

103
00:06:19.761 --> 00:06:22.940
through this window into a new world or whether we're still stuck in the middle.

104
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.080
In speaking of new worlds by you, which we should say you just heard, uh,

105
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.470
Lulu Miller, uh, briefly in that last few minutes.

106
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.150
She at the time was our producer.

107
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.230
Now of course she's become the superstar host of Invisibilia. Anyhow,

108
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.390
so the show began, uh, with

109
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.960
<v 2>a familiar voice.</v>

110
00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.000
Remember this guy I'm Robert Sapolsky on, Oh yeah, that's Robert Sapolsky.

111
00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.550
We've had him on the show a couple of times. He's a neuroscientist,

112
00:06:48.551 --> 00:06:52.120
spends most of the year at Stanford being a lab rep,

113
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.630
scientists doing neurobiology in the lab. But in the summers, most summers, um,

114
00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.450
I go and spend time in east Africa,

115
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:03.370
in the Serengeti studying wild baboons there. Why?

116
00:07:03.371 --> 00:07:04.360
What is it, what is he working on?

117
00:07:04.361 --> 00:07:07.660
What's this reason to suppose he is interested in studying stress,

118
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:12.930
the effect that stress has on the body and turns out baboons are a perfect

119
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:17.020
source of data because they're always under stress.

120
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.730
<v 0>No, the one thing we know about baboons and have known forever</v>

121
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:24.830
<v 2>is it, they fight baboons constantly, not just metaphorically,</v>

122
00:07:24.831 --> 00:07:29.831
but literally have been the textbook example of a highly aggressive male

123
00:07:30.321 --> 00:07:32.570
dominated hierarchical society.

124
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:37.460
Because these animals hunt because they live in these aggressive troops on the

125
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.300
Savannah parentheses, just like we humans used to invest.

126
00:07:41.301 --> 00:07:46.100
We evolved very similarly. They have a constant baseline level of aggression,

127
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:50.030
which inevitably spills over into their social lives,

128
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.260
which is why he studied them. So what's supposed to,

129
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.430
he does basically is he goes into the Bush and he watches,

130
00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:01.470
I mean your field notes though. There's a floor them there and a whole shelter.

131
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.660
His office is covered with these field notebooks.

132
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.590
Each one containing detailed notes of who groomed who and who's not getting

133
00:08:07.591 --> 00:08:10.320
along with who and who's messing around with who in the bushes.

134
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:15.150
He tells the following story of a particular moment in his baboo watching,

135
00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:18.450
which completely changed his life,

136
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.900
changed how he sees the world. It happened about 30 years ago.

137
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.830
Spolsky was a young guy just out of Grad school studying his first troop, my,

138
00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.490
my first baboons troop. He really loved these animals.

139
00:08:29.491 --> 00:08:34.320
I was very connected with numerous ways. It was a pretty average group. Yeah.

140
00:08:34.321 --> 00:08:36.210
Your basic Bab balloon troop.

141
00:08:36.211 --> 00:08:39.390
The females were highly affiliated with each other. Um,

142
00:08:39.391 --> 00:08:42.750
they had a very stable ranking system. The males, meanwhile,

143
00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:46.830
the highly aggressive dumping on each other cause that's just what males do,

144
00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.400
right? So we thought,

145
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:56.220
okay, mid eighties, a big boom and in Kenya,

146
00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:00.120
wonders for the economy, lots of new lodges, lots of large expansions.

147
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:04.380
And there happened to be the next territory over the tourist lodge.

148
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.640
And this one particular lodge he says, had gotten really big really fast.

149
00:09:08.641 --> 00:09:12.480
And during the time the lodge greatly expanded their garbage dump,

150
00:09:12.481 --> 00:09:15.300
which means basically that they just dug a hole out behind the lodge.

151
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.900
And each day attractor came out with the leftovers and dumped it there.

152
00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:23.040
So what we're talking about here, if you can nasally imagine,

153
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.760
is a big steaming pile of [inaudible] trash,

154
00:09:27.761 --> 00:09:30.010
half eaten food, baking in the sun,

155
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:35.070
smell wafting in the breeze from miles and miles and into the nostrils of

156
00:09:35.321 --> 00:09:36.460
baboons everywhere.

157
00:09:36.461 --> 00:09:40.900
So it was not long before a troop of baboons not supposed skis,

158
00:09:40.901 --> 00:09:44.170
but one nearby discovered the garbage and just started feeding on it.

159
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:50.930
And here where there are eating leftover desserts and chicken,

160
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.520
whatever is all dump full of food, must be to a baboo and like,

161
00:09:55.790 --> 00:10:00.080
like venturing into heaven, Manna in the wilderness.

162
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:04.130
So this troop almost immediately shifted their entire behavior to,

163
00:10:04.131 --> 00:10:08.090
they just slept in the trees above the garbage dump and instead of getting up at

164
00:10:08.091 --> 00:10:10.240
six in the morning to start for Jank, uh,

165
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:15.140
they would waddle down around two minutes of nine and the tractor would show up

166
00:10:15.141 --> 00:10:20.060
at nine o'clock and dump the food and they would have 20 minutes of sheer frenzy

167
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:24.890
and then they'd go back to sort of being couch potatoes.

168
00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:27.500
And this is how it went for awhile.

169
00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:32.620
So they're over there living off of garbage and somehow some of the males in my

170
00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.460
troop figured this out. These males think we got to get in on this.

171
00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:39.920
We've got to go over there and take their food.

172
00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:44.450
What emerged was each morning a bunch of males would run a kilometer or so,

173
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:46.660
uh, to the garbage dump and fight their way.

174
00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:50.203
<v 6>Okay.</v>

175
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.680
<v 2>Get some of the garbage. So every morning there'd be a showdown basically. Yeah.</v>

176
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:58.070
And they would come back with canine slashes and stuff like that,

177
00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:02.600
but they'd also have drumsticks, cakes, hamburgers,

178
00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:03.753
and this ritual,

179
00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:09.110
sensible ski went on for years and then a few years into it,

180
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:14.570
I got word that there were a couple of baboons in this garbage dump troop that

181
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.810
looked awful and something was wrong with them.

182
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:18.740
Some guys from the lodge had called him and said, hey,

183
00:11:18.741 --> 00:11:21.110
you better get down here and look at this. And when he got there,

184
00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:26.740
what he saw was horrible animals with rotting hands walking on their elbows,

185
00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:32.300
just really bad. So trying to figure out what this is about,

186
00:11:32.301 --> 00:11:35.960
get veterinarians involved and we finally figure out his tuberculosis.

187
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:39.230
Turns out some infected meat had been thrown in the dump and then eaten by the

188
00:11:39.231 --> 00:11:43.910
baboons. And this was really bad news because while tuberculosis and people,

189
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:45.650
is it really slow moving disease,

190
00:11:45.651 --> 00:11:50.651
he be kills nonhuman primates in weeks and it's a nightmare of a disease for

191
00:11:51.201 --> 00:11:55.780
them in just a short time. The garbage jump troop was completely decimated.

192
00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.050
Not to mention that the tough guys and suppose skis true.

193
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:00.790
The ones that had gone to the dump every morning,

194
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:06.750
they got it to have the same kind of rotting hands and they all die of that. Oh,

195
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
that must've been really kinda tragic to witness this with is not a good period

196
00:12:13.121 --> 00:12:13.954
for me.

197
00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:15.893
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

198
00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:20.280
<v 2>no, these were my animals. I had, I had grown up with these guys.</v>

199
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:24.331
But you know,

200
00:12:24.331 --> 00:12:28.260
while suppose ski was heartbroken now that half of the Alpha males in his troop

201
00:12:28.261 --> 00:12:32.310
were dead, he didn't notice some strange things started to happen.

202
00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:33.860
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

203
00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:37.670
<v 2>changes. How do they change? Well, grooming spiked grooming.</v>

204
00:12:37.671 --> 00:12:42.620
So you and I sit on a branch and I take little fleas out of here for, yes. Well,

205
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:46.850
you know, usually when a female grooms a male, the males never reciprocate,

206
00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.190
but suddenly they were even weirder.

207
00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:53.780
You saw adult males sitting in contact with each other and grooming each other.

208
00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:55.550
Oh, you know how, how,

209
00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:59.570
how rare that is be like if I'm suddenly in the middle of round five of a

210
00:12:59.571 --> 00:13:03.590
heavyweight bout Mike Tyson just decided to stop boxing.

211
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:07.100
[inaudible] clerk comb Evander Holyfield's hair.

212
00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.070
You'll be like that if you were a bad mood.

213
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:14.390
Ologist it would have been less shocking if these guys had wings or were

214
00:13:14.391 --> 00:13:19.340
photosynthetic or something up to then IHC in like 30 seconds of male male

215
00:13:19.341 --> 00:13:21.140
grooming in the course of 15 years.

216
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.570
But at the time supposed to get kind of wrote it off.

217
00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.620
It's just some freak event that wasn't going to last.

218
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:30.670
So he actually stopped studying even after that big investment of time.

219
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:34.240
Scientifically they were ruined by such a non-natural event,

220
00:13:34.241 --> 00:13:36.700
removing half the study subjects. Oh No.

221
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.450
As a scientist it became less interesting to you. That was the rationale.

222
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.420
It was just too painful to go and watch these guys.

223
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:48.190
So I moved to the other end of the reserve about 40 miles away and started with

224
00:13:48.191 --> 00:13:52.420
a new troop there and for six years I would not go anywhere near this corner of

225
00:13:52.421 --> 00:13:55.000
the park as I just didn't want to be there.

226
00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:00.130
Now fast forward six years and we come to the moment.

227
00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:01.930
That really changed things for him.

228
00:14:01.931 --> 00:14:06.220
Really flipped him into a different way of thinking and it happened kind of by

229
00:14:06.221 --> 00:14:08.020
accident. So about six years later,

230
00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:13.080
I'm out there for the first time with who was soon destined to become my wife

231
00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:19.000
and decided I wanted to kind of show her where I had grown up.

232
00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:23.110
What part of the park you went to go to? The old haunt? Um, yeah, basically.

233
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:26.980
So went there and the troop was there and they were acting pretty much the same

234
00:14:26.981 --> 00:14:30.940
as before. Lots of grooming, not so much fighting and isn't that nice?

235
00:14:30.941 --> 00:14:34.300
And they're still like this great remnant troops and he's sitting there with his

236
00:14:34.301 --> 00:14:36.330
wife. It just pointing out all the different baboons on,

237
00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:38.980
there's Tiva and the Arizona, I don't know whoever.

238
00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:44.110
And then it hits him this a Piffen or whatever. Wait a second.

239
00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:49.850
There was only one male left. We'd been there at the time of the TB outbreak.

240
00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.010
Got Dawn, don't I don't follow

241
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.700
<v 0>this one. One meal. Stick with me for just one second and you will get it. Okay.</v>

242
00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.330
The thing about male baboons, first thing you can understand is around puberty,

243
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:00.920
the males get a little ant,

244
00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.830
<v 2>they get itchy, they're bored, and they just pick up and leave.</v>

245
00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:09.120
So in a troupe, any of the adult males grew up someplace else. Richmond,

246
00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.030
<v 0>that these new guys that were coming into supposed skis,</v>

247
00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.770
troop were coming in from the outside, from the old world order a Jerky,

248
00:15:16.771 --> 00:15:19.110
real doggy dog world out there.

249
00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:22.980
So you gotta figure these new males are coming in with old expectations that

250
00:15:22.981 --> 00:15:25.860
they're going to have to kick ass to be respected,

251
00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:30.890
which would mean that this whole Koombaya situation should evaporate the moment

252
00:15:33.331 --> 00:15:37.120
these guys show up. But it didn't [inaudible]

253
00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:39.260
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

254
00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:43.810
<v 0>it's stuck. Oh my God. The new guys are learning.</v>

255
00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:48.910
We don't do stuff like that here. And if the new guys are learning a new way,

256
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:53.210
well that means the old way, the violent way isn't the only way [inaudible]

257
00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.110
<v 2>this, this floored me.</v>

258
00:15:58.650 --> 00:15:59.870
Who was one of those moments.

259
00:15:59.871 --> 00:16:02.990
It will be one of the three or four best silence moments in my life.

260
00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:10.880
The key question was how to these guys unlearn their entire childhood culture of

261
00:16:13.261 --> 00:16:14.940
aggression, Blah, blah,

262
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.850
and somehow learned we don't do stuff like that around here.

263
00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:21.610
<v 0>Well, well what, well,</v>

264
00:16:21.611 --> 00:16:25.510
how do they unlearn something that was supposedly built in? Um,

265
00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:30.400
well he doesn't really know exactly, oh but, but, but, but here's suppose skis,

266
00:16:30.401 --> 00:16:32.470
hunch. Here's his hunch and this is really cool.

267
00:16:32.471 --> 00:16:37.270
I may have to do with that precarious moment when the new guy comes in.

268
00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:41.800
Now normally what happens in this sort of status quo is that the new guy arrives

269
00:16:41.801 --> 00:16:44.130
and it's just a really bad experience for him.

270
00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:45.510
<v 2>It's awful. I mean,</v>

271
00:16:45.511 --> 00:16:50.370
you look at them and you just identify with like freshman year at college or

272
00:16:50.371 --> 00:16:53.280
something, they're completely peripheral.

273
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:56.010
Every male who's higher ranking dumps on them.

274
00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:59.940
<v 0>And even worse, this freshmen baboons is completely ignored by the ladies.</v>

275
00:16:59.941 --> 00:17:02.910
You just sit there and see somebody groom him. My God,

276
00:17:02.911 --> 00:17:06.630
I went to a sophomore year until somebody groomed him. Come on,

277
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:09.000
why don't they Google them? Well, because if they did,

278
00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:11.490
some adult male would have attacked them. Oh,

279
00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:15.300
tell the ladies hang back while he's out there biting and climbing and trying to

280
00:17:15.301 --> 00:17:16.340
scratch his way in.

281
00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:21.180
What you've got here is a cycle that is existed for a long,

282
00:17:21.181 --> 00:17:24.030
long time, but if you make one small change,

283
00:17:24.031 --> 00:17:29.010
just remove the Alpha male. Take him out of the equation. Suddenly

284
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:34.110
<v 2>the females are more relaxed and more likely to take a social gamble of reaching</v>

285
00:17:34.361 --> 00:17:37.120
out to somebody new. The key thing is the females,

286
00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:38.980
both ski thinks that it's all about timing.

287
00:17:38.981 --> 00:17:42.130
If the females can get to the new guy early enough,

288
00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:47.040
everything is different. It's remarkable. In your typical troop,

289
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.040
and it's three months on average before the

290
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.510
<v 9>first female grooms you in this trip,</v>

291
00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:58.430
<v 0>six days can out six days as a compared to three months. Yeah,</v>

292
00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:02.320
and a world in which from day one, as an adolescent male, you're treated better.

293
00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:05.290
Something about the aggressiveness melts away.

294
00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:08.913
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

295
00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:13.420
<v 9>the thing though is jab at a, before we get too carried away,</v>

296
00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:17.500
we do have to ask the question just how permanent this change is.

297
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:18.760
As Nice as it is.

298
00:18:18.761 --> 00:18:22.930
So I explained this whole story that you've just told to a professor at Harvard

299
00:18:22.931 --> 00:18:25.750
named Richard Wrangham. Yep. Versus the Wrangham is here.

300
00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:30.070
He's an evolutionary biologist. Studies chimps particularly. So I asked him,

301
00:18:30.071 --> 00:18:31.000
well, okay,

302
00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:35.400
you've heard the story about the baboons 40th think y'all know, it's,

303
00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:39.770
it's a nice example of the potential for some change. Uh,

304
00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:41.680
clearly we should put boundaries on it. You know,

305
00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:46.180
lots of baboons have been cited across Africa and this sort of example has never

306
00:18:46.181 --> 00:18:50.980
been found in a natural context, but I think I've used guys,

307
00:18:50.981 --> 00:18:54.070
wild baboons that just happened upon a, a garbage dump. Yeah.

308
00:18:54.071 --> 00:18:58.270
It's just not a very natural context to have humans provide food that leads to

309
00:18:58.450 --> 00:18:59.470
several males dying.

310
00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:03.040
But that means that I could imagine going on a helicopter all over Africa

311
00:19:03.041 --> 00:19:07.180
shooting all the Alpha males and then giving all the ladies a chance to, um,

312
00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:11.140
create a different baboon culture and meet. What I guess I'm wondering is,

313
00:19:11.141 --> 00:19:14.620
do you think in an absurd situation like that,

314
00:19:14.621 --> 00:19:17.890
that the baboons [inaudible] might change its essential nature?

315
00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:20.110
I don't think it'll change its essential nature.

316
00:19:20.111 --> 00:19:25.111
I can see that there can be a cultural influence that may last a little bit of

317
00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.193
time,

318
00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:31.440
but the larger influence clearly is the set of of genes that produce a

319
00:19:32.621 --> 00:19:37.270
particular kind of brain of a Boone is basically a baboon until you get some

320
00:19:37.271 --> 00:19:38.650
kind of genetic change.

321
00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:42.100
And that is something that supposedly has not seen though.

322
00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:46.590
So professor writing and once a genetic change to make sure that this is really

323
00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.640
real permanent and

324
00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:49.470
<v 0>yeah, but it's it. But here's the thing.</v>

325
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:51.540
I don't know if this constitutes a genetic change,

326
00:19:51.541 --> 00:19:56.160
but it has been 20 years [inaudible] yes, 20 years in suppose skis,

327
00:19:56.161 --> 00:20:00.540
original baboons troop is still operating in this peaceful mode even though

328
00:20:00.541 --> 00:20:02.700
dozens of new males have come and gone at this point.

329
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:08.510
And the idea that something that was thought to be so unchangeable could change

330
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:14.950
and change quickly and then stay changed as a result of something so airy and

331
00:20:14.991 --> 00:20:19.991
undefinable its culture will that has caused Robert Spolsky dare I say it to

332
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.970
hope absolutely in it's not something that I do by by nature.

333
00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:28.880
Not a hopeful guy by nature. No, not at all. In fact,

334
00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:30.380
the story got him so hopeful.

335
00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:34.520
He decided to send it to Foreign Affairs magazine,

336
00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:38.590
which was a magazine read by a lot of politicians. Yeah. Um,

337
00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.470
and they went forward and so we had to ask him after it was published.

338
00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:46.700
Did anyone write you back? Um,

339
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:52.700
<v 9>no. Basically not. I basically heard nothing from anyone. No.</v>

340
00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:56.760
From anyone. Yes. Big Yawning silence. I,

341
00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:02.360
I'm sure George Bush and Cheney read at each evening and the tremble at its

342
00:21:03.461 --> 00:21:06.130
implications. But no, basically as far as I can tell,

343
00:21:06.131 --> 00:21:11.050
it was a huge waste of time for me to write it. Ah, well when you read it,

344
00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:18.670
my mother didn't even, all right. So, uh,

345
00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:21.640
so six or seven years have passed as we've mentioned.

346
00:21:21.641 --> 00:21:25.450
And so we decided that it was only right for us to catch up with Robert

347
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:30.040
Sapolsky. Hello. Well hello is the person next to you taping? You know,

348
00:21:30.041 --> 00:21:33.640
we're trying to close a window here to decrease some noise.

349
00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:38.470
We found him in a very odd place,

350
00:21:38.471 --> 00:21:42.940
actually a for a baboon scientist in the library of the middle school with a

351
00:21:42.941 --> 00:21:46.060
bunch of kids outside. How did that happen?

352
00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:50.440
Like my wife now directs the musical theater productions.

353
00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:55.150
So somehow I'm playing piano as a rehearsal pianist at this school.

354
00:21:55.210 --> 00:22:00.040
What's the musical? Uh, we are doing Oliver this year really

355
00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:05.350
has nothing to do with anything. We should, okay. So anyway,

356
00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:10.360
so I told Robert that we talked to Richard Wrangham reminded him that rang him,

357
00:22:10.541 --> 00:22:14.440
says no, no baboons are hardwired to be a certain way and,

358
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:19.580
and circumstances never going to change them in the end. Yep. Well he and I, uh,

359
00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:24.160
this, this isn't the first time we've disagreed and I think we probably had a,

360
00:22:24.161 --> 00:22:27.180
we shall see sort of finish. So what,

361
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:30.730
what have we seen since you last talked to us? What's been happening?

362
00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:34.930
What's been happening? Well, he says, well, there were a few possibilities here.

363
00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:40.020
There's one scenario where it could have turned into exactly what was being

364
00:22:40.931 --> 00:22:41.800
predicted there,

365
00:22:41.801 --> 00:22:46.480
which was that the troop would go back to being a typical,

366
00:22:46.481 --> 00:22:48.580
highly aggressive baboons troops.

367
00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:52.930
The other possibility is the one that I was always like dreaming of,

368
00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:54.303
which is,

369
00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:59.580
so you're a kid who's grown up in that troupe and you've grown up on the commune

370
00:23:00.671 --> 00:23:01.031
there.

371
00:23:01.031 --> 00:23:04.810
And along comes puberty and it's time for you to pick up and you move to a

372
00:23:04.811 --> 00:23:05.644
different troop.

373
00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:10.660
And what happens when the kids who grew up in this babbling culture switch to

374
00:23:10.661 --> 00:23:14.960
other troops now supposedly admits that have just one baboon from the nice Jew

375
00:23:14.961 --> 00:23:17.680
went off to join the meanies, he'd probably get his ass kicked,

376
00:23:17.681 --> 00:23:21.580
but he thinks that if you get two nice baboons together,

377
00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:25.510
they make a little bit of a team and it would be kind of like a critical mass of

378
00:23:25.511 --> 00:23:30.511
niceness that just might spread and turn all the other guys Nice in principle.

379
00:23:30.611 --> 00:23:35.611
This like great unique Pacific culture in these baboons could be transmissible.

380
00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.700
Oh, in theory. Okay,

381
00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:43.780
well don't leave us hanging like I what has happened? Okay,

382
00:23:43.781 --> 00:23:47.480
so what actually happened is pretty damn grim.

383
00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:50.590
<v 10>Do they, did they go back to being mean?</v>

384
00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:53.660
In some sense it's really worse than that. You remember, um,

385
00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:57.550
how this whole thing begins because there's a troop next to [inaudible] and

386
00:23:57.551 --> 00:24:00.060
they'd been eating garbage in a garbage dump, right?

387
00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:04.840
Well eventually supposed skis troop because now the garbage dump is open and

388
00:24:04.841 --> 00:24:05.674
available.

389
00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:10.390
They went over there and began living with the tourist lodge and just living off

390
00:24:10.391 --> 00:24:14.740
of garbage. Now they just sort of squat with the garbage and essentially,

391
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:17.590
uh, stopped functioning as a coherent troupe.

392
00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:21.610
So this question of will they all become nice baboons eventually,

393
00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:24.030
<v 9>or will they all revert back to being mean baboons?</v>

394
00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:28.290
That got totally trumped by the garbage situation.

395
00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:33.240
There was so much food to eat for these baboons and it came so free and so

396
00:24:33.241 --> 00:24:37.210
available that the natural business of baboons tree just broke down.

397
00:24:37.211 --> 00:24:41.910
A lot of the males wound up being killed by game park rangers there because as

398
00:24:41.911 --> 00:24:43.320
per usual with the sort of thing,

399
00:24:43.321 --> 00:24:47.460
they got dangerous to the humans there because they got too habituated to

400
00:24:47.461 --> 00:24:50.640
humans. So lots of males were killed.

401
00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.210
The rest of the troop is just sort of fragmented.

402
00:24:54.211 --> 00:24:59.211
So I never got to find out what would happen in the long run because the garbage

403
00:24:59.461 --> 00:25:02.490
got in the way again. Yep, exactly. That.

404
00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:03.930
Certainly earlier I've seen your editor. Well.

405
00:25:03.931 --> 00:25:06.480
So the troubling thing here for me is that, you know,

406
00:25:06.481 --> 00:25:10.260
there was a traditional Bevin and culture, which was violent and hierarchical.

407
00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:14.580
There was this hint of a hope of a different baboo and culture,

408
00:25:14.581 --> 00:25:16.620
which was grooming and happiness.

409
00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:21.780
And we had question about which one of those two would spread or, or last.

410
00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:25.710
But the truth is they ran into some junk food and then they have no culture.

411
00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:29.070
Exactly. Which, I hate to say it. That sounds depressingly like America.

412
00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:35.430
Yeah. Um, and there's bunches of them still there. I'm sure as we speak,

413
00:25:35.431 --> 00:25:36.600
actually not as we speak,

414
00:25:36.601 --> 00:25:41.601
but 10 hours from now they'll be waddling over to get some leftovers.

415
00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:46.800
They're probably not missing the culture that they had. But yeah,

416
00:25:46.801 --> 00:25:48.270
those were my guys.

417
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:53.520
I had my last season out there four years ago and haven't been back since.

418
00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:56.970
No, it sounds like you, you need some, a little, you know,

419
00:25:56.971 --> 00:26:00.000
a little pick her up to quote, uh,

420
00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:04.020
the art that went wrong that we would do anything for you. Anything.

421
00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:08.710
We were climbing a hill. We're adapted.

422
00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:15.810
So just so you know, if you all are, we'll

423
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.260
okay. Oh God,

424
00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:25.530
I had just managed to get that stupid song out of my head rehearsal earlier

425
00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:26.010
today. Thanks a lot.
