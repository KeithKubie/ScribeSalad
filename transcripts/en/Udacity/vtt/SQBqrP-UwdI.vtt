00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.680
A closely related challenge is
accurate patient identification

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.650
across providers and health systems.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.420
Countries like France solved
this problem by issuing

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.940
a Special Health Smart card.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.370
Here in the US
a National Identity Number or card for

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:22.500
Healthcare is a controversial issue that
is unlikely to be solved anytime soon.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.220
So, absent one knowing if
John Smith at Hospital A,

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.080
is the same patient as John A.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.945
Smith at Hospital B can be hard.

00:00:32.945 --> 00:00:37.040
Cross-enterprise health
information exchange

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.480
depends on master patient
indices that use sophisticated

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.450
algorithms designed to solve this
problem as accurately as possible.
