00:00:11.552 --> 00:00:12.489
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:14.197
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: Go,
little balloon, go.

00:00:14.197 --> 00:00:15.881
You can do it.

00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:16.940
Hey, it's a great launch.

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:23.845
VIMAL BHALODIA: How far
away are we from the--

00:00:23.845 --> 00:00:25.300
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: 52 miles.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.960
VIMAL BHALODIA: Oh, wow.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.750
It's still going strong.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.640
It's still pinging
regularly with locations,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.424
and that's fine.

00:00:33.424 --> 00:00:35.090
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: My
good friend, Vimal,

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.830
is great at coming
up with crazy ideas,

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.930
and I love helping
him implement them.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.970
And he told me about
his crazy, awesome idea

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.000
to send cameras up on weather
balloons, and I was all in.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.540
I'm Heather Brundage.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.350
I'm an engineer and explorer.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.111
And I like to go on
crazy adventures.

00:01:03.111 --> 00:01:04.569
VIMAL BHALODIA:
I'm Vimal Bhalodia.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.040
I'm a serial entrepreneur,
software engineer,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.790
and maker of random things.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.990
ALL: We're the Casa
de Balloon Club,

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.870
and this is made with Android.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.620
VIMAL BHALODIA: Launching
weather balloons

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.194
is kind of an interesting
engineering challenge.

00:01:18.194 --> 00:01:20.360
Plus the fact that you can
get pictures of the earth

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.650
from 80,000 feet,
where you actually

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.879
see the complete
blackness of the sky

00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:26.170
and the curvature of the earth.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.462
And it's absolutely incredible.

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:28.836
HEATHER BRUNDAGE:
We used Android

00:01:28.836 --> 00:01:30.503
because it was a very
affordable device.

00:01:30.503 --> 00:01:32.169
Another reason why
we used Android is it

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:33.336
had fantastic documentation.

00:01:33.336 --> 00:01:35.669
VIMAL BHALODIA: One of the
greatest things about Android

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:37.380
was that it was very
easy to pick up.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.500
Literally just
downloaded the SDK,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.420
read through the first tutorial
on how to build an app,

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.930
and then built the
first prototype of this

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.291
all in an afternoon.

00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:47.790
Instead of using
this battery, we're

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.860
going to be wiring in
one of these holders.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.270
Up above 30,000 to 40,000 feet,
the normal lithium batteries

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.620
that are sitting in
your phones will not

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.620
work all the way up there,
because they'll just freeze.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.690
We actually have to
hook our phones up

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.280
to external battery
packs that are

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.380
using disposable lithium
primary batteries.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.160
I actually do all this
in my living room.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.639
I just have a little
bench, and you don't really

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:11.950
need that much to do
a project like this.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.800
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: Our
most basic payload

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.400
is just an Android phone.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.900
And with that phone, we're able
to get GPS location, as well

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.090
as altitude.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.280
Android allowed
us to take control

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.360
of the phone in a low-level
way that we needed.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.790
We're using these
phones in a way

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.660
that they're not designed
for, and other phones

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.900
don't let you do that.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.400
VIMAL BHALODIA: So the app that
we developed for our balloon

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.380
launches is pretty
much the polar opposite

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.760
of a normal
well-behaved mobile app.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.770
A normal well-behaved
mobile app tries

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.960
to be very careful
about power consumption.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.360
It tries to play well with
all the other apps that

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.860
are running.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.870
It doesn't want
to hog resources.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.640
We want it to be
running all the time.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.150
We never want it to sleep.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.650
We want it to always be the most
important app that is running.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.080
And make sure that, if
for whatever reason,

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.130
the phone reboots
because of a low power

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.339
situation or something, our
app comes up and running.

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:00.755
HEATHER BRUNDAGE:
That's something

00:03:00.755 --> 00:03:03.580
that a lot of other phones don't
allow you to have access to,

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.050
but Android allowed us
to have that control.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.091
VIMAL BHALODIA: And there's
our phone booting up.

00:03:08.091 --> 00:03:09.160
Good times.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.510
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: Checked the
weather for this Saturday,

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.061
and actually it looks fantastic.

00:03:12.061 --> 00:03:14.560
Ahead of time, I end up doing
a lot of work on the computer.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.290
And I'm looking at
wind simulations

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.180
to figure out a good
launch location,

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.570
as well as expected drop zones.

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.380
Checking that against
no-fly zones and airports

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.450
in big cities to make sure
that we don't have any issues.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.710
And, oh, it'll
pop over Los Banos

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.840
and land a little
bit over [? Fibra. ?]

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.530
VIMAL BHALODIA:
That's not a bad area.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.080
Nice.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.460
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: Sweet.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.335
So it looks like Saturday's
going to be good.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.340
We do run extra predictions
right at the time of launch,

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.759
since wind predictions are only
so good, and they can change.

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:49.050
VIMAL BHALODIA: I'm going to
be preparing the payloads,

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.250
putting in the batteries,
turning on the phones.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.490
Just doing a final
check to make sure

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:53.656
all the software is running.

00:03:53.656 --> 00:03:55.260
It looks like it's working.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.057
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: We've also
added in an Android camera.

00:03:58.057 --> 00:03:58.890
So it's not a phone.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:59.990
It's specifically a camera.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.781
So it's much better
than the camera in just

00:04:01.781 --> 00:04:02.781
a regular Android phone.

00:04:02.781 --> 00:04:04.906
VIMAL BHALODIA: There are
a lot of different things

00:04:04.906 --> 00:04:06.600
to worry about in
these payloads.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.440
We have a bunch of
trade-offs with respect

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.959
to weight, power
consumption, the electronics

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.000
and their sophistication.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.453
HEATHER BRUNDAGE:
So you guys ready?

00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:14.022
ALL: Yeah.

00:04:14.022 --> 00:04:15.730
VIMAL BHALODIA: At
the day of the launch,

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.779
we have a minimum
of three people.

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:20.160
We have the helium person,
the balloon person,

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.529
and the lift person.

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:24.220
And then, ideally, we also have
a fourth person with us, who's

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.740
reading off the directions.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.156
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Slide balloon neck

00:04:27.156 --> 00:04:29.830
approximately three inches over
the PVC balloon fill nozzle.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.175
VIMAL BHALODIA: This is
by far the hardest part.

00:04:35.175 --> 00:04:36.800
FEMALE SPEAKER: All
right, helium fill.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.330
VIMAL BHALODIA: Ready

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.121
FEMALE SPEAKER: Go.

00:04:52.854 --> 00:04:54.270
VIMAL BHALODIA:
Ooh, he's perfect.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.180
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: Great.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.600
VIMAL BHALODIA: All right.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.410
Then we tie the
payloads to them,

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.400
let them go, cross our fingers.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.440
ALL: Three, two, one.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.910
Woo.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:04.897
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:04.897 --> 00:05:06.605
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: Go,
little balloon, go.

00:05:06.605 --> 00:05:08.810
You can do it.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.570
Wow, that's really
awesome to see.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.645
Oh man, look at that
it just [WHISTLE].

00:05:14.645 --> 00:05:15.145
Yes!

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.782
Once the balloon is in the air,
we're actively tracking it.

00:05:22.782 --> 00:05:23.990
We have two devices in there.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.830
They're both sending
us GPS location.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:26.590
So they're close.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.131
They're a little
off from each other,

00:05:28.131 --> 00:05:30.350
but you can see she's
drifting southeast, ever

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.390
so slightly, which is
exactly what we expected.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.710
We do lose contact
with the balloon

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.780
at about 20,000 feet, when
it leaves cell reception.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.290
The cell phone is still
getting GPS data up

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.980
to about 60,000 feet, when
it then loses GPS data.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.480
When the balloon
rises, it expands.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.270
And when it gets high
enough, it bursts.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.080
And that's when the
parachute deploys,

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.220
and it starts to
descend back to earth.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.720
At this point, it's falling at
about five meters per second,

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.890
with a parachute.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.360
And it's spinning around.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.960
So it takes it a while to get a
cell reception and a GPS lock,

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.920
once it gets below there.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.020
It could land on a
freeway, which we hope not.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.870
It could land in a farm field,
or it could land in the water.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:13.744
We don't know.

00:06:13.744 --> 00:06:15.410
VIMAL BHALODIA: The
worst possible thing

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.820
that could go wrong is
that the payload actually

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.750
lands on a road or
inside a crowded area.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.530
And we take a lot of precautions
in choosing both our launch

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.270
site as well as our
expected landing site

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.146
to make sure that that's
not going to happen.

00:06:28.146 --> 00:06:30.645
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: We could just
lose the balloon completely.

00:06:30.645 --> 00:06:31.780
Have no contact with it.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.210
The batteries could die.

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.370
The phone could stop working.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.370
The program could
crash and not reboot.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.146
And if we don't hear from it,
we're not going to get it back.

00:06:40.146 --> 00:06:41.770
VIMAL BHALODIA: About
half the launches

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.660
that people have done
and blogged about,

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.150
they never saw again.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:48.873
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: Hey,
to a great launch.

00:06:48.873 --> 00:06:50.309
ALL: Cheers!

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:51.850
HEATHER BRUNDAGE:
To a full recovery.

00:06:54.929 --> 00:06:55.970
VIMAL BHALODIA: Oh, whoa.

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.420
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: She
went pretty far south.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.490
VIMAL BHALODIA: So
it's in a field.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:59.820
We don't have to worry.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:00.930
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: Yeah,
right in a farm field.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:01.270
VIMAL BHALODIA: Perfect.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.853
HEATHER BRUNDAGE:
Let's go pick it up.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.110
This is a perfect day
for Central Valley wind.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:14.121
It was exactly as we usually
expect, a nice southeast wind.

00:07:14.121 --> 00:07:15.495
VIMAL BHALODIA:
Yes, I'm about as

00:07:15.495 --> 00:07:17.544
zoomed in as I can possibly be.

00:07:17.544 --> 00:07:19.960
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: And here,
wait, let me show you the map.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:20.890
VIMAL BHALODIA: So one
of the great things

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.960
about using an Android phone is,
actually, in addition to using

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.030
GPS, also using network
triangulation, so we

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.100
have a much more
accurate location

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.670
spot, down to a couple of feet.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:30.060
HEATHER BRUNDAGE:
I'm just hoping

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.340
there aren't, like, snakes.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:32.960
VIMAL BHALODIA: Or sprinklers.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.543
HEATHER BRUNDAGE:
Yeah, or sprinklers.

00:07:34.543 --> 00:07:37.620
Typically, we can see the
red parachute sticking up.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.090
This time, we couldn't, so
we had this big, green field

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:42.500
and no red dot.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.910
So we had to start
tromping through the field,

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:47.435
but, finally, we got right on
top of it and there it was.

00:07:47.435 --> 00:07:48.560
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: Found it!

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.060
ALL: Woo!

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.205
VIMAL BHALODIA: Woo.

00:07:51.205 --> 00:07:51.955
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:07:51.955 --> 00:07:53.410
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: Awesome.

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:55.430
The Android device knew
where it was well-enough

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:58.090
and was able to communicate
its location to us well-enough

00:07:58.090 --> 00:07:59.290
that it led us right to it.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:00.748
It was a homing
beacon effectively,

00:08:00.748 --> 00:08:02.000
just purely through GPS data.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.251
And, even if all we knew
was, hey, it's in this field,

00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:05.541
it would have taken us forever.

00:08:05.541 --> 00:08:07.474
A combine would have
found it before we did.

00:08:07.474 --> 00:08:09.640
We would have had to fly
over the field to see that.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.710
VIMAL BHALODIA: There we go.

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:14.940
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: Oh,wow.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:15.565
Oh my goodness.

00:08:15.565 --> 00:08:17.880
VIMAL BHALODIA: Yeah,
everything is still pretty safe

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.157
and solid and secure.

00:08:19.157 --> 00:08:20.240
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: Oh, man.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:20.782
Look at this.

00:08:20.782 --> 00:08:22.739
MALE SPEAKER: It just
tied itself into a little

00:08:22.739 --> 00:08:24.040
[INAUDIBLE].

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.220
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: Wow.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.610
VIMAL BHALODIA: So here is
our happy, reliable phone.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.470
It's been ticking along.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:33.583
It is still on.

00:08:33.583 --> 00:08:35.010
It has a great connection too.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.860
HEATHER BRUNDAGE:
Awesome, let's.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.390
VIMAL BHALODIA: Everything
looks to be intact.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:42.021
When we recover the payloads,
we bring computers with us,

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:43.520
and we like to look
at the pictures.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.210
HEATHER BRUNDAGE:
Which is really

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:45.870
satisfying at the
end of a long day,

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:47.911
to see these pictures that
you've just retrieved.

00:08:50.826 --> 00:08:52.950
If other people are interested
in doing ballooning,

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:55.495
our code is open source
and available online.

00:08:58.074 --> 00:09:00.490
VIMAL BHALODIA: Everyone who
does this has their own site,

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:02.780
and has their own blog,
and tells their own story

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:05.363
about their launches, and their
payload, and their experience.

00:09:05.363 --> 00:09:08.200
And we've read a ton of them
and learned a lot from that.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.040
And we also want to share our
story at casadeballoon.club.

00:09:14.919 --> 00:09:17.460
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: (HELIUM VOICE)
We are Casa de Balloon Club.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.043
VIMAL BHALODIA: (HELIUM VOICE)
And this was made with Android.

00:09:20.043 --> 00:09:22.461
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:22.461 --> 00:09:24.210
The problem with regular
lithium batteries

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:26.980
is when it gets really, really
cold, they stop working,

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.627
so that's why we had to switch
lithium primary batteries.

00:09:29.627 --> 00:09:30.850
HEATHER BRUNDAGE: All right.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:32.100
Take it away from me.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:32.940
Oh my god.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.490
VIMAL BHALODIA: We're done.
