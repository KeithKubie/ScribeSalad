00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.350
In the last video, we talked
about freelancing work,

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.620
including new
technology-mediated work

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.161
arrangements.

00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:16.280
In this video, we're going
to take a look at Uber

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.340
as a case study.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.890
Many of you have probably
heard of Uber by now.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:28.310
Their main business
model is to connect

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.280
people who need a
ride with drivers

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.000
who are willing to
drive them, using

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.130
their own personal vehicle.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.040
And if this sounds suspiciously
like a cab company,

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.720
you're right.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.020
Uber competes directly with
traditional cab companies.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.360
In contrast, however, Uber
drivers use their own vehicle.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.750
And this means they're
responsible for the costs

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.570
associated with maintenance
and repair, the wear and tear

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.150
on their own
vehicle, and largely

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.820
fueling their own vehicle.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.050
The main service
provided by Uber

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.940
is this technology, which
connects people and facilitates

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.960
automatic payments.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.510
Early on, Uber and
companies like it,

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.800
were seen as ushering in
a new and very exciting

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.410
model of work.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.820
There was high flexibility
in terms of when you worked,

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.300
and where you worked.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.340
Uber even claimed early on that
the median salary for a driver,

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.130
working at least 40 hours
a week in New York City,

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.500
was $90,000 a year.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.540
Since then, people have begun
to challenge these figures.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:56.871
And darker aspects of work at
Uber have begun to surface.

00:01:56.871 --> 00:01:58.870
Uber started out with
higher fares, for example.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.016
But has cut them on
multiple occasions,

00:02:01.016 --> 00:02:02.390
in order to try
to better compete

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.681
with traditional cab companies.

00:02:03.681 --> 00:02:06.710
In fact, there are reports
that UberX drivers, UberX

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.750
being the most commonly
used, lowest-cost service,

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.630
make only a little bit more
than traditional cab drivers.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.100
And again, these drivers are
responsible for the costs

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:23.480
associated with using
their own vehicle

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.810
over extended periods of time.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.860
And there's some evidence
that Uber drivers

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.740
are becoming
increasingly disgruntled,

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.420
because of this price
cutting, because

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.660
of verbal abuse by passengers,
and a perception of apathy

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.220
on the part of Uber to
do anything about it.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.050
They're frustrated, as well,
because of the ranking system,

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.640
which will essentially
make them lose

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.430
their job if their
passenger rating falls

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.370
below a certain level.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.540
And some workers in some
areas like California,

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.100
have begun to try to organize
and collectively bargain.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.880
So, for example, in
California drivers

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.179
formed CADA, the California
App-based Drivers Association.

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:07.720
But these drivers face a tough
and very difficult road ahead.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.414
The US law does not
require Uber to negotiate,

00:03:11.414 --> 00:03:13.330
because these drivers
are currently considered

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.740
independent contractors.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.810
In other words,
they're not employees

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.498
from Uber's point of view.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.346
They're not their problem.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.440
So as it stands,
this association,

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.120
the California App-based
Drivers Association,

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.680
is trying to bring publicity
to some of these issues.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.220
But it doesn't have very
much leverage beyond that.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:04:20.940
So the question that
I would pose to you

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.350
as a class is, what
do you recommend

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.620
that Uber drivers do to improve
their employment circumstances?

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:37.350
I encourage you to
join in discussion

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.940
with your fellow classmates
in the next segment

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.860
of this course.
