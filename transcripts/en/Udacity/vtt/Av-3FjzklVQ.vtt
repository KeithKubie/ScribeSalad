[D. Evans] All of these are actually true.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It is a language that we want to be able to execute using computers.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We want to be able to create programs that we can actually run.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.070
It's also a language that we use to describe programs.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.078
That's the main thing we want to express with a programming language.

00:00:13.078 --> 00:00:18.056
It's designed to be easy for humans to write and for computers to execute.

00:00:18.056 --> 00:00:21.056
It's also designed to be read by humans.

00:00:21.056 --> 00:00:24.000
The written by computers is a little tricky.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.058
We haven't talked about that yet, but many programs are written by other programs.

00:00:27.058 --> 00:00:29.049
And we've seen our first example of that

00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:33.000
that the Python interpreter takes its input of a program and runs that program.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And finally, it's a language that's designed to be read and written by humans

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.078
and executed by computers.

00:00:39.078 --> 00:00:43.000
This is really the best answer - that we want the programs that we write

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
to be things that we can use to show to other humans

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
to understand a process, to be able to understand what's going on.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We also want to be able to execute those programs by computers.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So this is one of the challenges in designing a good programming language,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
that in order to be easy for humans to read and write it,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
that makes it harder for computers to execute it.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.070
And one of the nice things about Python is it works well for both of these properties.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.000
It is designed to be easy for humans to read and write.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And with the Python interpreter it executes well on computers.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
It doesn't execute as quickly as some other languages

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
that are less focused on being easy for humans to read and write,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.063
but certainly for a first language to learn about programming, it's an excellent choice.

00:01:21.063 --> 00:01:24.000
And focusing on being easy for humans to read and write

00:01:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
is a lot more important than making it easy for computers to execute.
