00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.750
What advice do you have for

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.660
beginners who may not have a lot of programming experience?

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.590
&gt;&gt; well, on one hand it is an awesome time to be doing that because

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.950
the field's kind of exploding right now.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.930
There's sort of a whole data movement, big data, like everybody's talking about

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.790
data and at the same time, you know, there are just as many people trying to

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.456
make sense of all that data and usually are [INAUDIBLE] so.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.910
In terms of advice it's,

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.750
it's really hard to give general advice because you know the good news and

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.110
the bad news is there's so many different ways into this field.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.970
If somebody's like a student wanting to go to school looking at programs you

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.990
know there are programs like this Udasity program there aren't a ton of sort of

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.120
you know majors, or even Graduate programs yet in information visualization.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.100
So there's no, kind of obvious one place to get all the skills that you need.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.810
And, and what I think is exciting about the field,

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.160
is that people come into it from so many different areas.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.270
Like I know, you know, architects, industrial designers, graphic designers,

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.030
statisticians, mathematicians.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.780
Like, everybody has some sort of core prior background, and

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.310
they bring that with them to the field.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.060
So, you know, one thing I encourage people to do is,

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.110
take advantage of whatever your personal background is.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.250
And, like, bring that to the field, and see what you can do with it.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.750
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.190
&gt;&gt; now, on like, a more practical level, usually, people want to know, well,

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.720
what book should I read or what program should I learn or how do I, you know.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.560
And again I think that depends like,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.450
I work with students who are coming from a design background, and so for them

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.770
it doesn't make sense to dive into like, the most technical code heavy projects.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.610
It makes sense to build on what they already know, so for somebody with a design

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.530
background I would say you know, start with, with illustrator.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.440
Start doing things manually and

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.760
like, figuring out ways to connect the things you know how to do to data.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:00.150
Somebody who's coming from computer science, mathematics, something like that.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.160
Obviously if you leverage you know,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.160
your skills being able to use some of these more advanced tools.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.730
But you might have to learn like the design language and the visual principles

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.650
and looking at human perception and psychology and like how do

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.530
we interpret colors, and scales, and size, and proportion and all this stuff.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.670
So, unfortunately, the answer is a whole sort of, it depends and

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.120
it's going to be a little bit different for everyone and I think that's okay.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.800
It's actually what's kind of exciting about the field is everybody has their

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.450
own perspective.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.950
&gt;&gt; Great.
