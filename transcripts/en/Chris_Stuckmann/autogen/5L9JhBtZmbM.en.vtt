where you're trying to jump off of
 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.700
where you're trying to jump off of
something where your character just

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710
something where your character just
 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.100
something where your character just
attaches himself to a random pole or

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110

honestly kind of broken and the worst
part was some of those glitches weren't

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790
