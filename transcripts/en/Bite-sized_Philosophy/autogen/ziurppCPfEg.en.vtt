in this world right because if you look

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050
in this world right because if you look
 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.420
in this world right because if you look
around the world at the state of

illuminated light against that
 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.250
illuminated light against that
background is it so difficult but

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260
background is it so difficult but
 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.290
background is it so difficult but
nonetheless you know we're as good as

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300
nonetheless you know we're as good as
 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.719
nonetheless you know we're as good as
it's got and unless we can come up with

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729
it's got and unless we can come up with
 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.100
it's got and unless we can come up with
something better we should be very

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110
something better we should be very
 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.780
something better we should be very

careful about messing around with that
 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.219
careful about messing around with that
so why don't we start with the

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229
so why don't we start with the
 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.450
so why don't we start with the
assumption that we're doing something

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460
assumption that we're doing something
 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.010
assumption that we're doing something
right one of the things we're doing

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020
right one of the things we're doing
 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.170
right one of the things we're doing
right for example is that we actually

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180
right for example is that we actually
 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.330
right for example is that we actually
value the individual right the

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340
value the individual right the
 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.850
value the individual right the
individual has intrinsic value in

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860
