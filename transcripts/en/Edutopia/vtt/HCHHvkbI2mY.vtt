00:00:09.826 --> 00:00:12.026
&gt;&gt;Paul: Hey, good morning,
Matthew, can you hear me fine?

00:00:12.026 --> 00:00:12.196
&gt;&gt;Matthew: Yes.

00:00:12.816 --> 00:00:15.106
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It's 7:30 on
the north side of Chicago.

00:00:15.106 --> 00:00:16.376
&gt;&gt;Paul: Okay, we're mostly here.

00:00:16.376 --> 00:00:17.586
We're missing a couple of people.

00:00:17.726 --> 00:00:20.806
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And for Walter Payton
High School's championship math team,

00:00:20.806 --> 00:00:22.016
it's time for donuts--

00:00:22.016 --> 00:00:22.946
&gt;&gt;Student: I prefer it with jelly.

00:00:23.336 --> 00:00:24.326
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And distance learning.

00:00:24.616 --> 00:00:26.066
&gt;&gt;Matthew: You can start
with an integer like two--

00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:28.376
&gt;&gt;Narrator: A Q and A with a
mathematician in Switzerland.

00:00:28.376 --> 00:00:29.716
&gt;&gt;Matthew: There's an
infinite number of integers,

00:00:30.106 --> 00:00:33.136
so there are an infinite possible
number of states, and this turns

00:00:33.136 --> 00:00:35.806
out to be how you can store an
arbitrary amount of information.

00:00:36.046 --> 00:00:39.116
&gt;&gt;Paul: Matt Cook really is one of
the world experts in this field.

00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.196
And so this is an opportunity
for them to interact

00:00:41.196 --> 00:00:43.746
with somebody who's actually
doing research in the area

00:00:43.746 --> 00:00:45.756
that we're talking about,
and that's really neat.

00:00:45.756 --> 00:00:48.876
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At this science
math and world language magnet,

00:00:49.146 --> 00:00:51.686
every subject seems to
have a global dimension.

00:00:51.686 --> 00:00:55.016
&gt;&gt;Paul: Conceivably, if every city is
connected to every other city, like,

00:00:55.016 --> 00:00:57.996
one obvious algorithm
here is void segment C, D.

00:00:59.246 --> 00:01:01.906
&gt;&gt;In a single day, we could talk
about math problems from China,

00:01:02.346 --> 00:01:04.746
which is how I introduced one
of my units in trigonometry.

00:01:05.016 --> 00:01:09.876
Geometry problems from Japan,
computation problems from France,

00:01:09.876 --> 00:01:11.776
I mean, the possibilities
are really endless.

00:01:12.496 --> 00:01:14.606
&gt;&gt;Ellen: Payton began
with a vision that,

00:01:14.606 --> 00:01:20.666
by putting together a great faculty
of teachers who had the desire

00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:25.586
to nurture global leaders, we would
be able to create a curriculum

00:01:25.636 --> 00:01:32.046
and programs to set us apart from
any other high school in the nation.

00:01:32.046 --> 00:01:32.566
&gt;&gt;Student: [Speaking Chinese].

00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:36.866
Narrator: One distinguishing factor
is Payton's requirement of four years

00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:38.236
of foreign language study.

00:01:38.856 --> 00:01:44.556
Offerings include Spanish,
French, Mandarin and Japanese.

00:01:44.556 --> 00:01:45.806
&gt;&gt;Carol Ruth: [Speaking Japanese].

00:01:45.806 --> 00:01:49.346
&gt;&gt;Language acquisition
is a profound thing,

00:01:49.416 --> 00:01:52.396
because when you learn
another language,

00:01:52.396 --> 00:01:54.506
you learn the way other people think.

00:01:54.836 --> 00:01:58.496
You are really learning to keep
several points of view in mind.

00:01:58.496 --> 00:02:02.386
It's important to have more than
one perspective, now more than ever.

00:02:02.386 --> 00:02:05.466
&gt;&gt;Jeremy: My friends and my family,
they're very much happy to see me try

00:02:05.666 --> 00:02:07.686
to learn these languages,
because they are quite difficult.

00:02:07.876 --> 00:02:11.476
At the same time, they're quite
fun, and I'm learning so much

00:02:11.476 --> 00:02:13.956
about foreign countries
and about foreign affairs,

00:02:13.956 --> 00:02:16.196
just based on taking Japanese
for a couple of years.

00:02:16.606 --> 00:02:19.746
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The school plays host
to a steady stream of visitors.

00:02:19.746 --> 00:02:22.926
&gt;&gt;Ellen: Good morning, and welcome
to Walter Payton College Prep.

00:02:22.926 --> 00:02:26.136
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Like this
delegation of 25 Chinese Mayors.

00:02:26.286 --> 00:02:29.136
&gt;&gt;Ellen: You are in a wonderful,
wonderful city right now,

00:02:29.136 --> 00:02:31.966
the City of Chicago,
the city of immigrants.

00:02:31.966 --> 00:02:32.276
[Speaking Chinese].

00:02:32.276 --> 00:02:38.736
&gt;&gt;Narrator: This group gathered
at The Confucius Institute,

00:02:38.966 --> 00:02:41.726
a resource center at Payton,
funded through a partnership

00:02:41.726 --> 00:02:44.156
between the Chinese government
and the city of Chicago.

00:02:44.156 --> 00:02:46.776
&gt;&gt;Ellen: We're very proud to
host the Confucius Institute

00:02:46.776 --> 00:02:49.486
and to give a global
perspective to our school.

00:02:49.486 --> 00:02:50.326
[Speaking Chinese].

00:02:50.326 --> 00:02:56.036
&gt;&gt;Robert: We really want to make
sure Chicago is at the forefront

00:02:56.036 --> 00:02:56.986
of Chinese people's minds,

00:02:56.986 --> 00:02:58.376
when they're thinking
about the United States.

00:02:58.496 --> 00:03:00.786
So we teach our children,
not only the language,

00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:02.966
but we teach them the Chinese
culture, and that's going

00:03:02.966 --> 00:03:06.096
to create a strong foundation for the
city, so that more and more business

00:03:06.096 --> 00:03:10.626
and cultural exchanges
can go on in the future.

00:03:10.626 --> 00:03:10.946
&gt;&gt;Student: [Speaking Chinese].

00:03:10.946 --> 00:03:15.546
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Chicago has the
largest Chinese language program

00:03:15.546 --> 00:03:17.856
in the United States, with more

00:03:18.226 --> 00:03:22.676
than 6,000 students studying
Chinese in 28 schools.

00:03:22.676 --> 00:03:22.786
&gt;&gt;Wenya: [Speaking Chinese].

00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:29.256
&gt;&gt;I have to make it fun and easy,
and then also at the same time,

00:03:29.256 --> 00:03:32.226
they have to feel like they
are-- they're learning a lot.

00:03:32.226 --> 00:03:32.293
&gt;&gt;[Speaking Chinese].

00:03:32.293 --> 00:03:38.896
&gt;&gt;And then make them laugh, and I
try to make them laugh every day,

00:03:38.956 --> 00:03:42.766
so that they think, oh,
it's not boring, and then,

00:03:42.766 --> 00:03:45.336
when they like it, they'll do well.

00:03:45.336 --> 00:03:45.526
&gt;&gt;Student: [Speaking Chinese].

00:03:45.526 --> 00:03:50.646
&gt;&gt;Robert: We have many, many
students who are recent immigrants

00:03:50.646 --> 00:03:52.856
from Mexico, and they all
speak Spanish at home,

00:03:52.996 --> 00:03:55.226
and they are learning Chinese
and English at the same time,

00:03:55.426 --> 00:03:58.616
so essentially, these kids will
go through 13 years of education,

00:03:58.616 --> 00:04:00.886
where they're learning
English, Spanish and Chinese,

00:04:00.886 --> 00:04:02.236
and they will come out pretty much

00:04:02.236 --> 00:04:07.056
as the most marketable
students in the United States.

00:04:07.056 --> 00:04:07.326
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Good.

00:04:07.846 --> 00:04:09.576
Are we ready?

00:04:09.576 --> 00:04:09.816
And..

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:09.883
&gt;&gt;Student: [Speaking French].

00:04:09.883 --> 00:04:11.976
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Technology
plays a key role here,

00:04:12.196 --> 00:04:15.036
from tools to create
rap videos in French..

00:04:15.036 --> 00:04:16.656
&gt;&gt;Doctor: So it doesn't
cut through the aorta.

00:04:16.846 --> 00:04:18.946
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To this health
class where students interact

00:04:18.946 --> 00:04:22.516
with doctors performing open heart
surgery at a Southside hospital.

00:04:22.516 --> 00:04:25.616
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What about Walter Payton,
do you guys have any questions?

00:04:25.676 --> 00:04:27.456
&gt;&gt;Student: Doctor,
I was just curious.

00:04:27.556 --> 00:04:28.986
How would this surgery differ

00:04:29.086 --> 00:04:31.006
if somebody had already
had a bypass surgery?

00:04:31.046 --> 00:04:32.486
&gt;&gt;Doctor: That's a good question.

00:04:32.486 --> 00:04:35.356
Fundamentally it's the same
operation, you know, that--

00:04:35.386 --> 00:04:38.746
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The same technology has
facilitated face-to-face encounters

00:04:38.746 --> 00:04:40.906
with students in several
sister schools.

00:04:41.456 --> 00:04:44.646
&gt;&gt;Student: I'd love to give you
some information about my school--

00:04:44.876 --> 00:04:47.726
&gt;&gt;Ellen: We connect with an
all Islamic Intercity school

00:04:47.726 --> 00:04:52.776
in Casa Blanca, Morocco, a school in
Osaka, Japan, we have sister schools

00:04:52.776 --> 00:04:55.656
in Concepcion, Chile, and in China.

00:04:55.996 --> 00:04:58.136
And a school in Durban, South Africa.

00:04:58.136 --> 00:04:59.486
&gt;&gt;Student: I want you
to play me something.

00:04:59.486 --> 00:05:00.166
[playing guitar].

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:06.116
&gt;&gt;Luis: It's amazing, I mean, to see
our students' reaction when they get

00:05:06.116 --> 00:05:13.056
so see someone from South
Africa, from Morocco,

00:05:13.106 --> 00:05:16.476
and even though they are so far,
and they speak another language,

00:05:16.836 --> 00:05:19.566
they still do the same thing,
they still like going to movies,

00:05:19.636 --> 00:05:24.076
they still like dancing, they
still sing and they're teenagers.

00:05:24.076 --> 00:05:24.916
[Applause].

00:05:24.916 --> 00:05:29.106
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Most students prefer
real world exchanges to virtual ones,

00:05:29.466 --> 00:05:31.346
and by raising their own funds,

00:05:31.626 --> 00:05:34.356
all students have the
opportunity to travel abroad.

00:05:34.616 --> 00:05:38.886
&gt;&gt;Grace: When we were in France, all
the things said, Coiffeur, on it.

00:05:38.886 --> 00:05:39.446
I think that's--

00:05:39.496 --> 00:05:43.566
&gt;&gt;Narrator: French student, Grace
Stome, visited Strasbourg, France,

00:05:43.906 --> 00:05:45.326
and spent a week in Morocco.

00:05:45.646 --> 00:05:48.796
&gt;&gt;Grace: The second the plane touched
the ground, we knew this was going

00:05:48.796 --> 00:05:53.256
to be way more than we could
ever expect, a great experience.

00:05:53.616 --> 00:05:56.756
Everyone there was so
hospitable and welcoming.

00:05:56.866 --> 00:06:00.316
We met all these dignitaries but
that was-- while that was nice,

00:06:00.316 --> 00:06:04.176
it was even better to get to spend
time with the kids and talk to them,

00:06:04.176 --> 00:06:07.806
and go to their classes, and go
home with them on home stays.

00:06:07.896 --> 00:06:10.286
We wanted to speak French
with them, but they said, no,

00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:11.336
no, let us speak English.

00:06:11.336 --> 00:06:13.686
We want to show you how
we can speak English,

00:06:13.936 --> 00:06:19.246
and it was just an eye opening
experience that I'll never forget.

00:06:19.246 --> 00:06:20.206
&gt;&gt;Wenya: [Speaking Chinese].

00:06:20.206 --> 00:06:21.566
&gt;&gt;Robert: Educators
should always be looking

00:06:21.566 --> 00:06:23.366
at how can we open more
doors for students.

00:06:23.886 --> 00:06:25.786
I find that when you
open those doors,

00:06:25.786 --> 00:06:27.966
and when you expand those
horizons, you never can close them,

00:06:28.226 --> 00:06:29.996
and that's going to change
these students' lives,

00:06:30.046 --> 00:06:38.106
and their families' lives and
their communities lives forever.

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:39.966
&gt;&gt;Wenya: [Speaking Chinese].

00:06:39.966 --> 00:06:41.536
Electronic flower?

00:06:41.536 --> 00:06:42.976
No. Okay?

00:06:43.056 --> 00:06:44.616
