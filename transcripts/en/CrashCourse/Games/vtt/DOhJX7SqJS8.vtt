Hi, I’m Andre, this is Crash Course Games,

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:09.180
and today we’re going to take a chance on talking about something a little different than the board games and video games we’ve focused on in the rest of this series.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.980
We’re going to bet it all on the hope that lots of people will want to watch an episode about gambling.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:23.080
[Theme Music]

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.800
Gambling is kind of an outlier in the world
of games.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.400
In fact, there are some pretty solid arguments that gambling doesn’t even have anything to do with games.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:37.620
I’d argue that some gambling very clearly falls in the realm of games, and even when gambling isn’t really a game, the two still frequently go hand in hand.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.840
In the most basic sense, gambling is the playing
of games for money.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.340
And that broad definition can be a little
problematic.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.149
As we’ll see, people, in general, like to
gamble, and will bet on just about anything.

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:52.940
When we talk about pure gambling though, there are essentially three types: wagers, lotteries, and games of chance.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.720
A wager is a bet on the outcome of an event.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.200
Wagers are things like bets on sporting events, horse or dog races, an election – even a coin toss.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.840
You can wager on just about anything, and
people do this all the time.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.530
I once made a bet about how long the national
anthem was going to be sung in a football event.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.720
I won it, too.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.760
While wagers are often related to games, like a bet on a sports game, wagering itself isn’t often thought of as a game in itself.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.860
Lotteries and games of chance have some things
in common.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.180
According to the textbook on internet gaming
law, creatively titled Internet Gaming Law,

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.840
“Lotteries and games of chance depend on the generations of random numbers through set parameters.”

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.860
At their most basic level, lotteries and casino
games rely on a random number generator.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.940
That generator could be a drum full of numbers, like with a lottery, or it could be a deck of cards or a pair dice, like in casino games.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.380
Lotteries are pretty simple.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.620
A player chooses a group of numbers – or has numbers assigned to them randomly – and wins if the matching numbers are spit out of the number generator.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.040
The lack of player agency in a lottery means
it’s not much like a game, either.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.660
Games of chance are more interesting, because they rely on giving the player an illusion of control.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.620
In reality, a pair of dice, or a roulette wheel, or a deck of cards is just as much a random number generator as a lottery drum.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:08.920
Almost all of the games in a traditional casino like blackjack, roulette, craps, baccarat, and slot machines are all considered pure games of chance.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.920
These are games where the player’s skill can improve their chances, but the house always has a statistical advantage.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.480
That’s why these games are always backed
by the casino or whoever’s running the game.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:27.160
The casino or other game operator understands the odds of these games very well, and sets up the rules of each one so that even the most skillful player is at a slight disadvantage to the house.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:34.680
But when players are allowed to throw the dice themselves, or place the ball in the roulette wheel, or cut the cards, they get a sense that they’re influencing the outcome of the game.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.120
In effect, they’re not.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.560
But it still leads them to bet more.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.160
Casinos usually keep that advantage relatively
small, though.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.220
If people didn’t win frequently at casinos, they wouldn’t have fun, and they wouldn’t want to come back.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:51.200
So some of these casino games, like blackjack or craps, only give the casino a very small advantage, if the players are able to place the best bets.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.860
But even if a casino is keeping 5% of bets on average, it still adds up to a lot of money over millions and millions of bets.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.620
And then there’s Poker, the one casino game
that many will argue is a game of skill.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.960
And in a lot of ways, it is.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.820
The way the cards fall is still subject to the randomness inherent to casino games, and the player can do nothing to influence the quality of their hand.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:15.640
The skill comes in the reading of one’s opponents, and the use of strategic betting to either force opponents out of the game, or lure them into betting when you have a stronger hand.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.439
But no matter what kind of gambling we’re talking about, there’s no doubt that people have been gambling for a long, long time.

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:23.080
Probably for as long as there have been people.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:29.980
Maybe one prehistoric guy bet another guy that he could throw a rock over a tree or something, and he lost his cow, and next thing you know, we’ve got casinos all over the world.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.120
There were probably a few steps in between
there, though.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.880
Actually, we’ve got plenty of non-speculative historical and literary evidence of gambling throughout history.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.419
The Rigveda from India includes the Gambler’s
Lament, written around the 12th century BCE.

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:44.039
It’s the story about a gambler who loses
it all.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.099
The poem reads,

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.820
“My wife holds me aloof, her mother hates me:
the wretched man finds none to give him comfort.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.560
As of a costly horse grown old and feeble,
I find not any profit of the gamester.”

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.920
And the narrator advises other gamblers to, quote,
“Play not with dice: no, cultivate thy corn-land.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.860
Enjoy the gain, and deem that wealth sufficient.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.740
There are thy cattle, there thy wife, O gambler.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.300
So this good Savitar himself hath told me."

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:17.900
There are also references to gambling in the ancient poetry of China, dating as far back as 1100 BCE, and gambling appears in Greek and Roman antiquity, and the Christian Bible as well.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.400
After Christ’s crucifixion, Roman soldiers “divided up His garments among themselves by casting lots.”

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:34.760
The casting of lots shows up in many early references of gambling which grew out of the ancient tradition of cleromancy, predicting the future or understanding the will of gods by interpreting random distributions of stuff they’ve thrown around.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.560
These lots eventually evolved into the dice
we know today, and became much more secular.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:45.180
Playing cards emerged in China around the 9th century CE, and we covered the history of cards pretty extensively in our Card Games episode.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.820
So we don’t need to get into that too much
again.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:55.400
Card and dice games were prevalent in Europe from antiquity onward, and casino gambling first appeared in Italy in the 17th century.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.140
By the middle of the 19th century, there were casinos all over the continent that would still be recognizable today.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.960
During the same period, gambling made its
way to North America.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:09.120
Lotteries were used to fund all kinds of things in colonial America, and all 13 colonies used official government lotteries.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.820
In fact, fundraising by lottery was used to help initially fund a bunch of the first American universities, including Yale, Harvard, and Princeton.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:23.140
Most gambling involving games of chance with cards and dice was more informal, and was happening in taverns, parlors and riverboats all over the New World.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:29.600
The legends of exploitative card sharps and cheaters in the 19th century American imagination contributed to changing attitudes about gambling.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.140
Let’s Go to the Thought Bubble.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:38.740
As the reform-minded progressive movement, the temperance movement, and a changing perception about gambling and corruption all took hold toward end of the 19th century,

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:44.520
legislators moved to ban lotteries in all the states, and games of chance and wagering were widely outlawed as well.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.760
Believe it or not, making gambling illegal
didn’t end the practice;

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:58.060
it just drove it underground, where it eventually became an important stream of revenue for the organized crime syndicates that were springing up all over the country to take up the booze business after the prohibition of alcohol by the 19th Amendment.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.850
The prohibition of gambling, like the prohibition
of alcohol, was pretty short lived.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.500
Gambling started to make a comeback.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.520
Betting on horse racing was re-legalized in several states, including California and New York during the during the 1920s.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.640
And casino gambling was re-legalized in fits
and starts.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:20.240
Nevada started to allow it in 1931, but it was slow to take off, largely because of the state’s small population, and because gambling was still widely considered morally questionable.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.640
The prohibitions against gambling outside Nevada continued to play out in surprising ways.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.120
One common device that was caught up in anti-gambling legislation was the pinball machine.

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:33.630
In the 1940s, pinball was considered a game
of chance, only suitable for gambling.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.460
The police raided pinball parlors and destroyed
the machines.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:46.120
Over time, pinball machines evolved into games of skill that people played solely for entertainment, and they were legalized in 1976, as attitudes toward gambling began to change.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.180
New Jersey legalized casino gambling in Atlantic
City in 1978.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:57.400
By the 1990s, attitudes towards gambling had shifted, and casino gambling began to be legalized in many states, starting with Iowa in 1989.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.400
Today, 20 states allow commercial casino gambling.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.580
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:07.760
Now lotteries also started to make a comeback in the 1960s, when New Hampshire created a state lottery to increase school funding.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:13.110
Over the next few decades that became commonplace, and today, 44 states have government-sponsored lotteries.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.180
Legalization of casino gambling was pushed
in much the same way.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.820
States that legalized gambling promised to tax
casinos, and use those revenues to fund services.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:25.340
This leaves states and municipalities “addicted” to gambling revenues in order to continue providing services.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.540
And as legal gambling expanded in the United
States, a lot of people have taken it up.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:41.040
One study by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago found that 86% of adults in the US reported gambling at some point in their life, and 52% of adults reported participating in a lottery in the last year.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:45.760
These gamblers bet a lot of money and lose
a lot of money. And I mean a LOT.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:51.980
According to The Economist, the world’s
gamblers lost a total of $440 billion in 2014.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:57.620
American gamblers lost the most, giving up
$119 billion in legal wagers.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.639
And those numbers are just for casinos and
other wagering business.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:07.800
If you count the money spent on lotteries, some estimates of worldwide legal gambling losses are as high as $10 trillion a year.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.230
So if we lose so much money, why do we keep
gambling?

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:13.420
Well people gamble so much because it triggers
our brain’s reward systems.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:20.700
When we do something that makes us feel good, like eating a good meal or beating a video game, our brain rewards us with a little bit of dopamine, which makes us feel really good.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.540
We want to engage in that behavior again – no
matter what the consequence might be.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:28.200
Humans can get addicted to gambling in the same way they can get addicted to opiates and cocaine.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:33.000
Drugs like heroin and cocaine trigger this same reward system, and it turns out, gambling wins do, too.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:40.260
In fact, compulsive gambling was classified as an addiction in the American Psychiatric Association’s update to its diagnostic manual in 2013.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:47.530
Surveys indicate that there are about two million problem gamblers in the United States, but addiction can’t account for the vast amounts of money that are being wagered and lost.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.680
What accounts for all those other gamblers?

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:56.300
Sure, their limbic reward system gives them some sweet dopamine for playing, but why do they continue to play if they aren’t actually addicted?

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:00.200
It turns out, there are a couple of ways that people
tend to think that keep them at the casinos.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:04.720
Behavioral economist David Ewing identified
one mechanic as the Gambler’s Conceit.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:10.480
The idea is that people who are gambling tend to believe that they can stop taking risks, even while they continue to take risks.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:17.560
A person sitting at a blackjack table, having lost hundreds of dollars, can very often convince themselves that they’ll quit as soon as they win their money back.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.420
That doesn’t often work as planned.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:24.760
The games are designed so that the house has an advantage, and the player is, in aggregate, unlikely to win those losses back.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.160
But the player is also unlikely to quit if
they do win the money back.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.340
They have little incentive to quit while they’re
winning.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:33.720
Another concept that keeps people gambling
is the Gambler’s Fallacy.

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.190
Remember that illusion of control we mentioned
earlier?

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:37.300
This is kind of similar.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:43.500
The gambler’s fallacy is the idea that a player can predict what’s going to happen during a game, based on what has already happened in a game.

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:47.060
Remember, these are games of chance and they’re
all based on random number generators.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.260
Some of them are more purely random than others,
but they’re random for a reason.

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.080
So that players can’t predict what happens.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.620
The Gambler’s Fallacy is nicely illustrated
by the game of Roulette.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:10:00.940
Players assume that because a certain number has not appeared in a while, it will be more likely to appear in the future.

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:01.940
Nope.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:05.980
Or that since a certain number has appeared
frequently, it is unlikely to appear again.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.280
Also, nope.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:12.820
That logic is flawed because the odds are reset with every roll, and the past doesn’t influence future rolls.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:20.500
A lot of casinos play into this fallacy though, by posting a board by the roulette table showing the last several rolls, which can “help” players predicts future spins.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:28.120
So gambling has been with us for millennia, all the way from the ancient casting of lots to the modern practice of playing tic-tac-toe against chickens.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:34.160
And the basic wiring of human brains, and the ways that risk and reward affect us will ensure us that we’ll be gambling for millennia to come.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.540
So, be sure to quit while you’re ahead.
If you can.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:42.360
In the end, we can only paraphrase America’s foremost expert on gambling, country music legend Kenny Rogers,

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:48.600
and admit we’re in no position to advise on when you should hold them, or when you should fold them, when to walk away, or when to run.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.540
I will suggest you quit counting that money
while you’re sitting at the table.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:54.170
There’ll be time enough to do that when
the video’s done.

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.710
Thanks for watching, and I’ll see you next
week.

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:58.490
Or will I?
Take a bet!

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:02.400
