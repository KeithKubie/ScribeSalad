00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.790
I've gone in and drawn that line that we said we should add y equals 0. So now

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.192
we're in the perfect place to finally figure out the connection between our

00:00:08.192 --> 00:00:13.170
rational function here, and the solution set of this inequality. In fact, the

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.766
connection is that the x coordinates of some points on the plane over here,

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:22.714
represent the solution set of this inequality. Which points are those? Is it

00:00:22.714 --> 00:00:28.920
all points above y equals 0? All points below y equals 0? All points on the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.080
function itself, all points on the function above y equals 0, or all points on

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.303
the function below y equals 0.
