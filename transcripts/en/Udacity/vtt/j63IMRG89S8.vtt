00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.060
Swift is statically typed.

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.375
The type of every entity
is known a compile time.

00:00:04.375 --> 00:00:09.360
Objective-C uses a combination
of static and dynamic typing.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.930
The types of the majority of objects
are declared a compile time,

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.850
in fact, it's required that
every object have a type.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.290
But sometimes,
the type that's declared is id.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.500
The id type is somewhat sneaky.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.630
It's kind of like a amorphous
blob that stands in for any type,

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.260
declaring an object of type id, is
kind of like writing to be determined.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.685
When an entity is declared with the type
id, a more meaningful type is determined

00:00:35.685 --> 00:00:38.720
that run time,
in other words, dynamically.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.520
Here's an example.
