00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.040
*laughs* Look at that! It's soaked the wall.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.640
That wall was like 25 feet away from me.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.140
Hey guys, welcome back. Thanks for joining us today on the King of Random.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.120
Recently, we got to show you our flamethrower which

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.200
shoots flame up to 50 feet.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.980
That would pretty amazing, but its a fairly expensive project

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.300
We're gonna do today is to show you how to make a smaller version of the flamethrower

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.520
that can be built for a lot cheaper, and just to give it an ironic twist

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.760
we're going to be building it out of a fire extinguisher

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.240
This is actually a pretty simple build here's the materials we'll be using to make it.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:35.240
A fire extinguisher, a Schrader valve, a hose clamp, a 1/4 inch brass hose adapter, a wind-resistant barbecue lighter

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.560
and two types of fuel we'll be trying out: some lamp oil and some lighter fluid.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.020
With all of our parts gathered we're ready to start building our flamethrower

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.180
and the first step is to empty out the fire extinguisher

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.680
of what's currently in it. This thing just pops right off.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.780
These chemical fire extinguishers are usually of a yellowish powder and I don't want to spray it inside

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.980
because it'll fill the room and get on everything so

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.889
I'm going to take it outside and I'm gonna try and spray it into a plastic bag, to contain the mess

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:08.939
Seems to be working alright.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.521
Alright! That is empty. You can see our pressure meter is now showing that this is empty, nothing left in it.

00:01:16.521 --> 00:01:24.520
See what comes out into this plastic bag. I don't really want to breathe this anything, there you go that's yellow powder

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.340
Now I know that this cap is something that screws on. I'm just not sure how hard it is to get it off.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:41.640
There we go! Not that hard apparently. A little bit of brute force, and this will just twist right off.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.880
There you go. We have the nozzle that controls the flow,

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.340
we've got threads that attach it to the bottle and we have this pipe that will feed whatever is in the bottom of the tank

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:56.819
up through into the nozzle before we proceed let's empty this out and wash it a little bit.

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:58.819
so we have a clean tank to work with.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.369
Oh wow! There was a lot of powder still in that.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.950
Hmm...yellow dust...

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.929
With the tank cleaned out, it's time to attach the tire valve. First, I'm going to screw this back on

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.460
about as tightly as I can to figure out which direction it's going to point when I'm using it

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.160
Alright, that's on there pretty tight.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.340
But, I want to add my tire valve on the opposite side of where it's pointing now let's take this back off

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.519
So it doesn't get in the way while we're drilling a hole into our tank

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.799
Since this is a round metal container, it's gonna be pretty hard to drill right into the side so I'm going

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.039
to use a nail to give an indentation that will help guide the drill bit.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.080
Alright, hopefully that little dent will make it easier for my drill bit to stay in place.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.500
We need a drill bit that is slightly smaller than the widest portion of the rubber on the valve. I'm using a 1/2 inch

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.280
drill bit.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.920
Now, we need to get the tire valve out through the hole we just drilled.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.160
Since I can't reach my hand inside the bottle, I'm going to pass a string

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:20.319
inside the hole and out the neck of the bottle, tie that to the top of the tire valve and try and pull it through.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.500
Ahh...there we go...

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.660
Valve is now attached through the hole in place and

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.509
hopefully that'll give us a nice tight seal that will hold against any pressure we put in. At this point, I want to test really

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.800
quick if the whole setup is going to work.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.640
So I'm going to fill it about halfway with water,

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.890
install the valve back on, fill it up with some pressure and try spraying it to see if it's working.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.140
Alright, that's installed.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:12.860
Alright...that's just about 80 psi right there, let's try that out. Alright here goes.

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.720
There you go, that is a nice spray.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.020
and with less pressure, it's a less nice spray

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.540
That seems to be working, so let's add on the other parts to turn this into a flamethrower.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.380
As you saw the water is spraying out in kind of a cone shape which i think is the intention with these extinguishers.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.200
They're suppose to put out fire over a larger area so it's better if the powder sprays out in a sort of a cone

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.820
However what we want is more like a squirt gun for the water or the fuel

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.079
to spray out in a stream that will then light on fire, instead of just going everywhere.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.100
That's the point of our little brass connection here. We're going to thread this into the nozzle

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.240
to try and narrow down the stream of water so it doesn't spray out as much. Now I've seen these fire extinguishers

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:05.260
where this nozzle is plastic and in that case we would probably be able to just drive our little brass fitting down into it using

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.600
a pair of pliers. However, this one's made of metal so first we're going to have to tap it to add some threads.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.240
Put a little bit of thread tape on our brass fitting.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.739
With the brass fitting attached, let's do one more test with water to see how the spray has changed.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.450
Alright, let's see if our flow is any better now.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.140
That's way better!

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.420
Got a lot more distance, it's a much tighter stream. That's what we're looking for right there

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.360
With the bike valve installed and the brass fitting on the nozzle, we have an excellent sprayer. Let's add a source

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.640
of heat so that when we fill it with fuel and spray it it'll turn into a flamethrower.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:02.600
I'm going to try to attach our wind-resistant barbecue lighter to the side of the tank so that the flame is in the path of the fuel.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.540
We'll use our hose clamp around the tank and the lighter and try and secure it in place.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.500
To make it easier to get the hose clamp in place without also trying to hold the lighter, I'm gonna use the little electrical tape

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.450
to hold it in place just for a second while I clamp it down

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:36.249
At this point, our spray should go right through our flame. So if we use some flammable liquid, hopefully we'll get a flamethrower.

00:06:36.619 --> 00:06:42.309
We're going to try two different types of flammable liquid in our flamethrower, the first is lamp oil and the second is lighter fluid.

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:47.588
The lamp oil isn't quite as flammable as the lighter fluid, but it's a popular liquid for using and breathing fire.

00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:53.409
Since I think we're gonna have a similar spray from our flamethrower, I want to try it out. I don't want to try anything more

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:59.169
flammable than these. I could put gasoline in here and it would almost certainly light on fire since we're using compressed air to power our

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:04.628
flamethrower here. I don't want to risk an explosion by mixing it with gasoline. Let's test out our miniature flamethrower.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.280
Some of you might recognize, this is the same spot where we test it out our larger flamethrower.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.520
I thought it'd be a good idea to test out our mini one in the same spot because it's really fireproof.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:19.500
First we'll try it with the lamp oil, which as I said is the same stuff used for breathing fire most of the time.

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.060
Perfect! Now, we add pressure.

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:33.309
Alright, just over 80 psi.

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:38.679
So I'll light the lighter and then while the flame is going I'll press the trigger and see what happens.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.850
Oh, a little...

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.210
Hmm...

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:53.920
Well I think this type of flame doesn't have enough heat and fire coming off of it consistently to light the oil.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:58.440
So let's try one more try using lighter fluid and see if that's a little bit more flammable.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.880
Hopefully the lighter fluid is a little bit more flammable and work with our lighter.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:18.400
So I tried firing, I got a little bit of it to light and then it went out I think that even though this is

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:23.049
supposed to be a windproof lighter, just the gentle breeze out there is blowing it out watch this

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.709
the amount i'm blowing wouldn't even come close to putting out a birthday candle this is kind of sad here goes

00:08:34.699 --> 00:08:36.699
Shooting right through the flame.

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.130
Well, that was mediocre.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:48.260
Well as you saw using our lighter as a heat source didn't work very well. I think the pressure from the oil flying out of the fire

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:53.500
extinguisher was enough to just blow out the flame, I have another method that I want to try that I think will hold up to

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.760
the pressure of the oil a lot better than the lighter.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:00.420
Instead of the lighter, we're going to try using a lamp wick. I picked up a few of them at Hobby Lobby for just a

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:07.180
couple bucks. To hold our wick, I have what's called a faucet supply tube. It's a small piece of chromed copper tubing and since it's

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.489
made of copper it's very flexible. We're going to use that to attach

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:13.449
to the front of our tank, add a wick in front of it and light that on fire.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:18.430
This tube is a little bit too long, so let's use a hacksaw to cut it short. I'm going to cut this one

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:20.430
so it's about seven inches long.

00:09:21.529 --> 00:09:25.088
Now, I'm going to put the bottom two inches of this pipe in a vice and flatten them out.

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.590
Clearly, if I leave the pipe straight, the flame is going

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:38.340
to be in entirely the wrong place. But fortunately, since this is copper, it does bend very easily.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:44.260
We want the pipe straight in front of the nozzle about an inch and a half in front of it and maybe an inch below it.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.320
Now, we use our hose clamp again to secure that in place.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:55.819
Alright, that feels pretty secure and just as a safety measure so I don't scratch myself on it, I'm going to bend the end of

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:59.359
the hose clamp over into a bit of a loop. Now that we have our tube attached

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:04.669
to the fire extinguisher, let's cut off about three inches of one of our wicks. take one end of your wick and roll it up.

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.849
You want to fit this rolled end into the copper pipe.

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:11.239
Try to fit one and a half to two inches of the wick down inside the pipe,

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.230
leaving at least an inch of it exposed.

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:18.260
Now we're ready to test our flamethrower, we'll soak the wick in either our oil or our lighter fluid and that will be the source

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:23.840
of ignition for the flamethrower. We now have our new wick attached to our fire extinguisher flamethrower, so let's test it out again.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:28.999
We had better results in our first test with the lighter fluid than with the lamp oil so I think we're gonna skip using the

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.500
lamp oil and just go straight to the lighter fluid in this one. However before I do that, there is another thing I want to

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.729
test and that's using coffee creamer. This is a corn syrup base powder that's actually pretty

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:41.659
flammable when it's separated out. I'm gonna see what happens if i put it into the fire

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:48.740
extinguisher and see if the pressure is enough to drive the powder through the nozzle. Coffee creamer torch in 3, 2, 1

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.600
That's actually working pretty good!

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.440
Alright it's already out of pressure but,

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.160
that work...that worked all right...

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.620
When it was blowing full pressure, it did sort of seem to

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:11.719
have so much pressure that the coffee creamer was flying past the flame so fast, it couldn't heat up

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.690
But, as the pressure dropped and even if I just

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:20.479
sort of halfway pressed the trigger to lower the pressure, it was lighting up pretty good and i think this might be a good

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:28.039
relatively safe way to do this since it really doesn't have a light flammable liquid getting everywhere it's probably a little safer than lighter fluid.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:33.580
Alright, we had sort of mixed results using the coffee creamer. Now let's move on to the lighter fluid and see if that works any better.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.560
Alright...

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.460
3, 2, 1

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.260
Haha!

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.540
That worked for a second.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:57.469
Then it worked for another second. That part in the middle, I'm not really sure what was going on there but

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:06.199
the beginning and end worked pretty good. I think what caused the gap in the middle is that there was too nice of

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.140
a stream. When it was first starting there was enough high pressure

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:13.789
that it sort of aerosolized a little bit and that caught on fire and then as the pressure got lower

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.000
it had just a nice little stream and that wasn't broken up enough

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:22.339
for it to really light on fire and then as the liquid got low it started getting air and liquid

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.549
into the tube again and once again it was air sliced and was able to light.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.659
Alright. Let's try this with lighter fluid again.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.480
See if we can get some good distance on it.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:36.740
3, 2, 1.

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:40.520
*laughs* Look at that! It's soaking the wall.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.380
That wall was like 25 feet away from me.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.040
Well, that was beautiful!

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:50.710
There we go. All the pressure, almost all the liquid gone.

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:53.979
That was...the wall is still on fire.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.909
It's still got lighter fluid soaking on it. That's pretty great!

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:02.739
That is how you want it to work. That was a great little just...

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:10.330
...spurt of fire that went 25 - 30 feet away stuck to the wall burning the whole time. That was beautiful.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.120
It's on fire! Put it out!

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.060
*camera shaking*

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.820
I caught the ceiling on fire. That made a really cool noise too.

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.780
There you have it. That is how you can make your very own

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:40.100
flamethrower out of a fire extinguisher,

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:44.649
which seems a little ironic but it works really well. If you use the right fuel

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.200
this thing can shoot pretty good and it lights on fire beautifully.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:52.500
We tried using coffee creamer and got mixed results and I think the biggest problem is that we switched between

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:57.249
using oil and lighter fluid and then the powdered coffee creamer and I think it kind of got gummed up.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.180
So if you're gonna use coffee creamer,

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:04.120
just use coffee creamer. Don't switch between the two unless you have a very good way to clean and dry it completely.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:09.820
Lighter fluid worked great as a fuel. This whole bottle cost about four bucks at Walmart and when you only fill a fire extinguisher

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:13.719
halfway, which I found works very well, you can get four or five different

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:18.610
firings out of this thing. It's all pressure just by using a bike pump and I got best results when i pumped it as high

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:24.669
as 95 psi. I got a really good distance and I got a really good spray of the droplets that still traveled quite away.

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.730
This thing fired almost as far as the full-sized flamethrower.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.550
Once again if you're going to build yourself a flamethrower,

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:33.610
don't be stupid about it. Make sure you're wearing protective clothing.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:39.819
Don't point it at anything that's alive. Don't point it at anything that's gonna light on fire unless it's in a carefully controlled location.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:44.770
Always make sure you have the proper equipment to put out any fires that you start while you're using it. Even if those fires are

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:48.850
exactly where you want them to be, you want to be sure you can put them out in a moment's notice if you need to.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.420
It has been a really fun project that's easy to do and doesn't take much time at all.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:57.129
This doesn't have quite the same flame output as the full-sized flamethrower but it's a lot easier and much cheaper to build.

00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:02.440
If you've got any great ideas, if something that really needs to be shot out with a flamethrower, let us know down in the comments.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:06.010
Thanks for joining us for this project today and we'll see you in the next one. Talk to you then.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.490
I didn't say it's used for breathing fire

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.999
Hey guys! I hope you're enjoying these new videos with Nate as much as I am. He's got some

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:27.050
phenomenal talent when it comes to building and crafting and he really loves what he does.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.960
Give him some validation if you agree and i'll see you in the next video.
