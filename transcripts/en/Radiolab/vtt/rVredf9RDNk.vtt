<v 1>This is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abu Ron and I'm Robert Krulwich.</v>

8
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.700
Our program today is about music. What it is, how it works,

9
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.820
and what we want to do next is we want to, we want to stay on the subject,

10
00:00:35.821 --> 00:00:38.310
but we're going to explore this a little more deeply.

11
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.770
Take a closer look at the connection between language and music.

12
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.770
We're going to add touch, touch, and that will take us to the ear, the ear,

13
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.830
and then into the brain, the brain, and then to the big question,

14
00:00:49.831 --> 00:00:51.000
the really big question,

15
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:55.440
why does music or how does music become a feeling?

16
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.100
The feeling, why do we get such deep pleasure or deep pain?

17
00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:04.101
We really have pain coming up to all simply because of air pressing against your

18
00:01:04.561 --> 00:01:07.830
ear. All right, we're first. All right.

19
00:01:07.831 --> 00:01:11.580
Well there is a psychology professor I want you to meet at Stanford who directs

20
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.751
the Center for Infant Studies.

21
00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:16.920
There in front olds is her name and she got it into her head that there is a

22
00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:21.360
kind of deep universal music inside language.

23
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.620
<v 2>She discovered it actually at a hospital.</v>

24
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.260
The Max Planck Institute in Munich has an obstetrics unit which is very popular

25
00:01:30.261 --> 00:01:33.560
among expectant mothers. These mothers came from the war.

26
00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:36.980
It's if this German hospital and so they were Turkish. They were Greek,

27
00:01:36.981 --> 00:01:40.970
they were Sicilian. They were the so called guest workers in the German society.

28
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.210
Of course, I didn't understand a word of what they spoke.

29
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.440
As soon as they put the baby down and no longer had the physical contact,

30
00:01:50.961 --> 00:01:52.460
bodily contact with a child,

31
00:01:52.461 --> 00:01:57.461
they started to sing almost in one language after another given the babies

32
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.400
Dutch. I heard these, I heard them use these melodies,

33
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.120
Russian gooseneck to reach to reach the child to remain in touch with the baby.

34
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.730
So next day I brought my tape recording

35
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.150
<v 1>and for an old took her tape recorder from that hospital and traveled all over</v>

36
00:02:21.151 --> 00:02:25.590
the world recording parents as they talked to their very little babies and it

37
00:02:25.591 --> 00:02:30.450
didn't matter whether the parents spoke the romance language or a tone language

38
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.030
everywhere she went below the words,

39
00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:37.410
she heard consistently the same melodies. For example,

40
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.040
I'll start with approval. When a parent wanted to praise a child,

41
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.720
we would ask the parents to show the baby they were happy.

42
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.380
Good boy. Now you got just using their voice. Show him you're happy with that.

43
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.770
I tried that. He get that. I got Hindi. [inaudible],

44
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.890
Kuala Caballo, Portuguese. It would.

45
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.900
These things had in common was that the melody was a kind of a of a rise phone.

46
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.060
Damn. Good girl, Girl. Got It. Yeah.

47
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.500
Good girl sweetie. It doesn't matter what words the parents are saying.

48
00:03:17.501 --> 00:03:20.260
It's always really about this melody

49
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.980
and why that particular melody. All she knows is that it worked.

50
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:30.790
There's something about this melody that that

51
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.790
<v 2>keeps the child doing something. There are,</v>

52
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.840
she says other categories that she discovered now with a prohibition.

53
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:39.591
In contrast,

54
00:03:39.591 --> 00:03:43.520
your goal is to stop the child from doing something in the category that says

55
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.680
stop quite a different melody. It's short, it's sharp in musical terms,

56
00:03:48.681 --> 00:03:53.390
it's Staccato. The back there is the category. Oh look,

57
00:03:53.391 --> 00:03:57.860
pay attention to that. Now this frequently use rising pitch. Look Sweetie,

58
00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.070
they frequently use higher pitch corn or Unicorn so far and Fernald has found

59
00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.040
four universal melodies that praise, that stop and call attention.

60
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:15.020
And of course the melody that comforts [inaudible].

61
00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.320
And while this may seem obvious to you, if you think about it,

62
00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.240
this is music that is understood by infants. We're just new in the world,

63
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.350
but we all know what it means. We all know these songs well.

64
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.190
We're used to thinking of sounds as being about something.

65
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.400
Speeches always about something, but it feels [inaudible] to me.

66
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.050
More like touch. Touch isn't about something.

67
00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:45.370
If you whack me on the arm in a sudden sharp way, I'm going to be startled.

68
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.170
Or a gentle touch has a different effect. And I think, you know,

69
00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:54.190
actually sound is kind of touch at a, at a distance.

70
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.950
<v 1>I was an old director of the center for infant studies at Stanford.</v>

71
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.490
And when Anne says sound is more like touch map turns out to be literally the

72
00:05:10.581 --> 00:05:14.810
case. This is something I learned from a friend of mine, Jonah Lehrer. Um,

73
00:05:14.811 --> 00:05:18.500
my name's Jonah Lehrer, who at this very moment is working on a book,

74
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.520
an upcoming book on art and science on the connection between art and science.

75
00:05:22.521 --> 00:05:24.240
Do we need it? Do we have a name for that book? Uh,

76
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.830
it's called Proust was a neuroscientist. Okay. Ansys Jonah,

77
00:05:27.831 --> 00:05:32.750
thinking about sound as touch more like touch, I asked him,

78
00:05:32.751 --> 00:05:36.230
how does sound get into or, or touch your brain,

79
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.790
take us on that journey. It's just waves of vibrating air.

80
00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.020
Um, it's just your voice shoot and [inaudible]

81
00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.630
<v 4>beginning your voicebox compresses air and that air travel through space and</v>

82
00:05:53.631 --> 00:05:58.070
time into

83
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.903
<v 5>my ear,</v>

84
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.670
the little tunnel waves of diffuse vibrating air focused and channeled into my

85
00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:08.990
ear drum, which vibrates a few very small bones

86
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.540
and the little bones transmit the vibration into this salty sea where the hairs

87
00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:19.400
are and the hairstyles are fascinating.

88
00:06:19.401 --> 00:06:22.160
The hair cells become active when they are literally bent by way.

89
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:26.080
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

90
00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.550
<v 5>Ben like trees and a breeze</v>

91
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.060
and when these hair cells band charged molecule

92
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.780
<v 6>cute old blood inwards and activate the shell,</v>

93
00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.960
<v 5>the sound triggers the bones. The bones disturbs the fluid.</v>

94
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.110
The fluid rocks the hair. Yes.

95
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:51.270
And then the heres set off essentially electricity. Yes. Huh.

96
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.160
That's the language of neurons.

97
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.940
All those changes from waves to bone was to electricity.

98
00:06:57.941 --> 00:07:01.670
All those things were a trip on their way to being heard.

99
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:08.050
It's only when the electricity finally forms a pattern in your brain.

100
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.720
Only when it's deep inside gaps. When you hear something

101
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.983
[inaudible]

102
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.400
<v 6>more like touch</v>

103
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.350
<v 5>sound is kind of touch edit at a distance.</v>

104
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:38.733
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

105
00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:46.320
<v 5>all right. Now that we have gotten a sound and any sound into our heads,</v>

106
00:07:46.321 --> 00:07:49.590
let me ask you the next really big question. Okay.

107
00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.930
Why do some sound and let's make it music. Okay.

108
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:57.230
Why does music make so many of us so often feel so strongly?

109
00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.780
Yeah. Like in terms of what we were just listening to,

110
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:05.800
like how does all that electricity from the ear going up to the brain in the

111
00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.030
next millisecond become a feeling? Yeah. Well,

112
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.810
let me introduce you to someone martyred. Trey, Mo z. We heard from him earlier.

113
00:08:12.811 --> 00:08:14.010
He's a neuroscientist.

114
00:08:14.011 --> 00:08:19.011
I'm in the Department of Neurology and Harvard medical school and mark can at

115
00:08:19.771 --> 00:08:22.770
least begin to answer this question, this feeling question.

116
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.660
He's done something really interesting.

117
00:08:24.661 --> 00:08:29.661
He's able to listen to the electricity as it pools in the ear and shoots up this

118
00:08:30.871 --> 00:08:35.250
big fat nerve to the brain. It's um, it's kind of a, a popping sound.

119
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:37.530
He can actually listen to that nerve,

120
00:08:37.531 --> 00:08:41.610
to the electricity so faster than I'm able to do here with my fingers.

121
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.670
Is that, is that the sounds, what it sounds like. So how do they get,

122
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.240
how do they get this sound? I actually have no idea.

123
00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.580
I guess I sort of tap into the nerve.

124
00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:59.220
This is the sound of sound entering the brain. Yes. This is a sound of sound.

125
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.520
Entering the brain as electricity, little pulses. And as you can hear,

126
00:09:02.521 --> 00:09:03.840
the electricity has a meter,

127
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:09.580
but mark is discovered is that when the electricity entering your brain is even

128
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:13.180
and regular. Regular. This is the [inaudible] sweet.

129
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:14.583
<v 3>Okay.</v>

130
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.263
<v 5>Yeah, that's regular.</v>

131
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.630
Right when the meter of the electricity is regular and rhythmic,

132
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:26.690
it will arrive in our mind and be heard by us as a sound that we generally like,

133
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:28.163
like this

134
00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:34.240
<v 1>nice sound that in music is known as a perfect fifth.</v>

135
00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:39.300
The inputs coming from a perfect fifth is very,

136
00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:40.400
very regular. Right?

137
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:43.190
<v 5>Good metronome. However, and here's where it gets interesting.</v>

138
00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.180
When the meter coming from the ear to the brain is irregular,

139
00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.940
jagged a with MC unpredictable [inaudible]. Let me hear it.

140
00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.280
This is the [inaudible] which

141
00:09:58.810 --> 00:09:59.300
<v 3>hello?</v>

142
00:09:59.300 --> 00:09:59.851
<v 5>Yeah, it is. Yeah.</v>

143
00:09:59.851 --> 00:10:04.200
And what mark has discovered is that when electrical impulses like that travel

144
00:10:04.201 --> 00:10:06.240
from the air to the brain and they will become heard by us,

145
00:10:06.241 --> 00:10:09.030
by our mind as a sound that we generally don't like

146
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.980
like that. Don't care for that one. That's a minor second.

147
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:16.140
The inputs coming from a minor second.

148
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:18.083
<v 3>Okay.</v>

149
00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:19.750
<v 1>Is Very, very chaotic.</v>

150
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:22.543
<v 7>[inaudible].</v>

151
00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:26.200
<v 1>Okay, so let me just sum up here what I think you're,</v>

152
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:31.230
you're saying if a sound entering my brain is disorderly and unexpected

153
00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.150
electrically speak electrically speaking,

154
00:10:34.151 --> 00:10:38.170
then that would make me feel uncomfortable. Yeah.

155
00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.530
And if it comes in in a familiar and orderly way,

156
00:10:41.531 --> 00:10:44.200
that will make me feel comfortable.

157
00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:48.760
There does seem to be a relationship between the kind of electricity as sound

158
00:10:48.761 --> 00:10:51.580
producers and how we feel about that sound.

159
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:52.913
<v 7>Wow.</v>

160
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.430
<v 5>Do they have like fancy names for this? Well that's a minor second.</v>

161
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.863
That thing you just said,

162
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.480
but did the scientist have names for pleasant and unpleasant?

163
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:05.430
A continent is pleasant. Dissonant is unpleasant. That's not a science name.

164
00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:08.760
That's a music name. Oh, okay. And these are fixed positions in your ear?

165
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.050
<v 1>Well, meet with me. Be Fixed for scientists. But you know,</v>

166
00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:15.530
maybe let me just propose this to you, that what people find pleasing,

167
00:11:15.531 --> 00:11:19.700
what people find painful is malleable.

168
00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:24.020
I'll tell you why. I'm going to tell you a story now, the true story,

169
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.930
and it involves a musician, ego, Stravinsky,

170
00:11:26.931 --> 00:11:30.200
who is now considered to be one of the great composers of the 20th century.

171
00:11:30.201 --> 00:11:32.660
If not the most important composer of the 20th century.

172
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.830
That's Jonah layer again.

173
00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:39.070
And Jonah tells the story of two concerts one year apart in the same city,

174
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:45.020
the exact same piece of music. The audience who heard it first,

175
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:49.700
mme audience or heard it later on her totally different things.

176
00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:55.960
<v 5>So let's first at Jonah. Well, how does this, um, just set the scene.</v>

177
00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:00.700
This is May, 1913 to spring night. It's a,

178
00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:04.510
it's a balmy summer night. Black Tie costumes.

179
00:12:04.511 --> 00:12:07.930
The women have their fedoras. This was evening clothes. Yeah.

180
00:12:07.931 --> 00:12:10.060
Well this was the Russian ballet. This was high art.

181
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.850
And the program's had, this is a concert about springtime,

182
00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:17.920
but as they settled into their seats,

183
00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:18.601
<v 1>as it turns out,</v>

184
00:12:18.601 --> 00:12:21.780
that what's driven ski had in mind was not spring like honeybees. No,

185
00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.920
the spring Stravinsky had in mind was about change,

186
00:12:25.921 --> 00:12:29.730
about radical change, ritual murder. Literally,

187
00:12:29.731 --> 00:12:31.190
that's what the story of the players, it's,

188
00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:35.730
it's a pagan ritual where the end of the virgin gets massacred.

189
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.983
Oh dear.

190
00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.700
<v 3>[inaudible]. But the music itself is fascinating.</v>

191
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.310
The beginning is this very charming bassoon. It's,

192
00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:53.360
it's a classic Lithuanian Folkston and it does sound like the earth is warming

193
00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.360
<v 5>and that lasts for about a minute.</v>

194
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:04.240
And then we get some Tutti of flutes and it's lovely.

195
00:13:04.241 --> 00:13:05.680
It's getting a little more disturbing

196
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:10.150
<v 3>and then about three minutes into it</v>

197
00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:13.713
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

198
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:15.870
<v 3>everything changes.</v>

199
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.790
[inaudible] there's, there's, there's just an earthquake.

200
00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:31.860
Stravinsky plays this cord [inaudible]

201
00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:34.070
<v 5>there's a great story that when Diaghilev,</v>

202
00:13:34.071 --> 00:13:37.740
who's the head of the ballet reus first heard this chord entrance.

203
00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:39.020
He was playing on the piano for him.

204
00:13:39.021 --> 00:13:41.120
He asked Devinsky how long will it go on like that?

205
00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.530
<v 3>And Stravinsky looked at him and said to the end,</v>

206
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:49.540
<v 5>and it literally does that chord structures, the music</v>

207
00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:50.970
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

208
00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:53.910
<v 5>it's one of the most difficult sounds you've ever heard.</v>

209
00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:59.200
<v 3>It is. It is just the stereotype of desinence. It is. [inaudible] it hurts you,</v>

210
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:03.850
Huh? Well, what happened? Well,

211
00:14:03.851 --> 00:14:05.740
after about three minutes, they ride it

212
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:07.650
<v 5>the way they ride it,</v>

213
00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:15.630
meaning what? Like they scream or through they scream. There was blood.

214
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:20.850
Old Ladies were hitting each other with Keynes. One Lady,

215
00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.760
all lady should've gotten hit Stravinsky with a cane.

216
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:24.960
But once they started screaming,

217
00:14:24.961 --> 00:14:28.020
Stravinsky ran backstage and by some accounts was crying,

218
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:31.830
Nijinsky was off on the side of the stage screaming to his dancers to keep the

219
00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:36.150
beat. Dude. Wow. Quite the fiasco.

220
00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.970
And the question is why?

221
00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:42.510
<v 1>Well, this is the feeling question.</v>

222
00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:47.130
Why so much feeling about a piece of music that, why did they arrive?

223
00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:52.190
You would think that they rioted because they were hot. They didn't like those

224
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:53.090
<v 5>sounds because they did.</v>

225
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:56.120
They thought those dancers were making strange and odd gestures.

226
00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:00.290
Love Jonah offers a different theory. Well, let me put it this way.

227
00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:04.250
This ride has been talked about and written about for forever,

228
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.440
but to the best of our knowledge,

229
00:15:06.441 --> 00:15:11.441
no one has ever tried to explain what happened that night through the lens of,

230
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:16.640
um, brain chemistry veering chemistry. Yeah.

231
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:20.000
What music can do to a brain. You know,

232
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.980
if you try to imagine yourself or all you've heard is Wagner and,

233
00:15:24.981 --> 00:15:27.970
and the great romanticism of 19th century music,

234
00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:33.970
um, and then all of a sudden you get debt.

235
00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:39.310
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

236
00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:43.240
<v 5>these are noises you've never heard before. It's all very new.</v>

237
00:15:43.241 --> 00:15:47.380
But scientists are beginning to figure out what happens in our brain when we

238
00:15:47.381 --> 00:15:52.150
hear noises we've never heard before, especially dissonant noise.

239
00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:54.450
<v 3>Okay?</v>

240
00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:56.310
<v 5>We find that chords,</v>

241
00:15:56.311 --> 00:15:59.610
musical chords that are typically judged to be dissonant,

242
00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:04.890
elicit these wild fluctuations in brain activity. This is Yon Fishman.

243
00:16:04.891 --> 00:16:09.630
He is a neuroscientist and he studies those wild fluctuations in the brain on an

244
00:16:09.631 --> 00:16:11.580
area of the brain called the auditory cortex.

245
00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:15.720
Let's zoom in to the auditory cortex for a moment because this is basically

246
00:16:15.721 --> 00:16:19.770
hearing central and when you're listening to music,

247
00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:23.340
there are all kinds of neurons during all kinds of things.

248
00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:28.350
One gang in particular that yarn is interested in.

249
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:29.160
That's right.

250
00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.970
The gang that he suspects gets very agitated when it hears sounds like these

251
00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:38.500
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>

252
00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:43.500
<v 5>These neurons might be the new noise department because he thinks their job is</v>

253
00:16:44.291 --> 00:16:49.180
to take every new strange unordered unpredictable noise that comes into the

254
00:16:49.181 --> 00:16:53.800
brain and figure it out. Find the pattern.

255
00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:56.860
There are groups of neurons whose sole job it is.

256
00:16:56.861 --> 00:17:00.280
This is how Jonah puts it to turn that dissonant note, dissect it,

257
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:02.530
take it apart and try to understand it.

258
00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:07.180
We are pattern searching animals and this is how Yon Fishman puts it.

259
00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:09.220
And so at the level of the auditory Cortex,

260
00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:14.490
the brain has this daunting task of having to be able to disentangle this

261
00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.270
complex mixture of sound.

262
00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:22.810
Most of the time those neurons in the auditory cortex succeed

263
00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:25.210
in finding the pattern

264
00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:26.053
<v 3>that's</v>

265
00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:32.510
[inaudible] not sad, but every so often

266
00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:38.060
this was the case that night they seem

267
00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:45.220
[inaudible].

268
00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:48.880
<v 5>Okay, so Robert, imagine inside the brains, inside the heads of the,</v>

269
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.610
in the audience listening to the rite of spring that night were all of these

270
00:17:53.611 --> 00:17:54.660
neurons. Yeah,

271
00:17:54.661 --> 00:17:59.100
I can hear them trying to make sense of the new sounds and failing,

272
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:05.190
not just feeling once or twice, but over and over and over.

273
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:09.330
The rite of spring keeps being dissonant all the way through so they can never

274
00:18:09.331 --> 00:18:12.870
get any rest. And when those neurons fail repeatedly,

275
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:15.600
there are consequences. Chemical consequences.

276
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.800
What happens is our neurons scored out a bit of dopamine and what does the

277
00:18:19.801 --> 00:18:23.190
dopamine do? Well, dove mean makes us feel a little dopamine,

278
00:18:23.191 --> 00:18:27.450
makes you feel happy. That's why sex and drugs make you feel euphoric,

279
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:31.650
but a little too much. [inaudible]

280
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:36.720
thank you for your turns into literally schizophrenia. Really? Yes.

281
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:40.200
I don't want to oversimplify a schizophrenia in any way, shape, or form,

282
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.220
but some of our most effective treatments for schizophrenia work by suppressing

283
00:18:44.221 --> 00:18:46.770
dopamine release in the brain. So there's some kind of relationship.

284
00:18:46.771 --> 00:18:50.310
Too much dopamine has been shown clinically to make people feel crazy. Yes.

285
00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:55.470
Maybe that's what happened that night. On May 29th, 1913 music erupted.

286
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.950
Neurons revolted, right? Dopamine flooded through.

287
00:18:58.951 --> 00:19:02.990
This is to their brains and people went mad. Literally, man,

288
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:07.530
let's go to the second night in our story. The piece does come back to Paris,

289
00:19:07.531 --> 00:19:12.090
right? Yes. How much later after the riot? Uh, it's from May to March.

290
00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.580
Actually it was April. So it's almost a year later. Yes.

291
00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.290
And this time it doesn't come with a ballet.

292
00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.170
This time it's just being performed as a work of music. She'll do.

293
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:23.910
Does anyone buy tickets? Oh yeah. It's, it's, it's, it's going to sell out.

294
00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:26.130
They do cause a few nights of violent riots.

295
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:29.950
Can you shut up the situation now the audience, is it a different audience? Uh,

296
00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.400
I actually don't know if the audience is different,

297
00:19:32.401 --> 00:19:35.340
but we can at least say that the audience is coming to it with a different set

298
00:19:35.341 --> 00:19:38.070
of information. Exactly. They've, they've been warned

299
00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:40.970
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

300
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:44.960
<v 5>so for the first time they can actually sit back and really try to pay attention</v>

301
00:19:44.961 --> 00:19:48.680
to the notes by being willing to listen.

302
00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:52.910
They could hear the orders and patterns that Stravinsky had hidden in this work.

303
00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:56.350
They were able to hear the music

304
00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:01.060
and find the orders hidden underneath this noise.

305
00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.930
Was there a riot this time? The second round? Oh No. Quite the opposite.

306
00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:13.200
Stravinsky was a hero. They carried them out on their shoulders.

307
00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:20.090
Really? Literally he was, he was literally, he was carried in the shoulders and,

308
00:20:20.091 --> 00:20:24.150
and, and the press was glowing in one year, in one year.

309
00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:27.990
And just one year Stravinsky had gone from villainous monster

310
00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:31.800
to hipster icon

311
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.600
to the extent that police had to escort him from the concert hall to keep them

312
00:20:36.601 --> 00:20:41.550
safe from adoring fans. And that was just the beginning. The,

313
00:20:41.551 --> 00:20:42.430
the third story,

314
00:20:42.431 --> 00:20:45.940
if you wanted to tell a third story would be it became children's music.

315
00:20:45.941 --> 00:20:50.830
It became Disney Music 1940 27 years after Stravinsky had caused a violent and

316
00:20:50.831 --> 00:20:51.850
bloody riot.

317
00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:56.920
He was negotiating with Mickey Mouse over the rights to use his music and

318
00:20:56.921 --> 00:21:01.130
Fantasia, which fantasia is just starting a hippopotamus in a little Tutu. No.

319
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:03.340
Is that the one? Is it the mushroom stone? Yeah,

320
00:21:03.341 --> 00:21:05.920
I think it's the mushrooms as mushrooms. Actually, we looked it up later.

321
00:21:05.921 --> 00:21:09.100
It was a the part with the dinosaurs. So how does this happen?

322
00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:14.101
How do you go so quickly from being the most outrageous thing that literally

323
00:21:14.141 --> 00:21:18.250
maddens people to a triumph to kids' music?

324
00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:23.320
Yes. I mean the rite of spring is perfect evidence of the brain's astonishing

325
00:21:23.321 --> 00:21:25.960
plasticity. See, this is the really cool part of it for me.

326
00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:29.920
If you remember just one bit of science from this whole thing. Remember this,

327
00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:33.760
those neurons who met earlier, the one that, the little voices,

328
00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:37.690
if it turns out those neurons learn

329
00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:40.780
and they learn fast

330
00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:46.300
because they're actually part of a larger network of brain cells with a very

331
00:21:46.301 --> 00:21:48.790
technical name called the Codigo fugal network.

332
00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.730
And what this network does is it's always sort of monitoring,

333
00:21:51.731 --> 00:21:56.731
listening to the sounds that are coming into the brain and tuning those neurons

334
00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.310
to better hear those sounds like trying to get the station on the radio just to

335
00:22:00.311 --> 00:22:01.144
getting it just right.

336
00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:06.050
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

337
00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:07.970
<v 1>so our neurons literally adjust.</v>

338
00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:11.000
Literally we're talking than biochemical engineering sense.

339
00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:16.090
So if on that first night you just hear the right as pure noise all the way

340
00:22:16.251 --> 00:22:18.860
through from beginning to end. If you're listening,

341
00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.950
if you're letting your cortical fugal network do its job,

342
00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:27.260
it can actually resculpt your brain and let you hear the patterns better as the

343
00:22:27.261 --> 00:22:28.220
symphony evolves.

344
00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:33.730
Is it fair to say that this is a sort of tug of war that an artist comes,

345
00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:40.120
create something that is new and unpredictable and strange and maybe noise ish?

346
00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:47.770
At first hearing and the artist is thrilled to be new in that way.

347
00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:54.400
And then the brain ruins it all slowly but surely by making it familiar and

348
00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:56.270
well, the brain pours the know.

349
00:22:56.630 --> 00:23:00.950
The brain constantly wants to assimilate every experience you've ever had into

350
00:23:00.951 --> 00:23:02.090
every other experience.

351
00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:07.100
And I think Stravinsky realized it was the purpose of the artist to challenge

352
00:23:07.101 --> 00:23:07.934
the brain,

353
00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.190
<v 5>to break the brain out of its conservative cycle.</v>

354
00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:17.730
<v 1>The astonishing thing to me is here you have an artist like Igor Stravinsky who</v>

355
00:23:17.731 --> 00:23:22.170
comes to town intentionally trying to get people to sit in their seats and

356
00:23:22.171 --> 00:23:24.000
really listened to music.

357
00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:27.630
And the strategy he chooses is instead of pleasing them,

358
00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:31.920
he wants to put them in a little bit of discomfort or real pain even, right?

359
00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:35.280
And indeed they not only listen, they riot, but within a year,

360
00:23:35.281 --> 00:23:39.720
and this is the sad part to me, within a year it's easier to hear.

361
00:23:39.721 --> 00:23:41.010
Suddenly it's pleasant.

362
00:23:41.011 --> 00:23:45.770
Suddenly they like it and suddenly eus driven ski is robbed of newness.

363
00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:48.500
Why is that sad for you? Well, because it kind of, I don't know.

364
00:23:48.501 --> 00:23:52.630
I never thought of the brain as the enemy of the artist before with IA.

365
00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:55.010
But I can give you a different interpretation on this. Who, I mean,

366
00:23:55.011 --> 00:23:55.990
here comes a guy who [inaudible]

367
00:23:56.030 --> 00:24:00.080
<v 5>offers up the most dissonance, stabbing,</v>

368
00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:01.160
percussive,

369
00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:05.510
painful music to anyone had heard to that point and we learned to love them.

370
00:24:05.511 --> 00:24:08.610
But because of that make you sort of feel like pride.

371
00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:11.760
<v 1>No, I no, I mean like our brains can decode anything.</v>

372
00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:15.420
We learned to love it only because it's well-made. Yeah.

373
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:18.570
But just random car hunks. I don't think you could really appreciate that,

374
00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:22.940
but I disagree. Or you think it would be like just having, have you heard

375
00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:24.760
<v 5>the music that was written after Stravinsky?</v>

376
00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:29.940
It's even worse than what you just did. Yeah,

377
00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:33.490
but my brain has never accommodated that. But some people love that stuff.

378
00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:35.560
And my only point is that if there,

379
00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:40.620
if there are these like fixed poles in our ear between continents and

380
00:24:41.021 --> 00:24:41.471
dissonance,

381
00:24:41.471 --> 00:24:46.150
which is how we started this whole thing and now we end up learning that our

382
00:24:46.151 --> 00:24:49.690
brains can override that to such an astonishing degree.

383
00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:55.240
Well then culture wins, culture beats bile. The two,

384
00:24:55.241 --> 00:24:59.560
but to me it's sad. Sad for the artist. It's not sad for us.

385
00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:01.860
<v 7>Hmm. [inaudible]</v>

386
00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:07.750
<v 1>it's sorta like the artists and the brains are that kind of eternal struggle.</v>

387
00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:09.363
