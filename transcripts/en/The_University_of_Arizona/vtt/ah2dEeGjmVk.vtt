00:00:01.744 --> 00:00:04.250
 We work at an
organization that

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.480
allows us to have a great impact
to give back to our community.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.540
So it's a full circle of giving
where the more we give back

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.500
to our community, the
more our community's

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.990
going to give back to us.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.930
My name is Renee Williams.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.090
I'm a senior accountant in the
financial services department

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.400
in the non-operating funds.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.610
When I first started and
I became an ambassador,

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.710
one of the things that
inspired me the most is I

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.440
went to a silent auction
that the sponsor project

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.630
and contracting services
team had put on.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.940
It really inspired me
to want to do more.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.750
Some of the events that we did
this year were three campus

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.580
pantry food drives.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.990
We did a pledger cup, which
is where we really educated

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.920
the employees about what it
means to pledge your payroll

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.000
deductions.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.210
We did a sock drive for the
United Way Days of Caring.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.200
Pax hosted a pizza party as
well as a bagel and donut sale

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.577
during their last auction.

00:00:58.577 --> 00:01:00.410
Everyone at some point
in time in their life

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.650
has either gone through a
hardship or has had a hardship,

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.470
and so I think it's important
that we come together

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.477
as a community and we
really help one another out.

00:01:09.477 --> 00:01:11.060
If you're looking
to organize an event

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.768
and you don't really
know where to start,

00:01:12.768 --> 00:01:14.990
I would recommend speaking
with Karla Morales, who

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.580
is the UA Cares coordinator.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.360
She helps departments
get started,

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.280
and she has a great
source of knowledge.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.091
Next year, we're hoping
to have a lot of fun.

00:01:25.091 --> 00:01:26.465
I don't know what
that means yet,

00:01:26.465 --> 00:01:28.350
but we're hoping to
have a lot of fun.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.670
We're open suggestions, so if
anybody has any great ideas,

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.210
we would love to hear from you.
