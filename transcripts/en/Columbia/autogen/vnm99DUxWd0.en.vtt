science any mechanics in the course any
 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.440
science any mechanics in the course any
any time you have a question even during

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450
any time you have a question even during
 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.480
any time you have a question even during
the time I'm talking you're welcome to

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490
the time I'm talking you're welcome to
 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.919
the time I'm talking you're welcome to
ask it I don't mind okay don't have to

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929
ask it I don't mind okay don't have to
 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:28.759
ask it I don't mind okay don't have to
wait till later yes yes sorry right what

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769
wait till later yes yes sorry right what
 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.010
wait till later yes yes sorry right what
do I recommend doing so the format of

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020
do I recommend doing so the format of
 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.889
do I recommend doing so the format of
the test will be short answers I'll put

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899
the test will be short answers I'll put
 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.410
the test will be short answers I'll put
up last year's test so you can see the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420
up last year's test so you can see the
 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.530
up last year's test so you can see the
format it'll be different will I'll give

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540
format it'll be different will I'll give
 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.420
format it'll be different will I'll give
you some study questions beforehand it

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430
you some study questions beforehand it
 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.299
you some study questions beforehand it
will cover what's in the lectures

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309
will cover what's in the lectures
 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.830
will cover what's in the lectures
nothing outside of the lectures I want

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840
nothing outside of the lectures I want
 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.970
nothing outside of the lectures I want
to ask you anything that's in the book

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980
to ask you anything that's in the book
 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.500
to ask you anything that's in the book
that I haven't covered for example

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510
that I haven't covered for example
 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.229
that I haven't covered for example
alright and I try to emphasize on the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239
alright and I try to emphasize on the
 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.600
alright and I try to emphasize on the
quizzes every week what I think are the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610
quizzes every week what I think are the
 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.760
quizzes every week what I think are the
important points so those will be the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770
important points so those will be the
 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.520
important points so those will be the
focus of the exam among other things as

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530
focus of the exam among other things as
 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.290
focus of the exam among other things as
well so I think if you just concentrate

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300
well so I think if you just concentrate
 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.570
well so I think if you just concentrate
on what we do here if you can listen to

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580
on what we do here if you can listen to
 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.520
on what we do here if you can listen to
the lecture a few times it really helps

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530
the lecture a few times it really helps
 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.070
the lecture a few times it really helps
to reinforce it because once is often

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080
to reinforce it because once is often
 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.280
to reinforce it because once is often
not sufficient but you'll know what I

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290
not sufficient but you'll know what I
 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.929
not sufficient but you'll know what I
want you to learn like today we have

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939
want you to learn like today we have
 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.270
want you to learn like today we have
some slides which show exactly what I

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280
some slides which show exactly what I
 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.780
some slides which show exactly what I
want you to get away from this ok

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790
want you to get away from this ok
 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:26.060
want you to get away from this ok
anything else yes it depends when I put

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070
anything else yes it depends when I put
 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.980
anything else yes it depends when I put
them up so I didn't put the ones up till

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990
them up so I didn't put the ones up till
 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.630
them up so I didn't put the ones up till
last night so there you get a week each

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640
last night so there you get a week each
 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.490
last night so there you get a week each
time basically it's a week yeah and if

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500
time basically it's a week yeah and if
 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.749
time basically it's a week yeah and if
you don't make it for whatever reason

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759
you don't make it for whatever reason
 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.490
you don't make it for whatever reason
just tell me and I'll open them up again

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500
just tell me and I'll open them up again
 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:44.030
just tell me and I'll open them up again
okay

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040
 
 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.290
 
anything else it's really my goal in

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300
anything else it's really my goal in
 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.990
anything else it's really my goal in
this course is to have you learn biology

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000
this course is to have you learn biology
 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.520
this course is to have you learn biology
okay I think that's the most important

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530
okay I think that's the most important
 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.110
okay I think that's the most important
thing I unfortunately have to give you a

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120
thing I unfortunately have to give you a
 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.390
thing I unfortunately have to give you a
grade so I have to figure out a way to

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400
grade so I have to figure out a way to
 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.850
grade so I have to figure out a way to
do that but I want you to enjoy it and

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860
do that but I want you to enjoy it and
 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.770
do that but I want you to enjoy it and
get the most out of it just the good

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780
get the most out of it just the good
 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.270
get the most out of it just the good
thing is when the course is over it'll

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280
thing is when the course is over it'll
 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:16.170
thing is when the course is over it'll
be warm right yes I think when you start

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180
be warm right yes I think when you start
 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.670
be warm right yes I think when you start
it there's a little red number in the

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680
it there's a little red number in the
 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.770
it there's a little red number in the
upper left that says you have until so I

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780
upper left that says you have until so I
 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.630
upper left that says you have until so I
just started taking one and it said yeah

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640
just started taking one and it said yeah
 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.220
just started taking one and it said yeah
I have till 6 p.m. so I give you a

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230
I have till 6 p.m. so I give you a
 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.530
I have till 6 p.m. so I give you a
couple of hours if you can't finish it

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540
couple of hours if you can't finish it
 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.460
couple of hours if you can't finish it
every two days because there's only

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470
every two days because there's only
 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.320
every two days because there's only
three questions so it's not a probably

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330
three questions so it's not a probably
 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.840
three questions so it's not a probably
know then each one will be two lectures

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850
know then each one will be two lectures
 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.310
know then each one will be two lectures
so it's not going to be any more than

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320
so it's not going to be any more than
 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.290
so it's not going to be any more than
six or seven questions so you have

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300
six or seven questions so you have
 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.150
six or seven questions so you have
plenty of time to do it but if you have

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160
plenty of time to do it but if you have
 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.640
plenty of time to do it but if you have
a problem you know and you want to redo

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650
a problem you know and you want to redo
 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.380
a problem you know and you want to redo
it just tell me because I want you to

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390
it just tell me because I want you to
 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.750
it just tell me because I want you to
use it as a learning tool okay all right

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760
use it as a learning tool okay all right
 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.130
use it as a learning tool okay all right
today we're going to start talking about

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140
today we're going to start talking about
 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.140
today we're going to start talking about
viral genomes you know what genomes are

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150
viral genomes you know what genomes are
 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.180
viral genomes you know what genomes are
of course the genetic material we're

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190
of course the genetic material we're
 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.410
of course the genetic material we're
going to talk about the different kinds

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420
going to talk about the different kinds
 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.180
going to talk about the different kinds
of structures there are and viruses and

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190
of structures there are and viruses and
 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.340
of structures there are and viruses and
then we'll talk about genetics how

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350
then we'll talk about genetics how
 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.740
then we'll talk about genetics how
experimentally we can manipulate these

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750
experimentally we can manipulate these
 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.009
experimentally we can manipulate these
genomes to do various things to

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019
genomes to do various things to
 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.470
genomes to do various things to
understand viruses to prevent infections

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480
understand viruses to prevent infections
 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.040
understand viruses to prevent infections
and to prevent other diseases as well

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050
and to prevent other diseases as well
 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.570
and to prevent other diseases as well
again remember we talked last time in

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580
again remember we talked last time in
 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.460
again remember we talked last time in
the 1950s there was a breakthrough in

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470
the 1950s there was a breakthrough in
 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.120
the 1950s there was a breakthrough in
virology

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130
virology
 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.400
virology
where it was found that the nucleic acid

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410
where it was found that the nucleic acid
 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.949
where it was found that the nucleic acid
genome carries the information needed to

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959
genome carries the information needed to
 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.199
genome carries the information needed to
make new virus particles so it's the

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209
make new virus particles so it's the
 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.960
make new virus particles so it's the
genetic code and that was previously

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970
genetic code and that was previously
 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.120
genetic code and that was previously
figured out for DNA and bacteria in the

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130
figured out for DNA and bacteria in the
 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.479
figured out for DNA and bacteria in the
40s but viruses were perceived as

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489
40s but viruses were perceived as
 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.250
40s but viruses were perceived as
different and it wasn't until the 50s

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260
different and it wasn't until the 50s
 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.890
different and it wasn't until the 50s
that this was sorted out so this is very

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900
that this was sorted out so this is very
 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.470
that this was sorted out so this is very
obvious to us now right nucleic acid is

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480
obvious to us now right nucleic acid is
 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.960
obvious to us now right nucleic acid is
the genetic information but back then it

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970
the genetic information but back then it
 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.759
the genetic information but back then it
was a debate very interesting things

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769
was a debate very interesting things
 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.100
was a debate very interesting things
change and the experiment we talked

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110
change and the experiment we talked
 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.060
change and the experiment we talked
about the other day the hershey-chase

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070
about the other day the hershey-chase
 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.610
about the other day the hershey-chase
experiment with bacteriophage t4 which

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620
experiment with bacteriophage t4 which
 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.370
experiment with bacteriophage t4 which
is this one right here was an important

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380
is this one right here was an important
 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.370
is this one right here was an important
part of that conclusion that the nucleic

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380
part of that conclusion that the nucleic
 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.820
part of that conclusion that the nucleic
acid is the genome but also work with

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830
acid is the genome but also work with
 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.020
acid is the genome but also work with
tobacco mosaic virus

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030
tobacco mosaic virus
 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.840
tobacco mosaic virus
which we'll talk about in another

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:58.860
information better than another so is
double stranded DNA better than

00:07:58.860 --> 00:07:58.870
double stranded DNA better than
 

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:03.180
double stranded DNA better than
single-stranded RNA maybe for you the

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:03.190
single-stranded RNA maybe for you the
 

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:04.560
single-stranded RNA maybe for you the
most important thing is do we have to

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:04.570
most important thing is do we have to
 

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.290
most important thing is do we have to
memorize all of this you don't actually

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:07.300
memorize all of this you don't actually
 

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.380
memorize all of this you don't actually
have to because after you understand if

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:10.390
have to because after you understand if
 

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:12.210
have to because after you understand if
you start at 7 different genome types it

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:12.220
you start at 7 different genome types it
 

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.000
you start at 7 different genome types it
will all come from that and so you don't

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:15.010
will all come from that and so you don't
 

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.190
will all come from that and so you don't
really have to memorize it but I will

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:17.200
really have to memorize it but I will
 

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.900
really have to memorize it but I will
ask you how many different genome types

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:18.910
ask you how many different genome types
 

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:21.570
ask you how many different genome types
there are some of these questions are

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:21.580
there are some of these questions are
 

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:22.050
there are some of these questions are
hard to

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:22.060
hard to
 

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.810
hard to
answer why is a given structure in a

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:24.820
answer why is a given structure in a
 

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.690
answer why is a given structure in a
genome used well sometimes that reflects

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:27.700
genome used well sometimes that reflects
 

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.120
genome used well sometimes that reflects
how the genome is packaged how it's

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:30.130
how the genome is packaged how it's
 

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:32.279
how the genome is packaged how it's
expressed and we'll give some examples

00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:32.289
expressed and we'll give some examples
 

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:33.779
expressed and we'll give some examples
of that in the course so a certain

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:33.789
of that in the course so a certain
 

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:35.640
of that in the course so a certain
structure in a genome may be important

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:35.650
structure in a genome may be important
 

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:37.350
structure in a genome may be important
for the replication cycle and that's why

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:37.360
for the replication cycle and that's why
 

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.550
for the replication cycle and that's why
it's present but we often don't know why

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560
it's present but we often don't know why
 

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.260
it's present but we often don't know why
things are there why are there still

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:43.270
things are there why are there still
 

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.690

all at once for many viruses they happen
 

00:10:49.209 --> 00:10:50.759
all at once for many viruses they happen
in a very orderly fashion and that's

00:10:50.759 --> 00:10:50.769
in a very orderly fashion and that's
 

00:10:50.769 --> 00:10:53.369
in a very orderly fashion and that's
encoded in the genome as well there are

00:10:53.369 --> 00:10:53.379
encoded in the genome as well there are

couldn't overcome host defenses we have
 

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:03.389
couldn't overcome host defenses we have
great host defenses and there are a lot

00:11:03.389 --> 00:11:03.399
great host defenses and there are a lot
 

00:11:03.399 --> 00:11:07.290
great host defenses and there are a lot
of proteins that have this job and

proteins that allows the viruses to
 

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:14.429
proteins that allows the viruses to
spread to other cells and hosts so all

00:11:14.429 --> 00:11:14.439
spread to other cells and hosts so all
 

00:11:14.439 --> 00:11:16.889
spread to other cells and hosts so all
these things are encoded in the genome

00:11:16.889 --> 00:11:16.899
these things are encoded in the genome
 

00:11:16.899 --> 00:11:18.540
these things are encoded in the genome
but there are also things that are not

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:18.550
but there are also things that are not
 

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:20.429
but there are also things that are not
encoded in genomes and looking at those

00:11:20.429 --> 00:11:20.439
encoded in genomes and looking at those
 

00:11:20.439 --> 00:11:23.780
encoded in genomes and looking at those
can be instructive as well for example

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:23.790
can be instructive as well for example
 

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:27.300
can be instructive as well for example
no virus has a complete protein

and showed how they led to mRNA so mRNA

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:20.050
and showed how they led to mRNA so mRNA
 

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:21.810

is central you have to make mRNA because

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:21.820
is central you have to make mRNA because
 

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.670
is central you have to make mRNA because
you have to make protein as far as we

you have to make protein as far as we
know the only way to make protein is

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:25.870
know the only way to make protein is
 

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:29.160
know the only way to make protein is
through a translation of mRNA so these

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:29.170
through a translation of mRNA so these
 

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.019
through a translation of mRNA so these
are the seven genome types and as I said

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:31.029

this is a very good scheme to understand
 

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.110
this is a very good scheme to understand
and perhaps even commit to memory

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:48.120
and perhaps even commit to memory
 

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.490

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.150
facts you can deduce the pathway from
any genome type to mRNA the key here is

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:28.160
any genome type to mRNA the key here is
 

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.280
any genome type to mRNA the key here is
that each pathway whether we're starting

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:30.290
that each pathway whether we're starting
 

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:31.930
that each pathway whether we're starting
from double-stranded DNA or

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:31.940
from double-stranded DNA or
 

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.880
from double-stranded DNA or
single-stranded RNA has its own

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:33.890
single-stranded RNA has its own
 

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.970
single-stranded RNA has its own
polymerase the nucleic acid enzyme that

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:36.980
polymerase the nucleic acid enzyme that
 

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:39.040
polymerase the nucleic acid enzyme that
copies the nucleic acid has a primer

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:39.050
copies the nucleic acid has a primer
 

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:41.440
copies the nucleic acid has a primer
that has a template and termination

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:41.450
that has a template and termination
 

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:45.070
that has a template and termination
requirements so each pathway again from

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:45.080
requirements so each pathway again from
 

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.660
requirements so each pathway again from
those seven different nucleic acids have

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:46.670
those seven different nucleic acids have
 

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:48.640
those seven different nucleic acids have
unique combinations of these things and

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:48.650
unique combinations of these things and
 

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:50.800
unique combinations of these things and
you can deduce those really once you

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:50.810
you can deduce those really once you
 

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:55.900
you can deduce those really once you
know the rules each virus family sticks

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:55.910
know the rules each virus family sticks
 

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.630
know the rules each virus family sticks
to one strategy so a virus family is

00:15:58.630 --> 00:15:58.640
to one strategy so a virus family is
 

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.750
to one strategy so a virus family is
made in part the classification is done

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:01.760
made in part the classification is done
 

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.360
made in part the classification is done
according to the nucleic acid so the

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:04.370
according to the nucleic acid so the
 

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:07.090
according to the nucleic acid so the
picornavirus family for example all have

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:07.100
picornavirus family for example all have
 

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.820
picornavirus family for example all have
plus stranded RNA genomes so they will

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:09.830
plus stranded RNA genomes so they will
 

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:11.980
plus stranded RNA genomes so they will
all follow the same strategy from their

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:11.990
all follow the same strategy from their
 

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:14.440
all follow the same strategy from their
genome to making mRNA so you don't have

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:14.450
genome to making mRNA so you don't have
 

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:16.000
genome to making mRNA so you don't have
to worry that within a family you're

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:16.010
to worry that within a family you're
 

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:18.040
to worry that within a family you're
going to have to understand different

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:18.050
going to have to understand different
 

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:20.800
going to have to understand different
strategies we will typically say okay an

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:20.810
strategies we will typically say okay an
 

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:22.269
strategies we will typically say okay an
example of a popcorn of viruses

00:16:22.269 --> 00:16:22.279
example of a popcorn of viruses
 

00:16:22.279 --> 00:16:23.530
example of a popcorn of viruses
poliovirus and we're going to teach you

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:23.540
poliovirus and we're going to teach you
 

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:27.310
poliovirus and we're going to teach you
how this virus replicates in a cell and

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:27.320
how this virus replicates in a cell and
 

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.949
how this virus replicates in a cell and
that will apply pretty much to all the

00:16:29.949 --> 00:16:29.959
that will apply pretty much to all the
 

00:16:29.959 --> 00:16:33.460
that will apply pretty much to all the
other viruses in the family now this is

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:33.470
other viruses in the family now this is
 

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:35.440
other viruses in the family now this is
a particularly nice figure that I found

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:35.450
a particularly nice figure that I found
 

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.990
a particularly nice figure that I found
which shows these seven classes of

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.000
which shows these seven classes of
 

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.120
which shows these seven classes of
genome and it shows how they replicate

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:40.130
genome and it shows how they replicate
 

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:43.150
genome and it shows how they replicate
so here are three different kinds of

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:43.160
so here are three different kinds of
 

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.380
so here are three different kinds of
viruses aren't viruses with RNA genomes

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:46.390
viruses aren't viruses with RNA genomes
 

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:48.940
viruses aren't viruses with RNA genomes
viruses that reverse transcribed their

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:48.950
viruses that reverse transcribed their
 

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:50.440
viruses that reverse transcribed their
RNA that means they take the RNA and

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:50.450
RNA that means they take the RNA and
 

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.930
RNA that means they take the RNA and
make a DNA copy and then there are the

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:52.940
make a DNA copy and then there are the
 

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:56.470
make a DNA copy and then there are the
viruses that have DNA genomes and the

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480
viruses that have DNA genomes and the
 

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.300
viruses that have DNA genomes and the
RNA viruses here genome replication

00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:58.310
RNA viruses here genome replication
 

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:00.610
RNA viruses here genome replication
cycle this is a nice cartoon that shows

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:00.620
cycle this is a nice cartoon that shows
 

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.290
cycle this is a nice cartoon that shows
you that all you have to do here is go

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:02.300
you that all you have to do here is go
 

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:05.169
you that all you have to do here is go
from RNA to RNA so the virus RNA comes

00:17:05.169 --> 00:17:05.179
from RNA to RNA so the virus RNA comes
 

00:17:05.179 --> 00:17:07.120
from RNA to RNA so the virus RNA comes
in the cell has to make more RNA and

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:07.130
in the cell has to make more RNA and
 

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:11.199
in the cell has to make more RNA and
more RNA etc quite simple the contents

00:17:11.199 --> 00:17:11.209
more RNA etc quite simple the contents
 

00:17:11.209 --> 00:17:13.059
more RNA etc quite simple the contents
of the virions the RNA viruses can be

00:17:13.059 --> 00:17:13.069
of the virions the RNA viruses can be
 

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:15.699
of the virions the RNA viruses can be
plus or minus single-stranded RNA or

00:17:15.699 --> 00:17:15.709
plus or minus single-stranded RNA or
 

00:17:15.709 --> 00:17:18.010
plus or minus single-stranded RNA or
double-stranded RNA so that breaks it

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:18.020
double-stranded RNA so that breaks it
 

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:19.659
double-stranded RNA so that breaks it
down makes it very simple and then at

00:17:19.659 --> 00:17:19.669
down makes it very simple and then at
 

00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:21.279
down makes it very simple and then at
the bottom there are some examples of

00:17:21.279 --> 00:17:21.289
the bottom there are some examples of
 

00:17:21.289 --> 00:17:23.230
the bottom there are some examples of
the kinds of viruses that fall in here

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:23.240
the kinds of viruses that fall in here
 

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.389
the kinds of viruses that fall in here
all right then we have our reverse

00:17:25.389 --> 00:17:25.399
all right then we have our reverse
 

00:17:25.399 --> 00:17:27.730
all right then we have our reverse
transcribing viruses these are viruses

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:27.740
transcribing viruses these are viruses
 

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:30.639
transcribing viruses these are viruses
with an RNA genome or some cases a DNA

00:17:30.639 --> 00:17:30.649
with an RNA genome or some cases a DNA
 

00:17:30.649 --> 00:17:32.710
with an RNA genome or some cases a DNA
genome and they go back and forth from

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720
genome and they go back and forth from
 

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.870
genome and they go back and forth from
one to the other but again within a

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:34.880
one to the other but again within a
 

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.399
one to the other but again within a
virus family it only goes in one

00:17:36.399 --> 00:17:36.409
virus family it only goes in one
 

00:17:36.409 --> 00:17:38.440
virus family it only goes in one
direction so the retroviruses have an

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:38.450
direction so the retroviruses have an
 

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:40.810
direction so the retroviruses have an
RNA genome they make DNA out of it

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:40.820
RNA genome they make DNA out of it
 

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.510
RNA genome they make DNA out of it
the kepada of irises have a DNA genome

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520
the kepada of irises have a DNA genome
 

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:46.690
the kepada of irises have a DNA genome
they make RNA and then DNA using reverse

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:46.700
they make RNA and then DNA using reverse
 

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:49.210
they make RNA and then DNA using reverse
transcriptase okay so the reverse

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:49.220
transcriptase okay so the reverse
 

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:51.070
transcriptase okay so the reverse
transcribing viruses simply means you go

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:51.080
transcribing viruses simply means you go
 

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.350
transcribing viruses simply means you go
back and forth between RNA and DNA and

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360
back and forth between RNA and DNA and
 

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.960
back and forth between RNA and DNA and
the these are two examples or retro

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:55.970
the these are two examples or retro
 

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:58.419
the these are two examples or retro
viruses like HIV and the hepatitis B

00:17:58.419 --> 00:17:58.429
viruses like HIV and the hepatitis B
 

00:17:58.429 --> 00:18:00.370
viruses like HIV and the hepatitis B
virus they have different genomes in the

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:00.380
virus they have different genomes in the
 

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.289
virus they have different genomes in the
in the virion the retroviruses have an

in the virion the retroviruses have an
 

00:18:02.299 --> 00:18:05.260
in the virion the retroviruses have an
RNA genome that's plus stranded now you

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:05.270
RNA genome that's plus stranded now you
 

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:07.060
RNA genome that's plus stranded now you
may say why aren't these the same as

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:07.070
may say why aren't these the same as
 

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:10.750
may say why aren't these the same as
these plus stranded RNAs well because

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:10.760
these plus stranded RNAs well because
 

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.669
these plus stranded RNAs well because
these have a reverse transcriptase and

00:18:12.669 --> 00:18:12.679
these have a reverse transcriptase and
 

00:18:12.679 --> 00:18:14.169
these have a reverse transcriptase and
they have a DNA phase in their life

00:18:14.169 --> 00:18:14.179
they have a DNA phase in their life
 

00:18:14.179 --> 00:18:17.799
they have a DNA phase in their life
cycle these viruses do not and finally

00:18:17.799 --> 00:18:17.809
cycle these viruses do not and finally
 

00:18:17.809 --> 00:18:20.500
cycle these viruses do not and finally
we have DNA viruses that simply go from

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:20.510
we have DNA viruses that simply go from
 

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:22.690
we have DNA viruses that simply go from
DNA to DNA to replicate their genomes

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:22.700
DNA to DNA to replicate their genomes
 

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:25.510
DNA to DNA to replicate their genomes
and these can be in the virion

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:25.520
and these can be in the virion
 

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.850
and these can be in the virion
either single-stranded DNA where

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:27.860
either single-stranded DNA where
 

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.919
either single-stranded DNA where
double-stranded DNA they can be circular

00:18:29.919 --> 00:18:29.929
double-stranded DNA they can be circular
 

00:18:29.929 --> 00:18:32.320
double-stranded DNA they can be circular
or linear so I find this useful to

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:32.330
or linear so I find this useful to
 

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:34.720
or linear so I find this useful to
summarize this with some examples that

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:34.730
summarize this with some examples that
 

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:37.870
summarize this with some examples that
goes beyond the Baltimore table so I

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:37.880
goes beyond the Baltimore table so I
 

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.639
goes beyond the Baltimore table so I
think you ought to memorize the seven

00:18:39.639 --> 00:18:39.649
think you ought to memorize the seven
 

00:18:39.649 --> 00:18:41.529
think you ought to memorize the seven
genome types but you can already do it

00:18:41.529 --> 00:18:41.539
genome types but you can already do it
 

00:18:41.539 --> 00:18:43.060
genome types but you can already do it
almost because if you just think of

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:43.070
almost because if you just think of
 

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:45.399
almost because if you just think of
every possible configuration of nucleic

00:18:45.399 --> 00:18:45.409
every possible configuration of nucleic
 

00:18:45.409 --> 00:18:48.130
every possible configuration of nucleic
acid you already have it done and that

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:48.140
acid you already have it done and that
 

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:50.380
acid you already have it done and that
will help you understand how the genomes

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:50.390
will help you understand how the genomes
 

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:53.230
will help you understand how the genomes
are expressed so don't wait till the

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:53.240
are expressed so don't wait till the
 

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.669

night before the first exam you should

00:18:54.669 --> 00:18:54.679
night before the first exam you should
 

00:18:54.679 --> 00:18:56.680
night before the first exam you should
start now you should start thinking what

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:56.690
start now you should start thinking what
 

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:58.389
start now you should start thinking what
are the seven types can I remember them

00:18:58.389 --> 00:18:58.399
are the seven types can I remember them
 

00:18:58.399 --> 00:19:00.340
are the seven types can I remember them
because if you know the structure you

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:00.350
because if you know the structure you
 

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:03.490
because if you know the structure you
can deduce how mRNA is made and how the

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:03.500
can deduce how mRNA is made and how the
 

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.740
can deduce how mRNA is made and how the
genome is copied to make more genomes

on the host for replication this is a

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080
on the host for replication this is a
 

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.810
on the host for replication this is a
key point that we'll be talking about a

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:43.820
key point that we'll be talking about a
 

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.450

three following each of the seven genome
 

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.640
three following each of the seven genome
strategies and this is an example of one

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:57.650
strategies and this is an example of one
 

00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:01.210
strategies and this is an example of one
of those figures so at the top of this

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:01.220
of those figures so at the top of this
 

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.310
of those figures so at the top of this
figure you have single stranded DNA

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:03.320
figure you have single stranded DNA
 

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.830
figure you have single stranded DNA
genomes so that's one of the seven

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:05.840
genomes so that's one of the seven
 

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.140
genomes so that's one of the seven
Baltimore classes has a little picture

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:08.150
Baltimore classes has a little picture
 

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:10.390
Baltimore classes has a little picture
of the single-stranded DNA two examples

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:10.400
of the single-stranded DNA two examples
 

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.270
of the single-stranded DNA two examples
of families of viruses that would have

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:13.280
of families of viruses that would have
 

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.520
of families of viruses that would have
this kind of genome and you can tell

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:15.530
this kind of genome and you can tell
 

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:17.950
this kind of genome and you can tell
that a word is a family name because it

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:17.960
that a word is a family name because it
 

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:21.790
that a word is a family name because it
has a e at the end CR Co viridi and

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:21.800
has a e at the end CR Co viridi and
 

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.430
has a e at the end CR Co viridi and
parvathi Rd and then at the top here it

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:24.440
parvathi Rd and then at the top here it
 

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:27.760
parvathi Rd and then at the top here it
has the strategy by which the genome is

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:27.770
has the strategy by which the genome is
 

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:30.190
has the strategy by which the genome is
not only made into mRNA but is also made

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:30.200
not only made into mRNA but is also made
 

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.700
not only made into mRNA but is also made
into new viruses so here these single

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:33.710
into new viruses so here these single
 

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:36.340
into new viruses so here these single
stranded DNA genomes they can be

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:36.350
stranded DNA genomes they can be
 

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:38.700
stranded DNA genomes they can be
actually either minus or plus stranded

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:38.710
actually either minus or plus stranded
 

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:41.350
actually either minus or plus stranded
they're copied to double-stranded DNA

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360
they're copied to double-stranded DNA
 

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:44.770
they're copied to double-stranded DNA
now you ask you may ask why would you

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:44.780
now you ask you may ask why would you
 

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.260
now you ask you may ask why would you
automatically assume that you have to go

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:47.270
automatically assume that you have to go
 

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:49.270
automatically assume that you have to go
from a single to a double stranded DNA

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:49.280
from a single to a double stranded DNA
 

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.670
from a single to a double stranded DNA
genome well you have to know one fact

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:51.680
genome well you have to know one fact
 

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.040
genome well you have to know one fact
and that is you cannot make mRNA from

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:54.050
and that is you cannot make mRNA from
 

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:57.070
and that is you cannot make mRNA from
single stranded DNA so if you know that

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:57.080
single stranded DNA so if you know that
 

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.140
single stranded DNA so if you know that
you'll be able to figure out when you

00:20:59.140 --> 00:20:59.150
you'll be able to figure out when you
 

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:01.030
you'll be able to figure out when you
see a single stranded DNA genome that

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:01.040
see a single stranded DNA genome that
 

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.770
see a single stranded DNA genome that
the first step that has to happen is it

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:02.780
the first step that has to happen is it
 

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.350
the first step that has to happen is it
has to be converted to double strand so

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360
has to be converted to double strand so
 

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.180
has to be converted to double strand so
that's what happens you make double

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:07.190
that's what happens you make double
 

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:08.910
that's what happens you make double
stranded DNA which can be then

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:08.920
stranded DNA which can be then
 

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.460
stranded DNA which can be then
transcribed to our mRNA

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:11.470
transcribed to our mRNA
 

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:13.540
transcribed to our mRNA
it's there that can be made into

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:13.550
it's there that can be made into
 

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:15.910
it's there that can be made into
proteins then the genome has to

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:15.920
proteins then the genome has to
 

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.160
proteins then the genome has to
replicate you know that we came in with

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:18.170
replicate you know that we came in with
 

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:20.140
replicate you know that we came in with
single stranded DNA so we have to make

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:20.150
single stranded DNA so we have to make
 

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:22.150
single stranded DNA so we have to make
more of that to put into new virion so

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:22.160
more of that to put into new virion so
 

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.340
more of that to put into new virion so
the genome is replicated to plus and

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:24.350
the genome is replicated to plus and
 

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:26.950
the genome is replicated to plus and
minus strands and then it's packaged

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:26.960
minus strands and then it's packaged
 

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:27.880
minus strands and then it's packaged
into capsids

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:27.890
into capsids
 

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:30.100
into capsids
so that's all embodied in this one

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:30.110
so that's all embodied in this one
 

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:32.050
so that's all embodied in this one
figure at the top and then on the bottom

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:32.060
figure at the top and then on the bottom
 

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:34.750
figure at the top and then on the bottom
are two examples of the genomes that

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:34.760
are two examples of the genomes that
 

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.150
are two examples of the genomes that
we've shown up here the Sirico viridi or

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:37.160
we've shown up here the Sirico viridi or
 

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.220
we've shown up here the Sirico viridi or
single-stranded circles it tells you the

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:39.230
single-stranded circles it tells you the
 

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.530
single-stranded circles it tells you the
size but I don't expect you to memorize

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:41.540
size but I don't expect you to memorize
 

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:42.790
size but I don't expect you to memorize
genome sizes

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:42.800
genome sizes
 

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.490
genome sizes
I just want to give you a sense for how

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:45.500
I just want to give you a sense for how
 

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.500
I just want to give you a sense for how
much it varies so circular

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:47.510
much it varies so circular
 

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:49.480
much it varies so circular
single-stranded DNA degree of dependence

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:49.490
single-stranded DNA degree of dependence
 

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:51.490
single-stranded DNA degree of dependence
on the host how did the gene expression

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:51.500
on the host how did the gene expression
 

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:54.130
on the host how did the gene expression
works and some other features which

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:54.140
works and some other features which
 

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:56.110
works and some other features which
might be of interest and unless I point

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:56.120
might be of interest and unless I point
 

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.490
might be of interest and unless I point
these out in lecture you won't need to

00:21:57.490 --> 00:21:57.500
these out in lecture you won't need to
 

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.110
these out in lecture you won't need to
know those and here's another kind of

00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120
know those and here's another kind of
 

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.990
know those and here's another kind of
virus with a linear single-stranded

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:02.000
virus with a linear single-stranded
 

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.520
virus with a linear single-stranded
genome with interesting structures at

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:03.530
genome with interesting structures at
 

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:05.320
genome with interesting structures at
the end and we'll talk about how those

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:05.330
the end and we'll talk about how those
 

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:07.210
the end and we'll talk about how those
work so this is in the chapter for all

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:07.220
work so this is in the chapter for all
 

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:09.910
work so this is in the chapter for all
seven genome types so I would have a

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:09.920
seven genome types so I would have a
 

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.680
seven genome types so I would have a
look at that and I think if you just

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:11.690
look at that and I think if you just
 

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:13.420
look at that and I think if you just
start with the seven genome types

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:13.430
start with the seven genome types
 

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:15.250
start with the seven genome types
memorized you'll be able to deduce

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:15.260
memorized you'll be able to deduce
 

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:18.070
memorized you'll be able to deduce
everything else from it so here are the

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080
everything else from it so here are the
 

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.840
everything else from it so here are the
seven classes I just want to go through

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:19.850
seven classes I just want to go through
 

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:22.120
seven classes I just want to go through
them one by one and talk about how they

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:22.130
them one by one and talk about how they
 

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:24.870
them one by one and talk about how they
work the double stranded DNA gapped

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880
work the double stranded DNA gapped
 

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.520
work the double stranded DNA gapped
double-stranded so you can put them into

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:27.530
double-stranded so you can put them into
 

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:29.850
double-stranded so you can put them into
two columns we have our DNA and RNA and

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:29.860
two columns we have our DNA and RNA and
 

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:32.740
two columns we have our DNA and RNA and
single-stranded DNA genomes and then we

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:32.750
single-stranded DNA genomes and then we
 

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:34.810
single-stranded DNA genomes and then we
have RNA genomes double stranded RNA

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:34.820
have RNA genomes double stranded RNA
 

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:37.090
have RNA genomes double stranded RNA
single strands of plus or minus polarity

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:37.100
single strands of plus or minus polarity
 

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:40.180
single strands of plus or minus polarity
and then our plus RNA viruses that go

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:40.190
and then our plus RNA viruses that go
 

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:41.590
and then our plus RNA viruses that go
through a DNA intermediate the

through a DNA intermediate the
 

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.500
through a DNA intermediate the
retroviruses okay that's where the name

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:44.510
retroviruses okay that's where the name
 

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:46.510
retroviruses okay that's where the name
comes from retro because they go from

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:46.520
comes from retro because they go from
 

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:49.510
comes from retro because they go from
RNA to DNA whereas for many years we

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:49.520
RNA to DNA whereas for many years we
 

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.860
RNA to DNA whereas for many years we
always thought the flow of genetic

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:50.870
always thought the flow of genetic
 

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:53.160
always thought the flow of genetic
information was DNA to RNA to protein

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:53.170
information was DNA to RNA to protein
 

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:58.840
information was DNA to RNA to protein
but this was the wrong way what's not

00:22:58.840 --> 00:22:58.850
but this was the wrong way what's not
 

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:02.320
but this was the wrong way what's not
the wrong way it was discovered my

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:02.330
the wrong way it was discovered my
 

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:04.000
the wrong way it was discovered my
expectation when you are done with this

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:04.010
expectation when you are done with this
 

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:06.220
expectation when you are done with this
course you will know the general answers

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:06.230
course you will know the general answers
 

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:08.800
course you will know the general answers
to these questions for each genome type

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:08.810
to these questions for each genome type
 

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:11.200
to these questions for each genome type
so this is what I want you to know what

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:11.210
so this is what I want you to know what
 

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:13.150
so this is what I want you to know what
are the steps to mRNA production from

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:13.160
are the steps to mRNA production from
 

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.730
are the steps to mRNA production from
each genome if I say I give you a

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:15.740
each genome if I say I give you a
 

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:18.010
each genome if I say I give you a
single-stranded DNA genome how do you

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:18.020
single-stranded DNA genome how do you
 

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:20.440
single-stranded DNA genome how do you
get to mRNA it's easy you tell me well

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:20.450
get to mRNA it's easy you tell me well
 

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:22.780
get to mRNA it's easy you tell me well
you make a double-stranded DNA copy and

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:22.790
you make a double-stranded DNA copy and
 

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:24.580
you make a double-stranded DNA copy and
then you transcribe that to make mRNA

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:24.590
then you transcribe that to make mRNA
 

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:27.070
then you transcribe that to make mRNA
and depending on the virus you can

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:27.080
and depending on the virus you can
 

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.050
and depending on the virus you can
divide we will either use viral enzymes

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:29.060
divide we will either use viral enzymes
 

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:31.870
divide we will either use viral enzymes
or host cell enzymes so those are the

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:31.880
or host cell enzymes so those are the
 

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.060
or host cell enzymes so those are the
steps what general gene products must

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:34.070
steps what general gene products must
 

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:36.090
steps what general gene products must
function at each step so to make

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:36.100
function at each step so to make
 

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.290
function at each step so to make
single-stranded DNA into double-stranded

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:38.300
single-stranded DNA into double-stranded
 

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:41.650
single-stranded DNA into double-stranded
DNA the host will do that for most of

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:41.660
DNA the host will do that for most of
 

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:44.560
DNA the host will do that for most of
these small viruses and then to make

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:44.570
these small viruses and then to make
 

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:48.400
these small viruses and then to make
mRNA from DNA it depends on the virus

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:48.410
mRNA from DNA it depends on the virus
 

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:50.650
mRNA from DNA it depends on the virus
some viruses we use host enzymes and

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:50.660
some viruses we use host enzymes and
 

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:53.590
some viruses we use host enzymes and
some viruses will use your own when in

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600
some viruses will use your own when in
 

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.960
some viruses will use your own when in
the life cycle is mRNA made so DNA virus

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:56.970
the life cycle is mRNA made so DNA virus
 

00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:59.330
the life cycle is mRNA made so DNA virus
when they first come in there's no mRNA

00:23:59.330 --> 00:23:59.340
when they first come in there's no mRNA
 

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:00.980
when they first come in there's no mRNA
present so they have to make it and they

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:00.990
present so they have to make it and they
 

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:02.870
present so they have to make it and they
can either make it earlier or later

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880
can either make it earlier or later
 

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.090
can either make it earlier or later
other viruses come in RNA viruses

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:05.100
other viruses come in RNA viruses
 

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.460
other viruses come in RNA viruses
they're already mrna so it doesn't have

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:09.900
to be made initially how's the genome
 

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.279
to be made initially how's the genome
copied what kind of enzymes are used

00:24:12.279 --> 00:24:12.289
copied what kind of enzymes are used
 

00:24:12.289 --> 00:24:14.899

what kind of replication proteins again

00:24:14.899 --> 00:24:14.909
what kind of replication proteins again
 

00:24:14.909 --> 00:24:17.060
what kind of replication proteins again
are they viral proteins or host proteins

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:17.070
are they viral proteins or host proteins
 

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:19.840
are they viral proteins or host proteins
and which proteins can produce mRNA and

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:19.850
and which proteins can produce mRNA and
 

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:22.610
and which proteins can produce mRNA and
how is this information converted to

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:22.620
how is this information converted to
 

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:25.010
how is this information converted to
gene products for the most part we have

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:25.020
gene products for the most part we have
 

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:27.529
gene products for the most part we have
a single mRNA that's translated into

00:24:27.529 --> 00:24:27.539
a single mRNA that's translated into
 

00:24:27.539 --> 00:24:29.090
a single mRNA that's translated into
protein but as we'll see in the

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:29.100
protein but as we'll see in the
 

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:30.529

translation lecture there are many

00:24:30.529 --> 00:24:30.539
translation lecture there are many
 

00:24:30.539 --> 00:24:32.990
translation lecture there are many
variations on that that viruses have

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:33.000
variations on that that viruses have
 

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.070
variations on that that viruses have
devised I would also suggest you you

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.080
devised I would also suggest you you
 

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.350
devised I would also suggest you you
look at Appendix A this is full of

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360
look at Appendix A this is full of
 

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.390
look at Appendix A this is full of
figures like this this is a replication

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:41.400
figures like this this is a replication
 

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:45.620

cycle of a hep adenovirus and it shows

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:45.630
cycle of a hep adenovirus and it shows
 

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:47.240
cycle of a hep adenovirus and it shows
you all the steps and you get a very

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:47.250
you all the steps and you get a very
 

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:49.580
you all the steps and you get a very
nice overview of what has to occur so

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:49.590
nice overview of what has to occur so
 

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:51.500
nice overview of what has to occur so
you can see the viral genome coming in

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:51.510
you can see the viral genome coming in
 

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:53.720
you can see the viral genome coming in
and it's getting into the nucleus and

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:53.730
and it's getting into the nucleus and
 

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:55.370
and it's getting into the nucleus and
you'll find out in the lecture that all

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:55.380
you'll find out in the lecture that all
 

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:57.200
you'll find out in the lecture that all
the gaps in this genome are repaired

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:57.210
the gaps in this genome are repaired
 

00:24:57.210 --> 00:25:00.289
the gaps in this genome are repaired
because can you do you think you could

00:25:00.289 --> 00:25:00.299
because can you do you think you could
 

00:25:00.299 --> 00:25:02.890
because can you do you think you could
make mRNA from a gapped DNA

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:02.900
make mRNA from a gapped DNA
 

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:06.169
make mRNA from a gapped DNA
double-stranded DNA just guess no you

00:25:06.169 --> 00:25:06.179
double-stranded DNA just guess no you
 

00:25:06.179 --> 00:25:07.730
double-stranded DNA just guess no you
can't because you can't make it from

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:07.740
can't because you can't make it from
 

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:09.409
can't because you can't make it from
single-stranded DNA template you can't

00:25:09.409 --> 00:25:09.419
single-stranded DNA template you can't
 

00:25:09.419 --> 00:25:10.850
single-stranded DNA template you can't
make it from gap so you have to repair

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:10.860
make it from gap so you have to repair
 

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:12.980
make it from gap so you have to repair
it and then this can be transcribed and

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:12.990
it and then this can be transcribed and
 

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:15.470
it and then this can be transcribed and
translated into proteins so you'll see

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:15.480
translated into proteins so you'll see
 

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.299
translated into proteins so you'll see
here viral life cycles some facts about

00:25:17.299 --> 00:25:17.309
here viral life cycles some facts about
 

00:25:17.309 --> 00:25:19.220
here viral life cycles some facts about
the genome and you can relate the simple

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:19.230
the genome and you can relate the simple
 

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:21.289
the genome and you can relate the simple
strategies to the life cycles in this

00:25:21.289 --> 00:25:21.299
strategies to the life cycles in this
 

00:25:21.299 --> 00:25:22.940
strategies to the life cycles in this
way you can say okay I start with a

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:22.950
way you can say okay I start with a
 

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:24.649
way you can say okay I start with a
single-stranded or double stranded or

00:25:24.649 --> 00:25:24.659
single-stranded or double stranded or
 

00:25:24.659 --> 00:25:26.180
single-stranded or double stranded or
gap gene on what do I have to do it's

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:26.190
gap gene on what do I have to do it's
 

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:27.950
gap gene on what do I have to do it's
all summarized right here I think that

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:27.960
all summarized right here I think that
 

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.980
all summarized right here I think that
helps a lot so let's look at some of

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:30.990
helps a lot so let's look at some of
 

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:33.710
helps a lot so let's look at some of
these genomes one by one the first or

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:33.720
these genomes one by one the first or
 

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.799
these genomes one by one the first or
the are the DNA genomes as you know our

00:25:36.799 --> 00:25:36.809
the are the DNA genomes as you know our
 

00:25:36.809 --> 00:25:38.840
the are the DNA genomes as you know our

said that so many DNA viruses for the

00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:41.940
said that so many DNA viruses for the
 

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:44.120
said that so many DNA viruses for the
most part emulate what we do with our

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:44.130
most part emulate what we do with our
 

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:49.159
most part emulate what we do with our
DNA but viral DNA genomes are mostly not

00:25:49.159 --> 00:25:49.169
DNA but viral DNA genomes are mostly not
 

00:25:49.169 --> 00:25:51.409
DNA but viral DNA genomes are mostly not
like cell chromosomes some of them have

00:25:51.409 --> 00:25:51.419
like cell chromosomes some of them have
 

00:25:51.419 --> 00:25:53.870
like cell chromosomes some of them have
features of cell chromosomes but they

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:53.880
features of cell chromosomes but they
 

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.940
features of cell chromosomes but they
are not like our chromosomes so I would

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:55.950
are not like our chromosomes so I would
 

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:57.380
are not like our chromosomes so I would
prefer if you did not call them

00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:57.390
prefer if you did not call them
 

00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:00.799
prefer if you did not call them
chromosomes but I understand that it may

00:26:00.799 --> 00:26:00.809
chromosomes but I understand that it may
 

00:26:00.809 --> 00:26:02.779
chromosomes but I understand that it may
be engrained in your lexicon but they're

00:26:02.779 --> 00:26:02.789
be engrained in your lexicon but they're
 

00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:05.720
be engrained in your lexicon but they're
not chromosomes unexpected tricks have

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:05.730

questions too

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:10.770
questions too
 

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:14.390
questions too
you thinking about DNA genomes how many

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400
you thinking about DNA genomes how many
 

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:18.620

ways can you think to replicate DNA do
 

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:20.420
ways can you think to replicate DNA do
DNA viruses always replicate in the

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:20.430
DNA viruses always replicate in the
 

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:22.880
DNA viruses always replicate in the

here first of all there's a protein
 

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:02.630
here first of all there's a protein
covalently linked to the five prime end

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640
covalently linked to the five prime end
 

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.639
covalently linked to the five prime end
of one strand so in the book you know in

00:30:04.639 --> 00:30:04.649
of one strand so in the book you know in
 

00:30:04.649 --> 00:30:06.799
of one strand so in the book you know in
all my slides I have color conventions

00:30:06.799 --> 00:30:06.809
all my slides I have color conventions
 

00:30:06.809 --> 00:30:09.620
all my slides I have color conventions
so DNA is always blue one strand is

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:09.630
so DNA is always blue one strand is
 

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:11.899
so DNA is always blue one strand is
lighter color than the other RNA is

00:30:11.899 --> 00:30:11.909
lighter color than the other RNA is
 

00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:13.639
lighter color than the other RNA is
green two different colors four plus and

00:30:13.639 --> 00:30:13.649
green two different colors four plus and
 

00:30:13.649 --> 00:30:17.000
green two different colors four plus and
minus and then proteins are some kind of

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:17.010
minus and then proteins are some kind of
 

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:21.200
minus and then proteins are some kind of
earth tone I think but the nucleic acid

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:21.210
earth tone I think but the nucleic acid
 

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:22.580
earth tone I think but the nucleic acid
is important so you can see here this is

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:22.590
is important so you can see here this is
 

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:24.590
is important so you can see here this is
double-stranded DNA you can see there's

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:24.600
double-stranded DNA you can see there's
 

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:27.019
double-stranded DNA you can see there's
a gap here you can also see this protein

00:30:27.019 --> 00:30:27.029
a gap here you can also see this protein
 

00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:28.430
a gap here you can also see this protein
linked to the five prime end of one of

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:28.440
linked to the five prime end of one of
 

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.889
linked to the five prime end of one of
the strands and also there is a piece of

00:30:30.889 --> 00:30:30.899
the strands and also there is a piece of
 

00:30:30.899 --> 00:30:33.889
the strands and also there is a piece of
RNA linked to one of the strands as well

00:30:33.889 --> 00:30:33.899
RNA linked to one of the strands as well
 

00:30:33.899 --> 00:30:35.720

short piece of RNA you can tell it's

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:35.730
short piece of RNA you can tell it's
 

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:36.590
short piece of RNA you can tell it's
green so

00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:36.600
green so
 

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:39.590
green so
that's the gap DNA with short RNA so one

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600
that's the gap DNA with short RNA so one
 

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.840
that's the gap DNA with short RNA so one
strand is complete this light blue

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:41.850
strand is complete this light blue
 

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:43.610
strand is complete this light blue
strand the minus strand is complete and

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:43.620
strand the minus strand is complete and
 

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:45.680
strand the minus strand is complete and
the other is only about half completed

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:45.690
the other is only about half completed
 

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:49.700
the other is only about half completed
so that's why we call it a gapped DNA so

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:49.710
so that's why we call it a gapped DNA so
 

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:51.500
so that's why we call it a gapped DNA so
that can't make mRNA as we've already

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:51.510
that can't make mRNA as we've already
 

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:53.690
that can't make mRNA as we've already
said when it comes into the cell it has

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:53.700
said when it comes into the cell it has
 

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.940
said when it comes into the cell it has
to be repaired and as far as we know

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:55.950
to be repaired and as far as we know
 

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:59.210
to be repaired and as far as we know
that uses cellular enzymes so that

00:30:59.210 --> 00:30:59.220
that uses cellular enzymes so that
 

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:01.670
that uses cellular enzymes so that
pattern of virus DNA genome is repaired

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:01.680
pattern of virus DNA genome is repaired
 

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.920
pattern of virus DNA genome is repaired
converted to double-stranded DNA so

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:03.930
converted to double-stranded DNA so
 

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:05.900
converted to double-stranded DNA so
repair means you take off the protein

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:05.910
repair means you take off the protein
 

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:07.700
repair means you take off the protein
you take off the RNA you fill in the gap

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:07.710
you take off the RNA you fill in the gap
 

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:09.920
you take off the RNA you fill in the gap
because you need perfectly duplex

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:09.930
because you need perfectly duplex
 

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:12.260
because you need perfectly duplex

DNA double stranded DNA in order to make
 

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:15.860
DNA double stranded DNA in order to make
mRNA so you have to remove those RNA and

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:15.870
mRNA so you have to remove those RNA and
 

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:17.210
mRNA so you have to remove those RNA and
protein you have to fill in the gap and

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:17.220
protein you have to fill in the gap and
 

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:19.940
protein you have to fill in the gap and
close the ends make sure they're ligated

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:19.950
close the ends make sure they're ligated
 

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:21.290
close the ends make sure they're ligated
together and then all that has to happen

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:21.300
together and then all that has to happen
 

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:26.210
together and then all that has to happen
before mRNA and this DNA genome we will

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:26.220
before mRNA and this DNA genome we will
 

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:28.010
before mRNA and this DNA genome we will

that's eventually what will get
 

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:23.510
that's eventually what will get
incorporated into the virion so that's

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:23.520
incorporated into the virion so that's
 

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:25.340
incorporated into the virion so that's
the reverse transcriptase that takes

they have single stranded DNA genomes
 

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:19.049
they have single stranded DNA genomes
and of course as we said they cannot be

and of course as we said they cannot be
 

00:33:19.059 --> 00:33:21.180
and of course as we said they cannot be
made into RNA so we have to make them

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:21.190
made into RNA so we have to make them
 

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:24.269

only reason you might want to learn that
 

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:32.190
only reason you might want to learn that
these genomes are small because if

these genomes are small because if
they're small they're very unlikely to

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:33.850
they're small they're very unlikely to
 

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:37.470
they're small they're very unlikely to
encode a DNA polymerase so these genomes

00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:37.480
encode a DNA polymerase so these genomes
 

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.019
encode a DNA polymerase so these genomes
usually encode a protein that is used to

00:33:40.019 --> 00:33:40.029
usually encode a protein that is used to
 

00:33:40.029 --> 00:33:42.629
usually encode a protein that is used to
build the capsid and one other protein

00:33:42.629 --> 00:33:42.639
build the capsid and one other protein
 

00:33:42.639 --> 00:33:44.039
build the capsid and one other protein
that's somehow involved in in

00:33:44.039 --> 00:33:44.049
that's somehow involved in in
 

00:33:44.049 --> 00:33:46.100
that's somehow involved in in
replication but is not a DNA polymerase

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:46.110
replication but is not a DNA polymerase
 

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:49.080
replication but is not a DNA polymerase
so these small circle virus parvovirus

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:49.090
so these small circle virus parvovirus
 

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:51.570
so these small circle virus parvovirus
genomes don't encode DNA polymerases so

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:51.580
genomes don't encode DNA polymerases so
 

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:54.539
genomes don't encode DNA polymerases so
that means they need to use the host DNA

00:33:54.539 --> 00:33:54.549
that means they need to use the host DNA
 

00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:58.139
that means they need to use the host DNA
polymerase so now what can you tell me

00:33:58.139 --> 00:33:58.149
polymerase so now what can you tell me
 

00:33:58.149 --> 00:34:00.600
polymerase so now what can you tell me
about where the divine DNA goes when it

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:00.610
about where the divine DNA goes when it
 

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:02.639
about where the divine DNA goes when it
first infects the cell so it's

00:34:02.639 --> 00:34:02.649
first infects the cell so it's
 

00:34:02.649 --> 00:34:05.519
first infects the cell so it's
single-stranded where do you think it

00:34:05.519 --> 00:34:05.529
single-stranded where do you think it
 

00:34:05.529 --> 00:34:07.320
single-stranded where do you think it
has to go so they can't make mRNA until

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:07.330
has to go so they can't make mRNA until
 

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:09.780
has to go so they can't make mRNA until
it's made double-stranded so where do

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:09.790
it's made double-stranded so where do
 

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:11.700
it's made double-stranded so where do
you think it has to go to the nucleus

00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:11.710
you think it has to go to the nucleus
 

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:13.079
you think it has to go to the nucleus
because that's where the enzymes are

00:34:13.079 --> 00:34:13.089
because that's where the enzymes are
 

00:34:13.089 --> 00:34:15.139
because that's where the enzymes are
that replicates so that's what I mean by

00:34:15.139 --> 00:34:15.149
that replicates so that's what I mean by
 

00:34:15.149 --> 00:34:17.819
that replicates so that's what I mean by
applying a few facts you can logically

00:34:17.819 --> 00:34:17.829
applying a few facts you can logically
 

00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:20.099
applying a few facts you can logically
think through these processes so all

00:34:20.099 --> 00:34:20.109
think through these processes so all
 

00:34:20.109 --> 00:34:21.510
think through these processes so all
replication in these virus is

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:21.520
replication in these virus is
 

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.399
replication in these virus is
accomplished by cellular DNA polymerases

00:34:23.399 --> 00:34:23.409
accomplished by cellular DNA polymerases
 

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:25.919
accomplished by cellular DNA polymerases
which are in the nucleus so that's where

00:34:25.919 --> 00:34:25.929
which are in the nucleus so that's where
 

00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:28.559
which are in the nucleus so that's where
these viruses have to go so here we are

00:34:28.559 --> 00:34:28.569
these viruses have to go so here we are
 

00:34:28.569 --> 00:34:30.569
these viruses have to go so here we are
single stranded DNA genomes in our

00:34:30.569 --> 00:34:30.579
single stranded DNA genomes in our
 

00:34:30.579 --> 00:34:33.540
single stranded DNA genomes in our
chapter 3 scheme single-stranded DNA is

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:33.550
chapter 3 scheme single-stranded DNA is
 

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:35.220
chapter 3 scheme single-stranded DNA is
converted to double-stranded DNA by a

00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:35.230
converted to double-stranded DNA by a
 

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:37.079
converted to double-stranded DNA by a
cellular polymerase that happens in the

00:34:37.079 --> 00:34:37.089
cellular polymerase that happens in the
 

00:34:37.089 --> 00:34:40.859
cellular polymerase that happens in the
nucleus you make mRNA in the nucleus now

00:34:40.859 --> 00:34:40.869
nucleus you make mRNA in the nucleus now
 

00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:42.869
nucleus you make mRNA in the nucleus now
you wouldn't be able to guess this but

00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:42.879
you wouldn't be able to guess this but
 

00:34:42.879 --> 00:34:45.899
you wouldn't be able to guess this but
if a virus doesn't encode of this size

00:34:45.899 --> 00:34:45.909
if a virus doesn't encode of this size
 

00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:47.760
if a virus doesn't encode of this size
doesn't think code a DNA polymerase it's

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:47.770
doesn't think code a DNA polymerase it's
 

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:50.010
doesn't think code a DNA polymerase it's
not likely to encode an enzyme to make

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:50.020
not likely to encode an enzyme to make
 

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:51.809
not likely to encode an enzyme to make
mRNA as well and these don't

00:34:51.809 --> 00:34:51.819
mRNA as well and these don't
 

00:34:51.819 --> 00:34:54.119
mRNA as well and these don't
so these transcriptase is the enzymes

00:34:54.119 --> 00:34:54.129
so these transcriptase is the enzymes
 

00:34:54.129 --> 00:34:56.790
so these transcriptase is the enzymes
that copy DNA into mRNA are present are

00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:56.800
that copy DNA into mRNA are present are
 

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.260
that copy DNA into mRNA are present are
the ones used from the cell and they're

00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:58.270
the ones used from the cell and they're
 

00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:00.870
the ones used from the cell and they're
present in the nucleus so we make viral

00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:00.880
present in the nucleus so we make viral
 

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:03.599
present in the nucleus so we make viral
proteins to make to do more replication

00:35:03.599 --> 00:35:03.609
proteins to make to do more replication
 

00:35:03.609 --> 00:35:04.140
proteins to make to do more replication
and make

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:04.150
and make
 

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:07.410
and make
and make more infectious Furion's the

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:07.420
and make more infectious Furion's the
 

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:09.270
and make more infectious Furion's the
circle viruses have a single-stranded

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:09.280
circle viruses have a single-stranded
 

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.490
circle viruses have a single-stranded
circular DNA genome it's very small one

00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:11.500
circular DNA genome it's very small one
 

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.190
circular DNA genome it's very small one
it's among the smallest DNA genomes that

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:14.200
it's among the smallest DNA genomes that
 

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:22.010
it's among the smallest DNA genomes that
we know about yeah

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:22.020
 
 

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:24.600
 
well some of these viruses actually

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:24.610
well some of these viruses actually
 

00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:27.480
well some of these viruses actually
package both strands so in some cases

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:27.490
package both strands so in some cases
 

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:31.380
package both strands so in some cases
you use them if it's a double-stranded

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:31.390
you use them if it's a double-stranded
 

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:33.150
you use them if it's a double-stranded
DNA of course both strand goes into the

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:33.160
DNA of course both strand goes into the
 

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:35.130
DNA of course both strand goes into the
virion but I think the good fraction of

00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:35.140
virion but I think the good fraction of
 

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:36.360
virion but I think the good fraction of
these are actually used and those are

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:36.370
these are actually used and those are
 

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:45.870
these are actually used and those are
not they're degraded yeah yes so the

00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:45.880
not they're degraded yeah yes so the
 

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:48.150
not they're degraded yeah yes so the
smaller viruses don't encode the DNA

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.160
smaller viruses don't encode the DNA
 

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:50.760
smaller viruses don't encode the DNA
polymerase or a DNA dependent RNA

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:50.770
polymerase or a DNA dependent RNA
 

00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:52.980
polymerase or a DNA dependent RNA
polymerase to the enzyme that makes mRNA

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:52.990
polymerase to the enzyme that makes mRNA
 

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:56.010
polymerase to the enzyme that makes mRNA
I have to remember to repeat the

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:56.020
I have to remember to repeat the
 

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:58.710
I have to remember to repeat the
questions so you can hear them on the

00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720
questions so you can hear them on the
 

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:02.580
questions so you can hear them on the
tape okay so this is single stranded DNA

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:02.590
tape okay so this is single stranded DNA
 

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:04.620
tape okay so this is single stranded DNA
small these are slightly larger the

00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:04.630
small these are slightly larger the
 

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:09.150
small these are slightly larger the
parvo viruses and as I said the circles

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:09.160
parvo viruses and as I said the circles
 

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:11.370
parvo viruses and as I said the circles
are ubiquitous you're all sural positive

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:11.380
are ubiquitous you're all sural positive
 

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:12.660
are ubiquitous you're all sural positive
for these viruses but we don't know that

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:12.670
for these viruses but we don't know that
 

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:15.180
for these viruses but we don't know that
they cause any disease the parvo virus

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:15.190
they cause any disease the parvo virus
 

00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:17.220
they cause any disease the parvo virus
is do cause human disease called v

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:17.230
is do cause human disease called v
 

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:21.210
is do cause human disease called v
disease and it's a rash like disease and

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:21.220
disease and it's a rash like disease and
 

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:23.340
disease and it's a rash like disease and
a rash disease of humans and they're

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:23.350
a rash disease of humans and they're
 

00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:25.770
a rash disease of humans and they're
also just cause disease of cats and dogs

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:25.780
also just cause disease of cats and dogs
 

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:27.870
also just cause disease of cats and dogs
they have a very unusual genome

00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:27.880
they have a very unusual genome
 

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.000
they have a very unusual genome
structure which we will talk about when

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:30.010
structure which we will talk about when
 

00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:32.460
structure which we will talk about when
we talk about DNA replication now about

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:32.470
we talk about DNA replication now about
 

00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:36.660
we talk about DNA replication now about
viruses with RNA genomes now cells these

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:36.670
viruses with RNA genomes now cells these
 

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:39.450
viruses with RNA genomes now cells these
are unusual and because cells have no

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:39.460
are unusual and because cells have no
 

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:42.660
are unusual and because cells have no
enzymes that can copy these genomes so

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:42.670
enzymes that can copy these genomes so
 

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:44.010
enzymes that can copy these genomes so
it's a little easier for you to remember

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:44.020
it's a little easier for you to remember
 

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:46.520
it's a little easier for you to remember
how they work just remember that RNA

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:46.530
how they work just remember that RNA
 

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:49.170
how they work just remember that RNA
cannot really be copied by cells I say

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:49.180
cannot really be copied by cells I say
 

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:50.700
cannot really be copied by cells I say
really you may think what is he

00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:50.710
really you may think what is he
 

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:53.190
really you may think what is he
qualifying there the cells can copy

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.200
qualifying there the cells can copy
 

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:56.100
qualifying there the cells can copy
short pieces of RNA right they can make

00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:56.110
short pieces of RNA right they can make
 

00:36:56.110 --> 00:37:00.030
short pieces of RNA right they can make
micro RNAs and hold the whole small RNA

00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:00.040
micro RNAs and hold the whole small RNA
 

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.520
micro RNAs and hold the whole small RNA
system in cells is made by copying small

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:02.530
system in cells is made by copying small
 

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:05.130
system in cells is made by copying small
pieces of RNA but they can't copy RNA

00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:05.140
pieces of RNA but they can't copy RNA
 

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:07.020
pieces of RNA but they can't copy RNA
genomes whatever enzymes do that cannot

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:07.030
genomes whatever enzymes do that cannot
 

00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:09.180
genomes whatever enzymes do that cannot
copy big viral genome so what well

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:09.190
copy big viral genome so what well
 

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:11.460
copy big viral genome so what well
that's why we say cells have no

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:11.470
that's why we say cells have no
 

00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:13.140
that's why we say cells have no
polymerase to replicate these genomes

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:13.150
polymerase to replicate these genomes
 

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:15.930
polymerase to replicate these genomes
and to make mRNA so they have to all use

00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:15.940
and to make mRNA so they have to all use
 

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:17.580
and to make mRNA so they have to all use
their own enzymes these viruses no

00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:17.590
their own enzymes these viruses no
 

00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:18.000
their own enzymes these viruses no
matter how

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:18.010
matter how
 

00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:19.650
matter how
well they are if they have an RNA genome

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:19.660
well they are if they have an RNA genome
 

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:22.350
well they are if they have an RNA genome
they have to encode an enzyme to copy it

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:22.360
they have to encode an enzyme to copy it
 

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:26.730
they have to encode an enzyme to copy it

the virus particle so you need all of
 

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:02.499
the virus particle so you need all of
them for infectivity and again because

00:40:02.499 --> 00:40:02.509
them for infectivity and again because
 

00:40:02.509 --> 00:40:04.059

translated the first thing that has to
 

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:08.380
translated the first thing that has to
happen is you make mRNA which can be

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:08.390
happen is you make mRNA which can be
 

00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:10.390
happen is you make mRNA which can be
made into protein and that can be used

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400
made into protein and that can be used
 

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:13.299
made into protein and that can be used
to make more RNA and more variants so

genome is plus strand so it can be
 

00:41:15.589 --> 00:41:18.549
genome is plus strand so it can be
translated it can be made translated

00:41:18.549 --> 00:41:18.559
translated it can be made translated
 

00:41:18.559 --> 00:41:20.380
translated it can be made translated
into protein so the genome comes in the

00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:20.390
into protein so the genome comes in the
 

00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:22.720
into protein so the genome comes in the
cell protein is immediately made and

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:22.730
cell protein is immediately made and
 

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:25.089
cell protein is immediately made and
that protein is eventually used to make

00:41:25.089 --> 00:41:25.099
that protein is eventually used to make
 

00:41:25.099 --> 00:41:29.710
that protein is eventually used to make
more Furion's the genome has to

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:29.720
more Furion's the genome has to
 

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.990
more Furion's the genome has to
replicate and to do that it has to go

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000
replicate and to do that it has to go
 

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.819
replicate and to do that it has to go
through a negative strand intermedia so

00:41:33.819 --> 00:41:33.829
through a negative strand intermedia so
 

00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:35.710
through a negative strand intermedia so
that's the way nucleic acids work as you

00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:35.720
that's the way nucleic acids work as you
 

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:37.990
that's the way nucleic acids work as you
know to be replicated you make a copy of

00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:38.000
know to be replicated you make a copy of
 

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.940
know to be replicated you make a copy of
one of the strands and the same goes on

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:39.950
one of the strands and the same goes on
 

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:41.680
one of the strands and the same goes on
with RNA viruses you take the plus

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:41.690
with RNA viruses you take the plus
 

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:43.450
with RNA viruses you take the plus
strand genome you make a full-length

00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:43.460
strand genome you make a full-length
 

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:45.520
strand genome you make a full-length
minus strand copy which has

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:45.530
minus strand copy which has
 

00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:47.950
minus strand copy which has
no function other than being a template

00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:47.960
no function other than being a template
 

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:50.410
no function other than being a template
for the synthesis of more plus strands

00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:50.420
for the synthesis of more plus strands
 

00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:52.690
for the synthesis of more plus strands
so eventually those minus strands are

00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:52.700
so eventually those minus strands are
 

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:54.400
so eventually those minus strands are
degraded they're not used because

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:54.410
degraded they're not used because
 

00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:56.350
degraded they're not used because
they're not packaged any further what

00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:56.360
they're not packaged any further what
 

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:57.640
they're not packaged any further what
goes into the variants or the plus

00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:57.650
goes into the variants or the plus
 

00:41:57.650 --> 00:42:01.300
goes into the variants or the plus
strands so these are some examples of

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:01.310
strands so these are some examples of
 

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:03.010
strands so these are some examples of
these genomes some of them are very long

00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:03.020
these genomes some of them are very long
 

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:05.650
these genomes some of them are very long

this is an interesting question why is
there a little dis limit on RNA the size

00:42:16.330 --> 00:42:16.340
there a little dis limit on RNA the size
 

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:19.350
there a little dis limit on RNA the size
of RNA genomes DNA viral genomes can be

00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:19.360
of RNA genomes DNA viral genomes can be
 

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:23.020

these are also poly ventilated so these

00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:37.760
these are also poly ventilated so these
 

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.820
these are also poly ventilated so these
are messenger rnas they roughly look

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:39.830
are messenger rnas they roughly look
 

00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:42.070
are messenger rnas they roughly look
like mRNAs in the cell they have a cap

00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:42.080
like mRNAs in the cell they have a cap
 

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:44.920
like mRNAs in the cell they have a cap
in a poly a but again not all of them do

the 3-prime and the popcorn of viruses

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.000
the 3-prime and the popcorn of viruses
 

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.820
the 3-prime and the popcorn of viruses
don't have a cap at the 5-prime end so

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:51.830
don't have a cap at the 5-prime end so
 

00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:53.830
don't have a cap at the 5-prime end so
this is what I mean by viruses doing

00:42:53.830 --> 00:42:53.840
this is what I mean by viruses doing
 

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:56.440
this is what I mean by viruses doing
unusual things and we'll talk about what

intermediate so there's one viral family

00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:07.880

you would say well that has to be

00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:36.440
you would say well that has to be
 

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:38.050
you would say well that has to be
translated into protein because it's

00:43:38.050 --> 00:43:38.060
translated into protein because it's

have to remember that plus stranded
genome does not get translated so it's

00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:47.780
genome does not get translated so it's
 

00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:50.230
genome does not get translated so it's
not translated in the cell and it gets

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:50.240
not translated in the cell and it gets

copied into a minus strand DNA copy by
 

00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:55.240
copied into a minus strand DNA copy by
an enzyme in the virus particle the

reverse transcriptase it's then made
 

00:43:57.620 --> 00:43:59.600
reverse transcriptase it's then made
double-stranded and now that you have a

double-stranded and now that you have a
 

00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:03.200

from the way all the other viruses
 

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:55.280
from the way all the other viruses
replicate so the pro viral DNA and probe

viral means the DNA copy of the virus

00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:57.330
viral means the DNA copy of the virus
 

00:44:57.330 --> 00:44:58.960
viral means the DNA copy of the virus
that's integrated into the host cell

00:44:58.960 --> 00:44:58.970
that's integrated into the host cell
 

00:44:58.970 --> 00:45:02.330
that's integrated into the host cell
that serves as the template for mRNA

00:45:02.330 --> 00:45:02.340
that serves as the template for mRNA
 

00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:04.670
that serves as the template for mRNA
synthesis and in fact viral genome

00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:04.680
synthesis and in fact viral genome
 

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:07.580

synthesis so here this DNA copy is

00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:07.590
synthesis so here this DNA copy is
 

00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:09.770

fact all of you have these in your

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:11.850
fact all of you have these in your
 

00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:14.470

retroviruses they're mutated extensively

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:17.210
retroviruses they're mutated extensively
 

00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:20.060
retroviruses they're mutated extensively
but you all have these and in other

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:20.070
but you all have these and in other
 

00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:21.800

animals where they're not extensively

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:21.810
animals where they're not extensively
 

00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:24.620
animals where they're not extensively
mutated they make mRNA and they make

00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:24.630
mutated they make mRNA and they make
 

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:26.660
mutated they make mRNA and they make
another copy of RNA that gets

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:26.670
another copy of RNA that gets
 

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:28.310
another copy of RNA that gets
incorporated into variants and that's

00:45:28.310 --> 00:45:28.320
incorporated into variants and that's
 

00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:33.260
incorporated into variants and that's
done by the cellular polymerase so then

00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:33.270
done by the cellular polymerase so then
 

00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:35.630
done by the cellular polymerase so then
we move to some minus strand RNA viruses

00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:35.640
we move to some minus strand RNA viruses
 

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:37.760
we move to some minus strand RNA viruses
there are seven virus families with

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:37.770
there are seven virus families with
 

00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:40.730
there are seven virus families with
negative sense RNA and these are some of

00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:40.740
negative sense RNA and these are some of
 

00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:42.800
negative sense RNA and these are some of
the mammalian viruses measles and mumps

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:42.810
the mammalian viruses measles and mumps
 

00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:45.980
the mammalian viruses measles and mumps
you may recognize rabies Ebola Marburg

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:45.990
you may recognize rabies Ebola Marburg
 

00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:48.380
you may recognize rabies Ebola Marburg
influenza and Lassa virus is some of

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:48.390
influenza and Lassa virus is some of
 

00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:51.950
influenza and Lassa virus is some of
these very serious human pathogens now

00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:51.960
these very serious human pathogens now
 

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:54.110
these very serious human pathogens now
the minus strand RNA you can predict

00:45:54.110 --> 00:45:54.120
the minus strand RNA you can predict
 

00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:56.540
the minus strand RNA you can predict
that when it gets into a host cell you

00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:56.550
that when it gets into a host cell you
 

00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:57.950
that when it gets into a host cell you
know it can't be translated by

00:45:57.950 --> 00:45:57.960
know it can't be translated by
 

00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:00.890
know it can't be translated by
definition because it's minus strand so

00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:00.900
definition because it's minus strand so
 

00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:03.350
definition because it's minus strand so
what has to happen it has to be copied

00:46:03.350 --> 00:46:03.360
what has to happen it has to be copied
 

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:06.020
what has to happen it has to be copied
into a plus strand and in addition

00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:06.030
into a plus strand and in addition
 

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:08.290
into a plus strand and in addition
because you know that cells cannot copy

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:08.300
because you know that cells cannot copy
 

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:11.570
because you know that cells cannot copy
RNA that copying has to be done by a

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:11.580
RNA that copying has to be done by a
 

00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:13.170
RNA that copying has to be done by a
viral enzyme

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:13.180
viral enzyme
 

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:15.630
viral enzyme
so knowing again knowing a few things

00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:15.640
so knowing again knowing a few things
 

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:17.579
so knowing again knowing a few things
you can predict what is going to happen

00:46:17.579 --> 00:46:17.589
you can predict what is going to happen
 

00:46:17.589 --> 00:46:20.339
you can predict what is going to happen
so these negative stranded RNAs are

00:46:20.339 --> 00:46:20.349
so these negative stranded RNAs are
 

00:46:20.349 --> 00:46:23.220
so these negative stranded RNAs are
copied to mRNA by the virion enzyme

00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:23.230
copied to mRNA by the virion enzyme
 

00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:25.470
copied to mRNA by the virion enzyme
which is then translated into protein

00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:25.480
which is then translated into protein
 

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:26.790
which is then translated into protein
and of course you need to make more

00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:26.800
and of course you need to make more
 

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:28.559
and of course you need to make more
negative strand RNAs to put into

00:46:28.559 --> 00:46:28.569
negative strand RNAs to put into
 

00:46:28.569 --> 00:46:30.420
negative strand RNAs to put into
variants and those are done through a

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:30.430
variants and those are done through a
 

00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:32.160
variants and those are done through a
replicative cycle through a plus

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:32.170
replicative cycle through a plus
 

00:46:32.170 --> 00:46:38.160
replicative cycle through a plus
stranded intermediate in these enzymes

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:38.170
stranded intermediate in these enzymes
 

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:42.180
stranded intermediate in these enzymes
by the way that copy this have to be in

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:42.190
by the way that copy this have to be in
 

00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:46.079
by the way that copy this have to be in
the virion itself because if it's if

00:46:46.079 --> 00:46:46.089
the virion itself because if it's if
 

00:46:46.089 --> 00:46:47.790
the virion itself because if it's if
this negative strand came into a cell

00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:47.800
this negative strand came into a cell
 

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.260
this negative strand came into a cell
without the enzyme nothing would happen

00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:49.270
without the enzyme nothing would happen
 

00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:51.870
without the enzyme nothing would happen
even if the enzyme were encoded in the

00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:51.880
even if the enzyme were encoded in the
 

00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:55.650
even if the enzyme were encoded in the
genome the cell cannot access the coding

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:55.660
genome the cell cannot access the coding
 

00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:57.900
genome the cell cannot access the coding
potential in that genome because it's a

00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:57.910
potential in that genome because it's a
 

00:46:57.910 --> 00:47:00.540
potential in that genome because it's a
minus strand so the enzymes have to be

00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:00.550
minus strand so the enzymes have to be
 

00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:03.299
minus strand so the enzymes have to be
in the particle so I could say to you

00:47:03.299 --> 00:47:03.309
in the particle so I could say to you
 

00:47:03.309 --> 00:47:06.329
in the particle so I could say to you
you have a negative strand virus with a

00:47:06.329 --> 00:47:06.339
you have a negative strand virus with a
 

00:47:06.339 --> 00:47:08.700
you have a negative strand virus with a
single stranded RNA genome negative

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:08.710
single stranded RNA genome negative
 

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:10.799
single stranded RNA genome negative
polarity what is in the particle and you

00:47:10.799 --> 00:47:10.809
polarity what is in the particle and you
 

00:47:10.809 --> 00:47:12.510
polarity what is in the particle and you
can tell me there's an enzyme to copy

00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:12.520
can tell me there's an enzyme to copy
 

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:14.460
can tell me there's an enzyme to copy
that you will absolutely know that by

00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:14.470
that you will absolutely know that by
 

00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:18.839
that you will absolutely know that by
automatically knowing these facts so

00:47:18.839 --> 00:47:18.849
automatically knowing these facts so
 

00:47:18.849 --> 00:47:20.700
automatically knowing these facts so
there's no again there are no enzymes in

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:20.710
there's no again there are no enzymes in
 

00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:23.789
there's no again there are no enzymes in
the cell that can make RNA so we have to

00:47:23.789 --> 00:47:23.799
the cell that can make RNA so we have to
 

00:47:23.799 --> 00:47:26.220
the cell that can make RNA so we have to
use it but we have to use a viral

00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:26.230
use it but we have to use a viral
 

00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:28.260
use it but we have to use a viral
polymerase to do that and that

00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:28.270
polymerase to do that and that
 

00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:30.329
polymerase to do that and that
polymerase makes mRNAs and it also

00:47:30.329 --> 00:47:30.339
polymerase makes mRNAs and it also
 

00:47:30.339 --> 00:47:33.720
polymerase makes mRNAs and it also
replicates the genome which means

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:33.730
replicates the genome which means
 

00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:35.460
replicates the genome which means
basically it makes a full-length plus

00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:35.470
basically it makes a full-length plus
 

00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:36.870
basically it makes a full-length plus
strand that is not a message it's

00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:36.880
strand that is not a message it's
 

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:39.720
strand that is not a message it's
reserved for replication and those are

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:39.730
reserved for replication and those are
 

00:47:39.730 --> 00:47:41.849
reserved for replication and those are
templates for making the minus strand

00:47:41.849 --> 00:47:41.859
templates for making the minus strand
 

00:47:41.859 --> 00:47:44.520
templates for making the minus strand
RNA genomes so here are some

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:44.530
RNA genomes so here are some
 

00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:46.950
RNA genomes so here are some
configurations of genomes of single

00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:46.960
configurations of genomes of single
 

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:50.190
configurations of genomes of single
strand RNA - sense viruses some of them

00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:50.200
strand RNA - sense viruses some of them
 

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:52.170
strand RNA - sense viruses some of them
are segmented just like those real virus

00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:52.180
are segmented just like those real virus
 

00:47:52.180 --> 00:48:06.200
are segmented just like those real virus
genomes were set the question yeah

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:06.210
 
 

00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:09.270
 
so the retroviruses have single stranded

00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280
so the retroviruses have single stranded
 

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:13.980
so the retroviruses have single stranded
RNA genomes of plus polarity well as

00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:13.990
RNA genomes of plus polarity well as
 

00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:16.350
RNA genomes of plus polarity well as
that's all we know of yeah we haven't

00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:16.360
that's all we know of yeah we haven't
 

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:21.000
that's all we know of yeah we haven't
discovered any minus polarity but if you

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:21.010
discovered any minus polarity but if you
 

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:23.520
discovered any minus polarity but if you
had a reverse transcriptase in the

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:23.530
had a reverse transcriptase in the
 

00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:25.200
had a reverse transcriptase in the
particle it's theoretically possible

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:25.210
particle it's theoretically possible
 

00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:27.480
particle it's theoretically possible
right because the reverse transcriptase

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:27.490
right because the reverse transcriptase
 

00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:30.060
right because the reverse transcriptase
could copy the negative strand into DNA

00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:30.070
could copy the negative strand into DNA
 

00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:33.030
could copy the negative strand into DNA
so there's no theoretical reason why

00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.040
so there's no theoretical reason why
 

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:35.310
so there's no theoretical reason why
that couldn't occur but we've never

00:48:35.310 --> 00:48:35.320
that couldn't occur but we've never
 

00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:40.260
that couldn't occur but we've never
found that so we have segmented genomes

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:40.270
found that so we have segmented genomes
 

00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:43.350
found that so we have segmented genomes
so here for example influenza virus

00:48:43.350 --> 00:48:43.360
so here for example influenza virus
 

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:46.800
so here for example influenza virus
genomes is in six to eight segments so

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:46.810
genomes is in six to eight segments so
 

00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:48.960
genomes is in six to eight segments so
again influenza A viruses have eight

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:48.970
again influenza A viruses have eight
 

00:48:48.970 --> 00:48:50.700
again influenza A viruses have eight
segments of RNA you need all of them in

00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:50.710
segments of RNA you need all of them in
 

00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:52.260
segments of RNA you need all of them in
the virus to be infectious they're all

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:52.270
the virus to be infectious they're all
 

00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:55.050
the virus to be infectious they're all
single-stranded and we have some viruses

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:55.060
single-stranded and we have some viruses
 

00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:56.970
single-stranded and we have some viruses
with non-segmented genomes paramyxovirus

00:48:56.970 --> 00:48:56.980
with non-segmented genomes paramyxovirus
 

00:48:56.980 --> 00:49:00.360
with non-segmented genomes paramyxovirus
--is mumps measles virus rabies virus

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:00.370
--is mumps measles virus rabies virus
 

00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:05.190
--is mumps measles virus rabies virus
are all single-stranded RNA genomes so

00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:05.200
are all single-stranded RNA genomes so
 

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.680
are all single-stranded RNA genomes so
two different configurations now having

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:07.690
two different configurations now having
 

00:49:07.690 --> 00:49:11.790
two different configurations now having
a segmented genome allows you to do

00:49:11.790 --> 00:49:11.800
a segmented genome allows you to do
 

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:13.770
a segmented genome allows you to do
something that viruses that don't have a

00:49:13.770 --> 00:49:13.780
something that viruses that don't have a
 

00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:16.950
something that viruses that don't have a
segmented genome can do what am I saying

00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960
segmented genome can do what am I saying
 

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:19.710
segmented genome can do what am I saying
it allows you to do things that genomes

00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:19.720
it allows you to do things that genomes
 

00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:21.780
it allows you to do things that genomes
that are not segmented cannot do right

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:21.790
that are not segmented cannot do right
 

00:49:21.790 --> 00:49:23.820
that are not segmented cannot do right
and that is something called

00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:23.830
and that is something called
 

00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:26.910
and that is something called
reassortment so when these are two

00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:26.920
reassortment so when these are two
 

00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:29.070
reassortment so when these are two
different influenza viruses infecting a

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:29.080
different influenza viruses infecting a
 

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:31.560
different influenza viruses infecting a
cell and when these two viruses infect

00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:31.570
cell and when these two viruses infect
 

00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:33.900
cell and when these two viruses infect
the cell each of them has eight RNA

00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:33.910
the cell each of them has eight RNA
 

00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:36.120
the cell each of them has eight RNA
segments and they can all read mix

00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:36.130
segments and they can all read mix
 

00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:38.040
segments and they can all read mix
within the cell and they replicated so

00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:38.050
within the cell and they replicated so
 

00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:40.080
within the cell and they replicated so
you have a mixture of sixteen different

00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:40.090
you have a mixture of sixteen different
 

00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:42.180
you have a mixture of sixteen different
RNA segments from two different viruses

00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:42.190
RNA segments from two different viruses
 

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:45.180
RNA segments from two different viruses
so the viruses that are produced can be

00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:45.190
so the viruses that are produced can be
 

00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:47.820
so the viruses that are produced can be
either of the two parental viruses or or

00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:47.830
either of the two parental viruses or or
 

00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:49.950
either of the two parental viruses or or
viruses that have mixed segments they

00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:49.960
viruses that have mixed segments they
 

00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:52.020
viruses that have mixed segments they
all have to have eight and they all have

00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:52.030
all have to have eight and they all have
 

00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:53.970
all have to have eight and they all have
to have eight specific segments but they

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:53.980
to have eight specific segments but they
 

00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:56.400
to have eight specific segments but they
can come from either parent virus so

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:56.410
can come from either parent virus so
 

00:49:56.410 --> 00:49:59.190
can come from either parent virus so
this is a way that these viruses undergo

00:49:59.190 --> 00:49:59.200
this is a way that these viruses undergo
 

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.770
this is a way that these viruses undergo
genetic mixing if you will and it's

00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:01.780
genetic mixing if you will and it's
 

00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:03.990
genetic mixing if you will and it's
called reassortment all right so it's a

00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000
called reassortment all right so it's a
 

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.450
called reassortment all right so it's a
very specific term it applies to

00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:05.460
very specific term it applies to
 

00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:07.680
very specific term it applies to
segmented viruses

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:07.690
segmented viruses
 

00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:10.830
segmented viruses
now when nucleic acids recombine you

00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:10.840
now when nucleic acids recombine you
 

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:12.210
now when nucleic acids recombine you
probably have learned this in other

00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:12.220
probably have learned this in other
 

00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:14.450
probably have learned this in other
courses you could have DNA recombination

00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:14.460
courses you could have DNA recombination
 

00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:15.930
courses you could have DNA recombination
breakage and review

00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:15.940
breakage and review
 

00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:18.210
breakage and review
DNA or copy choice mechanisms that allow

00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:18.220
DNA or copy choice mechanisms that allow
 

00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:20.760
DNA or copy choice mechanisms that allow
the shuffling of pieces or sequences of

00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:20.770
the shuffling of pieces or sequences of
 

00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:23.060
the shuffling of pieces or sequences of
DNA among different organisms but

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:23.070
DNA among different organisms but
 

00:50:23.070 --> 00:50:25.470
DNA among different organisms but
viruses have another way to do it with

00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:25.480
viruses have another way to do it with
 

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:27.120
viruses have another way to do it with
having a segmented genome these can

00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:27.130
having a segmented genome these can
 

00:50:27.130 --> 00:50:28.740
having a segmented genome these can
readily mix and the frequency is higher

00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:28.750
readily mix and the frequency is higher
 

00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:30.510
readily mix and the frequency is higher
because you don't need breakage you

00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:30.520
because you don't need breakage you
 

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:32.850
because you don't need breakage you
don't need copy choice in order to do

00:50:32.850 --> 00:50:32.860
don't need copy choice in order to do
 

00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:35.040
don't need copy choice in order to do
this so this happens with influenza and

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:35.050
this so this happens with influenza and
 

00:50:35.050 --> 00:50:37.500
this so this happens with influenza and
it's probably a major reason why these

00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:37.510
it's probably a major reason why these
 

00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:39.180
it's probably a major reason why these
viruses have been with us for many years

00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:39.190
viruses have been with us for many years
 

00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:42.290
viruses have been with us for many years
and it's very hard to get rid of them

00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:42.300
and it's very hard to get rid of them
 

00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:44.940
and it's very hard to get rid of them
some of the - strand RNA viruses are

00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:44.950
some of the - strand RNA viruses are
 

00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:47.730
some of the - strand RNA viruses are
called ambi sense that is they have both

00:50:47.730 --> 00:50:47.740
called ambi sense that is they have both
 

00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:51.450
called ambi sense that is they have both
plus and minus aspects and there are two

00:50:51.450 --> 00:50:51.460
plus and minus aspects and there are two
 

00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:53.610
plus and minus aspects and there are two
families of viruses Arina Veera day and

00:50:53.610 --> 00:50:53.620
families of viruses Arina Veera day and
 

00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:56.250
families of viruses Arina Veera day and
Bunya Verity and the last viruses are in

00:50:56.250 --> 00:50:56.260
Bunya Verity and the last viruses are in
 

00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:57.750
Bunya Verity and the last viruses are in
the arena of the verity families are

00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760
the arena of the verity families are
 

00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:00.180
the arena of the verity families are
very serious viruses that cause

00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:00.190
very serious viruses that cause
 

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:02.850
very serious viruses that cause
hemorrhagic fever highly fatal but

00:51:02.850 --> 00:51:02.860
hemorrhagic fever highly fatal but
 

00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:07.290
hemorrhagic fever highly fatal but
largely restricted to a few countries of

00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:07.300
largely restricted to a few countries of
 

00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:10.380
largely restricted to a few countries of
the world so here's what these genomes

00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:10.390
the world so here's what these genomes
 

00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:15.450
the world so here's what these genomes
look like and B cents RNA genomes so you

00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:15.460
look like and B cents RNA genomes so you
 

00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:17.940
look like and B cents RNA genomes so you
can see I think the two colors of RNA we

00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:17.950
can see I think the two colors of RNA we
 

00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:20.550
can see I think the two colors of RNA we
have our light green color and so this

00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:20.560
have our light green color and so this
 

00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:22.650
have our light green color and so this
is kelly green and this is olive green

00:51:22.650 --> 00:51:22.660
is kelly green and this is olive green
 

00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:25.320
is kelly green and this is olive green
okay and that's because there are two

00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:25.330
okay and that's because there are two
 

00:51:25.330 --> 00:51:27.990
okay and that's because there are two
different polarities we have the plus

00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:28.000
different polarities we have the plus
 

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.280
different polarities we have the plus
cents here and then the rest of the

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:29.290
cents here and then the rest of the
 

00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:31.710
cents here and then the rest of the
genome is minus cents so it's actually a

00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:31.720
genome is minus cents so it's actually a
 

00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:33.720
genome is minus cents so it's actually a
mixture of polarity so this part of the

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:33.730
mixture of polarity so this part of the
 

00:51:33.730 --> 00:51:36.600
mixture of polarity so this part of the
genome could be translated but not this

00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:36.610
genome could be translated but not this
 

00:51:36.610 --> 00:51:39.300
genome could be translated but not this
part because it's negative polarity so

00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:39.310
part because it's negative polarity so
 

00:51:39.310 --> 00:51:41.700
part because it's negative polarity so
this virus that we're illustrating here

00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:41.710
this virus that we're illustrating here
 

00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:45.030
this virus that we're illustrating here
has a genome of two RNA segments an else

00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:45.040
has a genome of two RNA segments an else
 

00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:47.790
has a genome of two RNA segments an else
segment and an S segment they're both

00:51:47.790 --> 00:51:47.800
segment and an S segment they're both
 

00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:50.160
segment and an S segment they're both
ambi cents and they encode two proteins

00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:50.170
ambi cents and they encode two proteins
 

00:51:50.170 --> 00:51:52.950
ambi cents and they encode two proteins
for each segment and what happens is

00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:52.960
for each segment and what happens is
 

00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:54.390
for each segment and what happens is
when these aren't when these viruses

00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:54.400
when these aren't when these viruses
 

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:57.750
when these aren't when these viruses
infect the cell the first thing that in

00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:57.760
infect the cell the first thing that in
 

00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:02.820
infect the cell the first thing that in
fact happens is that the vie there's a

00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:02.830
fact happens is that the vie there's a
 

00:52:02.830 --> 00:52:04.740
fact happens is that the vie there's a
viral enzyme in the particle that makes

00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:04.750
viral enzyme in the particle that makes
 

00:52:04.750 --> 00:52:09.540
viral enzyme in the particle that makes
a small mRNA complimentary to this

00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:09.550
a small mRNA complimentary to this
 

00:52:09.550 --> 00:52:11.280
a small mRNA complimentary to this
negative sequence at the three prime end

00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:11.290
negative sequence at the three prime end
 

00:52:11.290 --> 00:52:13.560
negative sequence at the three prime end
so in the olive green part is minus

00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:13.570
so in the olive green part is minus
 

00:52:13.570 --> 00:52:15.720
so in the olive green part is minus
strand so you can't translate it so a

00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:15.730
strand so you can't translate it so a
 

00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:17.880
strand so you can't translate it so a
virus enzyme makes an mRNA which is now

00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:17.890
virus enzyme makes an mRNA which is now
 

00:52:17.890 --> 00:52:19.350
virus enzyme makes an mRNA which is now
the plus strand that can be translated

00:52:19.350 --> 00:52:19.360
the plus strand that can be translated
 

00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:22.770
the plus strand that can be translated
into protein on the other hand the five

00:52:22.770 --> 00:52:22.780
into protein on the other hand the five
 

00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:25.230
into protein on the other hand the five
the sequences at the five prime end can

00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:25.240
the sequences at the five prime end can
 

00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:27.480
the sequences at the five prime end can
be directly accessed but they're not in

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:27.490
be directly accessed but they're not in
 

00:52:27.490 --> 00:52:29.809
be directly accessed but they're not in
fact a copy of this whole genome

00:52:29.809 --> 00:52:29.819
fact a copy of this whole genome
 

00:52:29.819 --> 00:52:32.630
fact a copy of this whole genome
to be made so now this goes from plus to

00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:32.640
to be made so now this goes from plus to
 

00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:35.479
to be made so now this goes from plus to
minus and then this is copied into an

00:52:35.479 --> 00:52:35.489
minus and then this is copied into an
 

00:52:35.489 --> 00:52:38.029
minus and then this is copied into an
mRNA from which proteins can be made and

00:52:38.029 --> 00:52:38.039
mRNA from which proteins can be made and
 

00:52:38.039 --> 00:52:39.620
mRNA from which proteins can be made and
probably the reason this isn't

00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:39.630
probably the reason this isn't
 

00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:41.209
probably the reason this isn't
translated is because there's no cap

00:52:41.209 --> 00:52:41.219
translated is because there's no cap
 

00:52:41.219 --> 00:52:44.089
translated is because there's no cap
here at the 5-prime end so that's an

00:52:44.089 --> 00:52:44.099
here at the 5-prime end so that's an
 

00:52:44.099 --> 00:52:46.130
here at the 5-prime end so that's an
example of a segment that has both kinds

00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:46.140
example of a segment that has both kinds
 

00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:49.519
example of a segment that has both kinds
of polarities in it and I don't know why

00:52:49.519 --> 00:52:49.529
of polarities in it and I don't know why
 

00:52:49.529 --> 00:52:51.859
of polarities in it and I don't know why
these have arisen again they exist they

00:52:51.859 --> 00:52:51.869
these have arisen again they exist they
 

00:52:51.869 --> 00:52:53.509
these have arisen again they exist they
volution airily that i've survived so

and this is the introduction of foreign

00:56:27.450 --> 00:56:27.460
and this is the introduction of foreign
 

00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:30.030
and this is the introduction of foreign
DNA into cells and the reason why it has

00:56:30.030 --> 00:56:30.040
DNA into cells and the reason why it has
 

00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:32.640
DNA into cells and the reason why it has
a long name DNA mediated transformation

00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:32.650
a long name DNA mediated transformation
 

00:56:32.650 --> 00:56:35.730
a long name DNA mediated transformation
is because before this it was

00:56:35.730 --> 00:56:35.740
is because before this it was
 

00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:38.190
is because before this it was
appreciated that you could put DNA into

00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:38.200
appreciated that you could put DNA into
 

00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:40.140
appreciated that you could put DNA into
cells and change their phenotypes hence

00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:40.150
cells and change their phenotypes hence
 

00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:42.270
cells and change their phenotypes hence
the word transformation it had already

00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:42.280
the word transformation it had already
 

00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:44.460
the word transformation it had already
been the word had already been used to

00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:44.470
been the word had already been used to
 

00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:46.920
been the word had already been used to
show to describe oncogenic

00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:46.930
show to describe oncogenic
 

00:56:46.930 --> 00:56:48.690
show to describe oncogenic
transformation the transformation of

00:56:48.690 --> 00:56:48.700
transformation the transformation of
 

00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:50.790
transformation the transformation of
cells into an oncogenic phenotype so

00:56:50.790 --> 00:56:50.800
cells into an oncogenic phenotype so
 

00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:53.700
cells into an oncogenic phenotype so
hence not to confuse the two we put DNA

00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:53.710
hence not to confuse the two we put DNA
 

00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:54.420
hence not to confuse the two we put DNA

MacLeod in McCarthy at Rockefeller which

00:57:03.809 --> 00:57:03.819
MacLeod in McCarthy at Rockefeller which
 

00:57:03.819 --> 00:57:06.230
MacLeod in McCarthy at Rockefeller which
showed that you could transform the

00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240
showed that you could transform the
 

00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:09.480
showed that you could transform the
morphology of a bacterium in this case a

00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:09.490
morphology of a bacterium in this case a
 

00:57:09.490 --> 00:57:14.220
morphology of a bacterium in this case a
pneumococcus using DNA so they took two

00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:14.230
pneumococcus using DNA so they took two
 

00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:17.039
pneumococcus using DNA so they took two
different colony morphologies here the

00:57:17.039 --> 00:57:17.049
different colony morphologies here the
 

00:57:17.049 --> 00:57:18.839
different colony morphologies here the
two different morphologies a small one

00:57:18.839 --> 00:57:18.849
two different morphologies a small one
 

00:57:18.849 --> 00:57:21.990
two different morphologies a small one
in a large shiny one and they could

00:57:21.990 --> 00:57:22.000
in a large shiny one and they could
 

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.910
in a large shiny one and they could
transform one to the other by taking the

00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:23.920
transform one to the other by taking the
 

00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:25.650
transform one to the other by taking the
DNA of one strain and putting it into

00:57:25.650 --> 00:57:25.660
DNA of one strain and putting it into
 

00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:27.180
DNA of one strain and putting it into
the other and this was the first proof

00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:27.190
the other and this was the first proof
 

00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:30.569
the other and this was the first proof
that DNA was the genetic material so you

00:57:30.569 --> 00:57:30.579
that DNA was the genetic material so you
 

00:57:30.579 --> 00:57:33.049
that DNA was the genetic material so you
see they called it transformation of

00:57:33.049 --> 00:57:33.059
see they called it transformation of
 

00:57:33.059 --> 00:57:35.099
see they called it transformation of
pneumococcal types and that's where the

00:57:35.099 --> 00:57:35.109
pneumococcal types and that's where the
 

00:57:35.109 --> 00:57:37.349
pneumococcal types and that's where the
word DNA mediated transformation came

00:57:37.349 --> 00:57:37.359
word DNA mediated transformation came
 

00:57:37.359 --> 00:57:41.930
word DNA mediated transformation came
from now nowadays we use another term

00:57:41.930 --> 00:57:41.940
from now nowadays we use another term
 

00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:45.089
from now nowadays we use another term
transfection transfection specifically

00:57:45.089 --> 00:57:45.099
transfection transfection specifically
 

00:57:45.099 --> 00:57:47.940
transfection transfection specifically
refers to the production of virus after

00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:47.950
refers to the production of virus after
 

00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:51.390
refers to the production of virus after
you put viral DNA into cells so you take

00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:51.400
you put viral DNA into cells so you take
 

00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:53.579
you put viral DNA into cells so you take
viral DNA purified viral DNA you

00:57:53.579 --> 00:57:53.589
viral DNA purified viral DNA you
 

00:57:53.589 --> 00:57:55.049
viral DNA purified viral DNA you
introduce it into cells that's DNA

00:57:55.049 --> 00:57:55.059
introduce it into cells that's DNA
 

00:57:55.059 --> 00:57:56.960
introduce it into cells that's DNA
mediated transformation and that

00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:56.970
mediated transformation and that
 

00:57:56.970 --> 00:58:00.029
mediated transformation and that
initiates an infectious cycle so that's

00:58:00.029 --> 00:58:00.039
initiates an infectious cycle so that's
 

00:58:00.039 --> 00:58:01.980
initiates an infectious cycle so that's
called transfection because it's

00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:01.990
called transfection because it's
 

00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:03.690
called transfection because it's
transformation and infection

00:58:03.690 --> 00:58:03.700
transformation and infection
 

00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:06.690
transformation and infection
transfection but unfortunately people

00:58:06.690 --> 00:58:06.700
transfection but unfortunately people
 

00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:09.019
transfection but unfortunately people
don't really like to say DNA mediated

00:58:09.019 --> 00:58:09.029
don't really like to say DNA mediated
 

00:58:09.029 --> 00:58:11.819
don't really like to say DNA mediated
transformation all the time so they say

00:58:11.819 --> 00:58:11.829
transformation all the time so they say
 

00:58:11.829 --> 00:58:14.730
transformation all the time so they say
transfection for everything so you take

00:58:14.730 --> 00:58:14.740
transfection for everything so you take
 

00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:17.819
transfection for everything so you take
a gene encoding a protein of any kind

00:58:17.819 --> 00:58:17.829
a gene encoding a protein of any kind
 

00:58:17.829 --> 00:58:19.470
a gene encoding a protein of any kind
and you express it in a cell by putting

00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:19.480
and you express it in a cell by putting
 

00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:20.579
and you express it in a cell by putting
DNA in the cell they call it

00:58:20.579 --> 00:58:20.589
DNA in the cell they call it
 

00:58:20.589 --> 00:58:23.490
DNA in the cell they call it
transfection it's not really correct but

00:58:23.490 --> 00:58:23.500
transfection it's not really correct but
 

00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:25.920
transfection it's not really correct but
you will hear everyone including Nobel

00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:25.930
you will hear everyone including Nobel
 

00:58:25.930 --> 00:58:28.260
you will hear everyone including Nobel
laureates using it so I just want to

00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:28.270
laureates using it so I just want to
 

00:58:28.270 --> 00:58:30.329
laureates using it so I just want to
explain what is the correct usage of the

00:58:30.329 --> 00:58:30.339
explain what is the correct usage of the
 

00:58:30.339 --> 00:58:32.339
explain what is the correct usage of the
term transfection really refers to

00:58:32.339 --> 00:58:32.349
term transfection really refers to
 

00:58:32.349 --> 00:58:34.109
term transfection really refers to
initiating a viral infection with

00:58:34.109 --> 00:58:34.119
initiating a viral infection with
 

00:58:34.119 --> 00:58:37.289
initiating a viral infection with
nucleic acid mutation of course is a

00:58:37.289 --> 00:58:37.299
nucleic acid mutation of course is a
 

00:58:37.299 --> 00:58:40.319
nucleic acid mutation of course is a
change in DNA or an RNA based changes

00:58:40.319 --> 00:58:40.329
change in DNA or an RNA based changes
 

00:58:40.329 --> 00:58:42.269
change in DNA or an RNA based changes
insertions deletions and rearrangements

00:58:42.269 --> 00:58:42.279
insertions deletions and rearrangements
 

00:58:42.279 --> 00:58:43.980
insertions deletions and rearrangements
we'll talk a lot about mutation in this

00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:43.990
we'll talk a lot about mutation in this
 

00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:47.309
we'll talk a lot about mutation in this
course nonsense mutation missense

00:58:47.309 --> 00:58:47.319
course nonsense mutation missense
 

00:58:47.319 --> 00:58:49.769
course nonsense mutation missense
mutations but it is not a change in

00:58:49.769 --> 00:58:49.779
mutations but it is not a change in
 

00:58:49.779 --> 00:58:53.190
mutations but it is not a change in
protein if you say i mutated the protein

00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:53.200
protein if you say i mutated the protein
 

00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:55.620
protein if you say i mutated the protein
that's not right because mutation means

00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:55.630
that's not right because mutation means
 

00:58:55.630 --> 00:58:57.930
that's not right because mutation means
you're working on nucleic acid and this

00:58:57.930 --> 00:58:57.940
you're working on nucleic acid and this
 

00:58:57.940 --> 00:58:59.910
you're working on nucleic acid and this
is again something that people don't use

00:58:59.910 --> 00:58:59.920
is again something that people don't use
 

00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:01.980
is again something that people don't use
correctly so I want to tell you the

00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:01.990
correctly so I want to tell you the
 

00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:03.900
correctly so I want to tell you the
proper usage mutation is for nucleic

00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:03.910
proper usage mutation is for nucleic
 

00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:07.529
proper usage mutation is for nucleic
acid what method allowed the application

00:59:07.529 --> 00:59:07.539

methods to animal viruses anyone wish to

00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:13.630
methods to animal viruses anyone wish to
 

00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:17.190
methods to animal viruses anyone wish to
hazard a guess yeah if you print it out

00:59:17.190 --> 00:59:17.200
hazard a guess yeah if you print it out
 

00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:18.810
hazard a guess yeah if you print it out
the lecture notes the answer is right

00:59:18.810 --> 00:59:18.820
the lecture notes the answer is right
 

00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:27.300
the lecture notes the answer is right
there what is that what cell cults your

00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:27.310
there what is that what cell cults your
 

00:59:27.310 --> 00:59:29.420
there what is that what cell cults your
health but there's another more specific

00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:29.430
health but there's another more specific
 

00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:34.860
health but there's another more specific
assay you see that circle what is that

00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:34.870
assay you see that circle what is that
 

00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:38.850
assay you see that circle what is that
picture plaque assay it allows you to

00:59:38.850 --> 00:59:38.860
picture plaque assay it allows you to
 

00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:41.850
picture plaque assay it allows you to
pick genetically pure cultures of a

00:59:41.850 --> 00:59:41.860
pick genetically pure cultures of a
 

00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:44.160
pick genetically pure cultures of a
virus right you need to be able to do

00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:44.170
virus right you need to be able to do
 

00:59:44.170 --> 00:59:46.830
virus right you need to be able to do
that to do genetics if you can't purify

00:59:46.830 --> 00:59:46.840
that to do genetics if you can't purify
 

00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:49.440
that to do genetics if you can't purify
a virus clone it you can't do genetics

00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:49.450
a virus clone it you can't do genetics
 

00:59:49.450 --> 00:59:52.230
a virus clone it you can't do genetics
so that's the plaque assay is crucial

00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:52.240
so that's the plaque assay is crucial
 

00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:53.910
so that's the plaque assay is crucial
for this so that's why I was such a big

00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:53.920
for this so that's why I was such a big
 

00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:56.490
for this so that's why I was such a big
deal when renato dulbecco devised the

00:59:56.490 --> 00:59:56.500
deal when renato dulbecco devised the
 

00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:59.300
deal when renato dulbecco devised the
plaque assay for animal viruses in 1952

00:59:59.300 --> 00:59:59.310
plaque assay for animal viruses in 1952
 

00:59:59.310 --> 01:00:01.920
plaque assay for animal viruses in 1952
it allowed you to isolate mutants of

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:01.930
it allowed you to isolate mutants of
 

01:00:01.930 --> 01:00:03.960
it allowed you to isolate mutants of
various sorts and how did we do that

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:03.970
various sorts and how did we do that
 

01:00:03.970 --> 01:00:06.780
various sorts and how did we do that
back then well it turns out that for RNA

01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:06.790
back then well it turns out that for RNA
 

01:00:06.790 --> 01:00:08.850
back then well it turns out that for RNA
viruses if you grow up an RNA virus

01:00:08.850 --> 01:00:08.860
viruses if you grow up an RNA virus
 

01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:11.600
viruses if you grow up an RNA virus
stock you have a tube of an RNA virus

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:11.610
stock you have a tube of an RNA virus
 

01:00:11.610 --> 01:00:14.700
stock you have a tube of an RNA virus
it's full of mutants already because the

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:14.710
it's full of mutants already because the
 

01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:16.890
it's full of mutants already because the
polymerase makes mistakes it makes about

01:00:16.890 --> 01:00:16.900
polymerase makes mistakes it makes about
 

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:18.750
polymerase makes mistakes it makes about
one mistake in ten thousand or a hundred

01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:18.760
one mistake in ten thousand or a hundred
 

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:22.050
one mistake in ten thousand or a hundred
thousand bases that it polymerizes so

01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:22.060
thousand bases that it polymerizes so
 

01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:24.210
thousand bases that it polymerizes so
many RNA virus genomes are ten thousand

01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:24.220
many RNA virus genomes are ten thousand
 

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:27.180
many RNA virus genomes are ten thousand
bases in length so that means that every

01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:27.190
bases in length so that means that every
 

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:29.280
bases in length so that means that every
time it's replicated one mistake is made

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:29.290
time it's replicated one mistake is made
 

01:00:29.290 --> 01:00:31.470

so a stock of virus which has billions

01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:31.480
so a stock of virus which has billions
 

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:33.360
so a stock of virus which has billions
of viruses in it is a wonderful

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:33.370

collection of mutants DNA viruses don't

01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:37.240
collection of mutants DNA viruses don't
 

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:40.440
collection of mutants DNA viruses don't
make as many mistakes several orders of

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:40.450
make as many mistakes several orders of
 

01:00:40.450 --> 01:00:42.240
make as many mistakes several orders of
magnitude higher so there are fewer

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:42.250
magnitude higher so there are fewer
 

01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:44.370
magnitude higher so there are fewer
mutants but they're still there you just

01:00:44.370 --> 01:00:44.380
mutants but they're still there you just
 

01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:46.140
mutants but they're still there you just
have to work harder and in some cases

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:46.150
have to work harder and in some cases
 

01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:48.180
have to work harder and in some cases
you mutagenize the viruses with

01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:48.190
you mutagenize the viruses with
 

01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:50.760
you mutagenize the viruses with
chemicals that introduce mutations so

01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:50.770
chemicals that introduce mutations so
 

01:00:50.770 --> 01:00:52.620
chemicals that introduce mutations so
that you can get mutants where you can't

01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:52.630
that you can get mutants where you can't
 

01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:54.780
that you can get mutants where you can't
otherwise so some of the mutations that

01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:54.790
otherwise so some of the mutations that
 

01:00:54.790 --> 01:00:57.570
otherwise so some of the mutations that
were used or listed here nitrous acid

01:00:57.570 --> 01:00:57.580
were used or listed here nitrous acid
 

01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:01.260
were used or listed here nitrous acid
hydroxyl amine and alkylating agents

01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:01.270
hydroxyl amine and alkylating agents
 

01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:03.210
hydroxyl amine and alkylating agents
they modify the DNA such that when the

01:01:03.210 --> 01:01:03.220
they modify the DNA such that when the
 

01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:05.040
they modify the DNA such that when the
replication occurs you get miss pairing

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:05.050
replication occurs you get miss pairing
 

01:01:05.050 --> 01:01:06.900
replication occurs you get miss pairing
so if you find any of these chemicals

01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:06.910
so if you find any of these chemicals
 

01:01:06.910 --> 01:01:08.720
so if you find any of these chemicals
anywhere don't ingest them they're very

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:08.730
anywhere don't ingest them they're very
 

01:01:08.730 --> 01:01:11.130
anywhere don't ingest them they're very
mutagenic they will cause mutations in

01:01:11.130 --> 01:01:11.140
mutagenic they will cause mutations in
 

01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:13.830
mutagenic they will cause mutations in
your DNA there are also base analogs

01:01:13.830 --> 01:01:13.840
your DNA there are also base analogs
 

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:16.380
your DNA there are also base analogs
that cause changes in DNA during

01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:16.390
that cause changes in DNA during
 

01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:19.200
that cause changes in DNA during
replication UV also does that as well so

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:19.210
replication UV also does that as well so
 

01:01:19.210 --> 01:01:20.960
replication UV also does that as well so
all of these were used to mute

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:20.970
all of these were used to mute
 

01:01:20.970 --> 01:01:23.810
all of these were used to mute
nice viruses to induce mutations when

01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:23.820

you extract the RNA from polio virus and

01:03:51.999 --> 01:03:52.009
you extract the RNA from polio virus and
 

01:03:52.009 --> 01:03:54.410
you extract the RNA from polio virus and
transfected into cultured cells you will

01:03:54.410 --> 01:03:54.420
transfected into cultured cells you will
 

01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:56.989
transfected into cultured cells you will
initiate an infectious cycle so the RNA

01:03:56.989 --> 01:03:56.999
initiate an infectious cycle so the RNA
 

01:03:56.999 --> 01:03:58.009
initiate an infectious cycle so the RNA
is infectious

01:03:58.009 --> 01:03:58.019
is infectious
 

01:03:58.019 --> 01:04:00.109

you can take this RNA and make a

01:04:00.109 --> 01:04:00.119
you can take this RNA and make a
 

01:04:00.119 --> 01:04:02.719
you can take this RNA and make a
double-stranded DNA copy of it and clone

01:04:02.719 --> 01:04:02.729
double-stranded DNA copy of it and clone
 

01:04:02.729 --> 01:04:04.969
double-stranded DNA copy of it and clone
it into a plasmid and then use the

01:04:04.969 --> 01:04:04.979
it into a plasmid and then use the
 

01:04:04.979 --> 01:04:07.489
it into a plasmid and then use the
plasmid to make RNA in vitro with

01:04:07.489 --> 01:04:07.499
plasmid to make RNA in vitro with
 

01:04:07.499 --> 01:04:09.709
plasmid to make RNA in vitro with
various enzymes and then you can take

01:04:09.709 --> 01:04:09.719
various enzymes and then you can take
 

01:04:09.719 --> 01:04:11.359
various enzymes and then you can take
that RNA and put it into cells and you

01:04:11.359 --> 01:04:11.369
that RNA and put it into cells and you
 

01:04:11.369 --> 01:04:13.009
that RNA and put it into cells and you
will get virus again because this is

01:04:13.009 --> 01:04:13.019
will get virus again because this is
 

01:04:13.019 --> 01:04:15.559
will get virus again because this is
very much like the viral RNA this is

01:04:15.559 --> 01:04:15.569
very much like the viral RNA this is
 

01:04:15.569 --> 01:04:17.809
very much like the viral RNA this is
great because you can modify this DNA

01:04:17.809 --> 01:04:17.819
great because you can modify this DNA
 

01:04:17.819 --> 01:04:19.429
great because you can modify this DNA
again you can mutate it you can add

01:04:19.429 --> 01:04:19.439
again you can mutate it you can add
 

01:04:19.439 --> 01:04:21.140
again you can mutate it you can add
bases subtract them change them you

01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:21.150
bases subtract them change them you
 

01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:22.880
bases subtract them change them you
could add sequences from other viruses

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:22.890
could add sequences from other viruses
 

01:04:22.890 --> 01:04:24.979
could add sequences from other viruses
can do whatever you want you can't do

01:04:24.979 --> 01:04:24.989
can do whatever you want you can't do
 

01:04:24.989 --> 01:04:28.160
can do whatever you want you can't do
that with RNA so we can we can do

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:28.170
that with RNA so we can we can do
 

01:04:28.170 --> 01:04:30.919
that with RNA so we can we can do
genetics having DNA copies of viral

01:04:30.919 --> 01:04:30.929
genetics having DNA copies of viral
 

01:04:30.929 --> 01:04:32.839
genetics having DNA copies of viral
genomes to do the same thing with

01:04:32.839 --> 01:04:32.849
genomes to do the same thing with
 

01:04:32.849 --> 01:04:36.160
genomes to do the same thing with
influenza virus influenza virus has

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:36.170
influenza virus influenza virus has
 

01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:40.459
influenza virus influenza virus has
eight negative stranded RNA segments so

01:04:40.459 --> 01:04:40.469
eight negative stranded RNA segments so
 

01:04:40.469 --> 01:04:42.109
eight negative stranded RNA segments so
what you have to do for that virus is

01:04:42.109 --> 01:04:42.119
what you have to do for that virus is
 

01:04:42.119 --> 01:04:44.179
what you have to do for that virus is
you have to clone each of the eight RNA

01:04:44.179 --> 01:04:44.189
you have to clone each of the eight RNA
 

01:04:44.189 --> 01:04:46.579
you have to clone each of the eight RNA
segments into a plasmid and then you

01:04:46.579 --> 01:04:46.589
segments into a plasmid and then you
 

01:04:46.589 --> 01:04:48.499
segments into a plasmid and then you
engineer the plasmid which is shown in a

01:04:48.499 --> 01:04:48.509
engineer the plasmid which is shown in a
 

01:04:48.509 --> 01:04:51.259
engineer the plasmid which is shown in a
linear way here to make both plus and

01:04:51.259 --> 01:04:51.269
linear way here to make both plus and
 

01:04:51.269 --> 01:04:54.140
linear way here to make both plus and
minus strand copies of the RNA the

01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:54.150
minus strand copies of the RNA the
 

01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:56.179
minus strand copies of the RNA the
reason you have to do that we don't need

01:04:56.179 --> 01:04:56.189
reason you have to do that we don't need
 

01:04:56.189 --> 01:04:58.009
reason you have to do that we don't need
to go into but basically you take eight

01:04:58.009 --> 01:04:58.019
to go into but basically you take eight
 

01:04:58.019 --> 01:05:01.519
to go into but basically you take eight
plasmids each plasmid encoding a one of

01:05:01.519 --> 01:05:01.529
plasmids each plasmid encoding a one of
 

01:05:01.529 --> 01:05:03.919
plasmids each plasmid encoding a one of
the viral RNAs you put those into cells

01:05:03.919 --> 01:05:03.929
the viral RNAs you put those into cells
 

01:05:03.929 --> 01:05:06.109
the viral RNAs you put those into cells
eight plasmid transfection and you get

01:05:06.109 --> 01:05:06.119
eight plasmid transfection and you get
 

01:05:06.119 --> 01:05:08.839
eight plasmid transfection and you get
virus out so again with influenza you

01:05:08.839 --> 01:05:08.849
virus out so again with influenza you
 

01:05:08.849 --> 01:05:10.489
virus out so again with influenza you
can do the same thing as with the corn

01:05:10.489 --> 01:05:10.499
can do the same thing as with the corn
 

01:05:10.499 --> 01:05:12.019
can do the same thing as with the corn
of viruses you can make changes in the

01:05:12.019 --> 01:05:12.029
of viruses you can make changes in the
 

01:05:12.029 --> 01:05:14.509
of viruses you can make changes in the
virus and see what their effect is now

01:05:14.509 --> 01:05:14.519
virus and see what their effect is now
 

01:05:14.519 --> 01:05:17.509
virus and see what their effect is now
this technique was used to rescue the

01:05:17.509 --> 01:05:17.519
this technique was used to rescue the
 

01:05:17.519 --> 01:05:20.839
this technique was used to rescue the
flu virus of 1918 we didn't have cell

01:05:20.839 --> 01:05:20.849
flu virus of 1918 we didn't have cell
 

01:05:20.849 --> 01:05:22.819
flu virus of 1918 we didn't have cell
culture in 1918 you know there was a

01:05:22.819 --> 01:05:22.829
culture in 1918 you know there was a
 

01:05:22.829 --> 01:05:24.650
culture in 1918 you know there was a
huge pandemic back then millions of

01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:24.660
huge pandemic back then millions of
 

01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:26.209
huge pandemic back then millions of
people died but we don't have the virus

01:05:26.209 --> 01:05:26.219
people died but we don't have the virus
 

01:05:26.219 --> 01:05:28.609
people died but we don't have the virus
from it so it's a shame we would like to

01:05:28.609 --> 01:05:28.619
from it so it's a shame we would like to
 

01:05:28.619 --> 01:05:31.579
from it so it's a shame we would like to
study it so what people did was they

01:05:31.579 --> 01:05:31.589
study it so what people did was they
 

01:05:31.589 --> 01:05:33.829
study it so what people did was they
resurrected it was we didn't it we

01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839
resurrected it was we didn't it we
 

01:05:33.839 --> 01:05:39.739
resurrected it was we didn't it we
didn't have flu until 1933 in 2005 viral

01:05:39.739 --> 01:05:39.749
didn't have flu until 1933 in 2005 viral
 

01:05:39.749 --> 01:05:41.650
didn't have flu until 1933 in 2005 viral
RNA was isolated from formalin-fixed

01:05:41.650 --> 01:05:41.660
RNA was isolated from formalin-fixed
 

01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:44.839
RNA was isolated from formalin-fixed
lung samples from someone who had died

01:05:44.839 --> 01:05:44.849
lung samples from someone who had died
 

01:05:44.849 --> 01:05:47.059
lung samples from someone who had died
in 1918 so the army you know a lot of

01:05:47.059 --> 01:05:47.069
in 1918 so the army you know a lot of
 

01:05:47.069 --> 01:05:48.670
in 1918 so the army you know a lot of
military people died of flu

01:05:48.670 --> 01:05:48.680
military people died of flu
 

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:51.500
military people died of flu
1918-19 and whenever they died the army

01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:51.510
1918-19 and whenever they died the army
 

01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:53.270
1918-19 and whenever they died the army
would take sections of their lungs and

01:05:53.270 --> 01:05:53.280
would take sections of their lungs and
 

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:54.830
would take sections of their lungs and
they would put them away very good at

01:05:54.830 --> 01:05:54.840
they would put them away very good at
 

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:56.870
they would put them away very good at
keeping these sections they're all in

01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:56.880
keeping these sections they're all in
 

01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:58.610
keeping these sections they're all in
order so if someone went back to those

01:05:58.610 --> 01:05:58.620
order so if someone went back to those
 

01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:01.100
order so if someone went back to those
archives took some of those sections on

01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:01.110
archives took some of those sections on
 

01:06:01.110 --> 01:06:02.750
archives took some of those sections on
slides and took off the tissue and

01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:02.760
slides and took off the tissue and
 

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:05.480
slides and took off the tissue and
extract and RNA got the sequence of the

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:05.490
extract and RNA got the sequence of the
 

01:06:05.490 --> 01:06:09.320
extract and RNA got the sequence of the
RNA they also got RNA from someone who

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:09.330
RNA they also got RNA from someone who
 

01:06:09.330 --> 01:06:12.080
RNA they also got RNA from someone who
had died of flu in 1918 and they were

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:12.090
had died of flu in 1918 and they were
 

01:06:12.090 --> 01:06:14.390
had died of flu in 1918 and they were
buried up in Alaska was the ground is

01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:14.400
buried up in Alaska was the ground is
 

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.550
buried up in Alaska was the ground is
frozen all the time so they opened the

01:06:16.550 --> 01:06:16.560
frozen all the time so they opened the
 

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:18.710
frozen all the time so they opened the
grave and they did a biopsy of the lung

01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720
grave and they did a biopsy of the lung
 

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:21.170
grave and they did a biopsy of the lung
and they took the tissue extracted the

01:06:21.170 --> 01:06:21.180
and they took the tissue extracted the
 

01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:22.910
and they took the tissue extracted the
RNA in sequence did so they could

01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:22.920
RNA in sequence did so they could
 

01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:25.250
RNA in sequence did so they could
reconstruct the sequence of the entire

01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:25.260
reconstruct the sequence of the entire
 

01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:27.980
reconstruct the sequence of the entire
virus so they made eight plasmids of the

01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:27.990
virus so they made eight plasmids of the
 

01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:31.430
virus so they made eight plasmids of the
1918 virus put those into cells and they

01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:31.440
1918 virus put those into cells and they
 

01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:35.300
1918 virus put those into cells and they
got the 1918 virus out complete sequence

01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:35.310
got the 1918 virus out complete sequence
 

01:06:35.310 --> 01:06:37.550
got the 1918 virus out complete sequence
and virus has recovered of course you

01:06:37.550 --> 01:06:37.560
and virus has recovered of course you
 

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.050
and virus has recovered of course you
have to study this under very high

01:06:39.050 --> 01:06:39.060
have to study this under very high
 

01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:41.360
have to study this under very high
containment you can't just do it up the

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:41.370
containment you can't just do it up the
 

01:06:41.370 --> 01:06:44.060
containment you can't just do it up the
street here you have to do it in a bsl-3

01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:44.070
street here you have to do it in a bsl-3
 

01:06:44.070 --> 01:06:47.480
street here you have to do it in a bsl-3
facility because it it's a very lethal

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:47.490
facility because it it's a very lethal
 

01:06:47.490 --> 01:06:49.160
facility because it it's a very lethal
virus but this shows you how you can

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:49.170
virus but this shows you how you can
 

01:06:49.170 --> 01:06:53.120
virus but this shows you how you can
reconstruct viruses from viruses that we

01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:53.130
reconstruct viruses from viruses that we
 

01:06:53.130 --> 01:06:55.580
reconstruct viruses from viruses that we
don't even have anymore now the other

01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:55.590
don't even have anymore now the other
 

01:06:55.590 --> 01:06:57.500
don't even have anymore now the other
thing you can do with having cloned

01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:57.510
thing you can do with having cloned
 

01:06:57.510 --> 01:06:59.470
thing you can do with having cloned
viral genomes and the ability to

01:06:59.470 --> 01:06:59.480

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:02.510
viral genomes and the ability to
resurrect viruses from DNA is you can

01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:02.520
resurrect viruses from DNA is you can
 

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:05.660
resurrect viruses from DNA is you can
make vectors and vectors are good for

01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:05.670
make vectors and vectors are good for
 

01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:08.360
make vectors and vectors are good for
research but they can also be used to

01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:08.370
research but they can also be used to
 

01:07:08.370 --> 01:07:12.350
research but they can also be used to
treat human diseases so congenial goal

01:07:12.350 --> 01:07:12.360
treat human diseases so congenial goal
 

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:14.270
treat human diseases so congenial goal
is to deliver a gene to patients who

01:07:14.270 --> 01:07:14.280
is to deliver a gene to patients who
 

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.190
is to deliver a gene to patients who
lack it or have a mutation and you can

01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:16.200
lack it or have a mutation and you can
 

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:19.400
lack it or have a mutation and you can
use viral vectors to do that so one way

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:19.410
use viral vectors to do that so one way
 

01:07:19.410 --> 01:07:21.470
use viral vectors to do that so one way
to do it is to take cells from a patient

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:21.480
to do it is to take cells from a patient
 

01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:23.510
to do it is to take cells from a patient
infect them with a virus vector that

01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520
infect them with a virus vector that
 

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:25.520
infect them with a virus vector that
expresses the gene and then put them

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:25.530
expresses the gene and then put them
 

01:07:25.530 --> 01:07:27.860
expresses the gene and then put them
back into the patient you can use these

01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:27.870
back into the patient you can use these
 

01:07:27.870 --> 01:07:30.890
back into the patient you can use these
vectors to deliver antigens in other

01:07:30.890 --> 01:07:30.900
vectors to deliver antigens in other
 

01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:32.720
vectors to deliver antigens in other
words you can make a viral vaccine from

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:32.730
words you can make a viral vaccine from
 

01:07:32.730 --> 01:07:34.580
words you can make a viral vaccine from
such vectors and we use them in the

01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:34.590
such vectors and we use them in the
 

01:07:34.590 --> 01:07:37.670
such vectors and we use them in the
research lab as well these vectors have

01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680
research lab as well these vectors have
 

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:40.010
