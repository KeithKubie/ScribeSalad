00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.190
So, now that we know a little bit about

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.360
class variables, both the ones that we created and the

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.360
ones that come by default or predefined in Python classes,

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.340
I want to take a moment to talk about the

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.290
next big idea in object-oriented programming which is called

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.660
inheritance. Now, let's think about the meaning of this word

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.110
inheritance and how we use it in the English language.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.570
You may have heard someone say that a child can

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.460
inherit some traits from their parents. Things like the last

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.369
name, the eye color, some money, if the kid is

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.940
lucky. So, if we were to take this meaning of

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.110
inheritance, like we commonly use it in the English language,

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.330
and turn it into code or model this in terms

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.890
of programming, we would create a class called Parent. Which

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.530
would have some attributes like last name and eye color.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.740
And then we would make a class called class Child which

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.140
would inherit these two things from the class Parent.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.010
Additionally, the class Child could have another variable of

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.570
its own called number of toys. Now, you may

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.670
notice that if we design code like this, we are

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.820
already beginning to reuse code, which is a huge

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.270
advantage of object oriented programming. Okay, so the next thing

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.340
we are going to do is take our design

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.190
and convert it into actual code. Let's do that next.
