Hello, DevFest Ukraine.

00:00:02.715 --> 00:00:04.376
[FANFARE PLAYING]

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.900
I am sorry that I'm not
joining you live in Lviv,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.560
but I am sure that
you're going to have

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.830
a blast of that a DevFest.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.610
Have two great days,
keep your eyes open,

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.040
and don't lift those fingers
off that coding keyboard.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.430
And as a tribute to
Ukraine and your DevFest,

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.690
I've decided to record something
very personal-- me dancing

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.815
a traditional folk dance.

00:00:31.815 --> 00:00:34.725

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.960
That was awesome.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.690
Now remember, when you code,
use Google Play Services,

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.610
because you will be
building better apps.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.060
So build some great apps
now at the DevFest Ukraine.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.230
And don't forget to tell me
everything about the event.
