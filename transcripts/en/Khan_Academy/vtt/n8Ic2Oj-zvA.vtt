00:00:00.245 --> 00:00:01.630
Voiceover:Which of the following

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:03.791
can represent a vector?

00:00:03.791 --> 00:00:05.618
A vector is something that

00:00:05.618 --> 00:00:09.091
has both a magnitude and a direction.

00:00:09.091 --> 00:00:10.862
Let's see which one of these
could represent something

00:00:10.862 --> 00:00:12.762
that has a magnitude and a direction.

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:16.001
The first choice right
over here is the number 5.

00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:19.403
5 could represent a magnitude,

00:00:19.403 --> 00:00:21.733
you could say, essentially,
how large something is.

00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.459
That's all the information has.

00:00:23.459 --> 00:00:25.747
It doesn't say 5 in a certain direction.

00:00:25.747 --> 00:00:28.157
This one by itself would not be a

00:00:28.157 --> 00:00:30.093
or it couldn't represent a vector.

00:00:30.093 --> 00:00:32.973
You need to specify a direction as well.

00:00:32.973 --> 00:00:36.095
The angle measure 5 degrees.

00:00:36.095 --> 00:00:37.957
Well the angle measure 5 degrees

00:00:37.957 --> 00:00:39.370
could represent a direction.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.604
If you say it's 5 degrees.

00:00:40.604 --> 00:00:43.806
Let's say that's the positive X axis

00:00:43.806 --> 00:00:45.876
that's the positive Y axis.

00:00:45.876 --> 00:00:47.930
If you said it's 5 degrees relative

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.739
to the positive X axis.

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.555
If you said something like this,

00:00:52.555 --> 00:00:54.318
so if you had 5 degrees over there,

00:00:54.318 --> 00:00:56.300
that would be specifying a direction,

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.069
but it's not giving us a magnitude.

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:00.186
It's not saying how far in that direction

00:01:00.186 --> 00:01:02.747
or how large in that direction.

00:01:02.747 --> 00:01:04.424
An angle measure of 5 degrees,

00:01:04.424 --> 00:01:06.304
you're giving us a direction,

00:01:06.304 --> 00:01:07.589
but no magnitude.

00:01:07.589 --> 00:01:09.400
Let's just cross these out.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.993
The  point (5,5). Now this is interesting.

00:01:13.362 --> 00:01:17.543
If we say that the point is
the end point of a vector

00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:20.925
that starts at the origin,

00:01:20.925 --> 00:01:22.647
so lets draw that out.

00:01:22.876 --> 00:01:25.884
That's the positive X
axis, positive Y axis.

00:01:25.884 --> 00:01:31.419
This is 1,2,3,4,5 in the
horizontal direction.

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:35.747
1,2,3,4,5 in the positive
vertical direction.

00:01:35.747 --> 00:01:40.038
The .5,5 is going to be right over there.

00:01:40.038 --> 00:01:46.339
If you said that this
represents the head of a vector

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:48.508
who's tail is at the origin.

00:01:50.646 --> 00:01:53.151
The vector would look something like this.

00:01:53.151 --> 00:01:56.903
Now, you're giving both a
magnitude and a direction.

00:01:56.903 --> 00:01:58.272
What's the magnitude?

00:01:58.272 --> 00:01:59.828
What's the distance between the origin

00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:01.724
and this point, right over here.

00:02:01.724 --> 00:02:04.532
You could solve using the Pythagorean theorem

00:02:04.532 --> 00:02:12.122
and the direction, it's
this general direction.

00:02:12.122 --> 00:02:16.906
This could specify a
magnitude and a direction.

00:02:16.906 --> 00:02:19.278
This could represent a vector.

00:02:19.478 --> 00:02:23.590
The outcome of 5+5,
obviously that's just 10.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.652
That's just a number.

00:02:24.652 --> 00:02:26.083
For the same reason, this first choice,

00:02:26.083 --> 00:02:27.118
if I just have a number,

00:02:27.118 --> 00:02:28.117
that could be a magnitude,

00:02:28.117 --> 00:02:29.845
but we don't have a direction as well.

00:02:29.845 --> 00:02:32.333
This could not represent and

00:02:32.333 --> 00:02:34.730
that one could not represent a vector.
