You better get ready to use that pause button
because you don’t want to miss any of these

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.540
hidden Easter Eggs. These Disney moments move
by so fast that if you don’t pause the screen

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.010
you will never notice them but don’t you
worry. We’ve got you covered and we will

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.630

Here is Screen Rant’s list of ten Paused
Disney Moments That Reveal Hidden Easter Eggs.

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:37.860
Monsters, Inc.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.480
When the scarers go in and out of doors to
scare little children pay close attention

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.670
to the items on the doors. Like most children,
the kids in Monsters, Inc. place stickers

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.950
on the outside of their doors and if you look
closely you’ll notice something special

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.690
about these stickers. They are the little
critter characters from the Woody’s Round-Up

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.940
TV show in Toy Story 2. It looks like Woody
is still popular during the time of Monsters,

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:04.500
Inc. maybe that’s why Jesse shows up in
Boo’s room.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.000
Inside Out

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.660
Inside Out has several Easter Eggs and we
have mentioned quite a few of them in past

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.240
videos but one arrives in the beginning of
the film that if you were still getting popcorn

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.490
you might have missed it. When the Anderson
family is driving to their new home they drive

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.410
past a field of corn but look at the telephone
wires. Sitting on the wires are the birds

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.930
from the Pixar short, For the Birds. The cool
part is, For the Birds must have taken place

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.070
in the fall when the corn is dried up and
Inside Out during the spring as it grows.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:38.360
It looks like no one headed south for the
winter.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.760
Cars 2

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.780
The Pizza Planet truck is a popular Easter
egg to spot and in Cars 2 he shows up during

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.280
the casual race as a spectator. This one isn’t
so hard to spot but many people don’t realize

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.500
he’s in two scenes in this film. When Guido
is showing off his drink mixing skills stop

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.870
looking at him and look above him to the TV.
The Pizza Planet truck is being interviewed,

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.650
maybe that’s why he’s in so many Pixar
films, he’s a world famous celebrity!

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.650
Toy Story

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.321
The first Toy Story film is what started it
all for Disney, Pixar and rightly so, this

00:02:06.321 --> 00:02:10.780
film still holds up today and will for another
bazillion years. We’re pretty sure no one

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.489
will argue with us on that point but one argument
that stands the test of time is Star Trek

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.269
versus Star Wars. The people at Pixar couldn’t
make a choice in 1995’s Toy Story. Check

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.780
out Buzz’s hand when he says goodbye, Spock
would be proud and when Buzz talks about Emperor

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:33.700
Zurg’s evil plan. He speaks directly about
the Death Star 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:45.700
even in part two we find out Buzz is the son
of Zurg. Sound familiar?

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.989
Finding Dory

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.129
In Finding Nemo we learned that the dentist
not only likes to cause pain to the children

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.909
he works on but he also likes to provide his
niece with fish, no matter how many she kills.

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:59.950
She shouldn’t own fish and it seems like
the people at the Marine Life Institute know

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.470
she shouldn’t too. In Finding Dory they
have her picture up on the wall at the institute.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.909
Or maybe it’s hanging there because she
belongs in the quarantine section because

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:14.349
something is wrong with her.

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:15.349
Cars

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:19.120
George Carlin is highly regarded as one of
the greatest and most influential stand-up

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.040
comedians of all time. Despite a great career
in stand-up he also provided the voice of

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.060
the character Fillmore in 2006’s Cars. The
characters in this film are usually moving

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.709
and we never get too close to the license
plates but many of the license plates have

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:37.030
double means. For instance Fillmore’s license
plate reads 51237, which stands for Carlin’s

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.890
birthdate, May 12th 1937.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.819
A Bug’s Life

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.579
Here is one that you have to pause two different
films and have a pretty good eye. In the film

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.560
A Bug’s Life the ants live under a fancy
looking tree that seems to mean more than

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.099
meets the eye. If you watch Toy Story 2 you
will notice that the film has the same exact

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.840
tree in it. Just look at that shape! With
the erosion around the tree in A Bug’s Life

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.719
we have to wonder what event took place to
cause that erosion and will that be the subject

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:06.060
of an upcoming Pixar film?

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.709
The Black Cauldron

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.019
In the 1980’s Disney was looking at the
success of Jim Henson’s 1982 film The Dark

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.630
Crystal for inspiration. They saw that dark,
fantasy adventure films were on the rise and

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.780
they wanted to get into that market. That’s
why they released The Black Cauldron in 1985;

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.090
but they also pulled inspiration from their
1953 film Peter Pan. When Taran heads into

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.390
a cave, he is surrounded by fairies and one
is none other than the attitude filled, Tinkerbell.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.380
Remember to only think happy thoughts.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.840
Zootopia

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.950
Zootopia has numerous references to pop culture
that they even hired Shakira to portray Gazelle.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.730
Judy Hopps even has a portable music player
with music from Fur Fighters, Fleetwood Yak,

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.120
and The Beagles but we only caught one from
Star Wars. When the stars of Zootopia break

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.040
into Cliffside they look around with a flashlight.
Pause the video and you will see the code

00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:00.870
TK-421 on the wall, as any good Star Wars
fan knows, this is reference to a foolish

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.420
Stormtrooper that fell for the oldest trick
in the book.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.970
The Incredibles

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:13.990
When Elastigirl flies a plane, she identifies
her plane to the radio tower. It stands for

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:20.250
I G 99, which also stands for the Iron Giant
that was released in 1999 by director, Brad

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.890
Bird. Then when she is in the control tower,
A113 makes an appearance too. A113 refers

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:30.380
to a classroom number at the California Institute
of Arts, where many artists from Disney started

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.580
their careers including Brad Bird. Looks like
Bird likes to reference his past.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.600
There you have it ten ten Paused Disney Moments
That Reveal Hidden Easter Eggs. Don’t forget
