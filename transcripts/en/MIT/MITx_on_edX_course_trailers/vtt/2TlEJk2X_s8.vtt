00:00:00.906 --> 00:00:03.420
MARK SHOTLAND: Greetings from
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.800
My name is Mark Shotland.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.640
I'm the director of training at the
Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:15.530
The Jameel Poverty Action Lab,
or J-PAL, is a research center

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.410
in the Economics Department
of The Massachusetts

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.310
Institute of Technology, MIT.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.410
J-PAL has been offering an
executive education course

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.470
on evaluating social
programs since 2005.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.990
So we'll be coming up on the tenth
run of this course this year.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.510
We've also offered this course about
30 other times, across the globe,

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.045
leveraging our regional offices
in South Asia, Europe, Africa,

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:49.120
and Southeast Asia.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.650
So, I would like to welcome you to
the online version of course hosted

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.410
by MITx, part of the edX consortium.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.790
J-PAL's Evaluating
Social Program course is

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.930
targeted for policymakers
and practitioners

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.270
from governments, NGOs, international
aid agencies, foundations,

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.610
and other donors.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.050
And basically, it's purpose for
them-- if you're part of this group,

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.190
it's purpose is to
help give you the tools

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.340
to distinguish good
evidence from bad evidence,

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.670
assuming you want to incorporate
evidence into your decision making

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.160
process.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.940
It should also help you
identify opportunities

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.390
for when to do an evaluation and
how to do an evaluation, assuming

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.860
you want to evaluate your
own programs and policies.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.940
It's also targeted to academics and
evaluators who are looking to retool.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.150
Particularly, the
focus of this course is

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.650
on impact evaluation
and a particular kind

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.870
of impact evaluation,
randomized valuations

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.720
or randomized controlled trials.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.980
So, I would like to welcome you to edX.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:11.035
Welcome you to J-PAL 101x,
Evaluating Social Programs.

00:02:11.035 --> 00:02:11.534
