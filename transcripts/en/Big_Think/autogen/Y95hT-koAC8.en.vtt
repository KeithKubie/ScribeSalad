it's a biology based in stem cells and
genetics and it has to do with

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.940
little more perspective let me remind
you that in the last century beginning

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950
you that in the last century beginning
 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.010

with Mendel's discoveries of peas and
 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.130
with Mendel's discoveries of peas and
genetic inheritance we learned about how

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140
genetic inheritance we learned about how
 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.319
genetic inheritance we learned about how
the genes we inherit from our mother and

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329
the genes we inherit from our mother and
 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.990
the genes we inherit from our mother and
father affect who we are that was

made of DNA the chemical stuff of
 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.059
made of DNA the chemical stuff of
genes is DNA and we now understand quite

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069
genes is DNA and we now understand quite
 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.070
genes is DNA and we now understand quite
a bit about how genes encode the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080
a bit about how genes encode the
 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.009
a bit about how genes encode the
proteins that are found in our body it

appearing in the popular press that all
 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.479
appearing in the popular press that all
we are is our DNA and we're much more

or ourselves what kind of proteins can
be made but the DNA doesn't define who

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819
be made but the DNA doesn't define who
 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.630
be made but the DNA doesn't define who
we are so what has been lost in this

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640
we are so what has been lost in this
 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.509
we are so what has been lost in this
discussion up till now is the idea that

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519
discussion up till now is the idea that
 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.170
discussion up till now is the idea that
the real unit of biology is not DNA but

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180
the real unit of biology is not DNA but
 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.410
the real unit of biology is not DNA but
is instead of cell cells are alive cells

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420
is instead of cell cells are alive cells
 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.440
is instead of cell cells are alive cells
make more cells and cells are the units

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450
make more cells and cells are the units
 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.750
make more cells and cells are the units
that allow us to harness the future of

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760
that allow us to harness the future of
 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.660
that allow us to harness the future of
our bodies and regenerative medicine in

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670
our bodies and regenerative medicine in
 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.699
our bodies and regenerative medicine in
order to make sense of this we have to

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709
order to make sense of this we have to
 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.650
order to make sense of this we have to
dig into a little bit of a kind of

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660
dig into a little bit of a kind of
 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.600
dig into a little bit of a kind of
biology called developmental biology

has to do with answering the question
 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.580
has to do with answering the question
how does an egg become a human being how

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590
how does an egg become a human being how
 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.580
how does an egg become a human being how
does it make make a human body

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590
 
 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.259
 
I'm going to show you some pictures of

I'm going to show you some pictures of
 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.150
I'm going to show you some pictures of
how this happens and talk a bit about

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160
how this happens and talk a bit about
 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.479
how this happens and talk a bit about
the very early stages of human life in

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489
the very early stages of human life in
 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.670
the very early stages of human life in
this picture here you see the first

this picture here you see the first
 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.160
this picture here you see the first
spark that starts human development that

spark that starts human development that
 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.400
spark that starts human development that
is fertilization you see a large yellow

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410
is fertilization you see a large yellow
 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.860

wins one of those blue headed sperm and
 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.570
wins one of those blue headed sperm and
that then leads to the first step which

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580
that then leads to the first step which
 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.270
that then leads to the first step which
will be cell division cell division

many of you will have heard about

00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:53.199
many of you will have heard about
 

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:55.020
many of you will have heard about
cloning and I'm going to explain that to

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:55.030
cloning and I'm going to explain that to
 

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.149
cloning and I'm going to explain that to
you in a bit of detail now because it

00:07:57.149 --> 00:07:57.159
you in a bit of detail now because it
 

00:07:57.159 --> 00:07:59.309
you in a bit of detail now because it
establishes a very important principle

00:07:59.309 --> 00:07:59.319
establishes a very important principle
 

00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:01.770
establishes a very important principle
that all of the cells in our body have

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:01.780
that all of the cells in our body have
 

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.200
that all of the cells in our body have

frog those two a male and a female frog
 

00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:29.129
frog those two a male and a female frog
were mated to make an albino frog and

00:08:29.129 --> 00:08:29.139
were mated to make an albino frog and
 

00:08:29.139 --> 00:08:32.100
were mated to make an albino frog and
then nuclei were taken from that and

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:32.110
then nuclei were taken from that and
 

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:34.290
then nuclei were taken from that and
injected into the egg of the donor

00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:34.300

that's a wild-type or a normal frog and
 

00:08:36.729 --> 00:08:39.810
that's a wild-type or a normal frog and
that then gave rise as I've said to this

00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:39.820
that then gave rise as I've said to this
 

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.019

00:11:39.939 --> 00:11:41.519
I'm reasonably confident that hasn't
been done because it's not a trivial

00:11:41.519 --> 00:11:41.529
been done because it's not a trivial
 

00:11:41.529 --> 00:11:44.309
been done because it's not a trivial
thing to do nevertheless there is the

00:11:44.309 --> 00:11:44.319
thing to do nevertheless there is the
 

00:11:44.319 --> 00:11:45.749
thing to do nevertheless there is the
question of should it be done at all

00:11:45.749 --> 00:11:45.759
question of should it be done at all
 

00:11:45.759 --> 00:11:48.299
question of should it be done at all
well scientists like myself have no

00:11:48.299 --> 00:11:48.309
well scientists like myself have no
 

00:11:48.309 --> 00:11:50.309
well scientists like myself have no
interest in cloning humans because we've

00:11:50.309 --> 00:11:50.319
interest in cloning humans because we've
 

00:11:50.319 --> 00:11:52.350
interest in cloning humans because we've
already learned the biological principle

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:52.360
already learned the biological principle
 

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.139

principles we need and want to know from

principles we need and want to know from
 

00:11:55.149 --> 00:11:57.419
principles we need and want to know from
cloning but it does raise an interesting

00:11:57.419 --> 00:11:57.429
cloning but it does raise an interesting
 

00:11:57.429 --> 00:11:59.489
cloning but it does raise an interesting
ethical question or a moral question

00:11:59.489 --> 00:11:59.499
ethical question or a moral question
 

00:11:59.499 --> 00:12:04.049
ethical question or a moral question
should one clone humans some arguments

should one clone humans some arguments
 

00:12:04.059 --> 00:12:05.730
should one clone humans some arguments
against this have been that it would be

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:05.740
against this have been that it would be
 

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:07.289
against this have been that it would be
wrong to make genetically identical

00:12:07.289 --> 00:12:07.299
wrong to make genetically identical
 

00:12:07.299 --> 00:12:09.780

individuals well that's sort of a silly

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:09.790
individuals well that's sort of a silly
 

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.819
individuals well that's sort of a silly
argument because identical twins are

and the phenotype of a human by creating
 

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.100
and the phenotype of a human by creating
an identical copy and I think that's

an identical copy and I think that's

location tissue turnover rate so we
 

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:52.350
location tissue turnover rate so we
believe that by looking at the biology

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:52.360
believe that by looking at the biology
 

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.960
believe that by looking at the biology
of stem cells we can change the rate of

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:54.970
of stem cells we can change the rate of
 

00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:57.780
of stem cells we can change the rate of
that process not reverse it nor can we

that process not reverse it nor can we
 

00:36:57.790 --> 00:37:01.230
that process not reverse it nor can we
make it stop but we can slow it down so

going to show you one experiment which

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:10.840
going to show you one experiment which
 

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.630
going to show you one experiment which
has given us confidence that this can

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:12.640
has given us confidence that this can
 

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:15.150
has given us confidence that this can
happen this involves putting two mice

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:15.160
happen this involves putting two mice
 

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:17.340
happen this involves putting two mice
together what we call para biotic mice

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:17.350
together what we call para biotic mice
 

00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:19.590
together what we call para biotic mice
and it's a kind of experiment I call a

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:19.600
and it's a kind of experiment I call a
 

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.530
and it's a kind of experiment I call a
Fountain of Youth experiment what we do

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:22.540
Fountain of Youth experiment what we do
 

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:24.660
Fountain of Youth experiment what we do
in this experiment is remove the outer

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:24.670
in this experiment is remove the outer
 

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:25.380
in this experiment is remove the outer
skin of

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:25.390
skin of
 

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:27.660

two mice and sew them together kind of

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:27.670
two mice and sew them together kind of
 

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:29.040
two mice and sew them together kind of
like Siamese twins

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:29.050

so we now will have a young Mouse and an
 

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:32.760
so we now will have a young Mouse and an
old mouse sewn together and the

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:32.770
old mouse sewn together and the
 

00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:34.920
old mouse sewn together and the
consequence of that is that they share

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:34.930
consequence of that is that they share
 

00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:36.450
consequence of that is that they share
their bloodstream they're really quite
