00:00:15.987 --> 00:00:17.570
ADDY OSMANI: So do
you know that thing

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.370
where you're given a
budget, and basically it's

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:20.810
enough to buy a
few cans of soup?

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:21.220
MATT GAUNT: Yep.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.928
ADDY OSMANI: We sort
of spent all of ours

00:00:22.928 --> 00:00:24.146
on the animated intro.

00:00:24.146 --> 00:00:25.770
MATT GAUNT: But it's
a very nice intro.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:26.561
ADDY OSMANI: It is.

00:00:26.561 --> 00:00:29.060
MATT GAUNT: And we can do this.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.412
ADDY OSMANI: Your leg's on fire.

00:00:30.412 --> 00:00:31.566
MATT GAUNT: Ah!

00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.065
So the reason we're
doing this video

00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:35.900
is we've recorded a brand new
season of "Totally Tooling

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.530
Tips."

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.870
But rather than host it on the
Google Developer channel, which

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.286
we're currently
on, we've moved it

00:00:40.286 --> 00:00:43.070
over to the Chrome Developer
channel, along with all

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.770
the other web content.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.560
ADDY OSMANI: So shows
like "Supercharged,"

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.780
and "Polycasts," "HTTP203"--

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.030
MATT GAUNT: Yep, and anything
new that might come out.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.800
It's all going to be over there.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.216
So hit the Subscribe
button, which

00:00:54.216 --> 00:00:56.590
will be somewhere on the
screen, probably, hopefully.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.870
ADDY OSMANI: Maybe.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.910
MATT GAUNT: But,
yeah, come and check

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.600
out our brand new series
of "Totally Tooling Tips."

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.350
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah,
"Totally Tooling Tips,"

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.200
the show that's been described
as blissfully mediocre.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.070
Thanks, mom.
