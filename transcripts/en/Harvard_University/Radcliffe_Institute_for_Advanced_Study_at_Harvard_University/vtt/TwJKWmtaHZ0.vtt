00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.886
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.100
- Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.260
I'm delighted you're here.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.100
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.980
I'm Dean of the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study,

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.880
and I'm happy to welcome you
to the annual Julia S. Phelps

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.960
Lecture in the Arts
and Humanities.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.730
As Harvard's Institute
for Advanced Study,

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.880
the Radcliffe institute
promotes pioneering research

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.670
in multiple fields of
knowledge, and the creation

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.070
of art in many forms.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.880
We foster cross-fertilization
between the academic

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.120
and the aesthetic,
because we believe deeply

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.770
that the arts and the sciences
have much to teach each other.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.530
Even more, we know
that their integration

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.720
can encourage new ways
of thinking and seeing.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.450
Because we are dedicated
to sharing with the public

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.780
the fruits of the advanced
study that we support,

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.710
we are pleased to welcome you to
a robust schedule of lectures,

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.620
conferences, and
exhibitions this spring.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.020
You'll find a full
list of programming

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.000
for the current semester on
the brochures at your seats,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.410
and on the Radcliffe website.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.030
Today, we are here to enjoy
the annual Phelps Lecture

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.730
in honor of Julia S. Phelps.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.160
Julia was a Radcliffe
College graduate,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.460
who went on to become an
art historian, a curator,

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.260
and a devoted teacher.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.280
Recent Phelps Lecturers have
included the writer, ZZ Packer,

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.100
the choreographer, Karole
Armitage, the filmmaker,

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.980
Frederick Wiseman,
and many more.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.620
We are grateful to
Julia's family, friends,

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.310
and students for their
support in honor of Julia.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.440
And I'm very pleased
to welcome here today

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.530
Julia's daughter, Susan
Napier, and her husband,

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.350
Stephen Coit, as
well as Susan Bush,

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.860
a loyal friend of
the Phelps Lecture.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.120
Our Phelps Lecturer today
is Dr. Jeremy Eichler.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.000
As a cultural historian
and a music critic,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.790
Jeremy exemplifies
Radcliffe's commitment

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.350
to the integration of art
with other fields of study.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.340
Jeremy holds a PhD in history
from Columbia University,

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.370
and he has taught at
Brandeis University.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.750
His scholarship focuses on
music and public memory.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.200
His critical essays have
appeared in many publications,

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.530
including the New Yorker,
the Nation, the New Republic,

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.750
Slate, and much more.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.360
Currently, he serves as
the chief classical music

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.120
critic for the Boston Globe.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.110
To our great delight, Jeremy
is also a current Radcliffe

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.270
Fellow.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.380
While he is here
with us this year,

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.620
he is working on a book
about how music composed

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.250
after World War II
captured and shaped

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.310
collective memory
of epic events.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.880
Historians' attention to
the topic of cultural memory

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.960
has grown in recent decades,
but it has focused mainly

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.520
on visual artifacts, like
paintings and statues that

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.800
memorialize important events.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.350
Jeremy's work
turns our attention

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.620
to musical
commemorations, and asks

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.480
us to think about how the
past is venerated in sound.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.290
He'll be speaking to us
about that project today.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.690
But that is only
one of the projects

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.770
that Jeremy has underway.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.820
He is also preparing
a book manuscript

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.070
about the composition and public
reception of a 1947 cantata

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.040
entitled, "A Survivor
from Warsaw,"

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.800
which was the first
major musical memorial

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.420
to the Holocaust.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.520
That book grows out of
Jeremy's doctoral dissertation,

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.420
which was entitled "The
Emancipation of Memory--

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.250
Arnold Schoenberg
and the Creation

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.760
of a Survivor from Warsaw,"
which won the Salo and Jeanette

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.610
Baron Prize for the
best Columbia University

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.390
dissertation in Jewish studies
defended over the previous five

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.380
years.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.530
It combines biographical
study of the composer

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.400
with a cultural and intellectual
history of classical music

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.830
in the wake of epic tragedy.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.460
The Baron Prize Award Committee
praised Jeremy's dissertation

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.779
for its in-depth research, its
ambitious theoretical scope,

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:22.360
and its elegant prose.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.710
That same elegance typifies
Jeremy's critical writings,

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.920
whether a review of
a single concerto

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.940
or an essay on the life
work of a major composer.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.990
Two of Jeremy's commentaries,
one about a Beethoven sculpture

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.460
at Boston's MFA, and another
about the cultural amnesia

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.840
behind the sale of American
composer Charles Ives' home,

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.830
have won awards for
excellence in music writing.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.280
Jeremy's critical essays
are lovely to read,

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.860
but they are much
more than ornaments.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.890
They do important cultural work.

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.990
Another award-winning critic
and essayist, Daniel Mendelsohn,

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.080
distilled the task of a
critic down to this equation--

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.910
"knowledge plus taste
equals meaningful judgment."

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.100
He explained that
the key difference

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.370
between stating an
opinion and offering

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.260
a lucid, critical assessment
comes down, in large measure,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.060
to expertise.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.530
A commodity that may seem to be
under suspicion these days, but

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.370
is a quality crucial to
the advancement of both art

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.020
and knowledge.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.480
We might all have
personal reactions,

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.900
positive or negative, to
a poem, to a painting,

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.140
or to a piece of music,
but we do not all

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.370
have deep knowledge of the
arts' cultural context,

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.600
of its historical origins, or
its political connotations.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.620
Nor are we all fluent in
the grammar or vocabulary

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.110
of every artistic medium.

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.380
To understand the significance
of a particular chord,

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.900
or a brush stroke,
we must understand

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.590
the range of options
available to a composer,

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.910
or the array of techniques
that a painter had available.

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.420
For those insights, we
rely on good critics, who

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.270
do have that expert knowledge.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.470
We all know the saying
that everyone's a critic,

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.140
but the truth is that
good critics, who

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.930
dedicate their training,
their expertise,

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.270
and their authoritative
judgment to deepening

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.030
the meaning of art, are rare.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.930
Jeremy's contemporary criticism
and his historical scholarship

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.010
deepen each other, and they
both enrich the understanding

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.830
of his many audiences--
from students

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.450
in history classes to readers
of his insightful reviews.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:53.440
In his hands, cultural
history and music criticism

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.260
become entryways to
better understanding

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.540
of the past and the present.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.880
And that is why I am
so pleased to have

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.200
Jeremy here at Radcliffe
this year, and with us today.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.290
Now, please join me in
welcoming Jeremy Eichler.

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:10.765
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:31.270
- Thank you so much to all
of you for being here today.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:36.480
Thank you to Dean Liz Cohen
for that lovely and incredibly

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.680
generous introduction.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.460
I also want to thank Judy
Vichniac, the guiding

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.550
light, I think we could say,
of the Radcliffe Fellowship.

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.740
I want to thank my fellow
Fellows, many of whom

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.130
are here today, who have
made the year so rewarding

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:51.750
on every level.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:55.590
And I'd also like to thank
the Radcliffe staff, who

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:59.070
have made the year
possible on every level.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:03.330
I'd also like to acknowledge
my intrepid quartet of research

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.540
partners, undergrads
at Harvard, who

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.210
have been doing such great
work helping me with my project

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:10.260
all year long.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.980
Their names are Caroline Boyce,
Dominique Kim, Stefan Paul,

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.510
and Andy Troska.

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.640
And finally, our
special gratitude today

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.562
to the family of Julia
Phelps for making today's

00:08:20.562 --> 00:08:21.270
lecture possible.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.960
On June 19, 1947,
the New York Times

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:32.490
had some important
news to share.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:36.960
America would be getting its
very first Holocaust monument.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.230
The location was to be
on Manhattan's west side,

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:44.540
on Riverside Avenue
at 84th Street.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:48.410
A few months later, on the
morning of October 19, 1947,

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:51.860
some 15,000 people gathered
in the drizzling rain

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.770
for the public dedication
of the future site.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:57.020
By that point, a
sculptor had been chosen,

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.330
and a budget had been announced.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.820
The officials who gathered
there that morning

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:05.810
to lay the cornerstone included
New York Mayor William O'Dwyer,

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:09.140
Senator Irving Ives, and
many foreign dignitaries,

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:14.000
whose speeches would be beamed
to Europe via shortwave radio.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.590
Indeed, a heavy symbolism
hung over the ceremony.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:20.510
Beneath the
cornerstone was placed

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:24.230
a dedicatory Hebrew scroll,
written by the chief rabbi

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.737
of Mandatory Palestine.

00:09:25.737 --> 00:09:27.320
It's a little hard
to make out, but we

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.611
can see the scroll right there.

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:35.300
It would take its place next to
a sampling of soil transported

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.370
from the concentration
camp of Terezin,

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:41.660
and presented by the foreign
minister of Czechoslovakia.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:44.480
100 survivors of
Buchenwald and Dachau

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:48.160
were there for the
occasion, looking on

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.450
as the Manhattan Borough
president compared

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.360
the future memorial to
the Statue of Liberty.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.470
Albert Einstein couldn't
make it, but sent a message.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:02.260
The text of the
cornerstone that they laid

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.780
that day reads as follows--

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.940
"This is the site for
the American memorial

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.850
to the heroes of the
Warsaw ghetto battle, April

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:14.020
to May 1943, and to the 6
million Jews of Europe martyred

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.720
in the cause of human liberty."

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.050
A New York Times editorial
conferred its own benediction,

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:23.830
stating, "May the monument
prove an eternal foundation

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:26.770
for the spread of goodwill
and understanding in our land,

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:30.930
and among all the
peoples of the earth."

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.300
As it happened, the
foundation turned out

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:37.770
to be far less eternal than the
Times editorial writers could

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.110
have possibly imagined.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.780
One can still visit the
memorial's cornerstone today--

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.450
this image is out there today--

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:48.330
but you will find no
monument on this site.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:52.820
It was never built. The
project quickly became

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:56.510
mired in controversies over the
aesthetic design, fundraising

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:59.210
difficulties, and
bureaucratic delays.

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:04.310
The site today remains haunted
by the memorial's absence.

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:07.280
After all the good intentions
and vaunted symbolism,

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.280
the space now stands
perhaps as a monument

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.490
to memory's fickleness,
its contingency,

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:16.670
its strange tendency
at times to court

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:19.960
the very forces of oblivion
that it seeks to resist.

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:28.430
The Holocaust has been
likened to an earthquake that

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:32.630
shattered all the instruments
intended to record it.

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:38.270
How, then, should an event like
this be commemorated in art?

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:40.190
This theme-- the limits
of representation--

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:43.070
is a well known one for the
first students of memory.

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.920
Primo Levi wrote about
the inadequacy of language

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.160
itself to describe the
horrors of camp life,

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.070
and about the problem of
rationality being asked

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:54.710
to serve as a guide
to the very places

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:57.410
where it had been suspended.

00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:59.930
Claude Lanzmann, director
of the film, Shoah,

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:01.640
has gone as far as
calling attempts

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:04.400
to rationally, quote,
"understand," unquote,

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.340
the Holocaust an obscenity.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:10.040
Against this backdrop in
the early post-war years,

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:14.420
as stone memorials went unbuilt,
we should perhaps not be

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.760
particularly surprised
that it was, in fact,

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.170
another art form--

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:21.050
music-- that came to the
fore as one of the earliest

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:23.510
mediums of commemoration.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:25.580
If you think about it,
music has a rare power

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.970
to express strong emotion
without being delimited

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:31.700
by the kind of
semantic specificity

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.910
that is the province
of language alone.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:38.000
It also is not limited
by the visual clarity

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.360
that we associate with,
for instance, photography.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.640
Since the era of the
Romantics, various writers

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.880
have found this aspect of
music to be a kind of catnip

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.860
for the literary imagination.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:52.480
Thomas Mann, for one, described
this phenomenon as, quote,

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:56.330
"the spoken unspokenness
given to music alone."

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.180
Rilke wrote of music
as, quote, "the language

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.940
where languages end."

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.000
And so, let's clarify
some chronology.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.210
Before Mayor O'Dwyer announced
a memorial that would never

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:10.820
arrive, before The
Diary of Anne Frank

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:13.550
had been translated
into any other language,

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:16.490
before the first book
of survivor testimony

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:18.740
had been published
in the United States,

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:22.760
before Alain Resnais' pioneering
documentary Night and Fog,

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.180
and long before Adorno's
often quoted statement

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.380
on the impossibility of
poetry after Auschwitz,

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:33.940
the composer, Arnold
Schoenberg, who

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:36.850
had spent the war years
in exile in Los Angeles,

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:42.580
wrote a seven minute cantata
called A Survivor from Warsaw.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:45.400
It became one of the first
major works of commemorative art

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.560
in any medium.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.680
We may think of sound as the
most slippery, evanescent,

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.050
ever-vanishing medium of all.

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:55.270
But in its way, as
these examples show,

00:13:55.270 --> 00:14:00.950
sonic memory can prove more
durable than that of stone.

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:02.790
The connection between
music and memory

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:06.750
might seem, at first blush,
to be so numerous and varied

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:08.520
as to elude our grasp.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:10.620
The character, Swann, in
proofs from remembrance

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:14.130
of things past, is greeted with
a flood of personal memories

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:16.800
linked to a little
phrase in a violin sonata

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.110
by the fictional
composer Vinteuil.

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:22.710
And similarly, most listeners
can attest in their own lives

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:25.850
to music's ability to
trigger personal reflections,

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:29.910
upwellings of what Bergson
called memoire involontaire,

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:31.330
involuntary memory.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.770
In fact, this linkage has
proven to be so robust

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:37.200
that iPods with
personalized playlists

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.590
are now increasingly being used
in the treatment for patients

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:44.970
with Alzheimer's and dementia,
as a way of excavating troves

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:47.340
of personal memories
that have otherwise

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:50.460
slipped beyond recall.

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.610
The role of concert music as a
medium of civic commemoration

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:55.770
may be equally accepted
on an intuitive level.

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:59.490
Only four months after the
attack of September 11,

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:01.020
the New York
Philharmonic contacted

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:05.250
the American composer,
John Adams, to commission

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:10.580
a memorial work, the
commission that became Adams'

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:12.920
On the Transmigration of Souls.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.960
It was subsequently
premiered on the one year

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.000
anniversary of the attacks.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.190
In his memoirs, Adams
describes reacting

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:23.540
to the request with hesitation,
given the enormity of the task,

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.460
but also with the
full understanding

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:28.970
of music's critical role in
this manner, historically,

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:29.940
and in the present.

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:34.220
Someone, he realized,
needed to write this work.

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.380
And yet, despite our
widely held notions

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.930
of these supposedly natural
linkages between music

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:41.090
and memory, music
and commemoration,

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:43.490
the subject has received
surprisingly little attention

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:44.600
from scholars.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:48.710
Indeed, despite its status
as a pioneering exemplar

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:51.020
of the genre, you
won't find A Survivor

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:53.330
from Warsaw even mentioned
in many histories

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:54.590
of post-war memory.

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:57.260
And across a wide range of
scholarship in this area,

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.270
examining Holocaust
memory through the prism

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:02.450
of literature, film,
architectural monuments,

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:04.760
even pop culture,
one scarcely finds

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.490
concert music mentioned at all.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:10.280
In our time today, I'd like to
pose a set of questions that

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.740
has informed my project
this year at the Radcliffe

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.470
institute, and I'd like
to at least gesture

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:18.680
in the direction of some
preliminary answers.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:22.310
I'd also like to share with
you some musical examples.

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:26.960
And along the way, I
will try to be addressing

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.560
a series of questions--

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.660
What is lost when we
fail to consider sound

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.450
as a carrier of
meaning about the past?

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.280
Why is music, in
fact, particularly

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.590
effective as a medium
of cultural memory,

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:43.100
capable of powerfully
conveying personal and national

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:47.030
narratives about war,
rupture, and displacement?

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:50.720
How do monuments in sound
do their work differently

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.390
from their sibling
monuments in stone?

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:59.025
And on an experiential,
sensorial level,

00:16:59.025 --> 00:17:02.060
how do oral and visual
encounters with memory art

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.790
differ from each other,
that is, memory perceived

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:06.740
through our ears
versus that which

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.660
is perceived through our eyes?

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:13.990
How, in short, has a wartime
past been inscribed in sound?

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:15.890
And what does it
mean to cultivate

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:18.650
new ways of hearing
these works precisely

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:21.800
at our current moment, that
is, as the generation that

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.290
lived through the reality
to which this music bears

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:28.880
testament is itself
fading into history?

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.550
So those are some questions to
keep in the back of our minds

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.600
as we proceed.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.990
We may explore a few offshoots
and alleyways along the way.

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:37.730
But that's OK as well.

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:39.450
As a friend of
mine likes to say,

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:42.007
digression is the
sunshine of narrative.

00:17:42.007 --> 00:17:44.442
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.970
Arnold Schoenberg was born
into a Viennese Jewish family

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:50.890
in 1874.

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:55.060
He is, of course, both revered
and reviled to this day

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:58.270
for his place as a forefather
of musical modernism,

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:01.570
the composer, who, in his
words, emancipated dissonance,

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:04.360
and, in so doing,
severed music's link

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.640
with the system of
tonal organization

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:10.900
that had governed the art
form since the Baroque era.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.720
And yet, years before his
invention of his signature

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:17.420
twelve-tone method of
composition in 1921,

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:20.050
Schoenberg had staked out
his own radical position

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:23.440
on a subject perhaps even more
fundamental to music than its

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.090
harmonic language--

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:28.060
the ethical purpose of music.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:31.000
The art of the future,
he felt strongly,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.130
should not strive
to be beautiful.

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.690
It should strive to be true.

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:38.680
"Art," he wrote in
1911, "is the cry

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:42.640
of distress uttered by those
who experience firsthand

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.730
the fate of mankind."

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:48.430
In the early 1930s, Schoenberg
was among the very first

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:50.290
German-speaking
artists to perceive

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:53.020
the urgency of the threat
facing European Jews.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:56.710
He emigrated in 1933 and
settled in Los Angeles.

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:59.470
After the war, which claimed
the lives of several family

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:04.270
members, he composed his own
short, but explosive, cry

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:07.750
of distress, his Survivor
from Warsaw, on a commission

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:11.440
from the foundation of Serge
Koussevitzky, music director

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.570
of the Boston Symphony.

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:16.390
Koussevitzky was renowned for
championing the music of living

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:18.340
composers, and he
gave Schoenberg

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:21.850
enormous creative latitude as
to how the commission would

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:23.140
be fulfilled.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:25.960
Interesting, nothing I ended
up finding in the archives

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.990
indicates that
Koussevitzky had any idea

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:31.120
that Schoenberg
planned to compose

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.100
a memorial to the Holocaust.

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:37.960
We can imagine his surprise upon
receiving this bracing score.

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.520
He was a conductor,
after all, who

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:43.840
had a very different vision
for the role of music

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.390
in the era of post-war
reconstruction.

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:48.310
He spelled out that
vision in a speech

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:51.820
to the first class of students
who returned to Tanglewood,

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:53.650
once it reopened after the war.

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:00.890
He told the students,
"In light of music,

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:03.800
the soul beholds the
good and the beautiful,

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:07.730
the heart awakens to faith in
man and in his better future.

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:09.650
If you deprive men of music--

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:11.930
just as they were deprived
of honor, dignity,

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:14.840
human rights, conscience,
faith, and freedom--

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.060
you will witness the
decline of the world

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:19.880
to a state of brutality
and barbarism.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:23.390
Music alone can still
tame the beast in man--

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:27.530
it is our comfort and our hope."

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:29.930
This is, of course,
quite far removed

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:35.870
from any notion of music as
the soul's cry of distress.

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:38.090
And A Survivor from
Warsaw, one might say,

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:43.700
does not tame any beast, but it
rather depicts them in its art.

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.590
As we'll hear shortly,
the piece itself

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:49.100
is a narrated scene that takes
place in a concentration camp.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:52.460
This work would not be
Koussevitzky's avenue

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:56.270
to moral and
aesthetic redemption.

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:58.760
It's in those terms that
I interpret Koussevitzky's

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.990
otherwise mysterious decision
to tacitly decline the chance

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:05.341
to give the work's world
premiere with the Boston

00:21:05.341 --> 00:21:05.840
Symphony.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.230
Almost all of his
other commissions

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:15.110
received the BSO's
red carpet treatment.

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:17.900
Not this one.

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.420
Instead, I think because
Survivor from Warsaw

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:23.780
was so far ahead of the
curve of public Holocaust

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.820
memory in this
country, the score

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:28.070
was pushed to what
were then the margins

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:30.010
of American musical life.

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:32.840
In what is surely one of
the strangest premieres

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.940
of a major work
in music history,

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:38.030
this piece was unveiled
in a university gymnasium

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:41.930
in Albuquerque, New
Mexico, in 1948,

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:45.620
with an Austrian conductor
named Kurt Frederick leading

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:50.350
an amateur chorus and
an amateur orchestra.

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:54.460
The performers included cowboys,
florists, assorted students,

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.320
and railroad engineers.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.320
The narrator was the head
of the university chemistry

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.050
department.

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:03.770
Here is a copy of the program.

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:06.280
The national press
sent correspondence.

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.320
The New York Times
ran a headline--

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.500
"Schoenberg in Albuquerque"--
sounding more like the set up

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:14.440
for a joke about two
things that go together

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:18.450
about as well as, say, a
Sachertorte and a campfire.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.110
But from all accounts,
the work seems

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:25.780
to have been an unqualified
success at its premiere.

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:27.820
The piece had to
be repeated twice.

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:29.800
Time magazine
reported that applause

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.320
thundered in the auditorium.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.920
Schoenberg was
not healthy enough

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:35.560
to travel for the performance,
but Kurt Frederick, just

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.840
after midnight on the
night of the premiere,

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.860
dashed off this telegram to
Schoenberg in Los Angeles--

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.380
"Survivor from Warsaw
made tremendous impression

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:46.270
on the performers and audience.

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:48.430
Thank you for the
great honor of allowing

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:51.850
us to perform this work."

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:53.800
In its early years, the
piece earned champions

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.110
well beyond the good burghers
of Albuquerque, New Mexico,

00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:00.280
including one listener who
championed it precisely

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.140
for the same reasons
that Koussevitzky

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.060
appears to have ignored it.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.850
I'm speaking of the philosopher,
critic, and musical thinker,

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:11.230
Theodor Adorno, who wrote
that, "In Survivor, perhaps

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:14.230
for the first time,
culture and barbarism

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:17.720
were not shown as
naively opposing forces,

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.630
but rather wrenched
into the frame

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:22.450
of a single explosive
work of art."

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:24.610
in Adorno's reading,
the work's incorporation

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:27.610
of horror and suffering
was exactly what

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:30.250
provided its truth content.

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:33.320
Here is a fuller
quote from Adorno--

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.530
"The effect of the
Survivor from Warsaw

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:38.230
is no less powerful--
a companion piece

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:40.720
to Picasso's Guernica--
in which Schoenberg

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.910
made the impossible
possible, standing up

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:46.090
to the contemporary horror
in its most extreme form,

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:48.850
the murder of the Jews, in art.

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:51.850
If music is to escape from
the nullity that threatens it,

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:53.740
the very loss of
its raison d'etre,

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:57.670
then it can only hope to
do so if it accomplishes

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:01.120
what Schoenberg accomplished
in the Survivor from Warsaw,

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:04.900
that is, if it confronts the
utter negativity, the most

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:08.770
extreme, by which the
entire complexion of reality

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:12.170
is made manifest."

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:14.610
To put his comment
in anecdotal form,

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:17.220
I'll mention that, in a
different essay on Schoenberg,

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.530
Adorno recalls the
memorable story

00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:24.300
about Picasso's famous
depiction of wartime slaughter.

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:26.610
Gestapo officers were
said to have, one day,

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:28.920
approached the great
painter near a photograph

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.960
of his Guernica.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.540
"Did you do this?"
they asked him.

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:36.200
"No," the painter
replied, "you did."

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.084
Before playing A
Survivor from Warsaw,

00:24:41.084 --> 00:24:43.000
for those of you who
might not know the piece,

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.270
here is a quick overview
of what you'll be hearing.

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:46.740
It lasts just seven minutes.

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:50.420
It's scored for narrator and
orchestra and male chorus.

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:52.220
After a brief
orchestral opening,

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:55.130
the narrator recites a
text written by Schoenberg

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:59.720
to be delivered in a hybrid
speech-song style known

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.160
as Sprechstimme.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.590
This narrator, as we'll
hear, describes a scene

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:06.380
he has witnessed in a
concentration camp involving

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:09.440
the beating of prisoners and
their selection for the gas

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.490
chamber.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:13.370
At the climax of his
story, the men's choir

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:16.340
enters singing Schoenberg's
own setting of the Hebrew

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.670
words of the Shema Yisrael
prayer, the central prayer

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:22.130
of Judaism.

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:25.700
And one the last word of caution
before we press play here

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:27.860
for our musical example.

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:30.350
Judgment of this
score's aesthetic merits

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:33.680
has been all over the
map over the years, which

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.440
is, in fact, a subject of an
entirely different lecture--

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.510
how we should
think about judging

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:43.940
these monuments in aesthetic
terms, or in other terms.

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:46.880
But the piece has been
heralded as, quote,

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:50.210
"the aesthetic and ethical
manifesto of our time,"

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:51.470
unquote.

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:53.180
That was from Luigi Nono.

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:56.900
And it's also been derided
as, quote, "Hollywood kitsch."

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.300
You can each judge
for yourself, though

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:00.830
to the extent that
this is possible,

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:04.460
I'd ask you to listen in a
spirit of oral generosity,

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:08.270
and to remember, just as
historians like to caution us

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:10.790
against back-shadowing,
which is viewing

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:13.340
the past through the
prism of the present,

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:15.830
I think we'd be wise to
guard against the equivalent

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:19.070
phenomenon in the domains
of memory and listening.

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:21.020
In other words,
try to keep in mind

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:24.890
that this was written in
1947, before, as we've said,

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:28.815
just about any other artifact
of Holocaust you might think of.

00:26:28.815 --> 00:26:30.440
If you'd like, you
can picture yourself

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:35.360
sitting in the Carlisle
Gymnasium of the University

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:39.320
of Albuquerque on November
4, 1948, the night

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.350
that this music
was actually new.

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:45.920
I'll put the text up here
for us to follow as we read.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:50.154
And here is the piece that
they heard that night.

00:26:50.154 --> 00:27:32.399
[MUSIC - ARNOLD SCHOENBERG, "A
 SURVIVOR FROM WARSAW"]

00:27:32.399 --> 00:27:35.970
- I cannot remember everything.

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:39.612
I must have been unconscious
most of the time.

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:49.820
I remember only the
grandiose moment

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:57.140
when they all started to
sing, as if prearranged

00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:00.890
the old prayer
they had neglected

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:06.000
for so many years,
the forgotten creed.

00:28:13.125 --> 00:28:17.100
But I have no recollection
how I got underground

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:24.924
to live in the sewers of
Warsaw so long a time.

00:28:24.924 --> 00:28:27.875
The day began as usual--

00:28:27.875 --> 00:28:31.763
Reveille when it still was dark.

00:28:31.763 --> 00:28:33.210
"Get out!"

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:35.390
Whether you slept,
or whether worries

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:37.642
kept you awake the whole night.

00:28:37.642 --> 00:28:41.240
You had been separated from
your children, from your wife,

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.224
from your parents.

00:28:42.224 --> 00:28:44.192
You don't know what
happened to them.

00:28:44.192 --> 00:28:46.160
How could you sleep?

00:28:56.492 --> 00:28:58.431
The trumpets again--

00:28:58.431 --> 00:28:58.930
"Get out!

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:02.820
The sergeant will be furious!"

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:07.650
They came out, some very
slowly-- the old ones,

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:10.990
the sick ones, some
with nervous agility.

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:12.950
They fear the sergeant.

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:15.360
They hurry as much as they can.

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.130
In vain!

00:29:19.088 --> 00:29:23.032
Much too much noise,
much too much commotion!

00:29:23.032 --> 00:29:24.018
And not fast enough!

00:29:24.018 --> 00:29:25.497
The Feldwebel shouts--

00:29:25.497 --> 00:29:26.483
"Achtung!

00:29:26.483 --> 00:29:27.469
Stilljestanden!

00:29:27.469 --> 00:29:28.455
Na wird's mal!

00:29:28.455 --> 00:29:31.906
Oder soll ich mit dem
Jewehrkolben nachhelfen?

00:29:31.906 --> 00:29:36.740
Na jut-- wenn ihrs
durchaus haben wollt!"

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:38.810
The sergeant and
his subordinates

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:41.753
hit everyone-- young
or old, strong or sick,

00:29:41.753 --> 00:29:43.874
guilty or innocent.

00:29:43.874 --> 00:29:49.290
It was painful to hear
them groaning and moaning.

00:29:53.622 --> 00:29:59.195
I heard it though I had
been hit very hard, so hard

00:29:59.195 --> 00:30:01.620
that I couldn't
help falling down.

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:09.464
We all on the ground
who couldn't stand up

00:30:09.464 --> 00:30:11.944
were then beaten over the head.

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:32.550
I must have been unconscious.

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:36.080
The next thing I knew
was a soldier saying--

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:40.526
"They are all dead!"

00:30:40.526 --> 00:30:45.375
Whereupon the sergeant ordered
leave to do away with us.

00:30:45.375 --> 00:30:54.124
There I lay aside
half conscious.

00:30:54.124 --> 00:31:00.578
It had become very still.

00:31:00.578 --> 00:31:03.013
Fear and pain.

00:31:05.935 --> 00:31:09.484
Then I heard the
sergeant shouting--

00:31:09.484 --> 00:31:11.770
"Achtung!"

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:17.680
They started slowly
and irregularly--

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:22.869
one, two, three, four.

00:31:22.869 --> 00:31:24.801
"Achtung!"

00:31:24.801 --> 00:31:28.591
the sergeant shouted again.

00:31:28.591 --> 00:31:30.052
"Rascher!

00:31:30.052 --> 00:31:32.487
Nochmals von vorn anfange!

00:31:32.487 --> 00:31:35.409
In einer Minute will ich wissen,
wieviele ich zur Gaskammer

abliefere!

00:31:40.766 --> 00:31:41.740
Abzahlen!"

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:51.174
They began again, first slowly--

00:31:51.174 --> 00:31:55.490
one, two, three, four.

00:31:55.490 --> 00:32:00.780
Became faster and
faster, so fast

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:07.974
that they finally sounded like
a stampede of wild horses.

00:32:07.974 --> 00:32:11.966
And all of a sudden,
in the middle of it,

00:32:11.966 --> 00:32:16.457
they began singing
the Shema Yisrael.

00:32:16.457 --> 00:32:18.952
[MEN'S CHOIR IN

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:22.460
of the work of music, a kind
of ontological fuzziness.

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.770
In the case of painting,
once the artist

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:27.850
has finished her
creative activity,

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:32.929
the painted canvas itself is
manifestly the work of art.

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:37.969
But where, or alternatively,
when does the work of musical

00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:40.110
art reside?

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:42.280
Is a score like this
one-- or let's say,

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.989
is Beethoven's Ninth Symphony--

00:34:45.989 --> 00:34:48.771
is the piece itself to be found
in the score of Beethoven's

00:34:48.771 --> 00:34:49.270
Ninth?

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:53.420
Is it located in a particular
performance of the symphony?

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:56.949
In the average of many
performances over time?

00:34:56.949 --> 00:35:00.610
Or perhaps in some platonic
idealized version of the score

00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:03.670
that lives only in our minds?

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:06.970
In short, a kind of
temporal ambiguity

00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:10.750
appears to be part of the
notated music tradition itself.

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:12.610
A score is a blueprint--

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:15.430
instructions for
realization at a later date.

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:18.040
We might go further
still to suggest

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.950
that the active musical
performance of any score

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:26.520
exposes listeners to a unique
kind of enlarged temporality,

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:29.800
a bridge between the present
tense of the listener

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:35.050
experiencing the performance and
the present tense of the music

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:38.650
at the time of its composition.

00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:41.390
In this sense, we might say
that a musical monument carries

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:44.300
in it a memory of
its own history,

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:47.660
and a performance of a
musical memorial as such--

00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:49.370
a work like the
one we just heard,

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:52.220
whose subject is
itself commemorative--

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:57.950
can make for a doubly
strong bridge to the past.

00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:59.840
So that sense of
enlarged temporality

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:02.000
is one special
attribute of music

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.590
I've been trying to get
my mind around this year.

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:07.130
But let's also quickly
mention a second attribute,

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:10.460
a certain visceral quality that
I think we would all probably

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:15.110
agree comes through very clearly
in the example we just heard.

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:20.150
It's an immediacy that seems
to attend to sound as such.

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:23.105
It seems connected,
I would think,

00:36:23.105 --> 00:36:25.130
to the nature of hearing.

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:27.560
The composer Murray
Schafer has written,

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:32.420
"The eye points outward,
the ear points inward."

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:35.990
Schafer, who first popularized
the notion of the soundscape,

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:38.690
which I use in my
title, also reminds us

00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:40.760
that, when we fall
asleep at night,

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:43.940
it is our hearing that is
the last of the five senses

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:46.490
to relinquish its guard.

00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:50.360
And it's the first one
to return in the morning.

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:51.800
In brief, in my
recent work, I've

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.900
been aiming to develop
ways to write and think

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:56.450
about musical memory that
do justice to these sui

00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:58.490
generis properties
of sound itself,

00:36:58.490 --> 00:37:00.140
and of music as an art form.

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:03.410
I believe that we can't simply
import wholesale an approach

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:06.830
from the domains of art
history or visual studies.

00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:09.130
Musical memorials,
I'm arguing here,

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:11.990
offer the possibility of
a unique, and perhaps more

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:15.890
immersive, grappling with
the performance of memory

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:17.720
then and now.

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:20.750
Adapting from Bakhtin, we can
say they have a special way of,

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:25.010
quote, "thickening time,
introducing new continuities."

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:27.000
Under the best conditions,
I am suggesting,

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.590
these works can help dispel
what Walter Benjamin described

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:34.010
as the expanse of homogeneous
empty time separating us

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:35.360
from the past.

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:38.090
Instead, musical memory,
works like this one,

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:41.150
have the potential to bring us
closer to what Benjamin called

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:44.180
the jetztzeit, or
in his words, "time

00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:46.280
filled by the
presence of the now."

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:53.440
Speaking of time, in the stretch
that we have remaining together

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:56.200
today, I'd like to
speak about one more

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.780
score, another instance
of musical memory,

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:03.110
and then offer some
concluding thoughts.

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:05.860
In A Survivor from
Warsaw, we've already

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:08.950
heard a piece that
derives its power,

00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:11.620
it's kind of burning
intensity, in part

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:13.870
from its composer's
proximity, I think,

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:16.150
to the history he describes.

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:18.130
There is a rawness
and a directness

00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:19.990
to that piece of music.

00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:22.360
I'd now like to turn to a
different score that speaks,

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:25.810
at a certain level, of
temporal and geographic removed

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:27.160
from the war years.

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:30.460
In that sense, it addresses
more seamlessly the moment

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:31.435
we are living in today.

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:37.680
The American composer, Steve
Reich, was born in 1936

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:41.580
and grew up in this country,
far from the agonies of Europe.

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:45.240
As a boy with divorced parents
living on opposite coasts,

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:48.300
he used to take long
train voyages, accompanied

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:52.770
by his governess, between
New York and Los Angeles.

00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:56.040
Decades later, as an
adult, in the 1980s,

00:38:56.040 --> 00:39:00.150
he came across the iconic photo
of a frightened boy standing

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:04.320
on the streets of the Warsaw
ghetto with his hands raised.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:09.090
Reich saw in that boy an
image of a kind of alter self.

00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:12.090
He and the boy looked
physically alike, he thought,

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:13.800
and given the year
of the photo, they

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:17.310
might well have been
born at the same time.

00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:18.870
They were separated,
Reich realized,

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:22.920
only by a senseless
accident of fate.

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.780
Had he, Reich, been
born in Europe,

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:27.330
the trains he rode as
a child, he realized,

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:29.970
would not be associated
with quaint memories

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:32.520
of Pullman porters
and of his governess.

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:37.080
They would have been, in his
phrase, different trains.

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:39.780
This became the title,
and the framing conceit,

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:43.200
of Reich's three movement work
for string quartet and tape

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.750
that was premiered in 1988.

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:47.830
Some of you have surely
heard it performed.

00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:51.270
We'll hear a little bit
of the music in a moment.

00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:54.390
The defining gesture of
Reich's musical score

00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:58.530
is the transfer of
actual survivor voices,

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:01.980
present through samples that
he took from recorded survivor

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:07.020
testimony, into the voices of
the instruments of the string

00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:09.330
quartet, which played
lines transcribed

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:12.210
from the contours
of the spoken words.

00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:17.580
Memory here is, quite
literally, inscribed in sound.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:20.047
It may seem as abstract
as I describe it now,

00:40:20.047 --> 00:40:22.380
but we'll see and hear shortly
the technique is actually

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:24.000
beautifully simple
and, in a way,

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.420
this work embodies another set
of themes I've tried to weave

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:29.400
through this afternoon's talk.

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.500
Different Trains is
music that dances

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:35.280
in that liminal space between
spoken and the unspoken,

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:38.160
between the flinty
precision of language

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:41.250
and the watery
sensuality of sound.

00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:43.500
Throughout this piece,
there is no narrator, only

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:45.840
shards of disconnected speech--

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:48.750
tiny slivers of language
that, with a kind

00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:51.900
of metonymic virtuosity,
become all that

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:54.600
is required at this
late date to summon

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:57.390
the enormity of the tragedy.

00:40:57.390 --> 00:40:59.010
In this brief
excerpt, we'll hear

00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:03.480
a survivor named Rachella say
a few simple words and phrases.

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:06.000
"1940," she says.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.880
Then later, "on my birthday."

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:12.900
Then later again, "the
Germans walked in."

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:14.640
We will hear a
viola, or at times,

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:17.550
a cello tracing the rise and
fall of Rachella's voice,

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:20.130
and then picking up the
resulting melodic line

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:21.680
shorn of its words.

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:26.880
We'll also, I will warn you,
hear Reich's use of sirens.

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:27.720
Let's have a listen.

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:30.960
Here is the first two minutes
of the second movement

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.449
of Different Trains.

00:41:32.449 --> 00:41:34.199
[MUSIC - STEVE REICH, "DIFFERENT
 TRAINS"]

00:41:34.199 --> 00:41:35.443
- 1940.

00:41:35.443 --> 00:41:38.936
1940.

00:41:38.936 --> 00:41:41.431
1940.

00:41:41.431 --> 00:41:43.926
1940.

00:41:43.926 --> 00:41:47.419
1940.

00:41:47.419 --> 00:41:49.415
1940.

00:41:49.415 --> 00:41:51.411
1940.

00:41:51.411 --> 00:41:52.409
On my birthday.

00:42:11.371 --> 00:42:12.868
The Germans walked in.

00:42:22.349 --> 00:42:23.846
Walked into Holland.

00:42:27.339 --> 00:42:28.836
- Germans invaded Hungary.

00:42:39.315 --> 00:42:40.812
I was in second grade.

00:42:53.287 --> 00:42:54.784
I had a teacher.

00:42:58.277 --> 00:43:01.770
I had a teacher,
a very tall man,

00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:04.265
his hair was completely
plastered smooth.

00:43:07.259 --> 00:43:14.245
A very tall man, his hair was
completely plastered smooth.

00:43:17.239 --> 00:43:19.235
A very tall man.

00:43:19.235 --> 00:43:23.227
He said, "Black Crows"--

00:43:23.227 --> 00:43:30.213
"Black Crows"-- He said, "Black
Crows invaded our country."

00:43:30.213 --> 00:43:36.700
He said, "Black Crows invaded
our country many years ago."

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:38.696
And he pointed right at me.

00:43:38.696 --> 00:43:40.193
He pointed right at me.

00:43:50.769 --> 00:43:52.310
- That was just a
snippet, of course,

00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:55.170
and please believe me, the
work's full power comes through

00:43:55.170 --> 00:43:57.480
much more clearly
as an entirety,

00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:00.420
preferably in a
live performance.

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:02.520
This was enough, though,
I hope, to give you

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:06.150
a sense of the ways in
which the score actually

00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:10.950
furnishes more than just a
potent listening experience.

00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:14.100
It also operationalizes,
if we could say,

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:16.710
a certain store of metaphors.

00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:20.220
By inviting the listener to
reverse engineer his melodies,

00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:23.610
to associate them with the
actual voices that formed

00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:26.320
their contours, the
voices from the era,

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:28.670
Reich makes
overwhelmingly tactile

00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:31.500
the ways in which the
past is always conferring

00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:33.390
its shape on the present.

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:37.134
And then, like the
voices, taking its leave.

00:44:37.134 --> 00:44:38.550
At the same time,
this piece wants

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:41.040
to hold on to the
singularity of those voices,

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.170
those links to actual people.

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:46.440
I think it is this
documentary specificity that

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:49.170
helps this score to
avoid the pitfalls of so

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:51.450
much other memorial art.

00:44:51.450 --> 00:44:54.270
And I'm speaking of the
cinematic re-enactments

00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:59.040
and memory kitsch that I think
can feel pervasive these days,

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:02.580
and can sometimes threaten
to numb the senses.

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:04.140
Reich's Different
Trains ultimately

00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:06.210
makes palpable the
ways in which the past

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:09.690
we are discussing tonight
oscillates between the spoken

00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:11.010
and the unspoken.

00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:14.340
It also, I think, resonates
with our contemporary moment,

00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:18.510
when the actual living memory
of the Holocaust is receding,

00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:21.360
and the generation who
experienced it directly

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:24.600
continues to fade.

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:27.930
Like Reich's sampled
voices, their memories

00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:34.020
now leave cultural traces that,
in turn, shape the contours

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:35.640
and cadences of our own.

00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:41.930
By way of a conclusion, I'd
like to refresh our memories

00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:46.030
about the well-known closing
passage of Adorno's Minima

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:49.340
Moralia, a book
composed of fragments.

00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:52.970
In this passage,
as I see it, Adorno

00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:54.770
came close to
distilling his life's

00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:57.540
work in a single sentence.

00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:59.990
He wrote that,
quote, "Perspectives

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:04.150
must be fashioned that displace
and estrange the world,

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:07.250
reveal it to be, with
its rifts and crevices,

00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:11.570
as indigent and distorted
as it will one day appear

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:15.060
in the messianic light."

00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:20.460
For Adorno, this, and this
alone, was the task of thought,

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:23.640
and certainly the task
of critical theory.

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:25.500
Yet, I believe
Adorno, of all people,

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:29.280
would forgive us one further
interpolation, that he would,

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:33.630
in fact, agree that this
self-same mission is also one

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:36.870
of the essential
tasks of art itself--

00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:39.420
to fashion the
perspectives on the world,

00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:41.010
from which the brokenness--

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:42.660
the rifts and fissures--

00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:45.600
of the present and the
past are revealed and felt

00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:46.860
for what they are.

00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:49.680
And not only the brokenness
in the past, of course,

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:53.130
but also its buried sparks
of hope for a future

00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:55.722
that might still have
turned out differently.

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:01.110
Every modern art
form contributes

00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:03.300
to this task in different ways.

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:05.730
As I hope I've given you at
least a glimpse of today,

00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:08.370
music has its own
contribution to make.

00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:11.280
For me, at least, it has always
been the best of the arts

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:15.270
at conveying this expanded
present tense, that sense

00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:18.420
of contact with
history and memory,

00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:21.570
and that basic truth so
elegantly distilled by WG

00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:25.530
Sebald in a deceptively
simple observation.

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:29.260
He wrote that, quote, "Time
measures nothing but itself."

00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:30.757
Thank you.

00:47:30.757 --> 00:47:33.252
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:44.210
- I'm a professor emeritus of
English, of Nichols College,

00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:47.570
and, yes, I've just
been reading a lot

00:47:47.570 --> 00:47:50.270
of Baudelaire's critiques.

00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:55.790
And I noticed that both of the
pieces that you played to us

00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:58.370
have words with them.

00:47:58.370 --> 00:48:01.810
And the Guernica did not have
words associated with it,

00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:03.500
but it was not realism.

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:10.160
So the imagination
of the listener

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:13.370
could be set free to imagine.

00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:17.330
And I was wondering
what you think

00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:23.990
about composers like Schoenberg
adding words to his music,

00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:28.040
so that somehow that defines
the memory that you're

00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:32.500
going to have, rather
than opening up

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:39.760
the listener's memory to
his or her own thoughts?

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:40.750
- Yeah, absolutely.

00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:41.770
It's a great point.

00:48:41.770 --> 00:48:43.790
We spoke about all
those semantic tricks

00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:45.770
that abstract music
can play, and then I

00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:51.330
went ahead and played you
two excerpts with words.

00:48:51.330 --> 00:48:53.900
The short answer is
that I think there

00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:57.200
are really effective
musical memorials in both

00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:01.270
of those types, both
of those genres.

00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:03.770
In the book project
that I'm working on,

00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:06.350
I hope to spend some
time writing and thinking

00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:08.630
about Strauss'
Metamorphosen, which

00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:12.290
is a strictly instrumental
work that was written shortly

00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:16.460
after the war, and is heard
by many as a kind of memorial

00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:20.480
to the destruction
of German culture.

00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:26.270
And I think that what I tried
to bring out also in the Reich

00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:29.510
was that the words--

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:32.750
I don't personally feel actually
that the words in the Reich

00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:35.840
really guide us into any
particular narrative,

00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:39.800
because they don't
actually tell the story.

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:43.610
But what they do do,
as I was trying to say,

00:49:43.610 --> 00:49:49.430
was that they anchor the piece
in the actual documentary

00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:52.580
details, the actual
voices of the people

00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:55.010
who lived through that
era, and, at the same time,

00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:58.730
abstract from them
with the musical lines

00:49:58.730 --> 00:50:02.150
that he derives
from their voices.

00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:06.710
And so I think,
in that way, it's

00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:09.890
a perfect memorial for this
particular moment, when

00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:13.010
we are right there on the
threshold between what

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:15.440
sometimes gets called
communicative memory,

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:19.400
or talking, telling stories,
and cultural memory,

00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:22.892
preserved through
art and other things.

00:50:22.892 --> 00:50:24.790
Yeah?

00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:25.840
- Hi.

00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:30.760
My name's Julie [INAUDIBLE],
and your discussion

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:33.310
of Different Trains
threw me back

00:50:33.310 --> 00:50:36.880
into my own musical memory.

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:41.620
I was at the performance that
the Kronos Quartet did here

00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:44.740
in Cambridge when they
were first touring it.

00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:46.810
I was in my late 20s.

00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:50.140
I was a composition student,
with a group of friends,

00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:52.660
who were not
professional musicians,

00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:56.230
but we all went and did lots of
cool cultural stuff together.

00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:58.960
And all of my
friends were Jewish.

00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:01.420
And two of them-- although I
didn't know it at the time--

00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:04.030
were children of survivors.

00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:05.890
We didn't know what
was on the program,

00:51:05.890 --> 00:51:10.330
and so this piece came as
a surprise to everyone.

00:51:10.330 --> 00:51:12.430
Being a composer, I was
very focused on what

00:51:12.430 --> 00:51:14.740
he was doing with the
tape and the rhythm,

00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:16.600
and all that kind of stuff.

00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:20.860
And we had, I think, one
of the longest and most

00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:24.520
passionate discussions after
this concert among my friends

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:27.010
I experienced with that group.

00:51:27.010 --> 00:51:29.650
And looking back,
my two friends,

00:51:29.650 --> 00:51:32.830
whose parents had
survived the camps,

00:51:32.830 --> 00:51:36.610
were the ones who were most
angry about this piece.

00:51:36.610 --> 00:51:38.920
They found it utterly insulting.

00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:41.260
They found it trivializing,
and they hated

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:43.780
the fragmentation of the text.

00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:47.110
And just now, it
was making me wonder

00:51:47.110 --> 00:51:52.750
about the space between
memorializing and experiencing.

00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:55.230
And I wondered if you might
say a little about that?

00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:00.800
- It's a great question,
and that's a big subject,

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.880
of course.

00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:10.040
I quoted from Adorno's very
affirmative embrace of Survivor

00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:14.240
from Warsaw as a
piece that reflected

00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:16.700
and incorporated the
barbarism of the times

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:21.460
into the frame of the artwork,
like Picasso's Guernica.

00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:23.930
What I didn't quote from is
some of the later opinions

00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:25.460
he had of the work.

00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:29.720
He was around for long enough
after the war to reconsider his

00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:35.560
opinions, and wrote, really
interestingly, in the 1960s,

00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:38.780
a kind of second thoughts
on Survivor from Warsaw,

00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:43.220
and spoke in particular about
a certain operea, he called it,

00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:52.710
that exists in Survivor from
Warsaw between acknowledging

00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:55.130
the victims of the
Holocaust-- the barbarism,

00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:57.440
the violence that
was done to them--

00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:03.680
on the one hand, but also being
careful not to instrumentalize

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:08.960
their memories, to use them
for the purpose of somehow

00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:13.730
possibly entertaining an
audience, or giving them

00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:14.582
pleasure.

00:53:14.582 --> 00:53:16.290
Because of course, at
the end of the day,

00:53:16.290 --> 00:53:19.670
this was a tragedy for which
there is no redemption.

00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:21.320
There was only death.

00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:24.920
And so this question
he raises of--

00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:26.360
he says something
along the lines

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:29.180
that, no work of art that
ignores the victims can

00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:33.920
possibly be of credit, or
of value, in this context,

00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:38.330
and at the same time, no work
of art that that exploits

00:53:38.330 --> 00:53:43.850
their memories should be
allowed to stand as well.

00:53:43.850 --> 00:53:47.720
So for him, that was the operea
in which all memory art stands.

00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:51.620
And I do think of that as
a kind of guiding framework

00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:54.650
for thinking about all of
our writing and responses

00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:57.080
and engagement with these works.

00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:00.380
I think that, for
different people,

00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:02.000
they will draw that
line differently,

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:06.110
and even the line perhaps seems
different at different points

00:54:06.110 --> 00:54:08.080
of remove from when
the work was written,

00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:10.349
and as we ourselves
change and grow older.

00:54:10.349 --> 00:54:12.140
I would wonder what
your friends might feel

00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:14.370
about Different Trains now.

00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:16.840
But I think those are
some very good points.

00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:20.150
Thank you for your comment.

00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:20.930
- I'm Dan Wikler.

00:54:20.930 --> 00:54:22.888
I'm a professor at the
School of Public Health,

00:54:22.888 --> 00:54:26.990
and I have a brief observation,
and then a question.

00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:30.820
Many years ago, I read
Perfect Pitch, a memoir

00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:35.390
by a musical lexicographer,
Nicholas Slonimsky.

00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:38.900
And I believe he said
in there, at one point,

00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:41.630
he had been close
to Koussevitzky,

00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:46.040
who then suddenly turned on
him and sort of dismissed him.

00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:47.650
And it hurt his
feelings terribly.

00:54:47.650 --> 00:54:53.300
And if I remember right, his
wife, as she threw him out

00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:55.460
of their living
room, said, you're

00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:58.220
nothing but a cheap, Odessa Jew.

00:54:58.220 --> 00:55:02.550
And Slonimsky's thought to
himself, as he walked away,

00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:06.050
but Koussevitzky's
an Odessa Jew, too.

00:55:06.050 --> 00:55:08.480
And I know that
Koussevitzky had converted

00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:12.260
to Christianity, either as a
teenager or as a young man,

00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:15.540
and was buried in a
Christian graveyard,

00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:17.540
and I wonder if there's
some problems there

00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:21.960
that might help to explain why
he didn't play the Schoenberg.

00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:23.550
The question is this--

00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:28.340
you mentioned Resnais'
movie, Night and Fog,

00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:30.650
which I've seen more
times than I can count.

00:55:33.359 --> 00:55:35.400
One striking thing about
that movie is the score.

00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:37.710
It's by Hanns Eisler.

00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:41.590
And when I first heard
the score, I thought,

00:55:41.590 --> 00:55:43.520
this is wildly inappropriate.

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:46.960
It's not a dirge,
or it's not even--

00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:48.780
It doesn't sound sad.

00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:53.520
It's a kind of
almost perky score.

00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:56.570
It's mood changes
from moment to moment.

00:55:56.570 --> 00:56:00.680
But if I heard that
thing in a concert,

00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:04.490
without being told that it
was written for Night and Fog,

00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:06.320
I would never have dreamed it.

00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:09.530
But over time, as I've watched
that film over and over,

00:56:09.530 --> 00:56:11.890
and heard that music,
it's come, to me,

00:56:11.890 --> 00:56:15.290
to seem the absolutely
perfect music for that movie.

00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:19.490
And I almost can't imagine
the movie without it.

00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:21.950
And I don't know whether
it's my brain making this up,

00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:23.870
or whether there's
something in the music

00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:29.240
that he somehow had figured out,
despite the fact that it seems

00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:30.800
so completely different in tone.

00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:34.810
And I wondered if you
have any thoughts on that?

00:56:34.810 --> 00:56:35.490
- Yeah.

00:56:35.490 --> 00:56:41.550
So Hanns Eisler, the
composer of that score,

00:56:41.550 --> 00:56:45.570
was a student of
Arnold Schoenberg's.

00:56:45.570 --> 00:56:48.870
After A Survivor from
Warsaw was written,

00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:53.580
Eisler had comments
in a lecture,

00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:56.310
or a published
article, in which he

00:56:56.310 --> 00:57:01.740
said that Schoenberg was
the quintessential composer

00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:06.450
of fear, and that his
genius was in the fact

00:57:06.450 --> 00:57:13.140
that he understood the
meaning of aerial bombardment

00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:14.940
and the meaning of
the gas chambers

00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:18.240
back at a time when
the world was still

00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:20.700
safe for the man in the street.

00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:27.900
So Eisler, I think, had a very
apt sense, and sharp sense,

00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:30.660
of what Schoenberg
was trying to do.

00:57:34.001 --> 00:57:34.500
As

00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:36.583
As for that film, I mean,
I think it's interesting

00:57:36.583 --> 00:57:38.850
that familiarity
sometimes breeds contempt,

00:57:38.850 --> 00:57:43.890
and also, of course, sometimes
love when it comes to music.

00:57:43.890 --> 00:57:47.340
I thought also, during
your comment, about some

00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:50.310
of the ideas Philip
Glass sometimes brings up

00:57:50.310 --> 00:57:52.510
when he talks about
his own film music,

00:57:52.510 --> 00:58:00.030
and the idea of a score's
purpose as not to necessarily

00:58:00.030 --> 00:58:05.790
create an auditory analog,
a sonic kind of mirror,

00:58:05.790 --> 00:58:08.190
to the action that you're
seeing in the film,

00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:10.860
but rather to open
up a sense of space,

00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:15.150
almost a sense of
distance, between the music

00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:18.090
and the action within
which we, as viewers,

00:58:18.090 --> 00:58:22.590
or the individual self, can
appreciate what's being offered

00:58:22.590 --> 00:58:24.870
to maximum effect.

00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:28.170
Obviously, Eisler had not
read Philip Glass when doing--

00:58:28.170 --> 00:58:31.740
and Philip Glass had
written those things yet.

00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:34.510
But those are a few thoughts
in responses to your comment.

00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:36.290
Thank you.

00:58:36.290 --> 00:58:36.790
- Thank you.

00:58:36.790 --> 00:58:37.540
Hello.

00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:38.640
I'm Aleksandra Kremer.

00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:40.700
I'm an assistant
professor of Polish

00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:43.030
from the Slavic Department
here at Harvard.

00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:45.150
And I have like a very
short commentary, which

00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:47.020
will lead me to my question.

00:58:47.020 --> 00:58:51.300
And so thank you
for your great talk.

00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:53.130
Well, from the
American perspective,

00:58:53.130 --> 00:58:55.140
and also from the
perspective of music,

00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:58.590
certainly Schoenberg's work
is like a very early response,

00:58:58.590 --> 00:59:00.030
very quick response.

00:59:00.030 --> 00:59:04.890
It made me very quickly to think
also about earlier artistic

00:59:04.890 --> 00:59:08.910
responses to
Holocaust, and to war,

00:59:08.910 --> 00:59:11.640
which appeared especially
in Polish culture, like,

00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:15.300
for example, Czeslaw Milosz,
who lived in the occupied Warsaw

00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:17.250
exactly at the time of
the ghetto uprising,

00:59:17.250 --> 00:59:20.220
and wrote two of his important
poems in '43 already--

00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:23.640
A Poor Christian Looks at the
Ghetto and Campo dei Fiori.

00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:27.330
I think also of Zofia Nalkowska,
whose book, Medallions,

00:59:27.330 --> 00:59:30.430
responses to exactly
the Nazis crimes.

00:59:30.430 --> 00:59:33.460
And I think of Tadeusz
Borowsky, translated as,

00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:35.430
This Way for the Gas,
Ladies and Gentlemen.

00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:37.130
This was '46 already.

00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:38.970
And these were all
like radical revisions

00:59:38.970 --> 00:59:41.130
of what literature can be.

00:59:41.130 --> 00:59:43.510
And also, in terms
of memorialization,

00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:46.620
like the first tablet
honoring the heroes

00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:48.245
of the ghetto
uprising in Warsaw.

00:59:48.245 --> 00:59:51.660
In Warsaw, it was '46,
and the monument's '48.

00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:53.850
So it's like, from
European perspective,

00:59:53.850 --> 00:59:56.645
it's not that
early, even in '47.

00:59:56.645 --> 00:59:58.020
And this leads me
to a question--

00:59:58.020 --> 01:00:00.330
to what extent, really,
the soundscape, which

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:04.890
you have in your title, are
best conveyed via music,

01:00:04.890 --> 01:00:07.190
and not, for example,
like literature,

01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:10.200
as the soundscape also
consists of so many words

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.520
and exclamations.

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:14.910
And also, when I think
about theater and cinema,

01:00:14.910 --> 01:00:18.030
to what extent really
full soundscape can

01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:21.510
be best preserved in
the work of musical art,

01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:25.050
which is still not that radical,
in terms of experimentation,

01:00:25.050 --> 01:00:26.490
at least what we have here.

01:00:26.490 --> 01:00:30.300
And do you have any thoughts,
like a rivalry of these words,

01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:33.944
literature and music, in
terms of memorialization,

01:00:33.944 --> 01:00:36.360
because you mostly talked about
visual arts and monuments?

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:38.362
And I would like to
thank you so much.

01:00:38.362 --> 01:00:39.660
- Yeah.

01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:40.860
Thank you for the question.

01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:45.420
And I would never like
to think about a rivalry

01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:49.410
between literature and
music, as regards memory art.

01:00:49.410 --> 01:00:52.110
And I would hope that we
wouldn't have to choose.

01:00:52.110 --> 01:00:54.930
It does seem like, in
my own work with some

01:00:54.930 --> 01:00:58.230
of these pieces, and
generally as a critic,

01:00:58.230 --> 01:01:03.450
I've often tried to read
music and literature, or music

01:01:03.450 --> 01:01:06.960
and other arts, in the
image of each other,

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:10.170
as a helpful way to write and
to think, and to make sense

01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:13.920
of what was being done by these
artists who were all breathing

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:14.770
the same air.

01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:22.540
The idea of the
soundscape in the title,

01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:24.460
again, comes from
Murray Schafer.

01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:27.460
And I hadn't been
thinking about it

01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:31.360
as kind of having anyone
appointed to sort of check

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:36.760
the passport of the art form at
the border, if you understand.

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:41.040
I would be happy to think
more about literature's place

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.370
in the soundscape.

01:01:42.370 --> 01:01:45.400
For me, it was just
a way of distilling

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:49.570
this idea of auditory
memory, and of getting

01:01:49.570 --> 01:01:55.700
at some of these issues
of sound specificity.

01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:58.270
I have in my work already
written a whole chapter

01:01:58.270 --> 01:02:02.170
on the way stone monuments
differ from monuments in sound.

01:02:02.170 --> 01:02:04.600
And it's a great
idea, perhaps it

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:07.510
would be really helpful and
instructive, to think through,

01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:10.780
in a systematic
way, how memorials

01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:13.330
in literature and
words also might

01:02:13.330 --> 01:02:15.130
differ from memorials in sound.

01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:18.570
Thank you for your comment.

01:02:18.570 --> 01:02:20.380
- My name is Donald Tipper.

01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:22.320
I'm a retired professor
at the University

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.780
of Massachusetts Medical School.

01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:28.230
And I had a question
relating to a somewhat more

01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:30.990
universal consequence
of warfare,

01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:33.890
and that is the
effect on children.

01:02:33.890 --> 01:02:36.440
That happens wherever
it is, whatever

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:42.330
country, the young always
those who suffer terribly.

01:02:42.330 --> 01:02:44.520
I was four years old
when war was declared

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:47.250
in the United Kingdom
in 1939, and I

01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:49.530
can remember it very well.

01:02:49.530 --> 01:02:52.680
But there are certain things
that bring back memories.

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:58.530
Of course, odors are the most
direct things that bring back

01:02:58.530 --> 01:03:00.460
memories to almost everybody.

01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:03.130
But sound is probably next.

01:03:03.130 --> 01:03:06.360
And for a child who lived in a
country which was not invaded,

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:12.405
but which was bombarded, the
sound that is most provocative

01:03:12.405 --> 01:03:15.760
is the sound of the
air raid warning sound.

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:18.010
Just a siren going up and down.

01:03:18.010 --> 01:03:19.810
That was actually
part of the background

01:03:19.810 --> 01:03:23.080
music in the Koussevitzky,
I think it was.

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:26.680
And I'm surprised that there
are not more references

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:30.010
to that kind of
influence of sound

01:03:30.010 --> 01:03:32.590
within the music
that tries to reflect

01:03:32.590 --> 01:03:35.650
the experiences of warfare.

01:03:35.650 --> 01:03:38.110
Of course, explosions
and that sort of thing,

01:03:38.110 --> 01:03:40.240
everybody can expect that.

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:45.830
But something that has more to
do with everybody's experience.

01:03:45.830 --> 01:03:49.340
Because not
everybody is directly

01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:53.930
affected by such events,
but the fear is universal.

01:03:57.182 --> 01:03:58.890
I don't know what you
can say about that,

01:03:58.890 --> 01:04:02.915
but I just thought it
was worth discussing.

01:04:02.915 --> 01:04:04.290
- Thank you for
your observation.

01:04:04.290 --> 01:04:06.507
There were so many
musical memorials

01:04:06.507 --> 01:04:08.340
I didn't get to speak
about today because we

01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:10.060
had a short amount of time.

01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:12.420
One of them, of course,
is Britten's War Requiem,

01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:14.910
which was written in
response to the 1940

01:04:14.910 --> 01:04:19.260
bombing of the Coventry
Cathedral in the UK.

01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:24.930
And incidentally, the Nazi code
name for that bombing operation

01:04:24.930 --> 01:04:25.905
was Moonlight Sonata.

01:04:31.590 --> 01:04:34.620
There are other memorials,
not necessarily the Britten,

01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:35.940
but other ones.

01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:41.130
For example, there's a piece
written, called Threnody

01:04:41.130 --> 01:04:43.350
for the Victims of Hiroshima.

01:04:43.350 --> 01:04:46.050
There are all kinds
of memorials that

01:04:46.050 --> 01:04:48.480
do try to take a more
naturalistic approach

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:53.890
to depicting what is the actual
auditory landscape, soundscape

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:56.130
of war.

01:04:56.130 --> 01:04:58.320
You know, samples
and other things.

01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:01.970
I think it gets us back
into some thorny territory.

01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:08.640
Is that kind of
direct literalness,

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:12.531
if you will-- transcribing
the wartime acoustic-- is

01:05:12.531 --> 01:05:14.280
that going to be the
most effective medium

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:15.795
of commemoration?

01:05:15.795 --> 01:05:18.780
Or is there something
reductive in that,

01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:23.190
and will some people find more
powerful these other works that

01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:25.530
are trying, in different
kinds of evocative language

01:05:25.530 --> 01:05:28.430
and with texts, to maybe
get to a similar place?

01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:30.200
But it's a really good point.

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:32.610
And it reminds me
to emphasize to you

01:05:32.610 --> 01:05:37.020
all just how we've got to hear
obviously a very small range

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:38.458
of musical memorials today.

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:45.410
- I'm Daniel Stepner.

01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:48.110
I'm a musician.

01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:50.930
So many references came up.

01:05:50.930 --> 01:05:51.830
So many things.

01:05:51.830 --> 01:05:54.620
Just to mention a few,
[INAUDIBLE] seems to me

01:05:54.620 --> 01:06:00.770
a memorial of European culture
before the First World War.

01:06:00.770 --> 01:06:01.810
Very interesting.

01:06:01.810 --> 01:06:07.110
Also, Charles Ives'
song, They Are There.

01:06:10.490 --> 01:06:15.200
There's a recording you can find
online, I'm sure, now of Ives

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:17.330
himself singing this,
and playing piano

01:06:17.330 --> 01:06:20.720
while he's singing, and it is
full of such incredible energy

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:26.870
and rage at Hitler, basically.

01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:29.400
It was recorded during the
war, but it's worth hearing,

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:29.900
I think.

01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:32.510
An important document.

01:06:32.510 --> 01:06:37.700
But I guess my question,
Jeremy, is based on a lecture

01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:41.960
I heard you do last year
at Brandeis, and that is,

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:47.810
linking Survivor from Warsaw
to Schoenberg's opera, Moses

01:06:47.810 --> 01:06:52.651
and Aaron, do you care to
talk about that a little bit?

01:06:52.651 --> 01:06:53.150
- Sure.

01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:54.650
That's great.

01:06:54.650 --> 01:06:56.890
Thank you.

01:06:56.890 --> 01:06:59.510
So I have written--

01:06:59.510 --> 01:07:03.120
it's strange to say, but
I have written a full page

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:07.160
manuscript about those seven
minutes of music that we heard.

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:15.410
And one aspect of what Mr.
Stepner is referring to

01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:17.330
is that I spend a
lot of time talking

01:07:17.330 --> 01:07:20.360
about Schoenberg's opera,
Moses and Aaron, which

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:23.510
was the last major work he
completed while still living

01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:27.730
in Germany, before fleeing
to the United States.

01:07:27.730 --> 01:07:29.870
It's a biblically-themed opera.

01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:32.990
It has two acts
that were written,

01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:34.880
and a third that
was never completed.

01:07:37.610 --> 01:07:40.280
There is a lot to
say about that,

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:42.710
and we're basically out
of time, so I'm just

01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:45.290
going to try to distill
a kernel or two.

01:07:45.290 --> 01:07:50.780
I think it was Schoenberg's
daughter, Nuria,

01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:54.800
who first referenced in passing
this idea that perhaps Survivor

01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:58.820
from Warsaw should be thought
of as the third act of Moses

01:07:58.820 --> 01:08:00.620
and Aaron.

01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:06.620
And this is, I found, a very
provocative and suggestive line

01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:08.330
of thinking, And
one that I ended up

01:08:08.330 --> 01:08:12.680
picking up in that longer
work and drawing out

01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:14.300
a lot of these connections.

01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:20.270
I think that the reason that
Schoenberg could not complete

01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:24.109
Moses and Aaron-- and this
is my own personal theory--

01:08:24.109 --> 01:08:29.779
is that the work itself was
this kind of final Herculean

01:08:29.779 --> 01:08:35.479
attempt to hold in tension,
and really to reconcile,

01:08:35.479 --> 01:08:38.750
these forces of
Jewishness and Germanness

01:08:38.750 --> 01:08:43.040
that were so definitive for him
over the course of his life up

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:44.660
to that point.

01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:48.080
And of course, when he tried
to return to the work in exile,

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:51.120
the very idea of that
reconciliation of Germanness

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:55.340
and Jewishness had itself
been sort of, we can say,

01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:57.640
I guess, shipwrecked by history.

01:09:00.170 --> 01:09:02.420
So there's a lot of connection
between Moses and Aaron

01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:05.550
and Survivor, and it would be
fun to talk about that with you

01:09:05.550 --> 01:09:06.480
all some other time.

01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:07.680
Thank you.

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:09.180
