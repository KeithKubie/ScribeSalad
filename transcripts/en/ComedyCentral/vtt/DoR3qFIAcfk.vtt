00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:07.173
- Mark's eyes rolled
into the back of his head.

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:10.276
And he starts to spit out
Mountain Dew and Cheeto dust.

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:11.677
He looks like a dragon,

00:00:11.677 --> 00:00:13.113
and he starts swinging
the joystick

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:15.414
in front of his body
like a martial arts weapon,

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:18.450
and for the first time I saw
fear in my big brother's eyes.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.919
He was like, "Hey, dude,
take it easy,"

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:23.556
and he's like--
[high-pitched voice] "Hiyah!"

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:25.558

I think family's
a pretty incredible thing

00:01:20.946 --> 00:01:24.651
Like, seriously, if you think
back to your childhood,

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:27.487

a stranger now

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:29.622
as poorly as you treated
your brothers, sisters,

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:32.358

you'd be in jail right now.

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:33.760
That's the truth.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.362
In my house, a felony
was committed every day.

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:38.130
Every day,
a felony was committed.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.534
Blackmail, extortion,
assault, larceny,

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:44.337

attempted murder.

00:01:44.337 --> 00:01:45.838
It happened all the time,

00:01:45.838 --> 00:01:47.774
because my big brother
was the worst offender.

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.174
He was a dick, okay?

00:01:49.174 --> 00:01:51.010
And I remember
this one year for Christmas

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.346
we all got excited,
because we had to come together

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:56.349
and ask Santa for a family gift,
like, a big gift,

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:58.784
and I was like, "Oh, what are we
gonna get? Can we get a monkey?"

00:01:58.784 --> 00:02:01.053
Right, like, I didn't know.
Right?

00:02:01.053 --> 00:02:03.789
And my big brother was like,
"We're gonna get an Atari."

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:05.224
I'm like, "I don't even know
what that is."

00:02:05.224 --> 00:02:08.560
He was like,
"We're gonna ask for an Atari."

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.130
So, we got an Atari
that year for Christmas,

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.300
and if you're not old enough
to remember what an Atari is,

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.036
it was the first
video game system for the house.

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:19.472
Dude, right, I--so many kids,
they're like, "What do you mean?

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:20.873
You couldn't play
on your phone?"

00:02:20.873 --> 00:02:22.875
No, dude, back in the day
you needed a quarter

00:02:22.875 --> 00:02:24.911
to play video games,
and you'd run out,

00:02:24.911 --> 00:02:26.379
so you'd have to go
through your house

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.381
like the goddamn Goonies
looking for pirate treasure

00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:30.649
to find another quarter.

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:33.219
I'm going, like, "Where did Dad
sit? Check the couch there."

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:34.721
We're going through my mom's
old jackets.

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:37.256
[imitates hawk]
"We got quarters!"

00:02:37.256 --> 00:02:39.525
So you'd ride your bike
to a video game thing

00:02:39.525 --> 00:02:41.226
or maybe get a ride
to the mall,

00:02:41.226 --> 00:02:42.895
and then you could be
at the arcade,

00:02:42.895 --> 00:02:44.430
but then, you could be
in the middle of a game,

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.065
and three teenagers show up
in Black Sabbath t-shirts,

00:02:47.065 --> 00:02:48.701
and you're like,
"Forget it,

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:49.735
"I'm not getting stabbed
over Q*bert.

00:02:49.735 --> 00:02:51.737
The game's yours."

[cheers and applause]

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:56.876
So--so this Atari
was supposed to bring joy

00:02:56.876 --> 00:03:00.246
into our house,
but it didn't,

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:02.115
'cause my big brother
ruined it.

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:03.916
And it wasn't the fact
that he would just beat us

00:03:03.916 --> 00:03:06.686
in the video games.
He would sing songs to us

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:08.454

in the games.

He's like, "Hey, relax,
it's just a game."

00:03:18.764 --> 00:03:21.700
So we're still playing,
and then he kept quiet.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.035
And then right before the game
was over,

00:03:23.035 --> 00:03:24.770
he'd go,
"Do you hear that?"

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.540

He goes, "Shh, shh, shh!

"Do you hear that?"
I go, "What?"

And I hit him,

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:45.257
but that's what he wanted,
he wanted me to hit him,

00:03:45.257 --> 00:03:47.126
because he outweighed me
by 100 pounds,

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:48.961
and then he'd just start
to choke-slam me

00:03:48.961 --> 00:03:52.131
like André the Giant
and drop a big Hulk Hogan leg

00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:54.800
and then pin me for a five count
like King Kong Bundy,

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.069
and then my dad would be like,
"Son of a bitch!

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.104
I'll unplug
the goddamn game!"

00:03:59.104 --> 00:04:01.974
Now my dad's running downstairs,
he's breaking up the fight.

00:04:01.974 --> 00:04:03.309
He's like, "Chris,
go to your room!"

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:05.277
And Chris is like,
"Steve started it."

00:04:05.277 --> 00:04:07.814
And he was like, "Well, then
you're going to your room too!"

00:04:07.814 --> 00:04:09.616
How the hell is that fair?

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:12.752
That's not fair.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.989
It's not.

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.258
So my little brother knew

00:04:19.258 --> 00:04:21.794
he could never beat up
my big brother.

00:04:21.794 --> 00:04:24.296
So he decided to get him
where it counted.

00:04:24.296 --> 00:04:27.300
Video game championship

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.600
Yes.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.938
My little brother became
like the Rudy of video games.

00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:37.776
He would wake up
at 5:00 in the morning

00:04:37.776 --> 00:04:41.113
when nobody was awake
just to practice.

00:04:41.113 --> 00:04:43.782
He knew where my mom hid
all the junk food,

00:04:43.782 --> 00:04:45.485
so he would steal,
like, a 2-liter bottle

00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:47.120
of Mountain Dew.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.721
Bro, before there was Red Bull
or 5-Hour Energy,

00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:51.557
there was mother-effing
Mountain Dew.

00:04:51.557 --> 00:04:53.292
[cheering]
Right?

00:04:53.292 --> 00:04:55.461
Twice the caffeine,
twice the sugar.

00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:58.798
He's drinking it warm
straight out of the 2-liter.

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:01.533
He looked like a rapper
drinking a 40 of St. Ides

00:05:01.533 --> 00:05:02.701
back in the '90s.

00:05:02.701 --> 00:05:04.203
He'd be like "Mountain Dew!"

00:05:04.203 --> 00:05:06.205
And then his little heart
would start getting jacked,

00:05:06.205 --> 00:05:08.741
and he's ripping open cheese
curls at 6:00 in the morning,

00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:10.643
shoving Cheetos
in his mouth,

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:12.144
and that orange
and cheese curl dust

00:05:12.144 --> 00:05:13.712
is floating
through the living room

00:05:13.712 --> 00:05:15.314
like cocaine
in "The Departed."

00:05:15.314 --> 00:05:17.016
Do you remember
when Nicholson had these, like--

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:18.884
[high-pitched voice]
"Cheese curls! Cheese curls!"

00:05:18.884 --> 00:05:20.853
And then he would get excited
and backwash it

00:05:20.853 --> 00:05:23.222
into the Mountain Dew--
disgusting.

00:05:23.222 --> 00:05:25.091
'Cause it looked like
a bottle of Goldschlager

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:27.226
with, like, just pieces of stuff
floating in there

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:30.396
like one of those
snow globes.

00:05:30.396 --> 00:05:33.032
So Mark, he got really good
at video games, right?

00:05:33.032 --> 00:05:36.235
But then some of the kids
didn't believe him,

00:05:36.235 --> 00:05:38.004
that he got that good
at video games.

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:39.372
They're like, "Why are you lying
to make friends?"

00:05:39.372 --> 00:05:44.176
He's like,
"I didn't. I did it."

00:05:44.176 --> 00:05:45.911
So this is how smart
my little brother was.

00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:48.680
He's like,
"I'm gonna need evidence."

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.950
So he bought
a Polaroid camera

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.451
to take pictures
of the TV set

00:05:52.451 --> 00:05:55.120
to prove that he beat games
and stuff.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.390
And then, I remember
this kid Jason was like,

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.124
"You--we don't believe you."
He's like, "Oh, really?

00:05:59.124 --> 00:06:00.726
I wish I had something
to show you."

00:06:00.726 --> 00:06:02.261
Boom. Right?

00:06:02.261 --> 00:06:05.264
And everybody's like,
"Oh, that's awesome!"

00:06:05.264 --> 00:06:06.632
And then Jason was like,
"Yeah?

00:06:06.632 --> 00:06:08.100
Well, how do we know
you did it?"

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.602
And the next picture is,
like, my little brother

00:06:09.602 --> 00:06:11.036
hugging the TV like--

00:06:11.036 --> 00:06:12.238
[high-pitched voice]
"I knocked out Mike Tyson,

00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:14.106

00:06:14.106 --> 00:06:17.543
So, Mark got good
at games.

00:06:17.543 --> 00:06:19.312
My big brother doesn't
know this, right?

00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:23.449
Couple years had gone by.
I remember this day vividly.

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:25.451
Okay.

00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:28.220
My big brother's
on the game console,

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.888
he's down there,
he's warming up.

00:06:29.888 --> 00:06:31.323
He doesn't know
Mark's gotten this good.

00:06:31.323 --> 00:06:32.258
We are confident.

00:06:32.258 --> 00:06:33.893
I mean,
we come down the steps

00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:35.995
like Ric Flair
in The Four Horsemen confident.

00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:38.631
Like, my little brother's
like, "Whoo!

00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:40.333
"You might not like it,
but one day,

00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:41.967
you'll learn to love it,
fat boy!"

00:06:41.967 --> 00:06:45.337
Let's rock."

00:06:45.337 --> 00:06:47.606
Mark immediately starts
lighting him up

00:06:47.606 --> 00:06:49.441
and he's like,
"It's awfully quiet over there,

00:06:49.441 --> 00:06:52.345
you must be losing.
Bawk, bawk." Right?

00:06:52.345 --> 00:06:55.814
And Chris is like, "Shut up."
And Mark's like, "Okay. Relax.

00:06:55.814 --> 00:06:59.685
"It's just a game.

00:06:59.685 --> 00:07:02.421
Hey, Chris, do you hear that?"
And Chris goes, "Hear what?"

00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:05.524
He goes, "I think it's Queen
warming up in the background."

So I'm like, "Dude,
where's your camera?"

00:07:17.203 --> 00:07:18.971
And he's like, "Oh, my God!
I left it upstairs."

00:07:18.971 --> 00:07:20.439
I'm like, "What?"

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:22.274
He goes, "It's next to

and Mark's not looking,

00:07:30.483 --> 00:07:31.350
So much worse.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.119
So I'm coming down the steps

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:35.020
and I just see Mark going,
"I can't move my man.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.190
"I can't move my man!
Hit pause! Hit pause!"

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.559
And Chris is going, "What?
I can't hear you.

00:07:40.559 --> 00:07:41.961
Queen's playing too loud."

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:43.696
He's like,
"This doesn't count!"

00:07:43.696 --> 00:07:45.031
Chris wins the game.

00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:47.065
Immediately,
Mark starts to cry.

00:07:47.065 --> 00:07:49.735
"I hate you." And when Mark
pushes Chris away,

00:07:49.735 --> 00:07:52.171
he sees that
that cord was unplugged.

00:07:52.171 --> 00:07:56.142
Oh, my effing goodness.

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:58.644
I didn't think this could happen
in real life.

00:07:58.644 --> 00:08:01.547
Mark's eyes rolled
into the back of his head,

00:08:01.547 --> 00:08:04.717
and he starts to spit out
Mountain Dew and Cheeto dust.

00:08:04.717 --> 00:08:06.085
He looks like a dragon.

00:08:06.085 --> 00:08:07.553
And he starts swinging
the joystick

00:08:07.553 --> 00:08:09.722
in front of his body
like a martial arts weapon.

00:08:09.722 --> 00:08:12.858
And for the first time, I saw
fear in my big brother's eyes.

00:08:12.858 --> 00:08:14.326
He was like, "Hey dude.
Take it easy."

00:08:14.326 --> 00:08:17.662
And he was like,
"I hate you!"

00:08:17.662 --> 00:08:19.999
Now it's over his head
like Indiana Jones.

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:23.035
It sounds like a Blackhawk's
landing in our family room.

00:08:23.035 --> 00:08:25.571
And he's just going,
"Die, bitch, die!"

00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:27.906
And he starts to smash
my big brother in the face.

00:08:27.906 --> 00:08:29.341
I'm like,
"What should I do?"

00:08:29.341 --> 00:08:32.778
And Mark, he's like,
"Help me!"

00:08:32.778 --> 00:08:34.113
So we double-teamed on him,

00:08:34.113 --> 00:08:36.415
dropping those
mother-effing bees on him.

00:08:36.415 --> 00:08:38.917
We're giving him
a ghetto boy's beat down.

00:08:38.917 --> 00:08:41.686
I don't know if it's doing
any damage, but it feels great.

00:08:41.686 --> 00:08:44.256
I'm like, "Take that,
fat boy, take that."

00:08:44.256 --> 00:08:46.725
Marky starts to take
the cord,

00:08:46.725 --> 00:08:49.695
and he's wrapping it
around Chris' throat.

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:52.765
He's making noises like
Luca Brasi in "The Godfather."

00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:55.935
Like--[groaning]

00:08:55.935 --> 00:08:57.369
I'm like,
"You're gonna kill him!"

00:08:57.369 --> 00:08:59.938
"I want to kill him!"
"I want to kill him!"

00:08:59.938 --> 00:09:01.807
So as Mark's leaning in
on the choke,

00:09:01.807 --> 00:09:03.542
I see Chris's legs
start to shake,

00:09:03.542 --> 00:09:05.410
and his chubby fingers
going back and forth like this.

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:07.646
Like--
[breathing heavily]

00:09:07.646 --> 00:09:10.749
Like Hulk Hogan in The Sleeper,
and he just throws Mark.

00:09:10.749 --> 00:09:12.785
[whooshes]
Mark flies.

00:09:12.785 --> 00:09:15.988
And he gets up and he's like--
[breathing heavily]

00:09:15.988 --> 00:09:18.490
And I'm like, "Hey man.

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:21.126
I'm glad you won."

00:09:21.126 --> 00:09:23.462
And he goes, "Oh, yeah?
I'm glad I did this."

00:09:23.462 --> 00:09:26.465
And he went...boom.

00:09:26.465 --> 00:09:28.066
Right in my face.

00:09:28.066 --> 00:09:33.172
Now, look, there's a code
to brother wars.

00:09:33.172 --> 00:09:35.974
It's passed down
from generation to generation.

00:09:35.974 --> 00:09:38.844
No punching to the face.

00:09:38.844 --> 00:09:40.679
Everything else is
on the books.

00:09:40.679 --> 00:09:42.147
You could throw a ninja star
at your brother,

00:09:42.147 --> 00:09:43.482
launch a bottle rocket
at him,

00:09:43.482 --> 00:09:45.251
put a stick in his bike
and watch him flip over.

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:48.587
All that's cool.

00:09:48.587 --> 00:09:51.490
But no kicking to the balls
and no punching to the face.

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:53.626
So he drops me,
and I'm pissed.

00:09:53.626 --> 00:09:58.431
I get up and I'm like,
"Oh, ho, ho, eff this.

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:01.033
I'm getting Mom!"
And I take off.

00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:02.334
He's like,
"Where are you going?"

00:10:02.334 --> 00:10:03.969
I'm like,
"I'm getting Mom!

00:10:03.969 --> 00:10:06.538
You're going to jail, bitch!
You're going to jail!"

00:10:06.538 --> 00:10:09.007
And Mark is like,
"We're pressing charges!

00:10:09.007 --> 00:10:12.944
We're pressing charges!"

00:10:12.944 --> 00:10:15.847
Now, Chris is real calm, and
he's like, "Where you going?"

00:10:15.847 --> 00:10:19.818
I'm like, "I'm getting Mom!
You're going to jail, bitch!"

00:10:19.818 --> 00:10:21.720
And he just looks at me,
he goes,

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.024
"You mean, uh, my mom, right?"

00:10:25.024 --> 00:10:28.194
And I went...

00:10:30.696 --> 00:10:32.698
"Get--I'm getting Mom."
He's like,

00:10:32.698 --> 00:10:34.867
"The woman you live with?

00:10:34.867 --> 00:10:37.536
"That's my mom.

00:10:37.536 --> 00:10:41.040
Nobody ever told you
that you were adopted?"

00:10:44.543 --> 00:10:46.578
And Marky goes,
"That's not true."

00:10:46.578 --> 00:10:48.481
"Is it not true?
Did I punch you in the face?

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:50.716
"No, 'cause you're
my real brother.

00:10:50.716 --> 00:10:54.053
I punched Steve in the face
'cause he's a stranger."

00:10:56.822 --> 00:10:58.424
I was like,

00:10:58.424 --> 00:11:00.325
"Well, I'm--
I'm still gonna tell."

00:11:00.325 --> 00:11:02.728
He's like, "Go ahead.

00:11:02.728 --> 00:11:07.766
"Tell my mom that her real son
had to punch you in the face.

00:11:07.766 --> 00:11:09.535
"See what happens.

00:11:09.535 --> 00:11:12.104
She'll make you pack up
your stuff and leave."

00:11:12.104 --> 00:11:14.773
I was like...

00:11:14.773 --> 00:11:18.210
[laughter]

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:21.347
"I don't have
anywhere else to go."

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:27.085
So he's like, "Well...

00:11:27.085 --> 00:11:28.420
"I guess I won't tell.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:30.088
"So if you don't tell,

00:11:30.088 --> 00:11:33.024
you can just come down here
and pretend this didn't happen."

00:11:33.024 --> 00:11:36.195
I was like,
"Thanks, man."

00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:38.764
He's an evil genius.

00:11:38.764 --> 00:11:41.867
He punches me in the face
and I'm thanking him for it.

00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:45.370
So I didn't--I didn't have
an ending to that story,

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:47.272
'cause that, like, happened.

00:11:47.272 --> 00:11:48.908
Do you know what I mean?
Like, it just--

00:11:48.908 --> 00:11:50.609
I was just like, "Yeah,
my big brother was a jerk

00:11:50.609 --> 00:11:52.745
and had me convinced
for a couple years

00:11:52.745 --> 00:11:54.146
that I was adopted.

00:11:54.146 --> 00:11:55.547
Like, it happened
all the time.

00:11:55.547 --> 00:11:56.548
We would always fight,
we would always say

00:11:56.548 --> 00:11:58.116
the meanest stuff possible.

00:11:58.116 --> 00:12:00.319
So then I was like, "Yeah,
if I talk about this onstage,

00:12:00.319 --> 00:12:02.821
people can relate to it,
you know?"

00:12:02.821 --> 00:12:04.724
That's it, like, big brother--
brothers can be mean

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:06.592
and you love each other
through it and that's it.

00:12:06.592 --> 00:12:08.560
Now we're awesome friends.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.597
So, one night after a show,
this guy came up to me,

00:12:12.597 --> 00:12:15.133
and he was like,
"You know what, dude?

00:12:15.133 --> 00:12:16.935
"My big brother,
same thing.

00:12:16.935 --> 00:12:19.004
He used to tell me I was adopted
all the time."

00:12:19.004 --> 00:12:20.806
He--and I was like,
"Yeah, they're jerks, right?"

00:12:20.806 --> 00:12:23.242
And he was like,
"Well, the messed up thing is,

00:12:23.242 --> 00:12:26.812
years later I found out
I really was adopted.

00:12:26.812 --> 00:12:29.848
Yeah, and here's the thing
though, he wasn't the only--

00:12:29.848 --> 00:12:31.617
People started to come up to me
and they were like--

00:12:31.617 --> 00:12:33.819
Like, they had this uneasiness
about being adopted.

00:12:33.819 --> 00:12:35.520
I'm like, "Oh, my God,
this is not what I want to do."

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.190
I want to put more love
into the world

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:39.825
and remind people
that family's awesome

00:12:39.825 --> 00:12:42.194
and it's the little things
and pizza night and stuff.

00:12:42.194 --> 00:12:43.929
You know?

00:12:43.929 --> 00:12:47.132
And then the other thing is,
like, so I always thought

00:12:47.132 --> 00:12:48.934
I wanted to adopt kids
at some point,

00:12:48.934 --> 00:12:51.002
maybe 'cause, in hindsight,
my brother told me

00:12:51.002 --> 00:12:54.606
I was adopted
for years.

00:12:54.606 --> 00:12:56.708
But, right, like I think
what a privilege it would be,

00:12:56.708 --> 00:12:58.677
'cause getting back to that
whole unconditional love thing.

00:12:58.677 --> 00:13:01.814
Like, how amazing that would be
to, like, one day hear my kids

00:13:01.814 --> 00:13:04.116
getting into a fight downstairs
and one kid's like,

00:13:04.116 --> 00:13:05.684
"You know you were adopted?"

00:13:05.684 --> 00:13:07.152
And he's like, "Yeah,
that's right, bitch,

00:13:07.152 --> 00:13:08.453
"'cause Mom and Dad
wanted me.

00:13:08.453 --> 00:13:09.821
"They walked into a room
and picked me out.

00:13:09.821 --> 00:13:10.956
"You were an accident.

00:13:10.956 --> 00:13:12.357
"You just showed up
and they were like,

00:13:12.357 --> 00:13:13.659
'How we gonna feed this one?'"

00:13:13.659 --> 00:13:15.060
Good night
and God bless you.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.528
Take care.
