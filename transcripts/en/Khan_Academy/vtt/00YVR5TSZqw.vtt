00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:02.250
- [Instructor] Adrianna gathered data

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.249
on different schools' winning percentages

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:07.968
and the average yearly
salary of their head coaches

00:00:07.968 --> 00:00:12.225
in millions of dollars in
the years 2000 to 2011.

00:00:12.225 --> 00:00:15.619
She then created the following
scatter plot and trend line.

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.604
So this is salary in millions of dollars

00:00:17.604 --> 00:00:19.936
and the winning percentage.

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:24.056
And so here, we have a coach
who made over $4 million,

00:00:24.056 --> 00:00:28.413
and looks like they won
over 80% of their games.

00:00:28.413 --> 00:00:29.831
But you have this coach over here

00:00:29.831 --> 00:00:31.313
who has a salary of a little over

00:00:31.313 --> 00:00:32.823
a million and a half dollars,

00:00:32.823 --> 00:00:35.451
and they are winning over 85%,

00:00:35.451 --> 00:00:38.119
and so each of one of these data points

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:39.576
is a coach,

00:00:39.576 --> 00:00:41.701
and is plotting their salary

00:00:41.701 --> 00:00:44.770
or their winning percentage
against their salary.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.326
Assuming the line correctly
shows the trend in the data,

00:00:48.326 --> 00:00:49.625
and it's a bit of an assumption,

00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:51.070
there are some outliers here

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.508
that are well away from the model,

00:00:53.508 --> 00:00:54.679
and this isn't a,

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:55.911
it looks like there's a linear,

00:00:55.911 --> 00:00:58.050
a positive linear correlation here,

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.582
but it's not super tight

00:00:59.582 --> 00:01:01.121
and there's a bunch of
coaches right over here,

00:01:01.121 --> 00:01:03.781
in the lower salary area,

00:01:03.781 --> 00:01:05.875
going all the way from
20 something percent

00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:07.483
to over 60 percent.

00:01:07.483 --> 00:01:10.209
Assuming the line correctly
shows the trend in the data,

00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:15.169
what does it mean that the
line's y intercept is 39?

00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:16.786
Well if you believe the model,

00:01:16.786 --> 00:01:19.784
then the y intercept of being 39

00:01:19.784 --> 00:01:22.357
would be the model is saying

00:01:22.357 --> 00:01:24.437
that if someone makes no money,

00:01:24.437 --> 00:01:26.583
that they could, zero dollars,

00:01:26.583 --> 00:01:28.054
that they could win,

00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:31.666
that the model would expect
them to win 39% of their games,

00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:33.230
which seems a little unrealistic,

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.072
because you would expect most
coaches to get paid something.

00:01:36.072 --> 00:01:37.760
But anyway, let's see
which of this choices

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.323
actually describe that.

00:01:40.323 --> 00:01:42.984
So let me look at the choices.

00:01:42.984 --> 00:01:46.124
The average salary was
39 million dollars, nope.

00:01:46.124 --> 00:01:48.108
No one on our chart made 39 million.

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:50.350
On average, each million
dollar increase in salary

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.765
was associated with a 39%
increase in winning percentage.

00:01:52.765 --> 00:01:56.686
That would be something
related to the slope

00:01:56.686 --> 00:01:58.735
and the slope was definitely not 39.

00:01:58.735 --> 00:02:01.353
The average winning percentage was 39%,

00:02:01.353 --> 00:02:02.692
we know that wasn't the case either.

00:02:02.692 --> 00:02:05.248
The model indicates
that teams with coaches

00:02:05.248 --> 00:02:06.781
who had a salary of zero millions dollars

00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:09.971
will average a winning
percentage of approximately 39%.

00:02:09.971 --> 00:02:12.717
Yeah this is the closest statement

00:02:12.717 --> 00:02:14.264
to what we just said,

00:02:14.264 --> 00:02:15.740
that if you believe that model,

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.285
and that's a big if,

00:02:17.285 --> 00:02:19.452
if you believe this model,

00:02:20.916 --> 00:02:23.375
then this model says
someone making zero dollars

00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:24.966
will get 39%,

00:02:24.966 --> 00:02:27.446
and this is frankly why you
have to be skeptical of models.

00:02:27.446 --> 00:02:28.688
They're not going to be perfect,

00:02:28.688 --> 00:02:31.249
especially in extreme cases oftentimes,

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:32.247
but who knows.

00:02:32.247 --> 00:02:34.873
Anyway, hopefully you found that useful.
