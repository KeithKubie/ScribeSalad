00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.500
Autism is a development disorder that

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.305
affects an individual's ability to socialize and communicate.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.560
Asperger's syndrome is part of the autism spectrum

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.120
but it differs because usually individuals diagnosed with Asperger's

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.340
have normal to higher IQs.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.820
overall though, both have many overlapping similarities,

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.650
and it is still being debated today

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.920
as to whether or not the two terms need to exist as separate diagnoses

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.550
Our mission is to break down stigmas,

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.020
myths, and misconceptions associated with autism.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.760
Many of our viewers have expressed concerns about the

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.140
misunderstandings that surround this disorder,

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.260
so we want to provide support to them and raise awareness.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.390
Here are five facts you need to know about autism.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.120
One, symptoms and signs of autism.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.920
Before we begin with this point,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.560
we want you to know that it's never a good idea to self diagnose.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.830
Please visit a health professional in order to receive reliable insights.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.330
According to Autism Speaks, more than 2 million people have autism spectrum

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.810
disorder and one in 59 of those people are children.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.150
Statistics also show that autism affects more boys than girls

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.273
The signs that health professionals look for in patients include:

00:01:17.274 --> 00:01:21.631
social challenges, communication, difficulties and repetitive behavior.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.650
Children with autism have trouble responding to social cues

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.640
such as returning a wave to someone

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.988
or being responsive when someone calls their name

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.630
They also have higher disinterest in people

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.050
starting at a young age

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.200
experienced a delay in learning speech

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.193
and have trouble reading body language.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.630
For instance, if someone is mad and crosses their arms

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.190
or expresses in patience by tapping their foot 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.360
People with autism can't pick up on that right away

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.510
they also tend to follow strict rigid schedules

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.540
and struggle with change.
they also tend to follow strict rigid schedules

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.000
and struggle with change.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.970
people with autism have few specific interests

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.220
that they are intensely devoted to

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.840
Two, causes of autism. Researchers have discovered that

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.080
there are many factors that influence the development of autism.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.340
one of them involves a specific gene that causes it.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.480
Other factors that are not genetic related involve environmental risks

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.500
 and events that happened before or during pregnancy

00:02:15.505 --> 00:02:18.681
for instance a baby may be susceptible to developing autism

00:02:18.682 --> 00:02:21.471
if the mother breathed in high levels of air pollution

00:02:21.472 --> 00:02:22.872
while she was pregnant

00:02:22.872 --> 00:02:26.542
or when the baby experiences a lack of oxygen in their brain,

00:02:26.542 --> 00:02:29.670
But none are certain and scientists are still searching

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.874
for a definitive cause ultimately.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.790
However, most adults with autism are less concerned with finding a cause

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.250
than they are with being accepted

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:40.069
and better understood by society

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.120
Three, treatment options. Unlike many disorders,

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.460
there is no medication that can specifically treat autism.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.810
Many people with autism use cognitive behavioral therapy

00:02:50.812 --> 00:02:52.710
in order to regulate their emotions

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.550
and to work on their impulse control.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.920
There are also support groups they can join,

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.574
speech therapists they can work with,

00:02:58.574 --> 00:03:00.451
and training sessions they can attend

00:03:00.451 --> 00:03:02.494
to build their social and motor skills

00:03:02.494 --> 00:03:04.663
related symptoms people with autism

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.140
may experience such as anxiety depression and ADD

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.220
can also be treated with the proper dosage prescribed by a health professional.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.420
For what teachers can do, educating children with autism

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.770
can be highly challenging.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.500
But here are some helpful tips they can use

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.150
when creating lesson plans,

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.980
Learn about what your students with autism like.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.570
People with autism have very distinct interests,

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.480
so if you can incorporate them to make

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.700
your lessons interesting,

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.130
This can help them engage with the material more.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.110
Another way is to allow for group discussions,

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.810
classroom discussions may be intimidating for students with autism

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.250
but one-on-one interactions is more approachable for them.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.470
It's also important to provide structure

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.280
and a schedule for them to follow.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.780
Predictability is crucial.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.370
Five, what parents can do.

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.990
It's important for parents to remember that

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.340
when their child has autism, they may have a hard time

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.450
fitting in in school,

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.140
or relating to other children.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.150
Be mindful of their habits

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.490
and teach them to love themselves for who they are.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.240
Provide a safe structure for them to thrive in

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.340
and attend programs where you can stay educated on autism

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.160
and enroll your child in classes

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.710
where they can work on their skills.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.660
Recognize that it will be a challenging journey ahead

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.550
but with your love and support it can go a long way

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:21.950
towards the progress they make.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.130
