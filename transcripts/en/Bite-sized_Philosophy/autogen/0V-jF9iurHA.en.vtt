okay so zebras have stripes and people

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080
okay so zebras have stripes and people
 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.590
okay so zebras have stripes and people
say well that's for camouflage and then

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600
say well that's for camouflage and then
 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.090
say well that's for camouflage and then
you think about that for two seconds and

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100
you think about that for two seconds and
 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.590
you think about that for two seconds and
you think that's a really stupid theory

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600
you think that's a really stupid theory
 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.840
you think that's a really stupid theory
because lions are camouflaged and

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850
because lions are camouflaged and
 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.060
because lions are camouflaged and
they're like golden like the grass and

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070
they're like golden like the grass and
 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.769
they're like golden like the grass and
zebras are black and white so you can

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779
zebras are black and white so you can
 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.960
zebras are black and white so you can
see a zebra five miles away it's like

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970
see a zebra five miles away it's like
 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.849
see a zebra five miles away it's like
there's a zebra it's black and white so

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859
there's a zebra it's black and white so
 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.889
there's a zebra it's black and white so
the whole camouflage thing that's just

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899
the whole camouflage thing that's just
 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.840
the whole camouflage thing that's just
not working out so well as a hypothesis

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850
not working out so well as a hypothesis
 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.690
not working out so well as a hypothesis
okay so by law biologists go and they

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700
okay so by law biologists go and they
 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.400
okay so by law biologists go and they
decide to take a look at some zebras and

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410
decide to take a look at some zebras and
 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.069
decide to take a look at some zebras and
so they're looking at a zebra at on the

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079
so they're looking at a zebra at on the
 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.130
so they're looking at a zebra at on the
herd because there's no zebra right just

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140
herd because there's no zebra right just
 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.290
herd because there's no zebra right just
like there's no fish there are schools

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300
like there's no fish there are schools
 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.270
like there's no fish there are schools
of fish and there are herds of zebras

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280
of fish and there are herds of zebras
 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.369
of fish and there are herds of zebras
there isn't a fish this is why I think

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379
there isn't a fish this is why I think
 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.979
there isn't a fish this is why I think
the cod aren't coming back there are no

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989
the cod aren't coming back there are no
 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.459
the cod aren't coming back there are no
Cod there are massive hundred mile long

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469
Cod there are massive hundred mile long
 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.049
Cod there are massive hundred mile long
schools of cod ten stories deep 20

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059
schools of cod ten stories deep 20
 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.910
schools of cod ten stories deep 20
million years old you wipe out the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920
million years old you wipe out the
 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.770
million years old you wipe out the
school you don't just get to throw a cod

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780
school you don't just get to throw a cod
 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.600
school you don't just get to throw a cod
in the water and say well you know ops

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610
in the water and say well you know ops
 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.969
in the water and say well you know ops
go it's like well where's my city

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979
go it's like well where's my city
 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.530
go it's like well where's my city
it's like launching you in the middle of

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540
it's like launching you in the middle of
 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.929
it's like launching you in the middle of
a field it's like well go out there and

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939
a field it's like well go out there and
 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.760
a field it's like well go out there and
reproduce like no that's not going to

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770
reproduce like no that's not going to
 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.190
reproduce like no that's not going to
happen you know so without the school

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200
happen you know so without the school
 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.899
happen you know so without the school
there's no Cod and you can't just

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909
there's no Cod and you can't just
 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.850
there's no Cod and you can't just
introduce a whole school of cod because

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860
introduce a whole school of cod because
 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.469
introduce a whole school of cod because
you don't have a whole school of cod so

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479
you don't have a whole school of cod so
 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.120
you don't have a whole school of cod so
you know maybe the cod are never coming

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130
you know maybe the cod are never coming
 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.859
you know maybe the cod are never coming
back and zebras are the same thing

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869
back and zebras are the same thing
 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.890
back and zebras are the same thing
there's not a zebra they're zebras and

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900
there's not a zebra they're zebras and
 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.289
there's not a zebra they're zebras and
so you're looking at the Zebras trying

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299
so you're looking at the Zebras trying
 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.030
so you're looking at the Zebras trying
to study a zebra and you look at the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040
to study a zebra and you look at the
 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.170
to study a zebra and you look at the
zebra and you make some notes if you

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180
zebra and you make some notes if you
 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.730
zebra and you make some notes if you
look up and you think oh Christ which

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740
look up and you think oh Christ which
 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.740
look up and you think oh Christ which
zebra was I looking at and the answer to

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750
zebra was I looking at and the answer to
 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.080
zebra was I looking at and the answer to
that is you don't know because the the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090
that is you don't know because the the
 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.870
that is you don't know because the the
camouflage is against the herd and the

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880
camouflage is against the herd and the
 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.920
camouflage is against the herd and the
black and white stripes there's a

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930
black and white stripes there's a
 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.840
black and white stripes there's a
variety of reasons for the stripes flies

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850
variety of reasons for the stripes flies
 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.940
variety of reasons for the stripes flies
off also seem not to like the stripes

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950
off also seem not to like the stripes
 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.710
off also seem not to like the stripes
but you know usually people things

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720
but you know usually people things
 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.050
but you know usually people things
evolve for multiple reasons but anyways

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060
evolve for multiple reasons but anyways
 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.850
evolve for multiple reasons but anyways
it's very difficult to parse out a zebra

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860
it's very difficult to parse out a zebra
 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.289
it's very difficult to parse out a zebra
against the herd you look down you look

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299
against the herd you look down you look
 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.719
against the herd you look down you look
up it's like oh all those damn zebras

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729
up it's like oh all those damn zebras
 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.850
up it's like oh all those damn zebras
look the same yes the camouflage is

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860
look the same yes the camouflage is
 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.340
look the same yes the camouflage is
effective but it's against the herd all

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350
effective but it's against the herd all
 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.080
effective but it's against the herd all
right so then you think well we better

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090
right so then you think well we better
 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.029
right so then you think well we better
identify a zebra so we can see what he's

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039
identify a zebra so we can see what he's
 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.540
identify a zebra so we can see what he's
up to

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550
up to
 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.510
up to
so then you take your Jeep and a can of

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520
so then you take your Jeep and a can of
 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.160
so then you take your Jeep and a can of
red paint and a stick with a rag on the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170
red paint and a stick with a rag on the
 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.360
red paint and a stick with a rag on the
end of it you drive up to the Z

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370
end of it you drive up to the Z
 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.940
end of it you drive up to the Z
and you paint their haunch red a little

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950
and you paint their haunch red a little
 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.500
and you paint their haunch red a little
bit put a nice red dot on their haunts

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510
bit put a nice red dot on their haunts
 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.940
bit put a nice red dot on their haunts
or maybe clip their ear with a cattle

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950
or maybe clip their ear with a cattle
 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.979
or maybe clip their ear with a cattle
clip and then you you know you stand

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989
clip and then you you know you stand
 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.630
clip and then you you know you stand
back and saying hey I'm pretty smart now

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640
back and saying hey I'm pretty smart now
 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.339
back and saying hey I'm pretty smart now
I'm going to watch that zebra so what do

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349
I'm going to watch that zebra so what do
 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.250
I'm going to watch that zebra so what do
you think happens to the zebra the Lions

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260
you think happens to the zebra the Lions
 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.509
you think happens to the zebra the Lions
kill it right right right

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519
kill it right right right
 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.089
kill it right right right
because lions they're smart right hunter

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099
because lions they're smart right hunter
 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.300
because lions they're smart right hunter
hunting animals are smart but they have

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310
hunting animals are smart but they have
 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.039
hunting animals are smart but they have
to identify a zebra before they can

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049
to identify a zebra before they can
 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.750
to identify a zebra before they can
organize their hunt they can't just hunt

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760
organize their hunt they can't just hunt
 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.149
organize their hunt they can't just hunt
the whole herd they have to pick out a

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159
the whole herd they have to pick out a
 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.729
the whole herd they have to pick out a
zebra and so maybe it's like a zebra

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739
zebra and so maybe it's like a zebra
 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.500
zebra and so maybe it's like a zebra
that's got a sore hip or something and

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510
that's got a sore hip or something and
 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.180
that's got a sore hip or something and
so you think well nature's kind it just

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190
so you think well nature's kind it just
 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.970
so you think well nature's kind it just
takes the week it's though no zebra or

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980
takes the week it's though no zebra or
 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.890
takes the week it's though no zebra or
Lions like really healthy delicious

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900
Lions like really healthy delicious
 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.780
Lions like really healthy delicious
zebras but they look like all the other

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790
zebras but they look like all the other
 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.580
zebras but they look like all the other
healthy delicious zebras so they can't

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590
healthy delicious zebras so they can't
 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.830
healthy delicious zebras so they can't
get a bead on them but if they're small

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840
get a bead on them but if they're small
 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.170
get a bead on them but if they're small
and just born or if they're limping or

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180
and just born or if they're limping or
 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.849
and just born or if they're limping or
there's something that identifies them

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859
there's something that identifies them
 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.140
