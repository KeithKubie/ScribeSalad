00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.694
Now let's discuss the first
major Internet worm,

00:00:03.694 --> 00:00:07.930
also called the Morris worm
after its creator Robert Morris.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.708
Here's how the worm worked.

00:00:09.708 --> 00:00:12.192
When the worm runs on a system,
it looks for

00:00:12.192 --> 00:00:15.241
other systems on the Internet
that it can spread to.

00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:19.137
For example, these systems have
some security vulnerabilities

00:00:19.137 --> 00:00:20.778
that the worm can exploit.

00:00:20.778 --> 00:00:24.187
And then by exploiting
these vulnerabilities,

00:00:24.187 --> 00:00:26.688
the worm can infect these systems.

00:00:26.688 --> 00:00:31.470
In other words, it can lure itself to
these systems and that's how it spread.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.221
Once the worm got on a system,

00:00:33.221 --> 00:00:37.787
it also employed a number of tricks in
order to keep himself from detectable.

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:41.534
According to each creator,
the Internet worm was made as part

00:00:41.534 --> 00:00:44.788
of an experiment to measure
the size of the internet.

00:00:44.788 --> 00:00:48.966
For example, by measuring how many
computers are connected together.

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:52.754
However, there was a programming
error in the code.

00:00:52.754 --> 00:00:56.230
That is the worm would infect
a computer regardless,

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.877
whether the computer had been infected
already one out of seven times.

00:01:00.877 --> 00:01:03.419
This proved to be too aggressive.

00:01:03.419 --> 00:01:07.239
And as a result,
many computers get infected repeatedly.

00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:11.849
That is on these computers, there
are many instances of the same worm

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:14.959
running resulting in
resource exhaustions.

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:18.201
And that's really how
the Internet worm was discovered,

00:01:18.201 --> 00:01:22.251
because the system admins find out
that their servers were overloaded.

00:01:22.251 --> 00:01:26.130
As a response, many system admins
disconnect their servers from

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.806
the internet in order to stop
the spread of the Internet worm.

00:01:29.806 --> 00:01:32.515
But since many servers
were disconnected,

00:01:32.515 --> 00:01:35.430
the Internet was disrupted as well.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.790
When the Internet worm identified
the next target to infect, it looked for

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.540
several security flaws that
it knew how to exploit.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.170
These include systems
with guessable passwords,

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.650
systems running the fingerd program that
had a buffer overflow vulnerability.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.393
Systems running a sendmail program that
has a trapdoor, which means that by

00:01:57.393 --> 00:02:02.375
supplying some special input commands,
one can gain access to these systems.

00:02:02.375 --> 00:02:05.079
When the security flaws were exploited,

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.562
the Internet worm can gain
access to a target system.

00:02:08.562 --> 00:02:13.031
It then will load a small piece of
code called the bootstrap loader on to

00:02:13.031 --> 00:02:18.510
a target machine and this loader will
then fetch the rest of the worm code.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.730
It even used password based
authentication to make sure that only

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.850
the bootstrap loader of the worm can
load the rest of the code of the worm.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.311
The Internet worm also employed
a number of tricks to hide itself.

00:02:32.311 --> 00:02:35.550
For example,
the worm code is loaded into the memory.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.494
It is encrypted and
decrypted when necessary and

00:02:38.494 --> 00:02:41.651
the original file is removed
from the hard drive, so

00:02:41.651 --> 00:02:44.908
that the user will not be
able to see the worm program.

00:02:44.908 --> 00:02:49.260
The worm even periodically change
its process name and process ID, so

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.128
that even when a system admin looks at
what programs are running on the server,

00:02:54.128 --> 00:02:57.028
he cannot easily discover
the Internet worm.

00:02:57.028 --> 00:03:01.617
The Internet worm resulted in major
deception to the Internet, because many

00:03:01.617 --> 00:03:05.725
servers were infected and had to
be disconnected from the Internet.

00:03:05.725 --> 00:03:08.300
So what lessons did we learn?

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.530
The first lesson we learned
was that we need to perform

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.080
security scanning and patching.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.891
The Internet worm was able to infect so
many servers,

00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:21.034
because these servers
had security flaws.

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:25.411
Further, most of these flaws
were not only well-known, but

00:03:25.411 --> 00:03:28.788
also had security patches or
fixes available.

00:03:28.788 --> 00:03:30.285
Therefore, if we scan and

00:03:30.285 --> 00:03:33.688
patch computers on the Internet
that have security flaws,

00:03:33.688 --> 00:03:38.290
then we can reduce the chances that
they will be infected by malware.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.710
The second lesson is that
we need to have a fast and

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.020
coordinated response to a major security
incident such as the Internet worm.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.610
And because of the Internet worm, the US
government established the computer

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.340
emergency response team or
CERT for short.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.840
Nowadays, CERT is
usually responsible for

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.980
issuing alerts about security for
flaws and recommendations about patches.
