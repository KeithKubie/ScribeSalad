00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.370
It's not easy being a teenager. There's
the angst. The emotions. The raging

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.260
hormones! And although hormones do play a big role in puberty, the brain is going

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.889
through a lot of changes too.
Neuroscientists are learning thatt some of

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:23.670
the most puzzling teenage behavior may
actually have some real benefits.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.660
legally, you're considered an adult when you turn18, but from the neuroscience perspective,

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.679
your brain is really still developing.
"And the current literature suggests that

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.809
it's about around age 25 or so is when
the brain finishes the period of

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.920
adolescence." This is Dr. Adriana
Galván and she runs the developmental

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.329
neuroscience lab at UCLA. The brain
develops from the back to the front, so

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.469
the prefrontal cortex is the last region
to fully develop. "The prefrontal cortex

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.129
is the part of the brain you need to
make good decisions, to think about the

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.090
future, think about consequences." You can kind of think of it like the Spock of

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.949
the brain: logical, calm and collected. And
then deeper in the brain there are these

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.790
emotional systems, like the limbic system, that are more interested in immediate

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.960
gratification. They're sort of like
Captain Kirk: a risk-taker and a bit

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.740
emotional. During the teenage years, the
limbic system develops really quickly

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.299
and the prefrontal cortex is trying to
catch up. Eventually as individuals

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.560
become adults, the prefrontal cortex will
increasingly have more influence over

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.700
behavior than the impulsive part of the
brain. So without a fully developed

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.619
prefrontal cortex, you can kind of see
why teens might be more impulsive or

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.060
just worry less about future
consequences. Another brain region that's

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.590
really active during adolescence is this
thing called the striatum and it's a key

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.549
part of the brain's reward system. Let's
say you find 20 bucks on the street or

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.930
someone gives you a cookie. The striatum goes off and it releases dopamine into

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.869
the brain.
Adrianna's lab discovered that the

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.710
teenage brain is super sensitive to
different rewards like sugar and money.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.000
Way, way more than in the brains of
adults and children. And all of this

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.970
activity in the brain's reward center, it
may actually serve a purpose.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.390
"We asked teenagers to come to the lab
and we scanned their brains while they

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.380
performed a learning task. They were
shown a picture of a butterfly and two

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.700
flowers and they were asked to guess
which flower the butterfly would land on."

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.720
After each guess, they were given
feedback. When the teens got it right,

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.430
their striatum would get really, really
active. "They would learn over time that

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.660
the butterfly preferred one flower over
the other — and everybody learned this,

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.410
but what we found is that the
adolescents learned it more quickly than

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.090
adults and with greater accuracy." So
having this reward center that's

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.930
hyperresponsive to feedback actually helps teenagers learn from their environment.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.670
But this same region of the brain is
also connected to risk-taking data from

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.750
Adriana's lab suggests that teens with a
more reactive striatum are more likely

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.330
to engage in risky behavior and to enjoy
it. "Rather than ask how you keep your

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.450
teenager from taking risks — because we
know the brain is really oriented

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.380
towards risk during this time — it's
better to ask, 'How do I provide

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.670
opportunities for healthy risks?'" Like
trying out for the school play, even if

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.060
you've never acted before. Or asking
someone out on a date.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.390
Those are real risks to a teenager, but
they're not the kind of risks that

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.140
parents typically worry about. "It makes
sense from an evolutionary perspective

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.220
that there's a time in life when teens
want to become more independent,

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.080
seek out new opportunities. In the animal
world, this would translate into looking

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.520
for new food resources or foraging
behavior and in teenagers it often

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.170
manifests as risk-taking behavior and
simply moving away from a family unit."

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.950
Teenagers are gonna make mistakes, but
they've got this brain that's

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.420
encouraging them to learn and explore
and push boundaries. "So adolescence is a

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.950
really special time and I think we don't
appreciate enough their energy and their

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.470
ability to lead and to motivate and how
excitable they find life in a way that

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.420
we maybe — maybe we don't later in life."
Our brains keep changing throughout our

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.959
lives and researchers at UC Berkeley are
learning that if you give people a

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.570
little bit of power it can have a big
effect on the brain.
