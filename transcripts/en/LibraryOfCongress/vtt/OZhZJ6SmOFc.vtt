00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:19.090
[ Silence ]

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.390
&gt;&gt; Travis Hensley:
Good afternoon.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.830
My name is Travis Hensley, and
I'm a Program Specialist here

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.060
at the John W. Kluge Center.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.270
Before we begin today's
program please take a moment

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.590
to check your cell phones
and other electronic devices,

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.080
and set them to silent.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.850
This afternoon's program is
being filmed for placement

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.150
on the Kluge Center's website,

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.200
as well as our YouTube
and iTunes channels.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.190
Today's lecture is presented by
the John W. Kluge Center here

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.880
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.490
The John W. Kluge Center
is a vibrant scholar center

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.130
on Capitol Hill that
brings together scholars

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.690
and researchers from around the
world to energize one another,

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.430
to distill wisdom from the
library's rich resources,

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.920
and to interact with
policymakers in the public.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.380
The center offers opportunities
for senior scholars

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.000
and postdoctoral fellows to
do research in the Library

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.650
of Congress collections.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.870
We also offer free public
lectures, conferences, symposia

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.500
and other programs, and
administer the Kluge Prize,

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.420
which recognizes
outstanding achievement

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.350
in the study of humanity.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.090
We will be holding the
Kluge Prize in 2018.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.200
For more information

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.320
And I invite you to sign up
for our RSS email list to learn

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.810
about future programs and
opportunities for research.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.670
Today's program is titled,
"Mapping the Landscape: Vision,

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:41.970
Memory and Place-making."

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.230
It has been presented
by Dr. Xin Wu,

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.890
who is an Associate
Professor of Art and History

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.920
at the College of
William and Mary.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.440
She specializes in the history
of the representation of nature

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.170
in East Asian art and global
contemporary environmental art

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.570
and landscape architecture.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.300
As a Kluge fellow for the last
year Professor Wu has leveraged

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.460
the library's collections to
help develop a book manuscript

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.040
on vision and place-making

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.190
in the neo-Confucianism
academies of Song, China.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.510
Please join me in
welcoming Professor Wu.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:21.380
[ Applause ]

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.950
&gt;&gt; Dr. Xin Conan-Wu: Thank
you for the introduction.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.540
And good afternoon, everyone.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.510
Thank you for coming
and for your support.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.710
I'm very honored to be part of
the time-honored lecture series

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.000
of Kluge scholar lecturers.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.400
Last year I was very
fortunate to be able

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.140
to spend a whole year
very productive here

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.870
as the Kluge fellow
while I was able to work

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.970
on my book manuscript
on Song Academy,

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.390
but also discovered
new materials

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.790
for many future projects.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.850
So this progress would not
be possible without many

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.860
of the support from here in
the center, and in the library,

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.330
especially the interdisciplinary
environment of the center

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.320
and the research
sources at the library.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.490
I'm indebted to many people.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.280
And many are here.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.620
And I'm sorry I wouldn't be
able to mention all the names,

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.610
especially, you know, from
Asian Division, Geography

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.930
and Map Division and [inaudible]
and Special Collections.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:48.430
At the Kluge Center I thank
especially Mary Rurick [phonetic

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.590
spelling] and Travis
Hensley for constant support

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.690
and encouragement,
which you really need

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.960
in a long fellowship,
and also Chet Van Duzer,

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.560
devoted historian of cartography

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.830
and [inaudible] fellow
in residence.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.950
He deserves special
acknowledgement

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.170
for calling my attention to the
Library of Congress collection

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:26.390
of rare Chinese historical
maps, and for inspiring many

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:32.240
of the questions I set
out to discuss right now.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.240
As the Art Historian and the
trend architecture engaged

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.820
with historical maps
the materiality

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.680
of the artifact is
central to my concern.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.720
I shall take the
art media employed

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.660
in traditional Chinese
maps as the departure point

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.510
of my inquiry, and proceed
to discuss three types

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.620
of related spaces
it [inaudible],

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.620
that is the cartographic
space, the pictorial space

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.970
and the physical space.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:17.290
My focus here will be on mapping
as the action of positioning.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.940
That is a process in
practice, rather than on maps

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.020
as the result of that process.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.820
We are familiar with maps
created on the flat surface

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.630
of two-dimensional media,
such as paper or parchment,

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:48.360
and presented in various
formats, such as sheets,

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.850
books, albums, scrolls.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:56.350
However, these media are
not to be taken for granted

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.750
as the only ones
for making maps.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:05.010
Stela is in the Chinese
cartographic tradition typical

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.900
of a quite different medium
in three-dimensional form,

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:16.040
just like groves in the
Western cartographic tradition.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.310
We have many groves
in our collection

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.760
in Geography and Maps.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:28.670
But we don't have actually
a stele in the collection.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:34.380
Steles are an important media
that carries symbolic meaning.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:40.330
Major steles often stand over
20-meters high being decorated

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.280
at the bottom, at the base,

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.210
decorated with two
sons of dragon.

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:47.810
The one on top is the
literary [inaudible]

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.650
in the form of a dragon.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.320
That's the picture up right.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.640
At the bottom is the son of the,
on the base is the [inaudible]

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:59.030
who is in the form of a
turtle carrying the stele.

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.880
Legend has it that
[inaudible] the turtle was a

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.740
flood-causing monster.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.630
It was tamed by the mythical
King Yu [phonetic spelling]

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:12.100
who led the people
through the deluge.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.820
In an action named [inaudible]
King Yu forcefully put the

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:21.740
monster under control by
suppressing it with the stele.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:26.010
The stele was engraved with
records of his accomplishment

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:31.500
at flood control that
guaranteed internal protection

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.040
to the land of China.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.500
Thus launched the
Chinese civilization.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.730
For millennia steles
bearing inscriptions

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:42.270
and images were erected
in the landscape

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:50.010
and in important locations,
such as palaces and tombs,

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:54.400
fulfill the dual function of
commemoration and of good deeds,

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.830
and suppressing evil spirits.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:01.900
Following the unification
of China in 211 BCE,

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.120
the first emperor, for instance,

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.530
is erected the seventh stele
doing his inspection tour

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:12.310
throughout the empire to
commemorate his triumph,

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.140
and to mark the territory.

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:18.010
The first of these steles
was erected immediately

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:22.730
after the unification in
210 BCE in [inaudible]

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.030
to worship the mythical king,

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:27.850
precisely the person
we just mentioned,

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:31.990
who like the first emperor
and before him was believed

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:37.670
to have inspected all the
land of China doing the survey

00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:41.370
of mountain and water in
the order of flood control.

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:49.710
All seven steles were placed
on the top of major mountains

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:54.670
after ritual worship
addressed to heaven and earth

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:58.490
that officially guaranteed the
divine power of the emperor.

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:04.350
They do not only mark the
boundaries of the new empire,

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:09.170
but also to indicate
the first emperor's rule

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:16.060
over the vast territory
from the Great War

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:19.750
to the South China Sea.

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:25.220
A stele has constituted a
very important cultural media

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:30.160
throughout Chinese history.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:36.270
The Han Dynasty scholars
collected

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:51.200
and rectified the classics
of Confucius teachings,

00:09:51.200 --> 00:10:09.050
which the first emperor
tried to destroy.

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:13.230
So they had them
carved on steles

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:17.440
in a standard calligraphic
script,

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.710
and displayed in the cities.

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:23.130
That was the famous
[inaudible] stone classics.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:29.300
Record has it it
has 40 plus steles,

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:34.320
holds over 200,000
characters, and people come,

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.860
thousands of them, to view
and read and make rubbings.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:43.370
It is erected in the
center of the capital city.

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:45.930
Following this president
and starting

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:55.130
in the 6th century CE
many Buddhist Sutras

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:59.290
and images were carved on
stele, and placed in mountains

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:04.210
around major temples
transforming nature landscape

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:06.430
into religious settings.

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:12.020
From the Sung Dynasty onwards
steles were used as records

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:17.250
for classic studies,
and presented

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:20.220
in government and
private schools.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:27.730
Classics and canonical
texts were inscribed

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:32.850
on the stone tablets as
we see on the image here,

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:41.310
and placed in the gardens, and
throughout the academy compound.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:49.430
By the 3rd century the
image scholars reading stele

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:55.240
to visit antiquity had become
a popular theme in literature,

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.780
and paintings soon
followed suit.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:02.470
The Sung Dynasty painting
reading the stele [inaudible]

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:09.140
stone depict a scholar and
his boy, his attendant boy,

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:17.590
in front of a towering stele
looking upward in admiration.

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:23.880
All the [inaudible] trees in a
wintry landscape are testimony

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:28.310
to a Chinese sense of history
as the ceaseless dialogue

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:31.780
between the past
and the present.

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.400
The presence of the stele

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:41.080
and the timeless message it
carries transport this scholar

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.660
into historical time and space.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:48.420
[inaudible] the agency at
work does not only derive

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:53.010
from the message engraved
on the stone surface,

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:57.090
but also from the
stele's physical existence

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:02.880
in the landscape as a monumental
and historical symbol.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:07.840
One cannot separate the
message from the media,

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.620
and the media from its location.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:14.150
Thus the physical
existence of a stele

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:18.230
in a place establishes
a reference point

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:21.790
for reading its content.

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:26.070
And in reciprocal fashion
inscriptions and images

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:31.610
on steles bestows in symbolic
meaning to places brought

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:35.530
to viewers' attention
by their presence.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:44.350
This map we have a rubbing of
it in the library's collection.

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:47.180
Stele was the commonly
used media

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:49.970
in the Chinese cartographical
tradition.

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:53.650
This map of the ancient
city [inaudible]

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:59.060
in South Song China Dynasty
is the world's oldest engraved

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:00.360
city map.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:04.630
The stele was engraved in 1229.

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:07.420
It was erected in
the Confucius temple

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:11.200
of [inaudible] prefecture
modern-day [inaudible]

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.550
in Jiangsu province.

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:20.260
The original stone has now been
removed from its original site,

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.010
and housed in the Museum

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:24.230
of Engraved Stone
Tablets in [inaudible].

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:33.390
The Library of Congress owns
a rare version actually.

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:37.120
It's a rare stone rubbing
of this stele dated

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.880
to the end of the 19th century.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.440
That is the time of
the rubbing was made.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:47.910
It was between 1858 to 1869.

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:56.410
It was a gift from the American
Presbyterian Missionary William

00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:00.070
Gamble in 1938.

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:01.910
And it is one of the earliest

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:06.130
and the largest stone
rubbing maps in China.

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:14.920
This line drawing based on the
stele gives us a clearer view

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:19.870
of the relief on this 13th
century engraved stone.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.400
The map is remarkable.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:27.680
It detailed containing the city
wall, the governor's quarters,

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:33.360
buildings and gardens, and the
dense network of roads, rivers,

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:37.830
canals, over 250
temples and hosts,

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:43.220
and 65 gateways,
and 359 bridges.

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.760
North is on top.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:52.680
And the chain of mountains is
depicted west of the city wall.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:56.520
In the close-up view to the
right of the screen the network

00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:00.150
of streets, canals and
the rivers is projected

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:05.250
as a typical plan view, while
the city wall, architecture,

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:09.660
mountains are presented in a
pictorial rendering as seen

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.420
from an elevated viewpoint,

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:16.390
exactly as in traditional
Chinese landscape paintings.

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:21.490
This I shall identify
as a juxtaposition

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:25.820
of cartographic and
pictorial space.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:37.220
The engraved map measuring 9.5
feet to five feet is larger

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:43.380
than most maps created on a
single sheet of parchment.

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:52.100
The stele standing at nearly
9.5 feet tall and 5.5 feet wide,

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:58.960
and one foot thick, commands
an impressive presence

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.880
than a two-dimensional map.

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.630
This map as a monumental project

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:09.640
of object may remind
contemporary museum goers

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:14.980
of the time-honored literati
tradition of reading stele

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:18.360
to visit the ancient sites.

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.040
Imagine that the stele was still

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:26.480
in its original outdoor
setting, then what is a map?

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:30.380
Is it the image carved
on the stone surface?

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:34.730
Or is it the stele
bearing that image?

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:40.100
By focusing on the media here
the stele the question arises

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:45.310
about the relationship between
cartographic representation

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:49.160
of space and the physical
presence in space.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:54.260
In this case we are
presented with condensation

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:59.270
of cartography and
physical space.

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:01.580
As shown in the painting
the stele

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:08.090
as the object provides a
connection to a longer history,

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:14.780
and the large space that
established the coordinates

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:18.450
for decoding the
content of a map.

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:23.710
Then changes of a stele's
physical location will alter our

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:26.930
understanding of the map.

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:32.800
This brief detour through
the media of stele as a media

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:36.780
of the map then draws our
attention to different types

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:43.020
of spaces that Chinese
cartography engaged with.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:47.740
While it will be helpless to
try to define what is a map,

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:52.040
I have just highlighted
the three types of spaces

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.460
that are relevant to
my studies of mapping

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:58.810
as the action of positioning.

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:07.020
The cartographic space defined
by a plan and its coordinates

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:11.540
that provides the manifesting
meaning of this work.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:15.790
The pictorial space
presenting a conic view

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:19.610
that triggers visual
images of place.

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:23.590
And then finally the
physical space on the ground

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:28.530
where a map stands, and
partially represents.

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:32.610
Next I shall proceed to
discuss the interrelationship

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:36.810
between these different types
of space, and their impact

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:38.840
on mapping the landscape.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:42.210
The materials I use
are mostly visual.

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:44.900
Due to the time constraint
I shall not be able

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:50.180
to discuss the [inaudible],
which is an indispensable branch

00:19:50.180 --> 00:20:00.040
of Chinese cartography tradition
that emphasized textual records.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:08.990
Let's start with two [inaudible]
actually explore the question

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:12.690
around the two oldest
[inaudible] maps in China.

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:18.640
They are presently in the
Forest of Stone Steles in one

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:24.320
of the most impressive
museums in modern city Xi'an.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:28.320
That is in the site of the
ancient capital Chang'an.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:33.050
And the two maps were
engraved on the two sides

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:39.100
of the same stele during
the Sung Dynasty in 1136

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:43.950
at the government School of
Jizhou near the ancient capital

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:46.780
of Chang'an in the
Yellow River Tributary.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:52.860
They were first studied and then
published in the western world

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:58.800
by French sinologist
Edward Siobhan in 1903,

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:03.250
and then later praised by the
British scholar Joseph Needham

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:08.920
as the most outstanding maps
of their time in his Science

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.970
and Civilization in China.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:21.320
On one side of the stone we can
see Huayi tu the Map of Chinese

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:27.150
and Barbarians, or the Map
of Chinese and Foreigners.

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:30.890
It was based on the Map
of Chinese and Barbarians

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:37.090
within the sea completed by Tang
Dynasty cartographer Jat Jatin

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:39.210
[assumed spelling] in 801.

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:41.520
The cardinal directions
are marked

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:44.770
on four sides with north on top.

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:49.170
The map details the
mountains, rivers and the cities

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:54.180
of the empire, and indicates
not its northern border

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:57.060
by highlighting the
location of the Great War.

00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:00.830
Actually this was the first
time the Great War was presented

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:03.350
at that time that we know.

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:05.210
Territories of neighboring
states

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:08.770
and nomadic groups were
not shown graphically,

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:15.440
but listed in texts arranged
accordingly around the map.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.640
To a certain extent this
map may be equivalent

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:24.160
to a continental map serving
as a tool for the Sung court

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:28.640
to keep track of its
[inaudible] states and enemies.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:35.890
Records has it that the same
map was painted in gold lacquer

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:38.060
on a screen behind the throne

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:39.890
of the seventh [inaudible]
Emperor [inaudible].

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:49.360
On the other side of
the stone is Yuju tu,

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:52.090
the Map of the Tracks
of King Yu.

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:56.020
That's the king we have
mentioned at the very beginning.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.700
It is also called
the Map of the Lands

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:04.020
where the sage emperor
left his traces

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:07.660
from his survey for
flood control.

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:11.460
Historians of Chinese
cartography agreed

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:17.250
that the original maps made
use of for the engraving

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:25.900
on the stele were made much
earlier, probably before 1100.

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.690
Over 500 hidden Asian

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:32.630
and contemporary place names
are plotted on the map,

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:37.510
which represents a panorama
of China in Sung times.

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:44.130
The engraving of the hydrologic
system is especially detailed

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:49.840
with nearly 880 rivers and
over 70 mountains named.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:53.270
Representations of
the Yellow River

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:57.210
and the Yangtze River
courses are very close

00:23:57.210 --> 00:24:01.150
to their appearance
on present-day maps.

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:05.380
That is to say it's
rather accurate.

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:09.920
The contour of the sea coast
is also quite accurate.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:15.240
Among surviving maps engraved
in stone this map is oldest

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:21.090
and the earliest to have
grade marks indicating scale.

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:26.090
It is the primary example
of the level of map making

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:30.740
in China during the
12th century at least.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:36.250
Its title makes reference to the
mythical King Yu's inspection

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:39.770
of the ancient land of China.

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:45.220
The map offers a presentation of
mountains and the rivers listed

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:47.670
in ancient records of the track

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:51.880
of the king during his
flood-control survey,

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:55.980
which assumably covered
the whole land of China.

00:24:55.980 --> 00:25:01.050
In this way the myth of
King Yu does give rise

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:03.980
to a Chinese cartographic
tradition

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:09.930
that refers place locations
to mountains and the river,

00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:12.490
the water features on the land,

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:19.090
and stresses the functional
importance of water management.

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:24.360
Our early discussion has
underscored the importance

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:28.740
of a stele's existence
in physical location,

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:33.850
in physical space, and its
impact on our understanding

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:38.860
of the meaning of its content.

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:43.830
The engraving of two maps,
one continental, one national,

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:49.290
on each side of the stele
implies that the location

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:54.070
where it stood marked
both the divide of China

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:58.260
and its neighbors,
Barbarian, and the heartland

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:00.980
of the central kingdom.

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:02.370
But why so?

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:09.770
And how? And was the
stele intended to function

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:11.820
as we mentioned earlier?

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:16.140
That is to commemorate
the last empire

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:21.210
or to suppress its
aggressive enemies.

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:25.030
Before answering
those questions,

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:30.580
let's turn to a correlated
mapping event.

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:35.870
Six years later one of the two
maps, the Map of the Tracks

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:41.090
of King Yu, that is the
national map, was reproduced

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:45.680
in a different place in 1142.

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:50.010
This new stele was
engraved, and they erected

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:53.080
in the government
school in the city

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.480
of Zhenjiang along
the Yangtze River.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:05.110
When we confront with
two identical map steles

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:08.550
in two very distant
places, let's engage

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:13.290
in a more detailed
reading for the sake

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:16.400
of comparison between the two.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:21.060
They are almost identical,
disappointing,

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:27.130
with two noticeable differences.

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:33.090
First, the legend of the
1142 map, that is the one

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:39.280
to my right, yes, also to
your right, clearly indicates

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:43.250
that it was made after the
early engraving of [inaudible],

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:46.280
and that is the map to the left.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:50.340
Secondly, the sea was
[inaudible] in wave pattern

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:54.870
on the 1142 map, and
not in the early map,

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:59.940
and left a blank in
the 1136 version.

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:04.560
The cartographer of the
original map remains unknown.

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:08.070
There is a fair amount
of debate going around.

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:15.090
It is attributed to the polymap
and the scientist Shen Kuo,

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:17.640
who had been a governor
near Chun,

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.640
and that's where the
first map was carved,

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:24.250
and then later retired to
his hometown Zhenjiang,

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:29.060
that's where the second map,
second stele was carved,

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:33.820
where he compiled the famous
Brush Talks from the Dream Book.

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:42.430
A look at a map made
by Shen Kuo.

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:46.930
A similar presentation
of the sea

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:51.870
on this map might
support this attribution

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:54.450
of possible authorship.

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:57.320
The map of the prefecture
and the counties

00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:03.520
of the nine districts is the
early extent map on stele.

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:11.550
It was engraved in 1121
at the prefecture school.

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:16.870
It was excavated in
1936 in the [inaudible]

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:18.320
for cultural revolution.

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:22.810
It is now housed in the
Museum of Sichuan Province.

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:28.700
Besides its remarkable accuracy
the map boasts a uniquely

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:34.630
elaborated pictorial depiction
of the sea that is incomparable

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:38.230
to any other known
maps of medieval China.

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:43.030
Unfortunately, the library
does not have a copy

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:47.610
of a rubbing of this map.

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:54.140
The presentation of the sea
includes ships, dragons,

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:59.710
horses and fishes, all
sorts of celestial beings.

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:06.380
It is worth mentioning that
Shen Kuo also of this map

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:11.880
in his book The Brush
Talks from the Dream Book.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:16.420
It's an encyclopedical
anthropology

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:20.990
of [inaudible] covering not only
science, but also humanities,

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:25.740
and that he is in the history
of art he's art attending,

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:27.380
he was the one who coined

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:30.630
at the time-honored the
landscape painting theme Eight

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:33.110
Views of Xiaoxian.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.020
Now let's move back, return

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:42.630
to the two steles bearing
the Map of Tracks of King Yu.

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:48.470
The fact that the media of the
map was not a portable sheet

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:54.170
of paper that we can carry
around, but a heavy stele fixed

00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:57.600
to the ground backs
further scrutiny

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:05.030
of the intention behind the
engraving and re-graving,

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:09.390
and the relocation
of this stele map.

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:15.280
By a paradoxical twist the
location of the original stele,

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:20.850
the former capital city of
Chang'an, also actually outside

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:25.790
of the Chinese border,
in the year of 1136

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:28.490
when the first stone
was engraved.

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:35.720
In 1127 China was defeated
by the invading [inaudible].

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.790
And the last is capital
city [inaudible].

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:45.480
Emperor [inaudible] and his
successor [inaudible] together

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:51.130
with over 3,000 members of
the court were captured.

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:55.290
The remaining of the Sung
court fled to the south.

00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:57.390
And then reestablished
itself in [inaudible]

00:31:57.390 --> 00:32:00.130
and modern-day Hangzhou.

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:05.990
This movement of the Sung court
marked the end of Northern Sung,

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:08.640
and the beginning
of Southern Sung.

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:17.100
The two maps to the left shows
the location of the border

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:23.130
of Southern Sung
and Northern Sung,

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:28.170
especially when in Southern Sung
[inaudible] we can see the size

00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:32.660
of China almost shrank to half.

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:36.610
Management of a vast
former Chinese territory

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:42.160
with its far more advanced
agriculture and economy,

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:46.200
however, was beyond the
ability of a nomadic invader.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:49.980
And there is a solution.

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:53.050
A [inaudible] called
[inaudible] ruled

00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:56.860
by a former Chinese
official was established

00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:02.220
between 1130 and 1137.

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:07.030
Precisely in that period
is the stele carved.

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:12.450
The original stele, therefore,
was engraved at a special moment

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:16.820
at history in between
the territory of China

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:19.100
and its Barbarian invader

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:23.730
under a [inaudible] government
established by the occupier,

00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:27.800
but run by a Chinese
official in order

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:31.380
to rule a Chinese populace.

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:35.520
Although we cannot be sure of
the rationale behind the making

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:39.820
of the origin stele the
fact that it was located

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:43.260
at the ancient capital
of Chang'an instead

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:48.560
of the [inaudible] Northern Sung
capital may indicate a denial

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:52.400
of the defeat and nostalgia

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:57.470
for the expensive powerful
Chinese empire during the Han

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:59.980
and the Tang dynasties.

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:04.510
Given a stele's dual function
in commemorating good deeds

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:10.870
and suppressing evil, it may
also have embodied a claim

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:14.250
for legitimacy as
a Chinese emperor

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:17.550
by the ill-fated
[inaudible] ruler.

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:20.010
On the other hand, the action

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:26.510
of re-engraving a stele
bearing the same map,

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:31.140
and thus relocate
the map to Zhenjiang

00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:36.860
in the south repositioned
the map of King Yu back

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:42.040
in the only legitimate
Chinese territory at the time.

00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:45.330
Back to the Sung time.

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:49.360
The remaking and the relocation
of the stele from Chang'an

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:54.010
to Zhenjiang, as here we can
see, highlighted the shift

00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:59.190
of the center of China from
the Yellow River region

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:01.160
to the Yangtze River.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:06.430
Examination of the structure of
the land of China shows a divide

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:12.170
of north and the south along the
tributaries of the two rivers,

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:16.410
while the Great Canal,
that is the purple line,

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:19.650
provides a south/north
connection

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:22.800
between the two river systems.

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:27.550
When the north was lost the city
of Zhenjiang at the intersection

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:31.610
of [inaudible] and the
canal was at the heart

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:35.320
of a newly established
[inaudible] territory,

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:40.840
mainly expanding over the
tributary of the [inaudible].

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:44.100
The erection of a stele
here bearing the full map

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:48.690
of King Yu's track therefore
asserts the court's control

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:52.950
of China in its putative
[inaudible],

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:58.230
no matter how elusive
that vision might be.

00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:05.900
The map was overly mistaken,
but political, not political,

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:11.080
yet the location of the stele
implies a political statement

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.380
of possession.

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:17.950
To underline the complexity
of such a map on stele

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:25.130
as a meaning making monument,
this stele derived a part

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:28.920
of its agency from its location.

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:35.330
And in return bestows a
symbolic value to the region

00:36:35.330 --> 00:36:38.830
where it stood as
the [inaudible] work

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:41.930
against potential invaders.

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:47.600
This is only one example of the
recursive relationship implied

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:53.980
by a map on a stele that
allows its physical location

00:36:53.980 --> 00:37:02.960
to inform the manifest
meaning of the map enduring it

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:08.210
with symbolic agency, which
in turn casts the whole site

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:09.880
in your light.

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:14.630
It is mapping as an
action of positioning.

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:20.530
Now let's turn to the
site of Zhenjiang.

00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:23.550
As mentioned earlier,
the presence of a stele

00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:27.020
in the landscape under the
timeless message it carries

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:32.160
transported a scholar into
a historical time and space.

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:37.260
Since the manifest content
of a map is a representation

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:42.890
of place the changing
significance of a place

00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:47.210
through history in turn
can be reflected by changes

00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:51.250
in the map's pictorial space.

00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:55.370
To illustrate this point we
shall zoom in on the site

00:37:55.370 --> 00:38:00.670
of Zhenjiang, and quickly
survey some changes in its fate,

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:04.210
and in the mapping
of its landscape.

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:09.120
Zhenjiang sits along the
Yangtze River at the crossing

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:12.820
between the river
and the Great Canal.

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:17.450
Its name literally
means securing

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:20.580
or surprising the
[inaudible] precisely.

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:26.660
It's the word I mentioned when
the mythical king was trying

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:30.110
to control the turtle.

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:33.780
The character [inaudible]
to suppress refers

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:38.270
to the action King Yu performed
to surprise [inaudible],

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:41.730
the turtle dragon, with a stele.

00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:45.870
Here the subject of
suppression was flooding

00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:48.000
by the Yangtze River.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.570
Militarily the character
[inaudible] also means securing

00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:54.290
and defending.

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:58.730
At the hot end of the 6th
century the city was made

00:38:58.730 --> 00:39:02.180
into an important garrison
on the lower Yangtze River,

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:05.450
and will soon become
a commentary site.

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:08.420
And its importance grows
with the construction

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:12.800
of the Grand Canal
in the 7th century.

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:18.590
From the 8th century BCE
onwards Zhenjiang was the seat

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:23.900
of a future domain
under various names.

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:28.560
Legend has it that the
site's Feng Shui was so great

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:34.680
that the first emperor had
to order 3,000 prisoners

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:38.640
to dig a tunnel through
one of its hills in order

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:44.240
to dissipate its
spiritual energy.

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:50.470
During Northern Sung when
China was under constant threat

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:52.950
of Zhenjiang invasion
from the north,

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:58.150
the Yangtze River became an
important natural burial.

00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:01.670
And the city of Zhenjiang at
the cross section of the river

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:06.080
under the canal gained further
attention from the throne.

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:11.230
The prefecture of Zhenjiang
was established in 1113.

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:13.450
That is 1, 1, 1, 3.

00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:18.220
By [inaudible] the last
emperor of Northern Sung,

00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:21.290
who resigned there
before he was enthroned,

00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:26.770
and who was interested
in southern landscapes.

00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:31.440
Politically [inaudible] was
remembered as a terrible king

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:35.160
who lost his whole empire.

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:40.810
But culturally he was remembered
as an accomplished artist

00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:44.090
and an exceptional
patron for the arts.

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:48.390
The year of 1113 that gave rise

00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:54.080
to [inaudible] prefecture also
saw the birth of a masterpiece

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:55.920
in Chinese painting history.

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.300
That's what we see
on the screen.

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:02.690
This spectacular blue-green
landscape [inaudible] of river

00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:08.140
and mountains was completed
by a student of [inaudible]

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:12.230
in the [inaudible] Painting
Academy, although the title

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:17.500
of this 36-foot-long scroll
does not contain the name

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:19.910
of [inaudible], it
is often considered

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:22.280
to be the first attempt

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:26.570
in presenting the long
river in a holistic manner.

00:41:26.570 --> 00:41:30.160
To order such a major
work the emperor reigning

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:33.690
in the north clearly
paid particular attention

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:35.940
to the [inaudible] in the south.

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:39.220
The scroll closes
with the mountain.

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:42.790
We are seeing the end
section of the scroll.

00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:44.320
It closes with a mountain

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:49.260
on the shoreline overlooking
all the water implied the mouth

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:50.560
of the river.

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:52.490
It calls our attention
to changes

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:54.450
in Chinese visual culture.

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:59.760
And to the use of an imperial
style tradition the blue

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:04.510
and the green landscape painting
originated in Tang Dynasty.

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:08.110
[ Silence ]

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:15.170
The early surviving [inaudible]
prefecture was compiled in 1213.

00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:18.910
That that is 100 years
later than the painting,

00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:22.200
and the establishment
of the prefecture.

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:26.680
Following the Northern Sung's
defeat by the [inaudible]

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:29.320
and the establishment
of the Southern Sung,

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:32.030
the Yangtze River
replaced the Yellow River

00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:35.380
as a natural barrier
between Imperial China

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:37.890
and its Barbarian invaders.

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:41.940
The importance of Zhenjiang as
the military defense position

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:46.000
and a cultural historical
site increased further,

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.620
which led to the compilation
of the multiple [inaudible].

00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:53.200
When the north and the
south were rejoined

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:57.130
under the Mongol Court,
after the collapse

00:42:57.130 --> 00:43:00.840
of Southern Sung Zhenjiang
remained significant

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:03.670
as the crossroad of two

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:08.240
of China's key water
traffic systems, the Yangtze

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.980
and the Grand Canal,

00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:17.220
which explains why it is
mentioned by Marco Polo.

00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:21.400
And Marco Polo's description
of China under the Great Han

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:26.460
in his book of The Marvels
of the World has led

00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:30.120
to imaginary depiction
of Chinese cities

00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:35.260
in several early
modern European maps.

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:45.770
[inaudible] map of 1455, for
example, Zhenjiang was depicted

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:50.900
in the fashion of a medieval
city so as other Chinese cities.

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:54.290
And the blue course
showing is [inaudible].

00:43:54.290 --> 00:44:00.090
Another name of Zhenjiang
is [inaudible].

00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:02.780
The term [inaudible] refers

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:08.490
to a challenging path
guided by high mountains.

00:44:08.490 --> 00:44:12.180
In reality the three
mountains [inaudible]

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:18.780
and [inaudible] are
actually not very high.

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:23.090
Although they are now
surrounded by marshes as seen

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:27.900
in this satellite photograph,
two of the mountains [inaudible]

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:32.330
and [inaudible] islands in
mainstream and [inaudible],

00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:36.590
which earned them the
name Floating Jade.

00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:41.690
Alongside growing attention
for the Yangtze River the loss

00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:46.550
of the north and the military
defeat spurred the development

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:50.640
of historical geography

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:53.800
and local history during
the [inaudible] Imperial.

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:57.730
Zhenjiang was presented in
an important prefecture seat

00:44:57.730 --> 00:45:03.840
in two major works of
imperial geography combined

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:07.500
in the beginning of
the 13th century.

00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:10.810
Almost [inaudible]
with the compilation

00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:18.740
of this geography books a long
scroll entitled 10,000 Li Along

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:24.570
Yangtze River is created in
early Southern Sung period.

00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:29.000
The 55-foot-long scroll
shows a bird's-eye view

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.410
of the Yangtze River from
its traditional source

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:36.080
in the mountains all
the way to the sea.

00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:41.210
You can see on the screen the
scrolls ending section, again,

00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:45.530
which shows how the Lower
Yangtze all the way enters

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:46.830
the sea.

00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:48.670
Following the same convention

00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:52.870
as the imperial vision the
landscape view is oriented

00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:54.540
towards the south.

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:57.350
That is the river actually,

00:45:57.350 --> 00:46:01.110
and to the left side
of the painting.

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:06.350
In reality the river
floats east.

00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:16.910
Let's turn to a close-up
view of the one small section

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:19.920
which reveals the detailed
depiction of the city

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:26.150
of Zhenjiang standing where the
Grand Canal crosses Yangtze.

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:29.400
It's really difficult to see
at the bottom of the screen

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:36.020
that was just a little bit on
the original scroll barges come

00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:39.940
from the city of
Yangzhou on the north part

00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:45.490
of the Grand Canal would pass
the canal along Watermelon

00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:51.970
Island where the canal goes
around, and across the current

00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:57.280
and and enters the south
section of the canal

00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:00.310
in the [inaudible]
Zhenjiang, sail all the way

00:47:00.310 --> 00:47:06.160
down to the capital in
the south, Hangzhou city.

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:15.290
If we compare the two paintings,
what we can see is the location

00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:20.150
of Zhenjiang in this location.

00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:24.750
It's rather close to the
end of the painting already,

00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:31.030
which indicates that at the
time it seems educated people,

00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:33.650
highly cultivated people

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:37.760
who produced those
paintings does not know much

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:41.300
about the Yangtze further
down from Zhenjiang,

00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:43.290
the point of Zhenjiang.

00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:48.420
And when we check the travel
records or in literature,

00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:51.120
we found support
to that argument.

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:55.980
Two of the major records
showing the travels all the way

00:47:55.980 --> 00:48:00.510
down from Hangzhou, one
upstream and one downstream,

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:06.290
both indicates that they take a
break in the point of crossing.

00:48:06.290 --> 00:48:14.750
And then it turns into the canal
system from the main Yangtze.

00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:19.000
That is to say at
the time the travel

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:27.920
on Yangtze River will
be ended in the spot

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:31.460
when the boats can turn
into the canal system,

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:38.140
instead of going all
the way down to the sea.

00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:42.860
Also on this painting we can see

00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:51.400
that in the picture below
is showing the two islands.

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:55.370
And those are the two
islands in front of Zhenjiang.

00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:57.770
The idea of Floating Jade

00:48:57.770 --> 00:49:03.650
on the Big River has
become a pending theme

00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:08.510
in the Northern Sung
period, as here we see.

00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:16.040
[ Silence ]

00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:18.240
On the other records we have

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:22.650
in the Asian Division an
illustrator [inaudible]

00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:28.380
of [inaudible] prefecture
actually shows the

00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:29.720
same mountain.

00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:32.730
The Yangtze River and
the Grand Canal goes

00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:36.440
into the northern section.

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:39.930
The same mountain
would be depicted

00:49:39.930 --> 00:49:42.330
in very different medias.

00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:46.930
And it's easy to recognize,
because there is this pagoda.

00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:57.850
Later on in Ming Dynasty in 1512
the three mountains starting

00:49:57.850 --> 00:50:03.090
to be presented as a whole,
as an iconic landscape,

00:50:03.090 --> 00:50:09.100
and the [inaudible] were
produced in their name.

00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:13.070
Two maps in a private
collection, the collection

00:50:13.070 --> 00:50:17.640
by Wellesley Brown, shows very
interestingly two different

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:21.810
views of the three
mountains as a group.

00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:28.650
The map, titled Floating Jade
of the Zhenjiang Prefecture,

00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:33.760
shows the three mountains
in the shape of a tripod.

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:40.210
As the [inaudible] of
the Three Mountains

00:50:40.210 --> 00:50:44.050
of Jingkou shows the
three mountains also

00:50:44.050 --> 00:50:46.360
in the same format.

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:53.940
And on top of it we will see
details of these cultural sites

00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:56.020
on each of the mountains.

00:50:56.020 --> 00:51:03.550
At the far end of the map that
is [inaudible] prefecture.

00:51:03.550 --> 00:51:06.830
on the north shore
of [inaudible].

00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:13.850
The two maps give us
very different views

00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:18.320
of the group of three mountains.

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:21.830
By this time in the Ming
Dynasty it's already become an

00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:24.130
iconic landscape.

00:51:25.830 --> 00:51:30.710
If the choice of viewing
perspective a precise cardinal

00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:36.070
position as a horizontal
pictorial presentation could

00:51:36.070 --> 00:51:40.120
carry symbolic meanings
in a sense like a stele.

00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:46.230
Even through the symbolism it
would be entirely different.

00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:50.160
One media could not
substitute the other.

00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:54.030
The map in painting
of the 10,000 Li

00:51:54.030 --> 00:51:57.920
of [inaudible] recorded an
expansive version of the land,

00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:00.650
as intended for the
emperor's gaze,

00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:03.600
since the throne was
always facing south,

00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:07.410
the painting would look
towards the south as if it were

00:52:07.410 --> 00:52:09.430
under the emperor's gaze.

00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:13.300
Yet at the time of its
painting in South Sung

00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:18.420
when the court was actually
located in the south,

00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:22.380
and then looking towards
the north to [inaudible].

00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:27.780
Interestingly [inaudible] map
did not follow the cartographic

00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:34.280
convention of the time to put
either the east or the north

00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:39.460
on top, similar to the
imperial vision in Chinese.

00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:42.540
Instead he uses south
on top similar

00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:46.820
to the imperial vision
in a Chinese scroll.

00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:49.220
A strange coincidence

00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:54.030
that [inaudible] himself
already tried to explain.

00:52:54.030 --> 00:52:58.490
I do not want to
give the impression

00:52:58.490 --> 00:53:04.300
that there is a linear
development for the presentation

00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:05.920
in the Chinese tradition,

00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:10.520
or that different methods
actually are used together.

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:13.530
Here we see, what do we
see, it's the [inaudible]

00:53:13.530 --> 00:53:19.320
of the canal showing
precisely in the cross spot

00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:24.430
between the Yangtze
and the canal.

00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:29.080
The text accompanying the
map it no longer exists.

00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:30.700
So it would be difficult

00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:34.520
to reconstruct exactly
the information.

00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:37.860
But we can see this
map is very accurate.

00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:43.470
And it probably is intended for
military use or water control.

00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:51.530
The fate of Zhenjiang changed
in the later 19th century

00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:55.700
when during the the Opium War.

00:53:55.700 --> 00:54:02.710
What we see on the screen are
maps, and by engraving made

00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:06.640
by the British troops during
the battle of Zhenjiang.

00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:08.190
The British took Zhenjiang,

00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:10.680
and they eventually
forced the Chinese emperor

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:12.350
to sign treaties.

00:54:12.350 --> 00:54:22.240
Eventually led to the opening
of Zhenjiang after the battle.

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:25.120
Zhenjiang was open to trade

00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:31.650
after the second Opium War
hoping to foreign trade in 1859.

00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:36.710
The British Consulate was
established there in 1864.

00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:42.270
The city remained a British
concession until 1927.

00:54:42.270 --> 00:54:46.800
After the Grand Canal lost its
importance to the railroads,

00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:51.350
Zhenjiang declined in
the later 19th century.

00:54:51.350 --> 00:54:54.390
While looking at after this
melancholic image I would

00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:58.190
like to wrap up the
idea presented.

00:54:58.190 --> 00:55:02.290
That is how the, oh, no, we
have observed the three very

00:55:02.290 --> 00:55:07.850
different types of
space in the map making,

00:55:07.850 --> 00:55:12.170
of the traditional Chinese
map making, which was carried

00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:16.410
by very different art
medias ranging from stele

00:55:16.410 --> 00:55:20.870
to long scroll and
the album pages.

00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:27.190
It's difficult to isolate
them from one another.

00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:31.630
And in the traditional sense
they were all juxtaposed,

00:55:31.630 --> 00:55:37.370
and used together to build
up a very rich interpretation

00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:41.590
for the place what
they're supposed to show.

00:55:41.590 --> 00:55:47.550
The major change comes after
the 19th century when many

00:55:47.550 --> 00:55:51.740
of the map making
adopted the modern method,

00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:56.930
and that the Chinese myth
making has been seen in more

00:55:56.930 --> 00:56:01.570
of a domain of cultural
practice and [inaudible] making.

00:56:01.570 --> 00:56:04.780
And that is what I say.

00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:09.940
In the traditional sense it
was much more of an action

00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:14.470
of positioning in terms
of making of the map.

00:56:14.470 --> 00:56:16.510
Okay. Thank you.

00:56:16.510 --> 00:56:25.160
[ Applause ]

00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:32.440
I guess I can take a
few questions here.

00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:34.180
Do you have the time?

00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:37.880
&gt;&gt; I did have a question.

00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:39.290
&gt;&gt; Dr. Xin Conan-Wu: Okay.

00:56:39.290 --> 00:56:46.910
&gt;&gt; It was [inaudible]
statement about the placement

00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:54.980
of the maps having an
effect on the meaning

00:56:54.980 --> 00:57:01.230
and the mass meaning
of [inaudible].

00:57:01.230 --> 00:57:06.160
And, if I understood this,--

00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:07.460
&gt;&gt; Dr. Xin Conan-Wu: Yes.

00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:15.130
&gt;&gt; And I'm wondering
how that happens

00:57:15.130 --> 00:57:18.350
to roll out into the culture?

00:57:18.350 --> 00:57:21.440
I mean does it roll out
in literature [inaudible],

00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:24.730
you know, a writer comes
into the stone art,

00:57:24.730 --> 00:57:26.030
and sees them [inaudible].

00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:27.330
And then, you know, some
new [inaudible] comes out,

00:57:27.330 --> 00:57:28.630
or something.

00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:30.110
But what your [inaudible]
speak to them.

00:57:30.110 --> 00:57:31.410
&gt;&gt; Dr. Xin Conan-Wu: Yes.

00:57:31.410 --> 00:57:33.440
Actually it's become a
very important aspect.

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:38.740
And, you know, as a continuation
of the literary tradition,

00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:42.490
especially I didn't have time
to mention in my research

00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:45.190
in the academy, okay, it's
very important for that kind

00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:46.490
of engagement with the space.

00:57:46.490 --> 00:57:48.490
As the space becomes
in a way flipped

00:57:48.490 --> 00:57:51.560
over of carrying the message
that was on the stele.

00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:54.110
And then how the
information located

00:57:54.110 --> 00:57:59.040
in a particular space will
extend into a historical time

00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:04.260
and space, and connect the
reader into the history.

00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:13.740
So the physical presence of the
map actually becomes the vehicle

00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:19.120
to drive the reader
into a larger context

00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:22.860
that makes the map important.

00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:24.160
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:25.960
&gt;&gt; Dr. Xin Conan-Wu: Yeah.

00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:30.200
[ Background Noises ]

00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:36.080
Dr. Xin Conan-Wu:
Well, if we have--

00:58:41.530 --> 00:58:45.500
&gt;&gt; Travis Hensley: You
want to [inaudible]?

00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:46.800
Did everyone [inaudible]?

00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:48.920
Is that what you want?

00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:50.220
No? Okay.

00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:52.940
&gt;&gt; Dr. Xin Conan-Wu: Thank you.

00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:55.250
&gt;&gt; Travis Hensley: Join me in
thanking Dr. Wu [inaudible].

00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:56.550
&gt;&gt; Dr. Xin Conan-Wu: Okay.

00:58:56.550 --> 00:58:57.850
