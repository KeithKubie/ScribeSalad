ANDREW MCMAHON: This
is a tune that kind of

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.880
kicked off the "Upside Down
Flowers" writing process

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.390
for me.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.875
It's a song about a trip I
took with my family crossing

00:00:15.875 --> 00:00:19.550
the country, moving from the
Midwest to the West Coast.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.146
It's called Ohio.

00:04:14.792 --> 00:04:16.280
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.760
Thank you so much.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.940
Thank you.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:21.860
This is cool.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.670
When I got this
invitation, I was like,

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.510
what would Google
want to do with me?

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.320
But I'm glad.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.492
I'm glad that you
all invited us out.

00:04:30.492 --> 00:04:31.950
I've had a good
few days in Boston.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.096
I got to play House of Blues
last night, which was a blast.

00:04:36.096 --> 00:04:36.860
What do you think?

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.530
Should we do "Fire Escape?"

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.850
It's an early--

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.610
This is rock and roll morning,
just so you guys know.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.130
So let's get the high notes
out of the way, see how we do.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.985
This is about a long weekend
in New York City, where there

00:04:56.985 --> 00:04:58.110
wasn't much sleep going on.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.485
It's called "Fire Escape."

ZAC CLARK: It's a fine
cappuccino bar you have here.

00:08:55.835 --> 00:08:56.335
I must say.

00:08:56.335 --> 00:08:59.330
ANDREW MCMAHON: Yeah, I mean, I
would be so jacked on caffeine

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:03.307
if there was a free latte
every time I turned a corner.

00:09:03.307 --> 00:09:04.890
ZAC CLARK: After my
second cappuccino,

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.420
I applied for a job.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.030
So--

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.060
--put in a good word for me.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:12.380
ANDREW MCMAHON:
Yeah, so, Bob and Zac

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.840
both have been talking
about how they're putting

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.810
in their applications today.

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:18.740
I'm not sure.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.340
At least your schooling will get
you further than the cafeteria.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:23.660
I certainly know mine wouldn't.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:24.462
I'm just kidding.

00:09:24.462 --> 00:09:26.170
Bobby went to way more
school than I did.

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:27.030
And Zac is--

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:29.030
BOBBY ANDERSON: It seems
like the happiest place

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.867
on earth, after the
cafeteria experience, too.

burrito waiting for them

This is Bobby Raw Anderson
here on the guitar,

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:40.910
Mr. Zac Clark on the keys.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:47.480
I figured we'd do
another new song.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.330
This is probably one of my
favorites off of the new album.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.420
I think doing what we do
for a living every day,

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.520
you kind of wake up and it's
a little bit of a gamble.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.103
Maybe this music business will
be here for us tomorrow or not.

00:09:58.103 --> 00:10:01.670
But I think, as I've
been very fortunate to do

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.988
this for 18 years in
three different bands,

00:10:03.988 --> 00:10:05.780
I should probably stop
asking that question

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:06.750
and just enjoy it.

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:07.958
That's what my wife tells me.

00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:11.026
So this one's
called "Paper Rain."

00:14:12.476 --> 00:14:13.220
Thank you.

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:17.210
So the last tune we'll do for
you is a song that I wrote,

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:20.210
gosh, 2014, I guess, maybe?

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:23.730
It was right before
my daughter was born.

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:26.420
I ended up in this writing
session with two guys

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.350
I'd never met before.

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:31.310
But that a of my publisher
said these guys are great.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:32.780
You should hang out.

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.990
And I had to kind of give the
caveat, when I was on my way

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:38.090
up to the session,
like, my wife is

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:40.797
within weeks of giving birth.

00:14:40.797 --> 00:14:43.130
I may end up having to leave
at some point in the middle

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:45.050
of this little session.

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:47.905
And it sort of
became the decision,

00:14:47.905 --> 00:14:49.280
when we walked
into the room, OK,

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.080
well, let's just write that.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.730
Let's write a song for
this new kid that's

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:55.020
going to come into your world.

00:14:57.375 --> 00:14:59.500
And that song changed a
lot for me, which is crazy.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.250
I've done this for a lot
of years, like I mentioned.

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:02.650
I've played in a lot of bands.

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:06.290
And I sort of wrote
this song as, like,

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:11.765
a introduction of myself
to my soon-to-be baby girl.

00:15:11.765 --> 00:15:13.640
And interestingly enough,
for a lot of people

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.490
it became the introduction to
me as an artist altogether.

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.020
Because it was
really the first song

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:21.330
I ever had that got
substantial radio play

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.300
and a lot of exposure on.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:27.440
So she's a good luck charm
for more reasons than one.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.870
And she turned five last
week, which is crazy to me.

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:35.337
But yeah, so this one is called
"Cecilia and The Satellite."

the record, they both

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:50.800
have much higher
education than I do.

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.250
SPEAKER: I'll get right to
work on your job applications.

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:54.940
Yeah.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:58.090
So I wanted to talk to you
a bit about the inspiration

00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:00.950
for your album, which has one
of the coolest album titles,

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:01.450
I think--

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:03.370
"Upside Down Flowers."

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:05.350
So I was reading on your site.

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:07.790
You said that you called it
that because, in many ways,

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:09.400
it's a mirror to my world--

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.460
an uncanny reflection, but
not quite the real thing.

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:15.190
Could you talk a little bit
more about that uncanny nature

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:16.330
of reality?

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:17.205
ANDREW MCMAHON: Yeah.

00:20:17.205 --> 00:20:19.690
You know, what's interesting
about the genesis

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:23.247
of this record was that a lot
of times you start records

00:20:23.247 --> 00:20:24.830
and you know you're
starting a record,

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:27.310
or you know you're
in the process.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:30.700
And instead, with this
album, I had this rare moment

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:36.790
where, after two full records
of touring and creating,

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:38.440
I had a few months off at home.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:41.800
Which is something that,
since I started this project,

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.220
I had not had in a while.

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:45.910
And the process began with--

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:47.945
I watched this
documentary, "Abstract."

00:20:47.945 --> 00:20:50.320
Which I don't know if you guys
have seen this on Netflix,

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.290
but it's a documentary
about just creatives

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:55.750
and the different
threads of success

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:57.160
through their creative lives.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.320
And the one thing
that struck me--

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.060
and I've always
known to be true,

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.760
but it's easy sometimes to
forget when you are an artist

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.700
who tours like we do--

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.480
that you've got to put
yourself in the position

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.040
to create every day.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.885
And when I got home and
I had this block of time,

00:21:13.885 --> 00:21:16.510
I think usually what I might do
is take a couple weeks and just

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:18.820
sort of flounder and
hang out with the family

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:20.050
and see old friends.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:21.220
And I did all that.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:22.960
But my daughter was
finally school age.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:27.280
So I started working in
the back house studio where

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:30.430
I wrote this record and
just created my own writing

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:33.100
practice based around the day.

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:36.400
And what ended up creeping
up were a combination

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.570
of these memories--

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:40.467
like the one you heard in
"Ohio," which is very much,

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:42.550
in a way, a kind of a vivid
portrayal of something

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:45.910
that happened to me when I was
a kid to a song like "Paper

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:49.270
Rain," which was, I
think, true in some senses

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:52.090
philosophically, about
this idea of living life

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:53.200
as a bit of a gamble.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.990
But it was very much
a story that kind of

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:58.300
came to me in the middle
of that writing process

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.240
and became the story
of somebody else.

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.570
But somehow, a piece
of me existed in there,

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:04.690
if that makes sense.

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:06.270
SPEAKER: Yeah, definitely.

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:10.480
I found "Ohio" very moving,
both figuratively and literally,

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:14.030
as it talks about your move
from Ohio to California.

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:17.620
And I know you referred to it
as sort of a pilgrimage for you.

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.540
So what did that mean
for you as a child,

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:22.540
moving from the Midwest out
to the land where it's always

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:24.365
sunny and warm and all that?

00:22:24.365 --> 00:22:25.240
ANDREW MCMAHON: Yeah.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.700
I mean, admittedly
my family-- we were

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:31.030
all in a bit of a tricky time.

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:33.280
Around then, I was about
11 or 12 years old.

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.010
And we had sort of gone
on the roller coaster

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:38.410
of having done
very well, and then

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:41.280
had kind of lost
everything to some extent.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.090
And we had family
on the West Coast.

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:44.530
It was, like, those were
the cousins we always went

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:45.640
to visit in the summertime.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:45.880
You know?

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.290
And that was a great summer.

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:48.670
Every summer, you're like, oh!

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:50.100
I grew up kind of
Midwest, East Coast,

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.100
where we could go to
California for the summers.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:54.850
And in a sense, it always felt
like the promised land to me,

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:55.730
you know?

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:59.150
And when we found
ourselves with so little,

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:01.150
it just made sense to go
be with my mom's family

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:01.930
on the West Coast.

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:06.010
And I think, for me, as
hard as that time was,

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:07.570
and for my family,
as hard as it was,

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:09.460
it was where we sort
of rebuilt our lives

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:11.050
and built a new
story for ourselves.

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:14.290
And for me, it was
the place where

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:16.830
I was able to really
explore my songwriting.

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:18.830
I had written for years
prior to our move there.

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:21.520
But this was the place
where I built my first band.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.480
I found those kind
of close friends

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.480
that, when you're somebody
who moves every three

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.360
years as a kid, you don't get
to make those close connections.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:32.570
And I think it did feel, and
it still does to this day,

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:34.780
it's not my native home.

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.680
But it's about as native
feeling as I know--

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.820
is the beach towns of
Southern California.

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.090
SPEAKER: So like a lot
of people, probably,

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:45.070
in the audience, my
favorite song of yours

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:47.377
is "Cecilia and The Satellite",
which you just played.

00:23:47.377 --> 00:23:49.460
And you give a little bit
of the background in it.

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.713
But it's such a
beautiful love song.

00:23:51.713 --> 00:23:53.380
But what's, I think,
so special about it

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:55.480
is we don't hear a whole
lot of rock love songs

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.960
from parents to children.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:01.910
It's usually a different kind
of romantic type of song.

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:04.090
So I was wondering if you'd
talk a little bit more

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:06.280
about the genesis
and also how does

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.478
your daughter feel about it?

00:24:07.478 --> 00:24:09.520
Do you play it for her a
lot, that sort of thing?

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.937
ANDREW MCMAHON: Any song that
references her-- my daughter

00:24:11.937 --> 00:24:12.738
is a huge fan of.

00:24:12.738 --> 00:24:15.280
I'm sure that is going to change
within the next four or five

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:15.780
years.

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:18.670
But as of now, I mean, even
on, like, even on "Paper Rain",

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:19.540
there's that lyric,
you know? (SINGING)

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:21.910
I've got mouths to feed, I'm
going to get-- (SPEAKING)

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:24.310
--but my daughter goes, that's
my mouth you have to feed.

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:25.685
You're, like,
thank you, Cecilia.

00:24:25.685 --> 00:24:26.570
Yeah, she knows.

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:32.770
She's keenly aware of where
she fits into my catalog now.

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:33.940
Yeah.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.780
For me, and I'm sure we can
touch on this at some point,

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:42.430
you know, "Cecilia" is a
product of a very tricky time

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:43.440
in my life.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.500
I'm a cancer survivor.

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:47.623
And you know, I was sort
of rendered infertile

00:24:47.623 --> 00:24:48.790
as a part of that treatment.

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:51.780
I apologize to get a little
gross here for you all.

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:53.620
But there's this
kind of joking story

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:55.150
that I've told, if you've
been to one of my shows.

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:55.930
It's not really a joke.

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:56.430
It's true.

00:24:56.430 --> 00:25:00.430
That in the process of
being a sick person,

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:03.910
finding out that you're going
to be infertile, at least,

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:06.592
for me--

00:25:06.592 --> 00:25:08.050
I was lucky to have
a doctor to say

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:09.310
you've got to bank your sperm.

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:11.470
And that's going to-- maybe
one day you'll have a family.

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:12.790
And I was, like, I don't care.

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:13.990
I was 22 at the time.

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:17.420
I was just-- that's not really
of interest to me right now.

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:19.810
Let's load me up with
the chemo, whatever,

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:21.190
and let's kill this cancer.

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:24.915
And eventually, what ended up
happening was he was, like,

00:25:24.915 --> 00:25:26.540
I won't treat you if
you don't do this.

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.300
So I did.

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:30.760
And you know,
miraculously, years pass.

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.597
And my wife and I
got to this place

00:25:32.597 --> 00:25:34.180
where, like, we do
want to have a kid.

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:37.120
And we went through
this IVF process.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.190
And I met this little person.

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:46.340
And I think, in a weird way,
telling that story and meeting

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:48.590
my daughter was the thing
that kind of closed the loop

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:49.970
on my cancer experience.

00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:52.890
Because I met the most
important person in my life,

00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:56.550
or one of them, because
of that experience.

00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:58.790
And so I think when I
was writing that song,

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:00.060
I felt all of those things.

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:04.040
That's why, instead of it
becoming just an ordinary love

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:07.070
song, it really became
me trying to educate

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:10.020
my daughter on the person I had
been, the things that I'd seen,

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:14.060
and let her know that those
peaks and valleys in life

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.988
are going to come to us all.

00:26:16.988 --> 00:26:18.530
But also that my
hope is that I could

00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:21.890
be there to walk that
road with her as much

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:24.520
as humanly possible.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.560
And I love that it
became my biggest song.

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:31.430
Because there are oftentimes
people in this business

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:35.420
that will try and force you into
the lowest common denominator

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:37.460
to reach the most
amount of people.

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:40.430
And what I found is
historically what's

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:42.590
been successful for
me has been the most

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:46.040
specificity and the most
sort of leaning into my story

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.910
and trying to find
those tangible threads.

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:50.870
Those universal threads have
been what have kind of led me

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:52.360
to the largest audience.

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.620
SPEAKER: Yeah, I think there's
a lot of truth to that.

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:56.720
That when you get
more specific, it

00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:00.330
becomes universal at the
same time sometimes, too.

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:03.410
So I can't imagine what
that was like, getting

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:05.420
a cancer diagnosis that young.

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:08.780
And I'm sure that
that greatly impacted

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:11.030
not just your life, but the
trajectory of your career.

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:13.520
Just in terms of going
through that experience,

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:18.200
being a survivor, do you feel
like that has affected like all

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.455
of the music you wrote since?

00:27:19.455 --> 00:27:20.330
ANDREW MCMAHON: Yeah.

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:23.990
I mean, I think the dangerous
game of survivorship

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:28.120
is trying to look at your
life as these sliding doors,

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:28.620
you know?

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:30.620
And saying, well, gosh,
if that hadn't happened,

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:31.830
where would I be now?

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:34.220
And I think it's
taken me years to sort

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.500
of unlearn that mentality.

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:37.880
And say, well, this did happen.

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:42.210
You know, this is the
way that your life went.

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:42.710
You know?

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:46.670
But it took me a lot
of years to figure out,

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:49.760
just as you build good
memories on the other side

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:53.100
of some trauma, that
becomes your life.

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.880
And that can be a really
beautiful existence.

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:59.610
But certainly it worked its
way into my creative process.

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:01.460
It worked its way, and
it was hard to create

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:02.340
after being sick.

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:03.945
I went from being
this fearless--

00:28:03.945 --> 00:28:06.320
you know, I made these records,
and I'd gotten successful

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.900
at such a young age, that
all of a sudden now I

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:13.490
had this ghost in every room
with me, going, you know?

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:15.425
Every decision became
much trickier to make.

00:28:15.425 --> 00:28:17.300
It was, like, everything
became life or death

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:23.600
after seeing life and death
in that frame at a young age.

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.540
But it's taught me a lot.

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:27.680
And at this point,
I wouldn't trade it.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:30.470
So much, like I said, has
happened because of it.

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:33.350
And I've been able to
make a lot of change

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:35.360
and try and raise a
lot of money for people

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.580
who've been in my position.

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:39.530
And that's been really
rewarding work for me.

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:42.170
SPEAKER: You're definitely an
inspiration to a lot of people,

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:44.180
having gone through
that and continuing

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:45.560
to create afterwards.

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:48.260
So on a lighter note,
I learned that you're

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:49.850
an amateur mixologist.

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:51.920
You just kicked off
a new video series

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.970
on YouTube, "The Rocktail Hour."

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:55.970
Could you talk a bit
about that, your interest

00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:58.515
in cocktails and your hobbies?

00:28:58.515 --> 00:28:59.390
ANDREW MCMAHON: Yeah.

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:02.540
I mean, I got a buzz
on at home one night.

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.860
And these phones,
as we all know,

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:06.920
sometimes you'll
maybe shoot a video

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:10.010
that you shouldn't shoot when
you've had too much to drink.

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:12.290
And I think it was a margarita.

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:13.850
I have a house margarita I make.

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:16.040
Then I was just, like, all
right, kids, here we go.

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:16.540
You know?

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:21.800
And it just turned into
this thing for my fans.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:25.530
They loved that window
into to my world.

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:28.670
And I think that that's a lesson
learned for me as somebody

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:31.460
who is not a early
adopter of technology,

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:35.120
but somebody who very much
has to be thrust and forced.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:38.920
Like, my manager's going, you
need to post on Instagram.

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:39.500
And now I do.

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:40.417
And I love that stuff.

00:29:40.417 --> 00:29:42.560
But yes, we started this series.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.930
A buddy of mine has a
bar in town where I live.

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:47.330
And he wrote all those recipes
and was behind the camera

00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:48.440
going, now you do this.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.210
Now you do that.

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:54.050
I make, like, three drinks well
and then quickly forget them.

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:55.160
But yeah.

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:55.790
It's fun.

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:59.180
It's a nice meditation at
the end of the night for me

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:02.407
to just make a single
drink for myself and enjoy.

00:30:02.407 --> 00:30:04.490
SPEAKER: We have some time
for audience questions,

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:07.230
if anybody wants to come up
to the mic and ask questions.

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:10.260
AUDIENCE: First off, thank
you so much for joining us.

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:12.530
As one of your fans who loves
a little bit of a window

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:15.300
into your life and the creative
process, much appreciated.

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:17.330
ANDREW MCMAHON: Thank you.

00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:19.790
AUDIENCE: You talk
about how you've

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:22.283
been on all these different
projects and bands

00:30:22.283 --> 00:30:24.200
and you've gone through
a lot of life changes.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.810
You talked earlier about being
a 22-year-old kid who, you know,

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:28.310
whatever.

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:30.060
I don't care about a
sperm bank right now.

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:31.490
Just treat me.

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:35.630
Obviously, your creative process
and style and musical style

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:38.000
has changed a lot
over those years.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.390
Who you are has changed
a lot over those years.

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:44.390
As a musician, though,
the music that you've made

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:45.350
is permanent, right?

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:46.430
It's on record.

00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:49.550
And there's some expectation
that you perform that old music

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:50.840
from time to time.

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:54.710
What is that like for you
being a very different person

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:57.625
than that person that
wrote those old songs?

00:30:57.625 --> 00:30:58.500
ANDREW MCMAHON: Yeah.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.530
You know, it's interesting.

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:03.770
I look at all of the
chapters of my first band,

00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:06.160
Something Corporate, Jack's
Mannequin, this record.

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:09.560
I don't necessarily look at
them as different people-- maybe

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:12.140
different lives, to some
extent, or different chapters

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.210
of a life.

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:17.330
And sure there are some
songs from my back catalog

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:19.540
that maybe I don't favor.

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:22.370
I would rather not play.

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:25.190
But what's interesting is I find
that the ones that are enduring

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:26.780
and the ones that people
talk about the most,

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:28.697
those are the ones that
matter to me the most.

00:31:28.697 --> 00:31:31.850
Kind of speaking to this idea
of when you write something that

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:33.680
feels very true
to yourself, even

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:37.010
if it's in some sort
of fledgling state

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:42.623
or some moment of growth, those
things still feel relevant.

00:31:42.623 --> 00:31:44.540
You know, when I play
those songs, and we do--

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:46.700
we do quite a bit of
back catalog in my set,

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:50.030
it's always kind of a
combination of the newest

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:51.000
record--

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.510
certainly I try and
lean heavy on whatever

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:54.960
project I'm working
specifically,

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.960
so there's a lot of
Wilderness songs in the set.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.030
But the other half
of the set is kind

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:03.260
of a mash up of the bigger
songs from Jack's and Something

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:03.830
Corporate.

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:08.270
And then sort of the ones on the
outskirts that I like the most,

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:11.270
or that fans talk
about the most.

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:13.700
And playing them live--

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:15.280
it still feels good.

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.885
If it doesn't, then I generally
kind of jettison those.

00:32:17.885 --> 00:32:19.260
Or I try and find
different ways.

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:21.440
There's a song called
"Punk Rock Princess"

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.300
from when I was in high school.

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:24.920
You know?

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:27.720
And we're doing it with a
full band for the first time

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.220
in forever.

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:30.380
Because this record
and this tour

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:34.040
is sort of a bit of a nostalgia
bent, because the album

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.680
itself is so reflective.

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:38.900
But with that song, I've
been doing that as a ballad

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.620
on and off for the
last few years.

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:45.140
And as a ballad, I feel like
the earnestness of being young

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:48.490
and what it is to sort
of pursue somebody

00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:51.240
who doesn't like the
same music that you like,

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.670
which I think is a--

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:56.677
you know, I can still
identify with that somehow.

00:32:56.677 --> 00:32:57.510
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:57.510 --> 00:32:58.590
ANDREW MCMAHON: Thank you.

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:00.120
AUDIENCE: That guy sort
of stole my question.

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.745
But it's more about
just your evolution

00:33:01.745 --> 00:33:03.240
of music over the years.

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:08.170
I mean, I feel like there's
pieces that seem very Something

00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:08.670
Corporate-y.

00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:10.378
But then, obviously,
you've changed a lot

00:33:10.378 --> 00:33:12.830
through life
experiences, et cetera.

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:15.260
I'm just curious
how what you learned

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:17.000
and what you experienced
in the Something

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.950
Corporate days, how
that impacted you

00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:22.190
when it went to Jack's Mannequin
and now your solo career,

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:25.850
what pieces you took with
you, what you maybe discarded.

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:27.480
Do you miss that period of time?

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:28.910
And then what's next?

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:31.575
What's next on your kind of
trajectory here with music?

00:33:31.575 --> 00:33:32.450
ANDREW MCMAHON: Yeah.

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:36.200
I mean, well, to the first
part, I think, like any of us,

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:38.810
we're trying to evolve.

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:43.970
And I think that's
been my biggest target.

00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:45.770
Just don't settle
and don't stay.

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:48.020
And that's why I've continued
to change project names.

00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:50.840
And people kind of hate
me for it on some level.

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:52.370
Because they're,
like, oh, new band?

00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:53.030
OK.

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:55.303
But historically,
most of the time,

00:33:55.303 --> 00:33:57.720
I have a lot of the same players
or producers or whatever.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.095
We're all involved
in this thing.

00:33:59.095 --> 00:34:02.030
And it's just more about
delineating time for me.

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:04.910
The thing that I take from
the Something Corporate era

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:08.889
for me is just I think
about collaboration.

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:11.190
I wasn't a great
collaborator in those days.

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:14.764
I think I was a very guarded
collaborator when I started.

00:34:14.764 --> 00:34:16.520
You know, you're a
kid in high school.

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:18.556
And you and your best
friends, you know,

00:34:18.556 --> 00:34:19.889
you're making a record together.

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:23.350
And all of a sudden
then it blows up.

00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:26.239
And then it gets political,
or whatever it is.

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:28.400
And I'm still close
with all those guys,

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.770
because I think we did
what a lot of bands

00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:32.520
and a lot of our
contemporaries didn't do,

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:35.100
which-- they stayed in it long
enough to hate each other,

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:35.600
you know?

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.437
Where it's, like, we did
the most mature thing

00:34:38.437 --> 00:34:39.020
we could have.

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:40.570
Which was, like,
we're best friends,

00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:44.892
we're not getting along so
well, let's take a break.

00:34:44.892 --> 00:34:46.850
And I think what I've
tried to learn over time,

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:49.159
and I think really
in a large way what

00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:51.560
the Wilderness is
a reflection of,

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:54.080
is how in those first two
projects, Something Corporate

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:59.480
and Jack's, I could carry a
chip on my shoulder, which

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:03.510
is just not a healthy way to try
and create or build anything.

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:04.010
You know?

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:05.930
If something didn't
go right or the launch

00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:08.360
of an album or a
single didn't take,

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:12.750
I would be pointing fingers.

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:15.020
And with collaboration,
again, I was a little bit more

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:16.560
of a jealous collaborator.

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:17.560
I was always guarded.

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:22.910
And with this project, it really
became about opening myself up.

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:24.920
Not being afraid
to get in a room

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:27.900
and write with somebody
who I admired or respected,

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.290
not being afraid to
travel here or there,

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:34.430
or meet this producer, or listen
to what a trusted manager had

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:35.540
to say about a song.

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:38.540
Because they want
me to win, you know?

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:42.000
And I think those are
the big lessons of now.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.450
And I think a lot of that is
just age and getting older.

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:49.910
And saying do you want to walk
through life with your fists

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:52.790
up all the time, or do you
want to sort of move through it

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:55.088
in a peaceful way?

00:35:55.088 --> 00:35:56.630
And I'd say those
are the big lessons

00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:58.190
I learned from the early days.

00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:02.090
As far as what's next,
I'm not 100% sure.

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:06.260
I'm in that bizarre
flux moment now where

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:10.640
this tour feels like it's doing
an amazing job of rounding out

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:11.268
this project.

00:36:11.268 --> 00:36:13.310
I don't think I'm walking
away from this project.

00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:14.840
But there's some
talk about maybe

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:17.510
doing some scoring work and
some film and television

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:18.450
stuff when I get home.

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:23.270
And I'm working on some other
projects for people who are not

00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:25.810
just myself, but
actually contributing

00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:28.740
to some other
avenues creatively.

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:30.140
So time will tell.

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:31.900
But I'll always be making songs.

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:32.650
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:32.990
Thanks.

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.160
Thanks for coming by.

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:33.590
ANDREW MCMAHON: Cheers.

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:35.160
Thank you, appreciate it.

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:37.400
AUDIENCE: My friend
introduced me to your music,

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.620
like, 15, 16 years ago.

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:45.170
And my girlfriend, it was
one of our first dates--

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:45.920
went to your show.

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:46.878
ANDREW MCMAHON: Really?

00:36:46.878 --> 00:36:47.530
Where?

00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:48.860
AUDIENCE: I think it was--

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:49.730
I can't remember.

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:50.750
ANDREW MCMAHON: Was it
in the area, though?

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:51.230
AUDIENCE: It was
in Boston, yeah.

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:52.272
ANDREW MCMAHON: OK, cool.

00:36:52.272 --> 00:36:53.090
Awesome.

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:56.270
AUDIENCE: And we've been
married now for 10 years,

00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:58.140
and we've got three kids.

00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:01.137
My seven-year-old daughter-- her
favorite song is "Fire Escape."

00:37:01.137 --> 00:37:01.970
ANDREW MCMAHON: Mhm.

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:05.160
AUDIENCE: And we sing it
to her almost every night.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:09.860
But the question I want to ask
is, my son is 11 years old.

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:12.830
And he's getting
into music a lot.

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:15.420
He's taking piano
lessons and guitar.

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:19.250
What advice would you give
to the parent of someone who

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:20.750
really wants to get into music?

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:23.292
ANDREW MCMAHON: The best advice
that I can give at this point

00:37:23.292 --> 00:37:24.740
is to do what my parents did.

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:30.140
Which, you know, my
parents just supported me.

00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:33.080
They never really
drove the whole--

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.310
you have to go to lessons.

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:37.160
I eventually asked for
lessons, because I was writing.

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:39.450
And I started by writing.

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:41.860
I learned a couple chords
and that was the beginning

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:42.860
of my writing adventure.

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:44.360
And then after about
a year of that,

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:47.100
I couldn't make any new sounds
or shapes with my fingers.

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:48.650
And so I asked for lessons.

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:51.230
I mean, they were diligent
about trying to make sure I went

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:52.940
and that I didn't
waste their money.

00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:57.520
But I think about my mom.

00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:00.740
Like, when I started
writing songs,

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:02.365
all the other kids
were playing sports.

00:38:02.365 --> 00:38:03.282
You know, what I mean?

00:38:03.282 --> 00:38:05.330
And my oldest-- I'm the
youngest of five-- all

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:07.538
of my older brothers and
sisters were great athletes.

00:38:07.538 --> 00:38:09.350
I was not a good athlete.

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:12.830
And instead, my parents
saw that I had a passion,

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:14.150
and they backed it.

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:17.000
And you know, my mom
looked up music producer

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.900
in the yellow pages
when I was 10 years old

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:22.760
and drove me to Dayton, Ohio.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:27.080
And I worked in this guy's
little home studio, which

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:29.270
was a fairly new
thing at that point,

00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:31.610
and made a three song demo tape.

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:35.420
And it wasn't very good.

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:39.013
But they sort of always
believed in me, you know?

00:38:39.013 --> 00:38:40.430
And believed that
it was possible,

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:41.810
when other people were,
like, oh, your kid's

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:42.727
going to be in a band.

00:38:42.727 --> 00:38:45.932
And when I was not
gearing up for college,

00:38:45.932 --> 00:38:47.390
I think there was
a lot of judgment

00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:48.432
there from other parents.

00:38:48.432 --> 00:38:51.560
And they just said this is his
passion, and they backed it.

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:55.220
You know, I just would
say with anything, music

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:59.690
or otherwise, if your kid's
got a passion for something--

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:02.390
you know, I learned a lot
from my parents in that sense.

00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:06.020
They backed me 100%.

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:08.070
And let him learn songs
he wants to learn.

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:09.070
That's what I would say.

00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:11.060
It's important
that they can make

00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:13.280
the connection of why
they're learning music

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.750
to why they love music.

00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:20.120
and sometimes classical
is a great teaching tool.

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:22.970
But I'd say what I did was
every classical song I learned,

00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:24.520
I learned a Billy Joel tune.

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:26.840
And I made my teacher do that.

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:28.720
And she was this
scary, scary woman,

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:31.703
and somehow she
still let me do it.

00:39:31.703 --> 00:39:32.203
Yeah.

00:39:32.203 --> 00:39:33.036
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:33.036 --> 00:39:34.040
