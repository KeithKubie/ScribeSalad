Woo, we made a prototype.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.920
It gave us information we needed.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.360
Well done prototype, you rock.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.470
Unfortunately, as we said at
the beginning of this lesson,

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.760
prototypes should exist for
exactly as long as they are needed, and

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.725
we don't need you anymore.

00:00:13.725 --> 00:00:19.090

And we're done.
