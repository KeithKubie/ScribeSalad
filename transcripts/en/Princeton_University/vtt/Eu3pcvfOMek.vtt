00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:08.490
In a few minutes, all of you will march through
FitzRandolph Gate as newly minted graduates

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.010
of this University.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:18.400
Before you do, it is my privilege to say a
few words to you about the path that lies ahead.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.900
Though in my case, to say a few words without jumping off the platform during my speech.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.900
It looks like fun actually, but I would not want to do that without a helmet.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.900
Whether on the platform or beyond it.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:46.890
It is indeed a privilege, and also a joy, to
address you, for all of you who graduate today

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.620
have accomplished something genuinely
important and worth celebrating.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.550
You have completed a demanding course of study.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.420
It will transform your life in many ways.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.500
It will expand the range of vocations you
can pursue, increase your knowledge of the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:12.540
world, deepen your capacity to appreciate
societies and cultures, and provide a foundation

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.970
for lifelong learning.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.940
So we celebrate here on the lawn in front
of Nassau Hall, as do other college communities

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:29.880
in courtyards, auditoria, arenas, and stadia
around the country.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.360
Graduates toss caps in the air 
and professors applaud.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.930
Families cheer and 
holler enthusiastically.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:45.250
Yet, even as we do so, we see a strange trend
from columnists, bloggers, think tanks, and

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.250
politicians.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:54.580
In essays, books, and speeches, some of them
suggest that too many students are earning

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.090
college degrees.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.869
Too many college graduates: that is a very
odd claim, because the economic evidence for

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:10.570
the value of a college degree 
is overwhelming.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:17.349
For example, in 2014, economists Jaison Abel
and Richard Deitz of the Federal Reserve Bank

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:24.730
of New York estimated the average annual return
on investment from a college degree, net of

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:33.120
tuition paid and lost earnings, at between
9 percent and 16 percent per year for a lifetime.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:40.359
For the last two decades, the return on investment
has hovered at the high end of that range,

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.709
around 15 percent per year.

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:50.230
By comparison, the historical average return
on investments in the American stock market

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.719
is around 7 percent per year.

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:58.639
That is why my friend Morton Shapiro, the
president of Northwestern University and a

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:04.930
leading educational economist, says that for
most people, the decision to invest in a college

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.370
degree will be “the single best financial
decision they make in a lifetime,” even

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.379
if judged purely in terms of financial return
on investment.

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.989
A degree conveys many 
other benefits as well.

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:26.519
For example, college graduates report higher
levels of happiness and job satisfaction,

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.690
even after controlling for income.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.670
College graduates are 
healthier than nongraduates.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:39.659
They are more likely to exercise, more likely
to vote, and have higher levels of civic engagement.

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:45.699
To these pragmatic considerations we should
add the joys that come with an increased capacity

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:52.819
to appreciate culture, the arts, the world’s
diversity, and the inherent beauty of extraordinary

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.540
ideas.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.849
The numbers I have quoted 
are not specific to Princeton.

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:04.689
On the contrary, they are averages over all
four-year degrees, in all fields, from all

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:08.049
colleges in the United States.

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:14.049
Think about that for a moment: on average,
all degrees in all fields from all colleges

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:20.430
generate an annual return between 9 percent
and 16 percent, and this return is supplemented

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.300
by additional benefits to health, happiness,
and quality of life.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.350
How could anyone think 
we need fewer college graduates?

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:36.330
Some people answer that you can learn a trade
without getting a college degree.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.660
Welders, they observe, can make more money
than many college graduates.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.039
That’s true.

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:48.590
There are, of course, reasons why you might
want to get a college degree even if you plan

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.419
to become a welder.

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:56.509
You might worry, for example, about what happens
if technology renders your trade obsolete,

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:01.860
or arthritis leaves you unable to practice
it, or you want to move into management or

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.060
explore other interests.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:10.880
A college degree equips you to respond to
the changes—to yourself, and to the world—that

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.970
inevitably occur over a lifetime.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.639
Still, if pundits and politicians were saying
only that America needs better vocational

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:23.080
training, I could agree wholeheartedly.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:29.210
It would be terrific if more people could
get the training they need to practice a trade.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:35.240
But at the same time it would also be great
if more people, not fewer, could receive the

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.439
extraordinary benefits that come 
with a college degree.

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:45.100
So I ask again: why would anyone think we
need fewer college graduates?

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.259
I think there is a simple answer.

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:51.919
Education requires 
high-quality teaching.

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:58.140
Teaching, in turn, depends upon 
skilled labor, which is expensive.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:04.760
As a result, the up-front cost for education
is real, large, and easy to measure.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:12.240
The returns are equally real and even larger,
but they accrue over a lifetime, are hard

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.550
to measure, and vary 
from person to person.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:23.050
It is tempting to wish that you could get
more certainty at lower cost.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:28.060
The people who call for fewer degrees 
yield to that temptation.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.770
They emphasize the short term.

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:36.180
They focus almost entirely on the price of
college and on the salaries students might

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.040
earn in their first jobs.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.751
That is a mistake.

00:06:40.751 --> 00:06:45.590
A college education is 
a long-term investment.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:51.930
It enables graduates to develop and adapt,
and it pays off spectacularly in the long

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.250
run.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:59.389
The idea that we would be better off with
fewer college graduates is a short-term swindle,

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:05.479
a swindle that will cheat America’s young
people, weaken the nation’s economy, and

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:15.400
undermine our future.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.060
We need to have the confidence to invest in
our young people and to ensure that a college

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:26.629
education is accessible and affordable for
students from all backgrounds and financial

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:30.680
circumstances.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:39.590
I hope that all of you who graduate today,
and who experience the power of education

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:46.030
in your own lives, will become advocates for
the value of higher education in our society.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:52.639
There is a national conversation taking place
right now about the value of higher education,

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:56.770
and we need your voice 
in that conversation.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:03.040
We need you, in other words, to help others
to achieve in the future what you achieve

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.569
today.

00:08:04.569 --> 00:08:08.110
How can you help more 
students earn college degrees?

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.060
Here are three suggestions.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:15.749
First, become advocates for the 
importance of completion rates.

00:08:15.749 --> 00:08:22.810
A college education produces a tremendous
return—if you get the degree.

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:27.430
Returns are much lower if you start college
but do not get the degree.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:33.520
The highest default rates on student loans
do not involve college graduates with big

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.770
debts.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:40.450
They instead involve students with small debts
who never finish college and so never get

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:44.250
the earnings boost that 
comes with a degree.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:51.690
A few moments ago, we awarded an honorary
degree to President Barbara Gitenstein.

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:57.850
Over her nearly two decades leading The College
of New Jersey, she raised the College’s

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:14.430
four-year graduation rate from 58 percent
to 75 percent, a number that puts TCNJ’s

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:21.780
on-time completion rate among the top 10
in the nation for public colleges and universities.

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:28.470
By raising TCNJ’s graduation rate, President
Gitenstein has improved the lives of thousands

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:33.650
of students who might have left 
school with debt but no degree.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:39.700
Be an advocate for higher education leaders
like Bobby Gitenstein, and for colleges like

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:44.330
TCNJ that commit to 
improving completion rates.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:57.580
Second, support America’s public 
institutions of higher education.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:04.240
State subsidies for public colleges and universities
have declined precipitously, and state funding

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:10.680
represents an increasingly small share of
the budget at public research universities.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:15.980
At the University of Michigan, for example,
state funding now accounts for only about

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:19.190
9 percent of total revenues.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:24.590
In the 1950s, by contrast, 
that number was 80 percent.

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:30.230
Tuition at state universities has risen not
because they have increased their expenditures

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:37.250
per student, but because state legislatures
have hollowed out their other sources of support.

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:41.010
America depends on its 
public colleges and universities.

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:51.300
They are engines of 
social mobility and innovation.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:56.360
Princeton and other private universities make
essential contributions to the nation and

00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:02.790
the world—but there is no way that we could
ever replace America’s great public institutions.

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:10.830
They are a national treasure, 
and I urge you to support them.

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:19.800
Third, stand up for the importance of enabling
more students from low-income families to

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:24.800
earn college degrees.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:34.600
Princeton’s Great Class of 2018 graduates
today as the most socioeconomically diverse

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:49.760
class in the 272-year 
history of this University.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.460
You will not hold that record for long.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:56.350
Other classes already at Princeton 
will break your record.

00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:02.150
Our graduate programs are likewise drawing
upon new sources of talent: this spring we

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:11.070
admitted the most socioeconomically diverse
class of doctoral students in Princeton University’s

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:14.630
history.

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:19.760
At Princeton we believe in socioeconomic diversity
because we know that to achieve excellence

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:26.600
as a University and as a nation we must draw
talent from every sector of society.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:32.680
We know, too, that a Princeton degree is a
rocket-booster for students seeking socioeconomic

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:33.950
mobility.

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:42.450
If we want to heal the divisions that inequality
has produced in this country, we must ensure

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:48.770
that students from low-income backgrounds
receive the educations they need to develop

00:12:48.770 --> 00:13:00.990
their abilities and contribute to our society.

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:07.510
As I look out at our extraordinary class of
undergraduate, master's, and doctoral degree

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:13.830
recipients, I take pride in your excellence
and your diversity, and I am excited about

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:17.100
the contributions you will 
make in the years ahead.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:21.140
The world needs more 
college degrees, not fewer.

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:27.510
We need more celebrations like the one we
hold today, with more proud families and happy

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:32.060
graduates ready to go out and make 
a positive difference in the world.

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:37.290
All of us on this platform are thrilled to
be a part of your celebration.

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:39.230
We applaud your achievements.

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:44.790
We send our best wishes as you begin the adventures
that lie ahead, and we look forward to welcoming

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:48.250
you back to this campus on future visits.

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:52.430
To the Great Class of 2018 and all of our
graduates, congratulations!
