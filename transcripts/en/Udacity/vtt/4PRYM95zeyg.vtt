00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.050
In this lesson we'll talk about the why

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:06.510
and how of programming SDNs. Unfortunately programming OpenFlow is

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.310
not easy. It offers only a very low level

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.280
of abstraction in the form of match action rules.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.710
The controller only sees events that switches don't know

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.320
how to handle. And there can be race conditions

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.270
if switch level rules are not installed properly, as

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.040
we've already seen in the lesson on consistent updates
