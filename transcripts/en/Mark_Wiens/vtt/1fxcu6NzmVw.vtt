00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.740
- Good morning, hope you're
having an amazing day.

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:02.573
It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:02.573 --> 00:00:05.300
I'm in Chiang Mai, Thailand,
and the goal of today

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.050
is to eat at this traditional restaurant.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:08.883
- Ying, what's the name

00:00:08.883 --> 00:00:10.605
of the restaurant we're
going to for lunch?

00:00:10.605 --> 00:00:13.574
- Uhhh (responds in foreign language)

00:00:13.574 --> 00:00:15.700
- (repeats in foreign
language) and they specialize

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.990
in very traditional, very
rare to find Thai dishes.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.100
So that's the goal of the
day but then there's a couple

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.280
of restaurants and little stalls that Ying

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.990
and I really wanted to check out.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.030
And so it's gonna be some good food.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.863
I'm gonna share it

00:00:26.863 --> 00:00:28.800
with you in this video
today on in Chiang Mai.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.690
We're sitting just on
little, tiny, wooden stools.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.360
The grill right in front of me.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.590
She's really nice.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.820
This is such a beautiful environment.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.070
You can smell the aroma of that beef.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.030
I'm always thrilled to try a
new version of satay but I mean

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.500
especially the sauce looks very unique.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.570
Oh man and if you could
smell that aroma sizzling

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.373
on that grill, oh wow.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.580
For my first bite, I'm
just gonna try it as is

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.430
without the sauce just to get
a taste of the actual meat.

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:17.050
- (speaks in foreign language)

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.430
- Oh she cooked it so it's
really juicy and fatty.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.700
You can taste a little
bit of chili in there

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.600
but you really taste
the flavor of the beef.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.510
Oh that's juicy too and oily.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.833
Let's try the sauce which
is a very unique sauce.

00:01:27.833 --> 00:01:30.120
This is a sauce unlike I've ever seen.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.953
There's some oil on there.

00:01:30.953 --> 00:01:32.770
There's some peanuts in
there and it's really

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:33.630
like thick and chunky.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.463
Look at that.

00:01:34.463 --> 00:01:36.293
It's like jelly or jam almost.

00:01:38.845 --> 00:01:41.487
Mhm, that's wow.

00:01:42.993 --> 00:01:45.020
It's like like blobby.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.120
It's like jam.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.230
It is almost kind of fruity.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.060
It's a little bit sweet and
very nutty and you do taste

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.830
that like undertone of
chili oil but what's amazing

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.820
is the beef and just how
juicy and oily that beef is.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.980
Oh the beef is awesome.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.980
And then she has a plate of
chilis and shallots as well.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.340
Taste that?

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.470
Oh yeah, oh that's a beautiful green burst

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.840
of heat in your mouth.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.673
Oh that's what you need.

00:02:10.673 --> 00:02:12.580
The sauce is quite sweet so balanced

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.930
with the juicy beef and with that chili.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.860
Now let me grab a shallot

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.690
and that completes the satay experience.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.370
That full round.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.920
Let's do it again.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.323
Step one, step two, step three.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.703
Oh one more step, I totally
forgot about the cucumber.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.237
And that's the full experience.

00:02:34.237 --> 00:02:35.193
Her beef though.

00:02:36.043 --> 00:02:36.876
It's so flavorful.

00:02:36.876 --> 00:02:37.720
It's so juicy.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.960
It's so oily.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.640
I'm in heaven here as
soon as you finish those,

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.180
she adds more right from
the grill so they remain hot

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.400
as you keep on eating.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.687
Yeah, the beef, the beef is awesome.

00:02:46.687 --> 00:02:49.440
(upbeat music)

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.710
Once you are satisfied,
you just give her the word.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.150
She'll literally just
keep giving you skewers

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.160
until you tell her the word
and when you're satisfied

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.620
you tell her, okay that's good

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.990
and then she'll count your sticks

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.860
and it's five baht per stick.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.610
Oh that was great.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.450
The beef itself was delicious
and the surrounding,

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.280
the atmosphere is just, it's awesome.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.050
The sauce is a little bit on
the sweet side for me kind of.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.630
It's almost custardy and nutty

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.130
but it was very interesting satay

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.370
that I've never had before.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.220
So that was a lot of fun.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.236
That was well worth checking out.

00:03:23.236 --> 00:03:24.069
- (speaking in a foreign language)

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.902
- That was fun.

00:03:24.902 --> 00:03:26.091
Now Ying what did you think?

00:03:26.091 --> 00:03:26.924
- Yes

00:03:26.924 --> 00:03:29.274
- So cool to be sitting
there eating satay, no?

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.270
So the next thing we have
planned today is lunch.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.060
We have reservations at noon, right?

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.510
Serves some rare, very hard

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.507
to find Bolang traditional Thai dishes.

00:03:42.507 --> 00:03:45.090
(upbeat music)

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.100
Welcome to lunch and the restaurant

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.387
is called (speaks in foreign language).

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.550
It's a little bit outside
of the center of Chiang Mai

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.720
but in a nice little neighborhood.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.720
It's quite a nice place and
it's known to be a real classic,

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.740
a real, a place that's
really preserving very rare,

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.950
very hard to find Thai dishes and snacks.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.943
So I'm excited and we'll
see what they have.

00:04:16.073 --> 00:04:20.740
- [Ying] (speaks in a foreign language)

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.910
- We chose to sit outside.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.390
It's a really nice garden area.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.560
They have some waterfalls.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.280
Very pleasant.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.210
We're just noticing how heavy the menu is.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.973
Oh beautiful photos in this menu.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.950
As soon as you sit down, they
give you a little platter

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.470
of (speaks in a foreign
language), which is green mango,

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.210
beautifully cut and then a
(speaks in a foreign language),

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.140
it's a sweet sauce but it's
like sweet but also savory

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.553
because there's shallots in
it, there's chilis in it.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.713
Oh wow, oh that is superb.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.270
It's salty, it's shrimpy.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.300
But then it's sweet and
like tamorindy as well.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.284
Oh what just came, Ying?

00:05:02.284 --> 00:05:03.450
- Saeng wa goong

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.283
- Saeng wa goong

00:05:05.799 --> 00:05:06.632
Gonna put a little bit

00:05:06.632 --> 00:05:08.380
of the fried shrimp cracklings on top.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.403
There's also a citrus in here
called somsa and the shrimp.

00:05:17.134 --> 00:05:19.850
Wow look at what she just gave us.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.070
Oh that is gorgeous.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.670
Okay first bite of the saeng wa.

00:05:31.655 --> 00:05:33.630
Mhm, oh the shrimp.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.100
That is like almost crab in texture.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.737
Beautiful presented.

00:05:37.737 --> 00:05:39.850
You can taste the caper lime peel in there

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.340
and then you got the
crunchy shrimp as well.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.219
Stunningly refreshing and good.

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:44.440
(upbeat music)

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.523
- (speaks in a foreign language)

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:51.630
- [Mark] I'm trying to find words man.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:52.463
This is...

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.910
- The texture is perfect.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.440
It's like engineered deliciousness.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.530
- [Mark] This is called kratong tong

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.020
and they're little gold
little cups filled with

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.590
I think it does have a little
bit of western influence.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.490
There's corn, there's carrots,
there's mince meat in here.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.590
But you got that crunch,
you got the mince meats

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.213
like a mince meat pot pie.

00:06:16.118 --> 00:06:17.740
We got so many dishes to try.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:18.992
Let's try the next dish
together, the chaw muang

00:06:18.992 --> 00:06:21.910
Chaw muang (speaking
in a foreign language)

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.870
- [Waitress] (speaking
in a foreign language)

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.710
- It's like some of the
prettiest food you'll ever see.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.590
I would imagine that
the blue color is coming

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.900
from butterfly pea.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:32.733
- [Joel] Yup.

00:06:32.733 --> 00:06:34.030
- [Mark] And then it's
covered in coconut milk.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:35.700
There you can see some
garlic shavings on there.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.130
So it's, I think it might
be the sweet, savory kind

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.170
of contract and then you
chase it with all that herbs

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.690
and vegetables, the lettuce, the cilantro.

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.470
I think that's it.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.040
So maybe we should use a spoon.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.090
Everything is just pinched perfectly

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.199
into this little floral dumpling.

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:53.782
(upbeat music)

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:58.363
- Warm too.

00:06:58.363 --> 00:07:00.080
- [Mark] Mh-hm, it's one
of those things where you

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.240
It's kind of deserty but at
the same time it's savory.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.580
Very sweet but at the same time garlicky

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.821
and then that's why you gotta
chase it with that herb.

00:07:07.821 --> 00:07:10.404
(upbeat music)

00:07:12.022 --> 00:07:14.260
And that just adds to the contrast.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.278
Do you remember the name of this one?

00:07:16.278 --> 00:07:18.330
- [Joel] Room, room

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.290
- [Mark] I mean everything
is taken into consideration

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.480
and the time intensive decorations.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.240
That looks like a little egg neck wrapper.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.046
Look at that neck like yolky wrapper.

00:07:29.046 --> 00:07:29.879
- Wow.
- Wow.

00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:32.564
- [Waiter] (speaking
in a foreign language)

00:07:32.564 --> 00:07:34.654
- [Girl in The Background]
(speaking in a foreign language)

00:07:34.654 --> 00:07:35.941
- [Mark] Wow.

00:07:35.941 --> 00:07:40.191
- (speaking in a foreign language)

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:46.633
- Three layers

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:48.800
- (speaking in a foreign
language) That looks

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.463
like a sausage roll. (speaking
in a foreign language)

00:07:52.463 --> 00:07:55.046
(upbeat music)

00:07:57.161 --> 00:07:58.078
The coconut

00:07:58.993 --> 00:08:03.243
- (speaking in a foreign language)

00:08:04.313 --> 00:08:05.500
- [Mark] That sweet coconut in there

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.400
and then like the yolky
omelet thin wrapper.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.380
As we were taking a bite of the last dish,

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.727
the owner (speaking in
a foreign language),

00:08:13.948 --> 00:08:16.330
she came with the
platter of the, it's kind

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.150
of like sausage wrapped
into an egg wrapper

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:20.010
with (speaking in a foreign language),

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.630
which is a Chinese (speaking
in a foreign language) sausage

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:23.463
in the middle.

00:08:23.463 --> 00:08:25.483
It's kind of like a sausage roll-up.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.790
Look at how beautiful that is.

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:31.190
Did it come with that sauce?

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:33.323
- [Joel] Yes.

00:08:33.323 --> 00:08:34.156
- [Mark] I think it did, right?

00:08:34.156 --> 00:08:36.200
Every bite there's a cucumber foundation.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.850
Cucumber base on the bottom.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.770
Look at that so you get the roll-up

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:41.920
with a cucumber on the bottom.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.377
Look at the, oh it just
slipped off of the spoon.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:48.110
Oh no, I'm sorry.

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.950
- [Joel] It's like dropping

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:49.783
a piece of artwork.

00:08:49.783 --> 00:08:50.616
- [Mark] I'm sorry.

00:08:50.616 --> 00:08:53.310
I did drop it and oh that's celery.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:54.700
Okay my bad about that.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.283
(upbeat music)

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.030
Oh this one is great.

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:07.010
There's so many different
contrasts of flavor.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:08.400
You got the sweet Chinese sausage.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.740
You got the like meatball
and then the egg wrapper

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:11.971
which is crunchy.

00:09:11.971 --> 00:09:13.160
- [Joel] Yeah.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.460
In the meatball, crunchy celery

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.793
and then there was also the celery leaf.

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:25.980
- Wow, I've never had anything
like this in Thailand.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.110
Next up for the mee krob.

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:32.110
This is the fried like
silky egg and noodles

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:35.220
and there should be noodle, yeah okay.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.300
So on the top you can see
it's like a egg shaving

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.230
so they drizzle the egg
into the oil so it fries.

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:43.580
Then, on the bottom it's
actually the mee, the noodles.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:47.094
Oh look at that egg net, egg net.

00:09:47.094 --> 00:09:49.677
(upbeat music)

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.193
- Really, wow.

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.950
Look at this green onion.

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:59.283
I think I'll just one bite it.

00:09:59.283 --> 00:10:00.116
Oh wow.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:05.470
The noodles, the noodles
just kind of like dissolve

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:06.303
into your mouth.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.870
You can really taste the
sweet tamarind in there.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:17.050
Wow this is like cripsyness drenched

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:20.850
in like tamarindy dressing.

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:22.300
- [Waiter] Chiang da pad thai

00:10:23.372 --> 00:10:25.680
- [Mark] This is a vegetable
stir fried with egg.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.033
Be careful of the chilis.

00:10:28.414 --> 00:10:30.014
- [Joel] Oh that smells so good.

00:10:30.942 --> 00:10:33.525
(upbeat music)

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:39.640
- Oh it's spinachy.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.480
It's got that really soft
slightly slimy texture to it.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.500
So the way they fried it,
you can taste the smoky,

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.400
you can taste the garlic.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.250
Oh that is superb.

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:50.240
Okay next up is the gaeng ranjuan

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.880
This is another classic dish.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.450
I think pork bones.

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:55.513
There's some chilis
floating around in there.

00:10:55.513 --> 00:10:56.730
It's very aromatic.

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.190
I'm just gonna try the soup

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.360
with a couple of chilis in there.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.820
Oh you can see the little slivers of,

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.140
I believe, lemongrass in there too.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.698
Try the broth first.

00:11:05.698 --> 00:11:08.281
(upbeat music)

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.520
It's almost fruity.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.630
- [Joel] Yeah, I taste fruit in there.

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.543
I was gonna ask is it like a plum?

00:11:13.543 --> 00:11:14.429
- [Mark] Passionfruity

00:11:14.429 --> 00:11:15.538
- [Joel] Yeah.

00:11:15.538 --> 00:11:17.270
- [Mark] Passionfruity
- [Joel] Wow.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:19.070
- [Mark] But at the same time porky.

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:28.310
The pork is just fall off the bone tender.

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:29.920
Okay next we're gonna try the khao yam

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.010
which is a southern Thai rice
salad and I've asked my wife,

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:34.970
Ying, to do the honors of mixing it.

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:36.570
Wow mix that all with (speaking
in a foreign language),

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:40.310
which is a fermented fish versera sauce,

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:41.493
which is the dressing.

00:11:41.493 --> 00:11:44.076
(upbeat music)

00:11:47.942 --> 00:11:49.530
Oh there's red cabbage in here too.

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.730
In one bite of this you
got like 25 ingredients.

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:52.563
- Oh yeah.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.600
- Every time I eat this dish, the one word

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.870
that comes to mind, herbaceous.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.520
Such a harmony.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.300
- So many fresh ingredients
like it's such a bite

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.470
that makes your mouth feel alive.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:18.360
- [Mark] Next dish and
again just spectacular,

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:22.750
nam prik kai boo, which
is the crab eggs dip

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:25.230
with a variety of vegetables.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:26.760
Stunning, I'm going green bean

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.450
and you can see the
yellowness from the crab eggs

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:31.310
but then also some crab
meat on the side there.

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:34.420
Then little pellets of I don't
know what they are exactly.

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:41.810
Oh, you don't expect it
to be cold like that.

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:45.460
It's like refreshing
immediately and it's so yolky

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:48.223
from all of the crab roe.

00:12:49.171 --> 00:12:50.004
- [Joel] I don't know

00:12:50.004 --> 00:12:50.837
if I ever had that before.

00:12:50.837 --> 00:12:51.670
- [Mark] Yeah.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.350
With a crunchiness factor, mhm.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:03.670
Oh (laughter) (speaking
in a foreign language)

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:04.503
- [Joel] Thank you, God.

00:13:04.503 --> 00:13:05.980
- [Mark] so we're still
waiting on a fish, aren't you?

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.710
One more fish to come but in the mean time

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:09.630
they brought out the deserts.

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:13.600
So we're gonna just taste the
deserts real fast and these

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.830
I don't think I've ever
seen a more beautiful desert

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:17.663
in my life.

00:13:17.663 --> 00:13:21.460
So it's sweet potato,
which is simmered in syrup

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:24.180
and then covered in coconut
milk and just carved

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.820
into flowers again.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.540
If you got a piece of
the flower and eat with a

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.000
oh yeah you can see the
starchiness of that,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.530
oh man I feel kind of
bad tearing into this.

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:35.690
- [Joel] It's cool they have
to cook it enough to be eaten

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.123
but also soft enough
to cut it so artfully.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:41.283
- [Mark] It's dripping with coconut milk.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.203
Wow really delicate.

00:13:51.513 --> 00:13:52.611
- [Ying] It's crunchy also, right?

00:13:52.611 --> 00:13:55.540
- Yeah it's cooked perfectly
so it's starchy and soft

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:56.707
but kind of crunchy at
the same time, right.

00:13:56.707 --> 00:13:58.076
- [Ying] Yeah.

00:13:58.076 --> 00:13:59.680
- And so it's like
exactly cooked perfectly

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.533
how they want it.

00:14:04.106 --> 00:14:05.030
Love it, huh?

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:06.284
- Mh.

00:14:06.284 --> 00:14:07.264
- [Mark] Oh the fish.

00:14:07.264 --> 00:14:08.097
Here comes the fish.

00:14:08.097 --> 00:14:09.793
That's the final dish we ordered, Ying?

00:14:09.793 --> 00:14:10.626
- Mh-hm.

00:14:10.626 --> 00:14:13.777
- [Mark] The final dish we got
was a black cod samoon prai

00:14:13.777 --> 00:14:17.870
and so it's a fried fish with
Thai herbs, which in this case

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:20.060
happened to be like a massive pile

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:25.060
of shredded deep fried
lemongrass and a second pile

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:27.270
of fried caper lime season.

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:28.740
Looks like there's some
basil in there too.

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.200
You could dump the sauce
over the whole thing

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.130
but I think I'll just
anoint this side first.

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:37.219
Joel, let's go from this side,
mix in some of the herbs.

00:14:37.219 --> 00:14:38.052
- [Joel] Look at that.

00:14:38.052 --> 00:14:38.890
- [Mark] Right out of the oil.

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:41.900
Oh yes it is with some of the

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.300
I'm gonna make this

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:45.700
This is a dish that you wanna
make your bite count, right?

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.510
- [Joel] Yeah, look at all those leaves.

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:51.260
- [Mark] Pile of fried lemongrass.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.050
The caper lime leaves,
the fish is under there

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:54.155
and some of the sauce.

00:14:54.155 --> 00:14:56.738
(upbeat music)

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.420
Oh yeah, oh wow.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.850
The lemongrass cause normally
you're not really meant

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:12.720
to eat lemongrass unless
it's shaved very fine

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.017
or unless it's shredded
and deep fried like this

00:15:15.017 --> 00:15:16.690
but it is so fragrant.

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:18.720
- [Joel] And that fish so warm and soft.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.834
That's glorious.

00:15:19.834 --> 00:15:20.792
- [Mark] That's spectacular.

00:15:20.792 --> 00:15:23.375
(upbeat music)

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:29.210
Wow that is blowing my mouth right now.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.290
- Even, I'm still getting the after taste

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:32.123
from the first bite.

00:15:32.123 --> 00:15:33.960
That is a mountain of
deep fried lemongrass.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:36.370
- Okay, I think we have
successfully tasted everything

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:37.410
that we ordered.

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:38.263
What a treat.

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:45.720
The style of food is more
of the Borang traditional

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:50.720
but also royal Thai food which
is always a little more mild

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:55.320
and sweet in taste overall.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.440
So like it depends on your
mood, you know, like the food

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:03.180
incredibly high quality, incredibly good,

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:08.180
incredibly balanced and
also just the time it took

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.660
to prepare all those dishes
and to the decoration.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:14.280
I mean that was for sure one
of the most beautiful meals

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:17.090
I've ever had but yeah
the food is on the milder,

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:20.860
sweeter side everything
but yeah really good.

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.420
That was a meal experience.

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:23.814
That was a meal experience.

00:16:23.814 --> 00:16:26.397
(upbeat music)

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.840
It's been kind of a mixed
bag day of food today

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.720
and we weren't really sure
what we were even gonna do.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.120
We were gonna go to dinner
after that giant lunch

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.220
but we have decided.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.480
We had a little break back at the house

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:44.220
but we have decided to
come out for dinner tonight

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.490
and not that hungry but
this is a restaurant,

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:48.843
I really wanted to
check out before leaving

00:16:48.843 --> 00:16:50.200
or in Chiang Mai.

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.163
So it's called Lerd
Rote Tai Rome Ma-Feuang.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.110
You just totally walk all
the way through their house

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:58.900
to the patio.

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.119
This is kind of the front
patio of their house

00:17:01.119 --> 00:17:02.260
and then you get to the
restaurant which is out here

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:03.480
over looking (speaking
in a foreign language).

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.913
Over looking the river.

00:17:07.125 --> 00:17:09.750
And the other interesting
thing is that this is mainly

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:12.860
a sea food restaurant and
Chiang Mai is actually

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:15.130
very, very far from the sea.

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:18.670
So normally I would not chose
to eat sea food in Chiang Mai

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.530
but people from Chiang Mai say this is one

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:23.550
of the greatest restaurants.

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:25.850
Many people really like
highly recommend it

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:29.393
so that's why we're here
and I'm very excited.

00:17:30.484 --> 00:17:32.170
- [Joel] Oh Micah look at that.

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:35.180
- [Mark] Dropped off the
first dish on our table.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.950
It's called (speaking
in a foreign language)

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:39.760
shrimp chili salt.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.550
The entire restaurant
just erupted with garlic

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:43.100
as soon as she set this on the table.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:43.933
Maybe our (speaking in a foreign language)

00:17:43.933 --> 00:17:44.790
is coming right now.

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:57.720
We're about to take a bite of the shrimp

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.670
when she just unleashed
all the other dishes.

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:04.370
The main event of dinner,
the crab stir fried.

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:07.050
It's in Thai (speaking
in a foreign language).

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:12.050
It is crab stir fried with
just heaps of black pepper,

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:13.440
and a heap of garlic.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.883
That looks insane.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:17.870
Okay but let's still
start with the shrimp.

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:19.970
This entire plate there's
only like four prawns

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:22.010
but it's an entire plate.

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:23.830
- [Joel] Look at the size of these guys

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:25.570
- [Mark] And just the herbs and the garlic

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:29.230
and the dude and the caper limes leaves.

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:32.200
Just check out that, check out that.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.990
It fills the entire spoon.

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:36.100
I'm gonna get a chili
on this bite as well,

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.770
sure beats shallots.

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:40.353
(upbeat music)

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:44.483
Wow.

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:51.540
- [Joel] Are you kidding with
the richness of that prawn.

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.360
- And just it's juicy.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.623
It's naturally sweet.

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:58.660
There's so much like
pepper and fried shallots

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:02.140
and all like fried to a crisp
to bring out the fragrance

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:02.973
and the crunch.

00:19:02.973 --> 00:19:06.053
It's literally like a forest
of fried herbs and spices.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.280
Wait we also got that tom
yum, the fire has stopped

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.890
but it was flaming when she brought it.

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:15.460
That just looks like such a
clear just beautiful fish broth.

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:17.430
There's chunks of fish, all the herbs.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:20.605
It's very, very aromatic.

00:19:20.605 --> 00:19:21.984
I'm just gonna taste the broth first.

00:19:21.984 --> 00:19:24.567
(upbeat music)

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.740
That is the, yeah, that's the taste like

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:34.280
just the sharp sourness
from lime juice followed

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.070
by the lemongrass and the
thick caper lime flavor

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:40.500
with the herbs in there and
just the like light fish stock

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.743
but that sourness, they got it right.

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:46.650
I think the only think that
I would've added to this is

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:49.640
a few more of the dry roasted chilis.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.750
Sometimes they toast the dry chilis

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:53.560
and then kind of crush them on
the top of tom yum like this.

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:57.059
That's the only thing like I
would've add but the sourness.

00:19:57.059 --> 00:19:59.150
It's perfect, perfect.

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:01.370
- [Joel] I've been smelling
even though I've been tasting

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:03.870
the dishes, I've been
smelling this the entire time.

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:08.020
- [Mark] The garlic and
pepper crust build up.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.020
It's just solid and the oh these are the

00:20:10.932 --> 00:20:14.103
- [Joel] These are just one
crab piled onto a plate.

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:17.270
Say hello to this guy.

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:18.103
- [Mark] Hello.

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:21.260
- [Joel] Oh and if you
look at the lid of the,

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:22.346
lift up that back

00:20:22.346 --> 00:20:25.430
it's just loaded look at
how much chili and garlic.

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:28.320
- [Mark] Okay let's begin
with these little the drums

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.780
just sprouting and I think in order

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:31.240
to maximize my first bite.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.330
- [Joel] That's for you

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:33.370
Spoon this on top

00:20:34.845 --> 00:20:35.678
Dude.

00:20:35.678 --> 00:20:38.373
- Oh and the green
onions, oh look at that.

00:20:40.353 --> 00:20:42.954
- That is a cheers worthy mega bite.

00:20:42.954 --> 00:20:45.537
(upbeat music)

00:20:57.612 --> 00:21:00.810
- I just got like solid
whole black peppercorns that

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:05.810
just crunch and that crab, it
just is so tender and sweet.

00:21:09.222 --> 00:21:10.730
So you ready for the claws?

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:11.990
- [Joel] Mh-hm.

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:13.590
- [Mark] The claw action

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:14.672
- [Joel] Look at that mountain.

00:21:14.672 --> 00:21:15.703
- [Mark] Dude, that one is huge.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:21.020
Okay now that we peeled
it, we have to reapply.

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:24.730
Just look at this oil, garlic, oh wow,

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:26.860
pepper onto this bite.

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:28.983
That's so much garlic and so much peppers.

00:21:31.163 --> 00:21:33.613
Oh wow I'm afraid of how
delicious this might be.

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:38.373
Right, cheers.

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:59.393
Wow dude that is

00:21:59.393 --> 00:22:02.023
- [Joel] My first kiss
was not as gentle as that.

00:22:03.722 --> 00:22:04.639
Oh my gosh.

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:08.670
- [Mark] Okay we also got
(speaking in a foreign language)

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:10.430
with a little bit of bumac squid in there.

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:13.280
Joel is still in his own
disbelief world right now.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.183
So I'm just gonna quickly
taste the vegetable.

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:21.793
He's still recovering,
recovering from that claw.

00:22:27.099 --> 00:22:27.932
That's one of the greatests.

00:22:27.932 --> 00:22:28.765
It was so good.

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:31.100
Vegetable is nice too.

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:34.220
Nice and like very perfectly salty.

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:35.970
We're just gonna sit here and embrace it

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:38.750
and slowly lick our fingers and spoons

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:40.910
and just devour everything.

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:43.990
What a meal and then I
will catch up with you

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:45.659
as soon as we finish this meal.

00:22:45.659 --> 00:22:48.242
(upbeat music)

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:52.800
Never in all my days did I
dream, I would come to Chiang Mai

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:56.740
to have an excelling sea food meal

00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:58.690
but that has just changed.

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:00.880
That was a superb meal.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.200
It was so good.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.550
It's so unassuming from the front.

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:06.620
That's the shop just a shop house

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:07.990
and it's almost like a museum.

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:09.750
You walk into the front there.

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:12.540
That's actually the
garage with a motorbikes,

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:14.480
then you walk to the
back to the patio area,

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.900
to the river view but he is a chef.

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:20.220
He is a master.

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:21.210
