00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.880
What's up guys welcome back. I'm hanging again with my good friend Brian brushwood. He is the Modern road. Hey, man

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.370
This is Grant thompson. He's the king of random. And today we're playing with some mad science. We've got some drain cleaner

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.149
We've got some aluminum foil. What kind of a reaction will they produce if we mix the two together?

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.759
Why do we have pink balloons? now this chemical drain cleaner

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:19.578
We picked up just came from the local hardware store, and this is not liquid

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:25.009
This is the crystal flakes and if you open it up, you'll see it's actually dry says, "Contains sodium hydroxide"

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:30.520
That's a little terrifying. Alright, so before we even began you shredded a bunch of this aluminum using a paper shredder

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.300
What's the point of doing that? So we did; we got a shredder we put aluminum foil through it and thats treads it up into

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.590
Little tiny pieces, the purpose of doing that is to increase the surface area of the aluminum

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:46.219
It's gonna make our reaction happen a little bit faster. Oh Commander Worf, You look amazing. That's so cool. We got our shredded aluminum

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.428
We've got our drain cleaner all we need now is a little bit of water Oh, we got a little bit of water

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:52.429
So we are ready to rock. Now when you're dealing with chemical reactions

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:55.009
It's not a bad idea to start a little bit smaller and work our way up

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.350
So we're gonna start off with this small glass bottle here

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.640
And if everything goes to plan we can move our way up to one of these things. Alright

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.440
so here's what we want to do. Start off by putting a little bit of your drain cleaner, your sodium

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.580
Hydroxide, into a glass jar, So now we can put in a little bit of our aluminum

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.520
Foil scraps on top and I don't notice I'd say about four times the volume of aluminum

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.820
What chemical reaction are we hoping is about to happen? Because right now

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.840
We've got what lye and aluminum

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.380
Right so, lye is Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) and the aluminum is basically just aluminum metal (AL)

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.070
What we're gonna do is mix in some water, and as we do that the sodium hydroxide is going to dissolve

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.180
And it's gonna react with the aluminum and release hydrogen gas. Right.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.309
And that gas that's being released is the stuff that we're after, and that's why we've got pink balloons

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.810
[I'm feeling ya, i'm feeling ya. ] So we will start off trying to put a little bit of water in the balloon, so stretch the mouth of your

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.100
Balloon over your water bottle got it turn it upside down. [yeah], and put a reasonable amount in there

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.820
It's not gonna hurt us to have more, rather than less. [Right around there?] That looks perfect

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.009
We're gonna fit that over top of the jar now

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.700
And once that is secured you can do the balloon. [Are you ready?] Yep, and it's gonna let the water in

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.760
Boom there goes the water, now watch what happens.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.680
Wow, that's a lot of water

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.059
But you see as the sodium hydroxide dissolves, it reacts with the aluminum and releases hydrogen gas; so all those little bubbles that you're seeing

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.000
right now, are hydrogen, and here's the cool thing give it a little shake and

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.669
Here to see that reaction accelerates dramatically. Oh, this is my favorite part

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.100
Congratulation

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:33.360
Whoa dude check this out! [holy cow holy cow! ] It's going crazy. It's like pumping up. How does that bottle feel now? It's really hot

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.340
it's really really hot that balloon is getting huge how much pressure can take I don't know I think I think we're hey we

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.599
Got a little bit more, but I mean it's it's about to burst okay

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.260
So update guys this reaction just took off after about two minutes to and crazy

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.340
It's hot so hot go ahead pull the balloon off. Don't spell

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.000
oh

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.460
The shame smell all that hydrogen that we just lost

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.040
R.I.P Hydrogen gas

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.220
thats the smell of failure

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.930
Burned my finger tips that was insanely hot okay?

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.139
Well here, take a look at this feel that oh yeah, that is that is really work

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.510
so

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.839
It took about two minutes to small bubbling and then that reaction just took off in an instant that blew and blew up really crazy

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.680
So we got to do that again?

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.450
Well did the big one?

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.800
Will be careful well let's let's get a good first reaction with this one

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.070
That can't be good. That is awesome. I love it. Okay

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.909
So when you stuff that down the reaction just went crazy, right?

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.369
Yeah, cuz I put the aluminum back down in there there. We go okay, [and] then we want to get that reacting against

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.930
We're gonna need to push that back down here

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.320
I think we can just kind of wash like we can put it right into the balloon look at that

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.670
There we go

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.339
[okay], yeah look how fast that reacts wow dude. Oh, it's amazing. You're going dude

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.679
That's fill up fast what we got in this balloon

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.510
Hopefully is hydrogen gas right?

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.260
And we can verify that just by dumping a little bit of dish soap to a bowl of water

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.629
We don't have as much to work with due to our

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.999
all right preview this Op attend an dling [idea] and if we put the neck of the balloon in there and fill it up and

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.389
Slowly let go we should start to generate some bubbles

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.700
whoa, whoa

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.149
So cool guys. We are confirmed. We have hydrogen gas okay. Let's take this up to 11. Let's crank it up

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.969
We are super stoked this idea works. We got hydrogen

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.589
So we're gonna supersize it now with a one gallon juice container a lot more lie in these balloons

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.080
I got out of truck stuff. You're talking about these things right here

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.440
Rook stops they have balloons. All right here we go

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.019
So I'm gonna start off by just pouring a lot more lying there

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.479
It seems like [you] really can't have too much. I would think you could what's going to throw a few handfuls of?

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.999
And we've got our truck stop balloons standing by I have to find a way to hold that on tightly though

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.340
I don't know why they roll these balloons up. That's a little bit

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.430
Hey slippery, so it looks from our last reaction like we got about two minutes before it starts going crazy

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.720
Yeah, but you can tell it's already at least starting right now. You see a problem. Yeah

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.730
Now this is awesome guys

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.870
It's only about 30 seconds, and I already feel the bottom of the glass containers starting to warm up

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.930
You can see the water's gone completely clouded with bubbles

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.009
I was starting to get a slight indication in our balloon that we're collecting some gas

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.289
So I guess really it's just a matter of time because it really did it took two full minutes before the reaction went to high

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.800
Gear yeah, and then it just went crazy at that point so here

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.849
We're definitely collecting some gas as you can see our balloons filling up. You know what I bet

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.689
We filled this one up, and I bet [we] could tie it off and then get another one going. Oh my gosh

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.840
Oh my gosh guys check this out. [it's] going crazy

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.129
It's actually getting really hot the glasses getting hut the balloon is filling up with really hot oh my gosh

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:37.020
Oh, that's two dead. Tell me this is safe. That is amazing here. Let me get another. I'm getting another balloon

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.600
Alright, so this reaction is going great

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.959
Already filled up one balloon, and we have a little bit

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.969
Actually, we still have quite a bit of gas, but it looks like the reaction settling down. Well. It's real good

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.499
Look at that. That is crazy fast this reaction is exothermic it releases heat as it

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.610
Reacts with the aluminum, and you can definitely feel that this glass is so

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.490
Ridiculously warm right out. How does that feel right now, bra? Oh much better now it feels tolerable

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.799
I was afraid that thing was gonna bust open yeah second there

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:13.020
I was amazing so here's the next question if I put a straw into this balloon and slowly let the gas out if I light

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.960
The tip will it keep burning like a torch or the whole thing blow up in my face

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.410
whoa

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:29.640
Hydrogen Torch guys. It's Melly Gonna try this first phasing look at that, whoa

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:37.650
Like a little sodium hydroxide in the morning. Oh that was amazing. It was incredible. That was a fun experiment

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.559
I'm really glad that we tried that today now we had another cool idea

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.840
What if we took this inside where you can see the flames a little bit better? Oh, it's warm that might be steamed. Oh

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.580
That was super fast

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:57.619
[whew] nice, wow dude that's amazing wow

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:12.340
Supercool guys so now you know what happens if you mix crystal drain cleaner with aluminum foil and water yeah

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.179
You get an awesome torch, and you get some nasty slurry. How do you dispose of this stuff?

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.379
So what we're [going] [to] do is dump this in a solution of vinegar because that's going to help neutralize the base

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:24.159
But remember [guys] you are playing with very caustic chemicals these are very dangerous

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.230
They have very strong warning labels

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.650
So if you think about doing any kind of experiments like this make sure you read the warning labels

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:34.359
They're there for a reason so guys if you haven't already go check out my friend Brian Brushwood his links in the description

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.200
He's the modern rug

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:40.210
Yeah, man, check it out me and Jason Murphy are on a quest to become [the] ultimate warrior gentlemen and Scoundrel

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:41.800
You're gonna dig it and us for all of you

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.189
Thanks so much for joining us for this experiment will see in the next one. Talk to you that

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.140
Brian get off your phone. Let's get back to work, right?

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:59.289
That was a super fast no, please note. That was scary his industrial-strength Trucker balloons are amazing

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:09.310
you
