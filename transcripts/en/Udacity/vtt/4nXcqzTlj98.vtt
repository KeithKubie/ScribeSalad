00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.070
Here is that formula written out in Java. Have a close look at the parenthesis.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.165
I was very careful to compute the entire expression, then have parenthesis

00:00:10.165 --> 00:00:16.406
around it, and only then take the integer part of the final answer. Now we are

00:00:16.406 --> 00:00:19.960
almost home free. The red tiles was the same as the pairs and the y tiles as

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.189
the pairs plus one. Here I'm running the program and when I supply the same

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:31.078
inputs as in the example problem, a 100 inches for the width. Tile size of 5,

00:00:31.078 --> 00:00:35.910
then I get the expected answer. Now the important part of this entire exercise

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.235
is to first do it by hand. If you can't do it by hand, you can't program it.

00:00:40.235 --> 00:00:44.141
And doing it by hand gives you valuable intuition that you need to write the

00:00:44.141 --> 00:00:47.988
Java code. You'll get to practice this with another example that Sarah will

00:00:47.988 --> 00:00:48.860
show you.
