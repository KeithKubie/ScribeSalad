00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.120
I'm pleased to know that
our colleagues at MIT

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.790
are reaching out to
people all over the world

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.340
to engage them in this important
discussion about the future

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.240
of work.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.230
We are launching our own
future of work initiative

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.610
here at the ILO.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.850
And this course will fit very
well with our initiative.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.930
Look, I think that our
future of work initiative

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.259
responds to two
essential things.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.820
One's got to do with need.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.830
One's got to do
with opportunity.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.960
The need comes from
the fact, and we're all

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.120
conscious of this in
our everyday lives,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.300
that there is massive
change taking place

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.420
in the world of work,
transformative change at a pace

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.320
and at a depth that
we don't really

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.200
have experience of in the past.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.700
So we think that
we need to study

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.010
these big changes to understand
them better as a way of working

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.080
out what we should do about
them in order to make sure

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.570
that the world of work
responds to the ILO's

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.504
ideas of social justice
fairness of work.

00:01:07.504 --> 00:01:08.920
And then there is
the opportunity.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.544
And the opportunity
comes from the fact

00:01:10.544 --> 00:01:14.410
that in three years
time, in 2019, the ILO

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.840
will celebrate its 100th
birthday, its centenary.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.540
So what better opportunity--

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.910
they don't come round
that frequently--

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.970
what better
opportunity than that

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.350
to have this in depth
reflection about the direction

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.160
that the world of work is taking
and what we can do to shape it,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.080
to move it, towards these
ideals of social justice.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.340
We are proposing
to amend the states

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.450
that they structure their
national dialogues around four

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.600
conversations.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.810
And very quickly, one is to
do with work and society.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.460
Sounds a bit
philosophical, but I

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.880
think there are some really
deep questions out there

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.940
about what work means to
each and every one of us

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.580
in terms of, not only
of earning our living,

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.330
but also of self-realization,
of what our lives mean,

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.490
and how we want to
proceed with them.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.170
Secondly, and it's a most
frequently asked question

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.039
that I at least get
about the future

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.650
is decent work of tomorrow,
the decent jobs of tomorrow.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.760
Where are those
jobs coming from?

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.210
We're having to create 40
million jobs every year

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.910
just to absorb the new people
coming onto the labor markets.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.950
And frankly, we're not able
to do it at the moment.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.570
So we have to be able to discuss
the nature and the origin

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.600
of work in the future.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.070
The third item is about the
organization, the organization

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.440
of work in production.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.490
We're seeing the digital
economy take off.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.300
We're seeing the way that
the internet is mediating

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.860
work in entirely new ways.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.980
Maybe, the enterprise
is going to look

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.210
very different in the future
from what it looks like today.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.060
We're seeing the fragmentation
and globalization

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.690
of production systems
in global supply chains.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.060
We need to understand what
the full implications are

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.417
of this new organization and
global division of labor.

00:03:03.417 --> 00:03:05.750
And the fourth point-- and
this is the culminating point

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.570
of the whole thing.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.660
We have to say, well,
what are the consequences

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.490
of these changes for the ILO's
mandate for social justice?

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.260
How can we shape, manage
all of these changes,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.930
so that we keep the world
moving in this direction

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.120
of social justice?

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.480
So let me end by
encouraging everyone

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.480
to join us in using the ideas
and the information presented

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.690
in this course to improve
the future of work

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.820
for people all around the world.
