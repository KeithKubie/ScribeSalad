00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.320
The polynomial reducability of one
problem to another is a relation,

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.180
much like the at most relation that
you've seen since elementary school.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.390
And while it doesn't have
all the same properties,

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.510
it does have the important
property of transitivity.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.080
Like the traditional at most sign for
integers or real numbers,

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.580
the polynomial reducability sign is
transitive, meaning that if A is

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.130
reducable to B and B is reducible to C,
then A is reducible to C.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.460
For example, we've seen how independent
set is reducible to vertex cover, and

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.380
I claim that vertex cover is reducible
to Hamiltonian path, a problem closely

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.160
related to the traveling salesman
problem, and from these facts,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.580
it follows that independent set
is reducible to Hamiltonian path.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.020
Let's take a look at
the proof of this theorem.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.860
We'll let M be the program
that reduces A to B,

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.480
and we'll let N be the program
that reduces B to C.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.520
To turn an instance of the problem
A into an instance of the problem C

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.870
we just pass it through M and
then pass that result through N.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.610
This whole process can be thought of
as another computable function, R.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.500
Note that like M and N,
R is polynomial-time.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.160
Thus x is in A if, and
only if, M of x is in B.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.330
Remember, M implements that reduction.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.180
And m of x is in B if and

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.390
only if N of M of x is in C because
N implements that reduction.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.170
The composition of N and
M is the reduction R so

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.870
overall we have the x is in A if and
only if R is in C, just as we want.
