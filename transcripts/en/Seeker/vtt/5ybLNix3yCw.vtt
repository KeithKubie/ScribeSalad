00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.901
The ancestor of the rhinoceros evolved in
India 55 millions years ago, millions of their

00:00:04.901 --> 00:00:07.210
kin spread across Africa and Asia.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.879
But today, they're almost all gone, because
some think one part of their body is worth

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:14.469
killing for.

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.720
Hey DNewsers.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.860
Trace here.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.960
Rhino horn has been valued since antiquity
for use as a medium for handles, and carvings

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.070
-- it's widely loved for it's beauty.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.550
In 1597, Li Shih-chen wrote a medical paper
stating rhino horn was a cure-all for "keeping

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.750
away evil spirits and miasmas," for "poisoning,"
to keep away nightmares and hallucinations,

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.510
for typhoid, fevers, colds, convulsions, dysentery,
vomiting, arthritis, melancholia, loss of

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.080
the voice and so on.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.640
But Li Shih-chen didn't add scientific evidence
into this document.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.649
It was used for thousands of years in Traditional
Chinese Medicine until in 1993, Rhino horn

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:57.191
was outlawed, and, according to TCM expert
Lixin Huang, it "was never used alone," and

00:00:57.191 --> 00:00:58.579
always with herbs.

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.370
After the ban, they came up with alternatives
that allegedly did the same thing.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.009
Today, despite these bans, some in Vietnam
believe the horn can assuage hangovers and

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.409
headaches and even cure cancer.

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.180
Because of this, a single 3 kilo horn can
be worth 300,000 dollars there.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.409
That's more than gold!

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.260
What is WRONG with people?

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.009
Because it's been banned, there's not a lot
of data on whether the horn IS any kind of

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.630
medicine or not.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.749
Most cite a single human study done with the
horn claiming it didn't work any better than

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:30.310
aspirin at curing headaches.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.549
To figure out whether there was any basis
to it being a cure-all.

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.469
I looked up studies of the construction and
composition of rhino horn.

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:42.899
One by the Zoological Society of London analyzed
the chemicals in rhino horn, finding its highly

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.359
determined by what that rhino eats over its
lifetime.

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:47.439
They're all different!

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.109
Some eat succulents, others eat grasses, so
each horn is unique.

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:56.280
Also, a study out of Ohio State, scanned and
broke down the horns, finding exactly what

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.099
the structures looked like, noting they were
mostly constructed of Keratin, with a calcium

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:06.020
and melanin core so they got harder as it's
sharpened from use in battle with other rhinos,

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.630
like a big pencil.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.630
Cool!

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.950
They called it a "cornified papillary epidermal
appendage" and classified it as similar to

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.569
bird beaks, hair, fingernails, and skin-based
structures; the horns are really similar to

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.230
the construction of hooves.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.780
Now, if the horn is made of regular old calcium,
nitrogen, carbon and such found in nature…

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.510
and is basically keratin, could that keratin
have medicinal benefit?

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.780
The Journal of Anatomy: analyzed every type
of keratin….

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.060
Checking out the pH, structure, atomic polarization
and handedness, molecular weight, chemical

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.180
characteristics, genetic basis, source, evolution
and even association with culture… bringing

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.540
us full circle.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.280
The closest mention of medicine was in keratin
K23, where it could be used to treat pancreatic

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.260
cancer, but that's not found in rhino, but
in the human pancreas.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.860
In extensive studies of keratin as a biomaterial
for medical applications, no one has yet found

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.250
anything I could turn up to turn keratin into
medicine.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.200
That being said, studies in China found rhino
horn had statistically significant pharmacological

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.900
effects, on inflammation, pain-relief, and
a bunch of other things.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.409
But according to the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:25.489
and Flora, their results couldn't be replicated
in studies done in the UK or South Africa.

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.280
So, maybe it's just a placebo.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.920
Which means it's not the rhino horn at all,
but raw human belief that it makes us "better."

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.860
We've done plenty of videos on the placebo
effect, and it's power.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.209
Perhaps people in Vietnam believe it works,
and thus it works for them, but so far the

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.579
for-profit biomedical industry has yet to
find proof of it.

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:48.109
And if Rhino Horn did have a medical benefit,
we'd have found it, synthesized it, and be

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:50.879
selling its effects in Western Medicine too.

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:55.629
Within 10 years, there will be no more of
this animal in the wild, ever again on this

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:56.629
planet.

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:59.550
We humans will have made these species extinct.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.499
We did this.

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:03.720
But maybe we can stop its extinction with
3-D printing!

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.730
I know it sounds crazy, but my friend Laura
Ling visited a company where they want to

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.280
try and 3D print replacement horns for the
rhino to try and save them.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.530
It's weird, but fascinating.

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.520
Check it out.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:33.510
What do you think?

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:40.270
How can we save this incredible and ancient
animal?

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.950
Any ideas?
