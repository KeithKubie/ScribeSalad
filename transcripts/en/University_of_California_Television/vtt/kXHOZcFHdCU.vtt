00:00:05.506 --> 00:00:08.093
(tense piano music)

00:00:08.093 --> 00:00:09.450
(upbeat piano music)

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.450
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.923
Bipedal, naked, large-brained.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.713
Long the master of fire,
tools and language.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.023
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.913
Aware that death is inevitable.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.883
Yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.243
We grow up slowly, we hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.893
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.020
We shape the future

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.693
from our shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.160
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.793
to exchange insights on who we are

00:00:52.793 --> 00:00:54.703
and how we got here.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.950
An exploration made
possible by the generosity

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.737
of humans like you.

00:01:15.412 --> 00:01:17.995
(upbeat music)

00:01:20.823 --> 00:01:24.323
(upbeat electronic music)

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.860
- So I'd like you to raise your hand

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.460
if someone in your life, a
young person in your life

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.560
often looks like this.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.070
So maybe it's a child, a grandchild,

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.910
the person in the line
for coffee in font of you.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.836
Okay, you're not alone.

00:01:47.836 --> 00:01:51.070
Meet this generation of
digital natives, right?

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.600
So we've heard that term.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.440
Generation of young people
that were born, you know,

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.600
without knowing a time
before the internet.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.410
So I'm a digital immigrant,
I won't ask you to identify

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.400
if you are not, but I remember
a world without the internet.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.502
And having to learn how to
integrate the digital world

00:02:08.502 --> 00:02:11.660
into how I work, how I communicate

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.520
and that's a very different space

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.380
that our kids are growing up in now.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.920
So in the digital age
the one thing we do know

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.610
is that the young people
among us are early adopters,

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.890
they're enthusiastic
adopters of new technologies.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.080
Here's some data just from 2004.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.070
We started following kids
around on their mobile devices

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.270
around 2007 and this just
shows you some of the changes

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.600
we saw during that time.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.240
2018 is the last time for which we have

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.520
a representative sample
and 95% of adolescents

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.491
now how access to a mobile device.

00:02:45.491 --> 00:02:49.710
They're on them quite a lot and
so a recent survey showed us

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.130
that tweens, those are
eight to 12 year olds,

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.130
they're on 4.36 hours and this
is just for media screen time

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.380
so this doesn't count
screen time for homework

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.320
or other activities, right?

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.840
And teens, at 6.4 hours a day,

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.180
so almost 6.5 hours a day and
I want you to hold the number

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.410
in your mind, that's the three hours more

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.900
per day that children
from low income households

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.780
are on the screen.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.320
So there's a huge difference

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.356
in screen time based on the
income level of your family.

00:03:24.356 --> 00:03:27.510
So we have a sample of about
2,000 young adolescents

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.360
we've been following and
these are some data on them.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.180
This is just them across age.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.010
So on the bottom of the
screen you'll see age here,

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.350
from 11 to 15 and you'll
see if the young people

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.560
in your life are around 11 years old,

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.510
about 48% of their peers
own a mobile device, right?

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.734
As we get older in our sample,

00:03:48.734 --> 00:03:51.830
we get up here to almost full saturation.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.080
This line up here is access
to the internet at home.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.650
So something we used to worry
a lot about in education

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.050
was a digital divide.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.000
So some kids not having
access to the internet,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.660
that's no longer true.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.560
And smartphone use is actually higher

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.913
among children from lower income families.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.700
So we don't see that
traditional digital divide.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.850
We see few differences in
mobile device ownership

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.490
by socio-economic status
but as I'm gonna show you,

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:22.510
we see differences in
experiences it may be affects.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.980
So what is this all mean?

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.290
You probably, if you pick up a paper,

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.601
probably today or tomorrow,
you'll read some story

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:32.810
about how digital devices are
ruining our children, right?

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.105
Smartphones are destroying a generation.

00:04:35.105 --> 00:04:38.400
Recently we had a number of
psychologists sign a letter,

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.502
an open letter to Apple,
demanding that tech companies

00:04:41.502 --> 00:04:44.820
end their addictive
practices toward our children

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.900
based on evidence, they said,

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.500
that smartphones are
making our children lonely,

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.400
depressed, suicidal, right?

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.610
Stealing things from them,
these are big claims.

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:56.920
These are big claims.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.560
So is this constant connection,
is it harmful to our kids?

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.900
And I'm gonna show you
two pieces of evidence.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.230
The first one is from a team in Britain.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.470
Now they've assembled
large amasses of data,

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.570
on hundreds of thousands of adolescents.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.360
Now these are surveys, so
just correlational research

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.500
asking kids to report on the amount

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.350
of time they're on their devices

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.410
and their mental health problems, right?

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.310
And I'll show you a graph here

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.440
but the thing to focus
on is just this pattern,

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.580
a Goldilocks effect, right?

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.680
So here are the kids that
are not on screen time at all

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.850
in the day, here are the kids
in those one or two hours

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.570
and then here's kind of a deterioration

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.070
of wellbeing across time, right?

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.070
So described as the Goldilocks effects,

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.830
the kids that are on not at all

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.390
don't look so great on mental health.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.738
The kids in the one to two hour range,

00:05:42.738 --> 00:05:44.900
you know, look good and
then out on the lower ends

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.600
of the tail, or the
higher ends of the tail,

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.610
those kids are experiencing some problems.

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.410
Now remember, this is correlational.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.040
The other thing to remember is that,

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.210
these data and all the
data that are presented,

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.500
including the data where people argue

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.370
that smartphones are causing
mental health problems,

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.490
these actually explain less
than 1% of the differences

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.890
between kids and their mental health.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:13.450
So said in other way, 99.5% of the reasons

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.410
that kids are different than each other

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:16.500
on their mental health problems

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.530
is due to something other
than screen time, right?

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.090
These same authors took
other variables they measured

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.450
in the data chips, or chips, in the data,

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.160
including potato chips,
eating potato chips,

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.810
higher correlation than
screen time, right?

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.670
Eating breakfast, 14 times
higher than scree time, right?

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.470
So just a word of caution.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:38.680
Now we took a different approach.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.360
We've been following
kids and their phones.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.900
So we had the advantage of
not necessarily comparing kids

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.620
to each other, so the kid
who's on zero hours a day

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.060
and a kid who's on five hours a day.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.860
They look very different on things

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.220
other than screen time, right?

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.490
Their parents probably have them

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.770
in a very different
structured environment,

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:56.830
lots of things are different.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.330
So we looked and followed
the same kids overtime

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:01.820
and asked the question,

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.902
on days when Sally is using screens a lot,

00:07:04.902 --> 00:07:06.900
what does her cognition look like?

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.120
What does her mental health look like?

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.410
What does her sleep look like?

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:10.840
And days when she's using less.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.823
So we used her as her own control.

00:07:13.697 --> 00:07:16.610
This is a study done by Mikey
Jensen, one of my post-docs

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.190
and this is in North Carolina,

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.052
this is a state of North Carolina.

00:07:20.052 --> 00:07:21.760
Each one of those red dots

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.020
is where a family in our study lives

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.180
of the 2,000 kids and 400 of those kids

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.980
we've followed intensively
on their phones.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.030
So every day they're reporting to us

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:31.914
on how much they're using their devices,

00:07:31.914 --> 00:07:33.610
their mental health, et cetera.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.573
And we find very few associations

00:07:36.573 --> 00:07:40.298
between how much they're using,
their mental health, right?

00:07:40.298 --> 00:07:42.715
And where we do find signal,

00:07:42.715 --> 00:07:44.840
is actually in the opposite direction.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.680
So days that they're
more closely connected

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.290
to their friends on family online

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:50.060
are days that they're
less lonely and depressed.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.429
But again, really small effects.

00:07:52.429 --> 00:07:54.610
We've been interested in this,

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.610
we've been using digital technology

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:57.890
and mobile phones as a tool

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.660
to study adolescents' mental health

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.670
and we first started in this area,

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:04.040
parents were asking for us advice, right?

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:04.980
It's scary, right?

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.680
It's scary to have an
adolescent period, right?

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.860
It's scary to have them glued
to their phone all the time.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.617
And so what we wanted to
dig a little deeper in was,

00:08:14.617 --> 00:08:16.900
what are the fears, right?

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.050
That parents have and what's the science,

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:20.900
what do we really know, right?

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.780
And then what's the narrative.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.970
So we went through and we
identified these seven fears

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:28.540
that parents and adults have
when they see young people

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.110
walking around on their devices

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.090
and then we went to the
scientific literature

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.266
and we started to examine,
what do we actually know

00:08:35.266 --> 00:08:36.880
about the effects.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.750
And here, I won't have time
to go into them all today

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.617
but I'll just summarize
with a couple of messages.

00:08:42.617 --> 00:08:47.617
In most cases we found mixed
results, we need more data.

00:08:47.893 --> 00:08:51.870
But in the majority of cases
we actually found evidence

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:53.500
for positive effects, right?

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.014
So kids that were most connected online

00:08:56.014 --> 00:08:58.500
were also most connected offline.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.490
If there were signs of vulnerability,

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:01.820
bullying et cetera offline,

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:05.260
those kids were also
experiencing problems online.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:09.043
So it was a bit of a mirror
between online and offline life.

00:09:09.043 --> 00:09:10.880
Parent time.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.040
So it was displacing time
you'd spend with parents.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.670
But it wasn't impacting
the relationship, right?

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:19.510
Where we do find some negative effects,

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:20.970
is in multitasking, right?

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.420
So Paula mentioned that before,

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.130
we need to keep your eye on that.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.300
And sleep is critically important, right?

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.470
So there is no question
that being on your phone

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:31.310
late at night, which many kids are

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:33.363
is impairing sleep in important ways.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.114
But when we published these results

00:09:36.114 --> 00:09:38.660
people were angry, right?

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.530
Parents were angry at us.

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:42.100
We were saying that, you know,

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.507
there are these things that
are happening with our kids

00:09:44.507 --> 00:09:46.500
are they the things we'd be worried about?

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.120
But we don't think the
phone is the problem, right?

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.920
And this wasn't a popular message

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.670
and in the discussion section
you guys can yell at me then,

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:55.620
I'm used to it now.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.193
I wasn't ready for it
here but I'm ready now.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.290
And so what we asked
is, what are the risks?

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:04.440
What are the risks of assuming
that phones are to blame

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.020
for these really important
problems facing our kids

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:10.690
versus taking a more holistic view.

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:13.770
Now, Paula did a wonderful job
of asking this question of,

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:15.100
rewiring the brain?

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:19.070
And Lea showed us signs of
developmental plasticity

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:21.630
in the brain and this has been the focus

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.210
of extreme attention right now, right?

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:28.253
So headlines, are smartphones
rewiring the brain?

00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:32.060
And again, this isn't
a new concern, right?

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:35.210
Whether tools are impacting
the brain in some way?

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:39.560
This is from The New York
Times in the 1904 right?

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.710
Concern that these race car drivers

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:44.193
might have a different brain, right?

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.530
We've seen concern, we see
fears of new technologies.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:52.310
We saw this with writing,
people starting to write,

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:55.233
this is going to impair our
ability to remember things.

00:10:56.932 --> 00:11:00.610
With kids, we've seen
this with numerous things.

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:03.200
We've seen it with the
introduction of romance novels,

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.370
the introduction of public libraries,

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:10.120
rock 'n' roll, things that
kids are doing we don't like.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.570
My husband started to complain
about this and I said,

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:14.500
stop complaining because
I think this means

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.408
that we're not kids anymore.

00:11:16.408 --> 00:11:19.510
(audience laughing)

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:20.780
Kids these days.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.290
So this is Scientific American.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:24.500
Are smartphones really
destroying the adolescent brain?

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.730
And I think that this
is an important question

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.620
of how the brain has become rewired,

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.350
how we're learning language
differently, et cetera.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.204
There's a recent article that showed,

00:11:33.204 --> 00:11:36.870
in fact digital technology
use and thumb movement

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:40.050
can we trace differences in
this on a day to day level

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:42.800
to cortical activity based on the EEG

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.810
and those are important questions

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:46.910
but I think maybe they're
the wrong ones right now

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:48.950
if we're thinking about
out kids' wellbeing.

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:52.020
I think the questions
that we need to be asking

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.330
are how are these tools used,

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.630
how are we scaffolding
and how are we engaging

00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:59.520
with these new technologies with our kids

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.640
and optimizing them for their
potential and their future.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.536
So we wrote recently that smart phones,

00:12:05.536 --> 00:12:08.239
they might be bad for some teens, right?

00:12:08.239 --> 00:12:13.239
But not for all and if we take
you back to that initial data

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:15.980
that I've showed you, children
in low income households

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.680
spending on average three more hours a day

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.350
on their phone than kids in
more affluent households,

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:22.573
it's not just a time different,

00:12:22.573 --> 00:12:25.370
it's what you're doing online, right?

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:29.010
So higher income households,
more likely to be using

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:31.830
digital technologies for
educational purposes,

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:33.860
looking up information, right?

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:37.040
Lower income households,
less parental involvement,

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.590
less adult involvement, on average

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:43.280
in scaffolding those behaviors
and building digital literacy

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.472
and the other things we
know our kids are gonna need

00:12:45.472 --> 00:12:47.713
if the future is in fact digital.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.890
In our study we found that children

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:53.280
in disadvantaged households,
they actually experience

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.470
more spillover from social media.

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:57.710
So something that happens on social media,

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:01.020
actually they report results
in an offline problem,

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.930
a fight, an argument,
trouble at school, right?

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:05.750
So it may not just be
different experiences,

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:07.250
it might be different effects

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:09.490
for kids that are the most vulnerable.

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:11.604
So as we look into the future,

00:13:11.604 --> 00:13:16.530
it's really not so much about
the effect of the tool, right?

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:20.010
The access to these tools
is equaling out, right?

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:21.768
Kids have access to computers,

00:13:21.768 --> 00:13:26.030
kids have access to smartphones
across socio-economic status

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:29.520
but the types of experiences
they're having online,

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.310
the type of help that they're getting

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:32.980
to ensure that they build the skills

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.200
in an online world, for an online future

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.100
are very different and it's possible

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.840
that there might be more negative effects

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.020
for certain populations of children.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:42.770
So I'd encourage us as we kind of look

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:45.740
towards supporting children
in the digital world,

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.930
that we look past some of the headlines,

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:49.700
some of the fears that we have.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:53.200
Some of the reasons that we
don't like the technology itself

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.690
and for parents who
report the biggest sources

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:58.840
of conflict in their home is fights over

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.870
how long their kid is on the device.

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:02.770
And I screamed at my child yesterday

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:04.690
for this and caught myself.

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:06.821
So instead of focusing on the time limits

00:14:06.821 --> 00:14:08.840
focus on what they're doing.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.950
Take some time, spend
some time with them there.

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:14.160
And we're entering to a whole new world

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.480
as our homes get smarter, right?

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:20.770
So here's a little boy
talking to his Alexa, right?

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:22.780
And I'm sure we'll have
a lively discussion

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:26.020
of what it means to have Alexa
rising our children soon.

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:27.833
So thank you for your attention.

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:30.610
And for the opportunity.

00:14:31.566 --> 00:14:34.876
(audience applauding)

00:14:34.876 --> 00:14:37.459
(upbeat music)
