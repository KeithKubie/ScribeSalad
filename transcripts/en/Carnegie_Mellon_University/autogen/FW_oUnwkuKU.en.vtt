because I really wanted to understand
 

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.400
because I really wanted to understand
how molecules work and I wanted to

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:37.410
how molecules work and I wanted to
 

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:38.809
how molecules work and I wanted to
understand something about the

that that as I'll explain to you here

that that as I'll explain to you here
 

00:12:01.259 --> 00:12:03.079
that that as I'll explain to you here
shortly that's really how I got into

shortly that's really how I got into
 

00:12:03.089 --> 00:12:05.449

something that even you know ten years

00:12:10.879 --> 00:12:10.889
something that even you know ten years
 

00:12:10.889 --> 00:12:13.069
something that even you know ten years
ago or so just a handful of labs around

00:12:13.069 --> 00:12:13.079
ago or so just a handful of labs around
 

00:12:13.079 --> 00:12:15.769
ago or so just a handful of labs around
the world were investigating and I think

00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:15.779
the world were investigating and I think
 

00:12:15.779 --> 00:12:18.319
the world were investigating and I think
the story really starts with the

00:12:18.319 --> 00:12:18.329
the story really starts with the
 

00:12:18.329 --> 00:12:20.840
the story really starts with the
discovery of the structure of DNA when I

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:20.850
discovery of the structure of DNA when I
 

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:22.539
discovery of the structure of DNA when I
think about you know if we think about

00:12:22.539 --> 00:12:22.549
think about you know if we think about
 

00:12:22.549 --> 00:12:25.100
think about you know if we think about
gene editing certainly it begins with

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:25.110
gene editing certainly it begins with
 

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:27.559
gene editing certainly it begins with
understanding the the double helix of

00:12:27.559 --> 00:12:27.569
understanding the the double helix of
 

00:12:27.569 --> 00:12:29.569
understanding the the double helix of
DNA which was of course reported back in

00:12:29.569 --> 00:12:29.579
DNA which was of course reported back in
 

00:12:29.579 --> 00:12:32.389
DNA which was of course reported back in
the 1950s but this also is kind of the

00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399
the 1950s but this also is kind of the
 

00:12:32.399 --> 00:12:34.429
the 1950s but this also is kind of the
interesting beginning of my own story in

00:12:34.429 --> 00:12:34.439
interesting beginning of my own story in
 

00:12:34.439 --> 00:12:37.549
interesting beginning of my own story in
science because I was given a copy of

00:12:37.549 --> 00:12:37.559
science because I was given a copy of
 

00:12:37.559 --> 00:12:39.349
science because I was given a copy of
James Watson's famous book the double

00:12:39.349 --> 00:12:39.359
James Watson's famous book the double
 

00:12:39.359 --> 00:12:42.409
James Watson's famous book the double
helix back when I was probably in middle

00:12:42.409 --> 00:12:42.419
helix back when I was probably in middle
 

00:12:42.419 --> 00:12:45.730
helix back when I was probably in middle
school and when I got that book

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:45.740
school and when I got that book
 

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.760
school and when I got that book
I read it and was kind of had my mind

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:48.770
I read it and was kind of had my mind
 

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:51.250
I read it and was kind of had my mind
blown by by understanding how scientists

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:51.260
blown by by understanding how scientists
 

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:55.000
blown by by understanding how scientists
could have an idea and do experiments to

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:55.010
could have an idea and do experiments to
 

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:57.430
could have an idea and do experiments to
figure out something even as complicated

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:57.440
figure out something even as complicated
 

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.940
figure out something even as complicated
and tiny as the structure of DNA and it

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:00.950
and tiny as the structure of DNA and it
 

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:03.100
and tiny as the structure of DNA and it
really kind of gave me the idea that

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:03.110
really kind of gave me the idea that
 

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:04.900
really kind of gave me the idea that
that was the kind of thing I wanted to

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:04.910
that was the kind of thing I wanted to
 

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:06.610
that was the kind of thing I wanted to
do with my life I wanted to spend my

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:06.620
do with my life I wanted to spend my
 

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:10.210
do with my life I wanted to spend my
life doing that kind of experimentation

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:10.220
life doing that kind of experimentation
 

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.860
life doing that kind of experimentation
I didn't know exactly what but I knew

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:11.870
I didn't know exactly what but I knew
 

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:13.900
I didn't know exactly what but I knew
that that was sort of very captivating

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:13.910
that that was sort of very captivating
 

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:16.990
that that was sort of very captivating
to me and so then I went off to I went

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:17.000
to me and so then I went off to I went
 

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.020
to me and so then I went off to I went
off to to college and I was actually a

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:20.030
off to to college and I was actually a
 

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:22.690
off to to college and I was actually a
chemistry major in college with a focus

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:22.700
chemistry major in college with a focus
 

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.240
chemistry major in college with a focus
on biochemistry and we were taught the

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:25.250
on biochemistry and we were taught the
 

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:28.540
on biochemistry and we were taught the
the central dogma of biology and my in

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:28.550
the central dogma of biology and my in
 

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:29.800
the central dogma of biology and my in
the one sort of you know it sort of

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:29.810
the one sort of you know it sort of
 

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:31.660
the one sort of you know it sort of
introductory biology course that I took

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:31.670
introductory biology course that I took
 

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:34.180
introductory biology course that I took
which is shown right here which is the

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:34.190
which is shown right here which is the
 

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:36.820
which is shown right here which is the
idea that cells encode genetic

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:36.830
idea that cells encode genetic
 

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:39.370
idea that cells encode genetic
information in DNA that's the importance

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:39.380
information in DNA that's the importance
 

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:42.010
information in DNA that's the importance
of understanding its structure and that

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:42.020
of understanding its structure and that
 

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:45.180
of understanding its structure and that
that information that's encoded is is

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:45.190
that information that's encoded is is
 

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:48.340
that information that's encoded is is
conveyed to the cell and is sort of

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:48.350
conveyed to the cell and is sort of
 

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:50.800
conveyed to the cell and is sort of
implemented through a process that

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:50.810
implemented through a process that
 

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:53.950
implemented through a process that
involves copying DNA into molecules of

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:53.960
involves copying DNA into molecules of
 

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:57.490
involves copying DNA into molecules of
RNA and then and then translating those

00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:57.500
RNA and then and then translating those
 

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.520
RNA and then and then translating those
RNA molecules if they're messenger RNAs

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:00.530
RNA molecules if they're messenger RNAs
 

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:03.430
RNA molecules if they're messenger RNAs
mRNAs into proteins and that the

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:03.440
mRNAs into proteins and that the
 

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.740
mRNAs into proteins and that the
proteins do all of the interesting

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:05.750
proteins do all of the interesting
 

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.630
proteins do all of the interesting
things in the cell so you know when I

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:07.640
things in the cell so you know when I
 

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.190
things in the cell so you know when I
sort of grew up in science I thought

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:09.200
sort of grew up in science I thought
 

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.750
sort of grew up in science I thought
well DNA is really interesting because

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:10.760
well DNA is really interesting because
 

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.300
well DNA is really interesting because
it's the code and proteins are really

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:13.310
it's the code and proteins are really
 

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:15.160
it's the code and proteins are really
interesting because they're the the

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:15.170
interesting because they're the the
 

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:17.440
interesting because they're the the
actors but in the middle is this kind of

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:17.450
actors but in the middle is this kind of
 

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:18.700
actors but in the middle is this kind of
boring you know

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:18.710
boring you know
 

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:21.070
boring you know
throwaway copy of the genome called RNA

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:21.080
throwaway copy of the genome called RNA
 

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.400
throwaway copy of the genome called RNA
and I never paid much attention to it

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:23.410
and I never paid much attention to it
 

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:26.340
and I never paid much attention to it
but interestingly enough when I got into

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:26.350
but interestingly enough when I got into
 

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:28.930
but interestingly enough when I got into
graduate school I had the good fortune

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:28.940
graduate school I had the good fortune
 

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:31.090
graduate school I had the good fortune
to make my way to the lab of Jack

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:31.100
to make my way to the lab of Jack
 

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.280
to make my way to the lab of Jack

szostak and in the at the time he was a
 

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:35.440
szostak and in the at the time he was a
he was actually a yeast geneticist he

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:35.450
he was actually a yeast geneticist he
 

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:38.170
he was actually a yeast geneticist he
was studying recombination of DNA but he

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:38.180
was studying recombination of DNA but he
 

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:40.480
was studying recombination of DNA but he
told me when I came to his lab as a

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:40.490
told me when I came to his lab as a
 

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:41.860
told me when I came to his lab as a
first-year graduate student he said well

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:41.870
first-year graduate student he said well
 

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:44.140

actually I've gotten very interested in

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:44.150
actually I've gotten very interested in
 

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:47.320
actually I've gotten very interested in
the origin of life and I want to

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:47.330
the origin of life and I want to
 

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:50.020
the origin of life and I want to
understand how RNA molecules might have

understand how RNA molecules might have
 

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:52.450
understand how RNA molecules might have
been involved in the very early steps

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:52.460
been involved in the very early steps
 

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.360
been involved in the very early steps
that gave rise to life as we know it on

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:55.370
that gave rise to life as we know it on
 

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:55.570
that gave rise to life as we know it on
earth

and so that

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:57.180
and so that
 

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.210
and so that
really set the stage for what I've ended

00:14:59.210 --> 00:14:59.220
really set the stage for what I've ended
 

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.340
really set the stage for what I've ended
up kind of thinking about in a way for

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:01.350
up kind of thinking about in a way for
 

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.950
up kind of thinking about in a way for
my whole career which is the functions

career thinking about the molecular
 

00:15:13.589 --> 00:15:15.470
career thinking about the molecular
structures of RNA and we were in those

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:15.480
structures of RNA and we were in those
 

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.470
structures of RNA and we were in those
days focused on catalytic RNA so RNA

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480
days focused on catalytic RNA so RNA
 

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.000

when I moved my laboratory so I started

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:26.250
when I moved my laboratory so I started
 

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:29.090
when I moved my laboratory so I started
my professional life at Yale University

my professional life at Yale University
 

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:32.630
my professional life at Yale University
as a assistant professor and then I was

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:32.640
as a assistant professor and then I was
 

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.579
as a assistant professor and then I was
recruited away to Berkeley eight years

00:15:34.579 --> 00:15:34.589
recruited away to Berkeley eight years
 

00:15:34.589 --> 00:15:37.329
recruited away to Berkeley eight years
later and when I moved to UC Berkeley I

00:15:37.329 --> 00:15:37.339
later and when I moved to UC Berkeley I
 

00:15:37.339 --> 00:15:40.460
later and when I moved to UC Berkeley I
really wanted to start studying the ways

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:40.470
really wanted to start studying the ways
 

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:43.150
really wanted to start studying the ways
that RNA molecules control the flow of

that RNA molecules control the flow of
 

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.800
that RNA molecules control the flow of
genetic information in cells and we we

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:45.810
genetic information in cells and we we
 

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:48.019
genetic information in cells and we we
were in those days working on very tiny

00:15:48.019 --> 00:15:48.029
were in those days working on very tiny
 

00:15:48.029 --> 00:15:50.930
were in those days working on very tiny
pieces of RNA called micro RNAs that are

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:50.940
pieces of RNA called micro RNAs that are
 

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.720
pieces of RNA called micro RNAs that are
made by animal and plant cells where

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:53.730
made by animal and plant cells where
 

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:57.650
made by animal and plant cells where
they perform roles in defending plants

00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:57.660
they perform roles in defending plants
 

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.870
they perform roles in defending plants
in particular against viruses and in

sorts of different interesting pathways
 

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.510
sorts of different interesting pathways
and so we were as biochemists studying

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:11.520
and so we were as biochemists studying
 

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.300
and so we were as biochemists studying

how these very tiny micro rna's are made
 

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:16.940
how these very tiny micro rna's are made
and how they're able to act in

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:16.950
and how they're able to act in
 

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:19.699
and how they're able to act in
conjunction with proteins to control the

got me into inter crispers because I was
 

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.480
got me into inter crispers because I was
sitting in my office at Berkeley one day

what that might be and we met up to to

00:17:23.699 --> 00:17:23.709
what that might be and we met up to to
 

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:26.130
what that might be and we met up to to
discuss this and it turned out that she

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:26.140
discuss this and it turned out that she
 

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.799
discuss this and it turned out that she
had come across a number of examples of

had come across a number of examples of
 

00:17:28.809 --> 00:17:32.250
had come across a number of examples of
very unusual DNA sequences in the

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:32.260
very unusual DNA sequences in the

what these are is a pattern of DNA

00:17:52.919 --> 00:17:52.929
what these are is a pattern of DNA

idea what they might be doing and the
 

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:40.770
idea what they might be doing and the
reason these were started to be of

bioinformatics teams had published
 

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:50.730
bioinformatics teams had published
papers that pointed out that in many of

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:50.740
papers that pointed out that in many of
 

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.919
papers that pointed out that in many of
these CRISPR arrays and bacterial

00:18:52.919 --> 00:18:52.929
these CRISPR arrays and bacterial
 

00:18:52.929 --> 00:18:55.950
these CRISPR arrays and bacterial
genomes there were sequences in these

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:55.960
genomes there were sequences in these
 

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.289
genomes there were sequences in these
these these what are called spacer

00:18:58.289 --> 00:18:58.299
these these what are called spacer
 

00:18:58.299 --> 00:19:00.299
these these what are called spacer
sequences between the repeats that

00:19:00.299 --> 00:19:00.309
sequences between the repeats that
 

00:19:00.309 --> 00:19:03.030
sequences between the repeats that
corresponded to DNA sequences from

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:03.040
corresponded to DNA sequences from
 

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:06.720
corresponded to DNA sequences from
viruses that infect these bacteria so it

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:06.730
viruses that infect these bacteria so it
 

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.060
viruses that infect these bacteria so it
was the first hint that these might

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:09.070
was the first hint that these might
 

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:11.100
was the first hint that these might
actually represent some kind of an

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:11.110
actually represent some kind of an
 

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:13.620

adaptive immune system in bugs some way
 

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:16.440
adaptive immune system in bugs some way
that bugs could acquire DNA sequences

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:16.450
that bugs could acquire DNA sequences
 

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:19.260
that bugs could acquire DNA sequences
from viruses and store them in these

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:19.270
from viruses and store them in these
 

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:23.010
from viruses and store them in these
arrays and then somehow possibly use

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:23.020
arrays and then somehow possibly use
 

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:24.990
arrays and then somehow possibly use
to protect cells from future viral

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:25.000
to protect cells from future viral
 

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.120
to protect cells from future viral
infection and what was intriguing about

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:27.130
infection and what was intriguing about
 

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:29.040
infection and what was intriguing about
these arrays was that they didn't occur

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:29.050
these arrays was that they didn't occur
 

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:31.800
these arrays was that they didn't occur
in isolation they were actually found in

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:31.810
in isolation they were actually found in
 

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:35.700
in isolation they were actually found in
close proximity to genes these were DNA

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:35.710
close proximity to genes these were DNA
 

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:37.530
close proximity to genes these were DNA
sequences that were known to encode

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:37.540
sequences that were known to encode
 

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:40.380
sequences that were known to encode
proteins that were CRISPR associated or

proteins that were CRISPR associated or
 

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:42.420
proteins that were CRISPR associated or
cast they were called cast genes and

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:42.430
cast they were called cast genes and
 

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:44.400
cast they were called cast genes and
nobody knew the functions of any of

nobody knew the functions of any of
 

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:47.210
nobody knew the functions of any of
those proteins but they had interesting

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:47.220
those proteins but they had interesting
 

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:50.730
those proteins but they had interesting
similarities to proteins that carry out

in different ways so the hypothesis was

00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960
in different ways so the hypothesis was
 

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.260
in different ways so the hypothesis was
maybe these crispers are actually an

so from that very early conversation

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:06.160
so from that very early conversation
 

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.970

with Jill Banfield I got intrigued and I
thought well this this would be amazing

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:10.600
thought well this this would be amazing
 

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.560
thought well this this would be amazing

part of the CRISPR system that is a
 

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:38.010
part of the CRISPR system that is a
programmable DNA cutter that means it's

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:38.020
programmable DNA cutter that means it's
 

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.410

first of all to tell you

00:21:36.659 --> 00:21:36.669
first of all to tell you
 

00:21:36.669 --> 00:21:38.970
first of all to tell you
about how we got into the studying this

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:38.980
about how we got into the studying this
 

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:41.549

00:21:47.049 --> 00:21:48.629
currently understood or was understood
even a you know a few years ago about

00:21:48.629 --> 00:21:48.639
even a you know a few years ago about
 

00:21:48.639 --> 00:21:51.330
even a you know a few years ago about
CRISPR adaptive immune systems and

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:51.340
CRISPR adaptive immune systems and
 

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:52.950
CRISPR adaptive immune systems and
bacteria and so on what I'm showing you

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960
bacteria and so on what I'm showing you
 

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.279
bacteria and so on what I'm showing you
in this cartoon is a segment of a

00:21:56.279 --> 00:21:56.289
in this cartoon is a segment of a
 

00:21:56.289 --> 00:21:58.529
in this cartoon is a segment of a
bacterial cell so here's the the

00:21:58.529 --> 00:21:58.539
bacterial cell so here's the the
 

00:21:58.539 --> 00:22:01.979
bacterial cell so here's the the
bacterial cell cell membrane and we've

00:22:01.979 --> 00:22:01.989
bacterial cell cell membrane and we've
 

00:22:01.989 --> 00:22:04.560
bacterial cell cell membrane and we've
got a viruses that are infecting this

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:04.570
got a viruses that are infecting this
 

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:07.139
got a viruses that are infecting this
cell and injecting their DNA into the

00:22:07.139 --> 00:22:07.149
cell and injecting their DNA into the
 

00:22:07.149 --> 00:22:08.759
cell and injecting their DNA into the
cell and when an infection like that

00:22:08.759 --> 00:22:08.769
cell and when an infection like that
 

00:22:08.769 --> 00:22:11.430
cell and when an infection like that
occurs the DNA goes in and it contains

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440
occurs the DNA goes in and it contains
 

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.830
occurs the DNA goes in and it contains
the codes for the the program that's

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840
the codes for the the program that's
 

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.690
the codes for the the program that's
necessary to make more viruses so it

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:15.700
necessary to make more viruses so it
 

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.519
necessary to make more viruses so it
quickly takes over the cells machinery

00:22:17.519 --> 00:22:17.529
quickly takes over the cells machinery
 

00:22:17.529 --> 00:22:20.669
quickly takes over the cells machinery
unless it's a bacterial cell it has a

00:22:20.669 --> 00:22:20.679
unless it's a bacterial cell it has a
 

00:22:20.679 --> 00:22:22.799
unless it's a bacterial cell it has a
CRISPR system and if it has a CRISPR

00:22:22.799 --> 00:22:22.809
CRISPR system and if it has a CRISPR
 

00:22:22.809 --> 00:22:25.649
CRISPR system and if it has a CRISPR
system then what the cell can do is to

00:22:25.649 --> 00:22:25.659
system then what the cell can do is to
 

00:22:25.659 --> 00:22:28.859
system then what the cell can do is to
detect that foreign DNA and integrate a

00:22:28.859 --> 00:22:28.869
detect that foreign DNA and integrate a
 

00:22:28.869 --> 00:22:31.200
detect that foreign DNA and integrate a
small piece of it into the CRISPR array

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:31.210
small piece of it into the CRISPR array
 

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:33.690
small piece of it into the CRISPR array
and it does that on one end of the array

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:33.700
and it does that on one end of the array
 

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:36.419
and it does that on one end of the array
so a little segment of DNA is inserted

00:22:36.419 --> 00:22:36.429
so a little segment of DNA is inserted
 

00:22:36.429 --> 00:22:39.180
so a little segment of DNA is inserted
it's flanked by copies of these repeat

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:39.190
it's flanked by copies of these repeat
 

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:40.979
it's flanked by copies of these repeat
elements so it's sort of marked in the

00:22:40.979 --> 00:22:40.989
elements so it's sort of marked in the
 

00:22:40.989 --> 00:22:43.289
elements so it's sort of marked in the
cell as part of this CRISPR array and

00:22:43.289 --> 00:22:43.299
cell as part of this CRISPR array and
 

00:22:43.299 --> 00:22:45.509
cell as part of this CRISPR array and
then the cell is able to make an RNA

00:22:45.509 --> 00:22:45.519
then the cell is able to make an RNA
 

00:22:45.519 --> 00:22:48.419
then the cell is able to make an RNA
copy of that array initially has a long

00:22:48.419 --> 00:22:48.429
copy of that array initially has a long
 

00:22:48.429 --> 00:22:50.759
copy of that array initially has a long
piece of RNA that's chopped into smaller

00:22:50.759 --> 00:22:50.769
piece of RNA that's chopped into smaller
 

00:22:50.769 --> 00:22:53.190
piece of RNA that's chopped into smaller
units each containing a sequence that

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:53.200
units each containing a sequence that
 

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.859
units each containing a sequence that
comes from a virus and those RNAs then

00:22:55.859 --> 00:22:55.869
comes from a virus and those RNAs then
 

00:22:55.869 --> 00:22:57.720
comes from a virus and those RNAs then
assemble with one or more of the cast

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:57.730
assemble with one or more of the cast
 

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:01.169
assemble with one or more of the cast
proteins to form an effector complex a

00:23:01.169 --> 00:23:01.179
proteins to form an effector complex a
 

00:23:01.179 --> 00:23:03.509
proteins to form an effector complex a
complex protein RNA that's able to

00:23:03.509 --> 00:23:03.519
complex protein RNA that's able to
 

00:23:03.519 --> 00:23:05.369
complex protein RNA that's able to
search the cell looking for a sequence

00:23:05.369 --> 00:23:05.379
search the cell looking for a sequence
 

00:23:05.379 --> 00:23:08.070
search the cell looking for a sequence
of DNA that matches the letters in the

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:08.080
of DNA that matches the letters in the
 

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.349
of DNA that matches the letters in the
RNA molecule and if a match is found

00:23:10.349 --> 00:23:10.359
RNA molecule and if a match is found
 

00:23:10.359 --> 00:23:13.349
RNA molecule and if a match is found
then the proteins in this complex are

00:23:13.349 --> 00:23:13.359
then the proteins in this complex are
 

00:23:13.359 --> 00:23:15.659
then the proteins in this complex are
able to cut up the DNA so it's a great

00:23:15.659 --> 00:23:15.669
able to cut up the DNA so it's a great
 

00:23:15.669 --> 00:23:17.249
able to cut up the DNA so it's a great
way that the cell can program this

00:23:17.249 --> 00:23:17.259
way that the cell can program this
 

00:23:17.259 --> 00:23:20.789
way that the cell can program this
protein to find and cut viral DNA that

00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:20.799
protein to find and cut viral DNA that
 

00:23:20.799 --> 00:23:23.879
protein to find and cut viral DNA that
it's been exposed to in the past and so

00:23:23.879 --> 00:23:23.889
it's been exposed to in the past and so
 

00:23:23.889 --> 00:23:26.729
it's been exposed to in the past and so

we started by working on this sort of

00:23:30.629 --> 00:23:30.639
we started by working on this sort of
 

00:23:30.639 --> 00:23:32.460
we started by working on this sort of
middle intermediate step which is si

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:32.470

and that led to a realization that we

00:28:18.549 --> 00:28:18.559
and that led to a realization that we
 

00:28:18.559 --> 00:28:20.680
and that led to a realization that we
could actually link together the two

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:20.690

really sort of led us to an
 

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:03.730
really sort of led us to an

that then has to rotate into place so

00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:00.720
that then has to rotate into place so
 

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.900
that then has to rotate into place so
that it can actually cut the DNA so it's

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:02.910
that it can actually cut the DNA so it's
 

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:03.910

little machine and one thing just to

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:06.900
little machine and one thing just to
 

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:10.790
little machine and one thing just to
keep in mind is that this DNA unwinding

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800
keep in mind is that this DNA unwinding
 

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:13.099

without an external source of energy and
we think that largely this is due to

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:41.540
we think that largely this is due to
 

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:44.240
we think that largely this is due to
favourable thermodynamics so for those

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:44.250
favourable thermodynamics so for those
 

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:46.280
favourable thermodynamics so for those

you might know that when you have two
strands of DNA that are hybridized you

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:50.130
strands of DNA that are hybridized you
 

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:52.910
strands of DNA that are hybridized you
have a helix of DNA that's actually less

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:52.920
have a helix of DNA that's actually less
 

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:56.000
have a helix of DNA that's actually less
stable then when we have a strand of RNA

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:56.010
stable then when we have a strand of RNA
 

00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:58.940
stable then when we have a strand of RNA
that's hybridized to DNA and that's even

00:36:58.940 --> 00:36:58.950
that's hybridized to DNA and that's even
 

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:01.099
that's hybridized to DNA and that's even
less stable than we when we have two

00:37:01.099 --> 00:37:01.109
less stable than we when we have two
 

00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:03.410

strands of RNA that are hybridized to

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:03.420
strands of RNA that are hybridized to
 

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.670
strands of RNA that are hybridized to
each other just in a sort of an

each other just in a sort of an
 

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.910
each other just in a sort of an
energetic sense so this is an end

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:06.920
energetic sense so this is an end
 

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:08.620
energetic sense so this is an end
that takes advantage of that because

00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:08.630
that takes advantage of that because
 

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:11.859
that takes advantage of that because
we're swapping a DNA DNA hybridization

00:37:11.859 --> 00:37:11.869
we're swapping a DNA DNA hybridization
 

00:37:11.869 --> 00:37:14.650
we're swapping a DNA DNA hybridization
for an rna-dna hybrid that's actually

for an rna-dna hybrid that's actually
 

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:16.870
for an rna-dna hybrid that's actually
more stable the trick is for this enzyme

it gets going we think it slips up as
 

00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:25.829
it gets going we think it slips up as

long as there is base pairing
complementarity that then triggers the

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:28.460
complementarity that then triggers the
 

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:30.099
complementarity that then triggers the
structural change in the enzyme that

00:37:30.099 --> 00:37:30.109
structural change in the enzyme that
 

00:37:30.109 --> 00:37:33.400
structural change in the enzyme that

one of the big challenges going forward

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:55.160
one of the big challenges going forward
 

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:57.250
one of the big challenges going forward
with gene editing which was alluded to

00:37:57.250 --> 00:37:57.260
with gene editing which was alluded to
 

00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:58.599
with gene editing which was alluded to
in the introduction which is the

00:37:58.599 --> 00:37:58.609
in the introduction which is the
 

00:37:58.609 --> 00:38:01.450
in the introduction which is the
opportunity to use gene editing to

00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:01.460
opportunity to use gene editing to
 

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:03.430
opportunity to use gene editing to
actually cure genetic disease it's kind

00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:03.440
actually cure genetic disease it's kind
 

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.260
actually cure genetic disease it's kind
of an amazing thing to think that we're

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:05.270
of an amazing thing to think that we're
 

00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:07.630
of an amazing thing to think that we're
really on the threshold of a technology

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:07.640
really on the threshold of a technology
 

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.430
really on the threshold of a technology
that's going to enable that making a

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:09.440
that's going to enable that making a
 

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:12.339
that's going to enable that making a
change to the DNA not not having to

00:38:12.339 --> 00:38:12.349

their whole life to treat a disease but
 

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:20.620
their whole life to treat a disease but
actually to treat it at its source by

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:20.630
actually to treat it at its source by
 

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:24.520
actually to treat it at its source by
correcting the code in the DNA and how

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:24.530
correcting the code in the DNA and how
 

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:26.170
correcting the code in the DNA and how
would one actually do that and I think

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:26.180
would one actually do that and I think
 

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:28.000
would one actually do that and I think
there are three sort of big challenges

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:28.010
there are three sort of big challenges
 

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:30.370
there are three sort of big challenges
when we think about this going forward

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:30.380
when we think about this going forward
 

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:32.170
when we think about this going forward
and lots of lots of other challenges too

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:32.180
and lots of lots of other challenges too
 

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:34.390
and lots of lots of other challenges too
but these are three of the big ones one

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400
but these are three of the big ones one
 

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.490
but these are three of the big ones one
is delivery how do we actually get these

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:36.500
is delivery how do we actually get these
 

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:38.980
is delivery how do we actually get these
gene editing molecules into the cells

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:38.990
gene editing molecules into the cells
 

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:41.710
gene editing molecules into the cells
where they would need to be active to

00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:41.720
where they would need to be active to
 

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:44.799
where they would need to be active to
create a cure for disease secondly how

00:38:44.799 --> 00:38:44.809
create a cure for disease secondly how
 

00:38:44.809 --> 00:38:47.260
create a cure for disease secondly how
do we control the way the DNA repair

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:47.270
do we control the way the DNA repair
 

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:49.030
do we control the way the DNA repair
happens because as I told you the

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.040
happens because as I told you the
 

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.760
happens because as I told you the
Cassadine protein is a great chemical

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:51.770
Cassadine protein is a great chemical
 

00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:54.220
Cassadine protein is a great chemical
cleaver of DNA that's programmable but

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:54.230
cleaver of DNA that's programmable but
 

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:56.859
cleaver of DNA that's programmable but
the editing actually happens after that

00:38:56.859 --> 00:38:56.869
the editing actually happens after that
 

00:38:56.869 --> 00:38:58.750
the editing actually happens after that
it happens in the cell with natural

00:38:58.750 --> 00:38:58.760
it happens in the cell with natural
 

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:00.130
it happens in the cell with natural
machinery in the cell so how do we

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:00.140
machinery in the cell so how do we
 

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:02.260
machinery in the cell so how do we
understand that well enough that we can

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:02.270
understand that well enough that we can
 

00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:05.380
understand that well enough that we can
really control exactly how that editing

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:05.390
really control exactly how that editing
 

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:07.210
really control exactly how that editing
is happening in every single cell we're

not there yet but it's the field is
 

00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:11.650
not there yet but it's the field is
definitely moving in that direction and

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:11.660
definitely moving in that direction and
 

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:13.569
definitely moving in that direction and
then finally there's a number of ethical

00:39:13.569 --> 00:39:13.579
then finally there's a number of ethical
 

00:39:13.579 --> 00:39:15.760
then finally there's a number of ethical

this even a few years ago but it's just
 

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.309
this even a few years ago but it's just
been so exciting to have the opportunity

00:39:35.309 --> 00:39:35.319
been so exciting to have the opportunity
 

00:39:35.319 --> 00:39:38.910
been so exciting to have the opportunity
to work with colleagues on ways that we

of applications of gene editing because

00:39:45.299 --> 00:39:45.309
of applications of gene editing because
 

00:39:45.309 --> 00:39:47.849
of applications of gene editing because
of the challenge of getting these gene

00:39:47.849 --> 00:39:47.859
of the challenge of getting these gene
 

00:39:47.859 --> 00:39:51.240
of the challenge of getting these gene
editing complexes into the brain so this

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:51.250
editing complexes into the brain so this
 

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:53.309
editing complexes into the brain so this
is just a slide that shows that and I

00:39:53.309 --> 00:39:53.319
is just a slide that shows that and I
 

00:39:53.319 --> 00:39:55.049
is just a slide that shows that and I
think you're familiar here with the

00:39:55.049 --> 00:39:55.059
think you're familiar here with the
 

00:39:55.059 --> 00:39:57.420
think you're familiar here with the
concept that a number of neurological

00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:57.430
concept that a number of neurological
 

00:39:57.430 --> 00:40:00.930
concept that a number of neurological
disorders actually originate or at least

00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:00.940
disorders actually originate or at least
 

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:04.500
disorders actually originate or at least
are exacerbated by by the sequence of

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:04.510
are exacerbated by by the sequence of
 

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:06.770
are exacerbated by by the sequence of
DNA that that are in in the cells and

00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:06.780
DNA that that are in in the cells and
 

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:09.359

Alzheimer's Huntington's and ALS are all
 

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:15.839
Alzheimer's Huntington's and ALS are all
diseases where we know some of the of

00:40:15.839 --> 00:40:15.849
diseases where we know some of the of
 

00:40:15.849 --> 00:40:17.849
diseases where we know some of the of
the genetic causes and in some cases

00:40:17.849 --> 00:40:17.859
the genetic causes and in some cases
 

00:40:17.859 --> 00:40:19.500
the genetic causes and in some cases
like in the case of Huntington's which

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:19.510
like in the case of Huntington's which
 

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:21.870
like in the case of Huntington's which
is a fortunately fairly rare disorder

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:21.880
is a fortunately fairly rare disorder
 

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.789
is a fortunately fairly rare disorder
but that has been studied for a long

00:40:23.789 --> 00:40:23.799
but that has been studied for a long
 

00:40:23.799 --> 00:40:27.349
but that has been studied for a long
time we actually know exactly where

mutations occur in one gene that are
 

00:40:30.369 --> 00:40:32.940

terrible thing when families know they

it's a really a horrifying thing to know

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:49.480
it's a really a horrifying thing to know
 

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:52.109
it's a really a horrifying thing to know
that you might have this and if you have

few years back Brett Stoll came to my

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:04.540
few years back Brett Stoll came to my
 

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:07.589
few years back Brett Stoll came to my
laboratory as a postdoctoral fellow who

00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:07.599
laboratory as a postdoctoral fellow who
 

00:41:07.599 --> 00:41:09.839
laboratory as a postdoctoral fellow who
was interested in asking the question

00:41:09.839 --> 00:41:09.849
was interested in asking the question
 

00:41:09.849 --> 00:41:12.809
was interested in asking the question
whether we could really develop the

00:41:12.809 --> 00:41:12.819
whether we could really develop the
 

00:41:12.819 --> 00:41:15.210
whether we could really develop the
CRISPR cast line technology in ways that

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:15.220
CRISPR cast line technology in ways that
 

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.490
CRISPR cast line technology in ways that
would eventually allow treatment or even

00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:17.500
would eventually allow treatment or even
 

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:20.480
would eventually allow treatment or even
cure of disorders like Huntington's and

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:20.490
cure of disorders like Huntington's and

cure of disorders like Huntington's and
and so when he came to the lab we

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:22.690
and so when he came to the lab we
 

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:25.020
and so when he came to the lab we
started thinking about this question of

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:25.030
started thinking about this question of
 

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:27.510
started thinking about this question of
delivery and at the time there were sort

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:27.520
delivery and at the time there were sort
 

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:29.940
delivery and at the time there were sort
of several ways that people had been

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:29.950
of several ways that people had been
 

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:32.630
of several ways that people had been
working on delivering the

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640

Tass 9rn a complex into cells and and
 

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:37.910
Tass 9rn a complex into cells and and
I'm just going to show you some of them

00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:37.920
I'm just going to show you some of them
 

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:40.490
I'm just going to show you some of them
here so one way is to do it by encoding

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:40.500
here so one way is to do it by encoding
 

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:43.670
here so one way is to do it by encoding
the Cassadine protein and its guide RNA

00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680
the Cassadine protein and its guide RNA
 

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:46.370
the Cassadine protein and its guide RNA
in a DNA molecule so that DNA goes into

00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:46.380
in a DNA molecule so that DNA goes into
 

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:49.160
in a DNA molecule so that DNA goes into
the cell and then it gets copied into

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:49.170
the cell and then it gets copied into
 

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:51.049
the cell and then it gets copied into
RNA and the RNA gets translated into

00:41:51.049 --> 00:41:51.059
RNA and the RNA gets translated into
 

00:41:51.059 --> 00:41:53.089
RNA and the RNA gets translated into
protein and it assembles with a piece of

00:41:53.089 --> 00:41:53.099
protein and it assembles with a piece of
 

00:41:53.099 --> 00:41:55.370
protein and it assembles with a piece of
guide RNA that's also encoded here and

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:55.380
guide RNA that's also encoded here and
 

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:58.549
guide RNA that's also encoded here and
then you get editing a second way is to

00:41:58.549 --> 00:41:58.559
then you get editing a second way is to
 

00:41:58.559 --> 00:42:02.900
then you get editing a second way is to
use a virus to introduce the the encoded

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:02.910
use a virus to introduce the the encoded
 

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:05.180
use a virus to introduce the the encoded
sequence the sequence encodes caste line

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:05.190
sequence the sequence encodes caste line
 

00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:07.819
sequence the sequence encodes caste line
in its guide RNA into cells you can also

00:42:07.819 --> 00:42:07.829
in its guide RNA into cells you can also
 

00:42:07.829 --> 00:42:10.460
in its guide RNA into cells you can also
use direct delivery of messenger RNA

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:10.470
use direct delivery of messenger RNA
 

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:12.680
use direct delivery of messenger RNA
that encodes the protein and this can be

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:12.690
that encodes the protein and this can be
 

00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:15.019
that encodes the protein and this can be
done by encapsulating it into lipid

00:42:15.019 --> 00:42:15.029
done by encapsulating it into lipid
 

00:42:15.029 --> 00:42:16.759
done by encapsulating it into lipid
nanoparticles or other kinds of

00:42:16.759 --> 00:42:16.769
nanoparticles or other kinds of
 

00:42:16.769 --> 00:42:19.039
nanoparticles or other kinds of
nanoparticles so these are all ways that

00:42:19.039 --> 00:42:19.049
nanoparticles so these are all ways that
 

00:42:19.049 --> 00:42:21.259
nanoparticles so these are all ways that
had been delivery methods that have been

00:42:21.259 --> 00:42:21.269
had been delivery methods that have been
 

00:42:21.269 --> 00:42:23.509
had been delivery methods that have been
used for other kinds of molecules and

00:42:23.509 --> 00:42:23.519
used for other kinds of molecules and
 

00:42:23.519 --> 00:42:25.430
used for other kinds of molecules and
could be adapted quickly for for

00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440
could be adapted quickly for for
 

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.740
could be adapted quickly for for
delivery of caste line but it's

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:27.750
delivery of caste line but it's
 

00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:29.809
delivery of caste line but it's
biochemists we started wondering whether

00:42:29.809 --> 00:42:29.819
biochemists we started wondering whether
 

00:42:29.819 --> 00:42:31.519
biochemists we started wondering whether
we might actually be able to think of a

00:42:31.519 --> 00:42:31.529
we might actually be able to think of a
 

00:42:31.529 --> 00:42:33.920
we might actually be able to think of a
different way of doing the delivery that

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:33.930
different way of doing the delivery that
 

00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:35.509
different way of doing the delivery that
might have certain advantages and the

00:42:35.509 --> 00:42:35.519
might have certain advantages and the
 

00:42:35.519 --> 00:42:38.720
might have certain advantages and the
idea was could we actually use a non

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:38.730
idea was could we actually use a non
 

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:41.569
idea was could we actually use a non

00:42:41.569 --> 00:42:41.579
genetically encoded form of caste 9 main
 

00:42:41.579 --> 00:42:44.749
genetically encoded form of caste 9 main
namely doing what we do is biochemists

00:42:44.749 --> 00:42:44.759
namely doing what we do is biochemists

caste 9 protein assembling it with guide
RNAs that would direct it to the

00:42:50.809 --> 00:42:50.819
RNAs that would direct it to the
 

00:42:50.819 --> 00:42:53.870
RNAs that would direct it to the
huntingtin gene and delivering that

00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:53.880
huntingtin gene and delivering that
 

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:57.259
huntingtin gene and delivering that
somehow directly into cells and in a an

00:42:57.259 --> 00:42:57.269
somehow directly into cells and in a an
 

00:42:57.269 --> 00:42:59.299

important advantage of this kind of

00:42:59.299 --> 00:42:59.309
important advantage of this kind of

important advantage of this kind of
strategy when you have a non genetically

strategy when you have a non genetically
 

00:43:01.259 --> 00:43:03.230
strategy when you have a non genetically
encoded delivery mechanism is that you

00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240
encoded delivery mechanism is that you
 

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:05.690
encoded delivery mechanism is that you
don't have to worry about this editing

00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:05.700
don't have to worry about this editing

molecule hanging around in cells for a
 

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:09.650
molecule hanging around in cells for a
long time because the protein has a very

short lifetime about 24 hours in cells
 

00:43:12.119 --> 00:43:14.690
short lifetime about 24 hours in cells
that means that it goes in does its

that means that it goes in does its
 

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:16.819
that means that it goes in does its
business generating a cut that gets

00:43:16.819 --> 00:43:16.829
business generating a cut that gets
 

00:43:16.829 --> 00:43:18.980
business generating a cut that gets
repaired and then that chemical cleaver

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:18.990
repaired and then that chemical cleaver
 

00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:20.749
repaired and then that chemical cleaver
is degraded so we don't have to worry

00:43:20.749 --> 00:43:20.759
is degraded so we don't have to worry
 

00:43:20.759 --> 00:43:23.210

about it hanging around for a long time

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:32.660
undesired edits potentially so with that
idea in mind

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:32.670
idea in mind
 

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:35.839
idea in mind
Bret started to do experiments to ask

00:43:35.839 --> 00:43:35.849
Bret started to do experiments to ask
 

00:43:35.849 --> 00:43:37.460
Bret started to do experiments to ask
whether this approach would actually

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:37.470
whether this approach would actually
 

00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:39.410
whether this approach would actually
work and so the idea was to take

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:39.420
work and so the idea was to take
 

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:42.380
work and so the idea was to take
purified Cassadine protein assemble it

00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:42.390
purified Cassadine protein assemble it
 

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:44.720
purified Cassadine protein assemble it
with guide RNA in vitro that means just

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:44.730
with guide RNA in vitro that means just
 

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:45.550
with guide RNA in vitro that means just
in

00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:45.560
in
 

00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:47.260
in
taking these purified molecules and

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:47.270
taking these purified molecules and
 

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:49.930
taking these purified molecules and
mixing them together and then adding

00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:49.940
mixing them together and then adding
 

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:52.090
mixing them together and then adding
them to cells and we were doing this

00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:52.100
them to cells and we were doing this
 

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:54.640
them to cells and we were doing this
initially just in in cultured cells and

00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:54.650
initially just in in cultured cells and
 

00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:57.760
initially just in in cultured cells and
he had another I thought very very good

00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:57.770
he had another I thought very very good
 

00:43:57.770 --> 00:44:00.640
he had another I thought very very good
idea he took advantage of cells that had

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:00.650
idea he took advantage of cells that had
 

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:03.190
idea he took advantage of cells that had
been made in mice that have been

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200
been made in mice that have been
 

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:05.020
been made in mice that have been
engineered in they're having their

a way that it's turned off so it doesn't

00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:19.190
a way that it's turned off so it doesn't
 

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:22.920
a way that it's turned off so it doesn't
get made but he designed editing

a very idea was to use that strategy to

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:37.730
a very idea was to use that strategy to
 

00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:40.090
a very idea was to use that strategy to
easily visually detect cells that had

00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:40.100
easily visually detect cells that had
 

00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:41.410
easily visually detect cells that had
been edited so this is just showing

00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:41.420
been edited so this is just showing
 

00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:44.380
been edited so this is just showing
again a cartoon of how the idea for

00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:44.390
again a cartoon of how the idea for
 

00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:47.230
again a cartoon of how the idea for
doing this where you have these cast

00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:47.240
doing this where you have these cast
 

00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:49.390
doing this where you have these cast
line proteins that can edit the DNA

00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:49.400
line proteins that can edit the DNA
 

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.430

turning it on and turnin the cells red

00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:54.430
turning it on and turnin the cells red
 

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:58.540
turning it on and turnin the cells red
and so so that idea let me just show you

00:44:58.540 --> 00:44:58.550
and so so that idea let me just show you
 

00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:00.130
and so so that idea let me just show you
what this actually looks like so if you

00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:00.140
what this actually looks like so if you
 

00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:02.410
what this actually looks like so if you
do this in cells that are growing in a

00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:02.420
do this in cells that are growing in a
 

00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:05.220
do this in cells that are growing in a
dish in the lab you can actually

00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:05.230
dish in the lab you can actually
 

00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:08.530
dish in the lab you can actually
introduce that protein RNA complex just

00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:08.540
introduce that protein RNA complex just
 

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:11.290
introduce that protein RNA complex just
by very gentle disruption of the cell

00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:11.300
by very gentle disruption of the cell
 

00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:14.320
by very gentle disruption of the cell
membranes these complexes go in and we

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:14.330
membranes these complexes go in and we
 

00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:16.510
membranes these complexes go in and we
were very gratified to see that the more

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:16.520
were very gratified to see that the more
 

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:19.930
were very gratified to see that the more
of this RNA protein complex or RMP that

00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:19.940
of this RNA protein complex or RMP that
 

00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:22.060
of this RNA protein complex or RMP that
we added to the sample these cells the

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:22.070
we added to the sample these cells the
 

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:25.000
we added to the sample these cells the
more red cells were observed and you can

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:25.010
more red cells were observed and you can
 

00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:27.220
more red cells were observed and you can
actually quantify that you can separate

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:27.230
actually quantify that you can separate
 

00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:29.290
actually quantify that you can separate
the red cells from the non red cells and

00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:29.300
the red cells from the non red cells and
 

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:30.790
the red cells from the non red cells and
you can figure out roughly how many

00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:30.800
you can figure out roughly how many
 

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.710
you can figure out roughly how many
cells have gotten edited and we could

00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:32.720
cells have gotten edited and we could
 

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:34.450
cells have gotten edited and we could
get a very nice kind of dose response

00:45:34.450 --> 00:45:34.460
get a very nice kind of dose response
 

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:37.180
get a very nice kind of dose response
here the more of this editor we added to

00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:37.190
here the more of this editor we added to
 

00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:40.120
here the more of this editor we added to
the cells the more cells got edited so

00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:40.130
the cells the more cells got edited so
 

00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:41.860
the cells the more cells got edited so
it's fine in the lab but how would you

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:41.870
it's fine in the lab but how would you
 

00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:43.540
it's fine in the lab but how would you
actually do this what if you wanted to

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:43.550
actually do this what if you wanted to
 

00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:45.970
actually do this what if you wanted to
be able to do that kind of editing in

00:45:45.970 --> 00:45:45.980
be able to do that kind of editing in
 

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:49.060
be able to do that kind of editing in
cells of a brain and you can't you can't

00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:49.070
cells of a brain and you can't you can't
 

00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:50.710
cells of a brain and you can't you can't
easily how are you gonna disrupt the

00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:50.720
easily how are you gonna disrupt the
 

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.660
easily how are you gonna disrupt the
brain cell membranes and you probably

00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:52.670
brain cell membranes and you probably
 

00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:54.580
brain cell membranes and you probably
wouldn't want to do that anyway and so

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:54.590
wouldn't want to do that anyway and so
 

00:45:54.590 --> 00:45:56.859
wouldn't want to do that anyway and so
how do you how do you get this in and so

00:45:56.859 --> 00:45:56.869
how do you how do you get this in and so
 

00:45:56.869 --> 00:45:58.359
how do you how do you get this in and so
another idea that bread had this was

00:45:58.359 --> 00:45:58.369
another idea that bread had this was
 

00:45:58.369 --> 00:46:00.339
another idea that bread had this was
really based on some work a guy named

and we adapted it here was to introduce

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:13.970
and we adapted it here was to introduce

protein that would be cell penetrating
so these are charged little pieces of

00:46:22.539 --> 00:46:22.549
so these are charged little pieces of
 

00:46:22.549 --> 00:46:24.519
so these are charged little pieces of
protein that have the ability to

protein that have the ability to
 

00:46:24.529 --> 00:46:27.489
protein that have the ability to
penetrate cell membranes and so Brett

00:46:27.489 --> 00:46:27.499
penetrate cell membranes and so Brett
 

00:46:27.499 --> 00:46:31.150
penetrate cell membranes and so Brett
generated a series of these protein cast

00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:31.160
generated a series of these protein cast
 

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:33.009
generated a series of these protein cast
line complexes with different numbers of

these cell penetrating peptides on the
 

00:46:35.119 --> 00:46:38.710
these cell penetrating peptides on the

00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:38.720
surface and and then he was able to show
 

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:41.499

00:46:46.549 --> 00:46:48.849
penetrating peptides on the protein we
got no editing without any kind of

00:46:48.849 --> 00:46:48.859
got no editing without any kind of
 

00:46:48.859 --> 00:46:50.470
got no editing without any kind of
artificial disruption of the cell

membranes but if we had these
 

00:46:52.299 --> 00:46:54.579

we saw red cells so we could and we

00:46:56.349 --> 00:46:56.359
we saw red cells so we could and we
 

00:46:56.359 --> 00:46:58.120
we saw red cells so we could and we
could quantify this and this is just

00:46:58.120 --> 00:46:58.130
could quantify this and this is just
 

00:46:58.130 --> 00:46:59.130
could quantify this and this is just
showing that the more of these

00:46:59.130 --> 00:46:59.140
showing that the more of these
 

00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:01.329
showing that the more of these
penetrating peptides were on the cell

00:47:01.329 --> 00:47:01.339
penetrating peptides were on the cell
 

00:47:01.339 --> 00:47:04.839
penetrating peptides were on the cell
surface of Casner and the more editing

we saw and we could actually quantify
 

00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:10.599
we saw and we could actually quantify
that further and I won't drag you

but this was just a way of really
 

00:47:16.009 --> 00:47:19.420
but this was just a way of really
quantifying how much change to the DNA

00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:19.430
quantifying how much change to the DNA
 

00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:21.309
quantifying how much change to the DNA
had actually occurred in us in a given

00:47:21.309 --> 00:47:21.319
had actually occurred in us in a given
 

00:47:21.319 --> 00:47:23.829
had actually occurred in us in a given
number of cells by doing using a system

00:47:23.829 --> 00:47:23.839
number of cells by doing using a system
 

00:47:23.839 --> 00:47:25.749
number of cells by doing using a system
of that could actually allow us to

00:47:25.749 --> 00:47:25.759
of that could actually allow us to
 

00:47:25.759 --> 00:47:28.269
of that could actually allow us to
detect edited DNA and separate it from

00:47:28.269 --> 00:47:28.279
detect edited DNA and separate it from
 

00:47:28.279 --> 00:47:31.210
detect edited DNA and separate it from
non edited DNA and this is just showing

00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:31.220
non edited DNA and this is just showing
 

00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:33.489
non edited DNA and this is just showing
that we could test the activity of these

00:47:33.489 --> 00:47:33.499
that we could test the activity of these
 

00:47:33.499 --> 00:47:35.920
that we could test the activity of these
proteins that have the penetrating

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:35.930
proteins that have the penetrating
 

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:37.599
proteins that have the penetrating
peptides on the surface and show that

00:47:37.599 --> 00:47:37.609
peptides on the surface and show that
 

00:47:37.609 --> 00:47:40.180
peptides on the surface and show that
they behaved exactly the same in terms

00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:40.190
they behaved exactly the same in terms
 

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:43.479
they behaved exactly the same in terms
of their chemistry as the non modified

00:47:43.479 --> 00:47:43.489
of their chemistry as the non modified
 

00:47:43.489 --> 00:47:45.789
of their chemistry as the non modified
protein and then I really just want to

00:47:45.789 --> 00:47:45.799
protein and then I really just want to
 

00:47:45.799 --> 00:47:48.359
protein and then I really just want to
show you this result here so this is now

00:47:48.359 --> 00:47:48.369
show you this result here so this is now
 

00:47:48.369 --> 00:47:50.440
show you this result here so this is now
fast-forwarding so we said ok we have

00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:50.450
fast-forwarding so we said ok we have
 

00:47:50.450 --> 00:47:53.140
fast-forwarding so we said ok we have
modified cassadine proteins that can get

00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:53.150
modified cassadine proteins that can get
 

00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:54.849
modified cassadine proteins that can get
into cells what happens if we actually

00:47:54.849 --> 00:47:54.859
into cells what happens if we actually
 

00:47:54.859 --> 00:47:58.150
into cells what happens if we actually
inject these into an animal brain and so

00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160
inject these into an animal brain and so
 

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:02.019
inject these into an animal brain and so
here we're using this TD tomato reporter

00:48:02.019 --> 00:48:02.029
here we're using this TD tomato reporter
 

00:48:02.029 --> 00:48:03.609
here we're using this TD tomato reporter
Mouse and that just means that we have

00:48:03.609 --> 00:48:03.619
Mouse and that just means that we have
 

00:48:03.619 --> 00:48:05.769
Mouse and that just means that we have
now a whole Mouse that has in its genome

00:48:05.769 --> 00:48:05.779
now a whole Mouse that has in its genome
 

00:48:05.779 --> 00:48:08.240
now a whole Mouse that has in its genome

again downstream of a DNA sequence that

00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:10.680
again downstream of a DNA sequence that
 

00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:14.210
again downstream of a DNA sequence that
gets edited by the caste line complexes

00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:14.220
gets edited by the caste line complexes
 

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:17.510
gets edited by the caste line complexes
that we're making and to deliver it we

00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520
that we're making and to deliver it we
 

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.820
that we're making and to deliver it we
have a tiny tiny needle that gets

00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:19.830
have a tiny tiny needle that gets
 

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:22.070
have a tiny tiny needle that gets
inserted into the skull and it actually

00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:22.080
inserted into the skull and it actually
 

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:24.890
inserted into the skull and it actually
goes in to a part of the brain where we

00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:24.900
goes in to a part of the brain where we
 

00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:27.820
goes in to a part of the brain where we
can eject a very small volume of these

00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:27.830
can eject a very small volume of these
 

00:48:27.830 --> 00:48:30.950
can eject a very small volume of these
modified protein cast line RNA complexes

modified protein cast line RNA complexes
 

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:33.860
modified protein cast line RNA complexes
and then observe the amount of editing

00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:33.870
and then observe the amount of editing
 

00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:35.750
and then observe the amount of editing
by simply sectioning the brain at

00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:35.760
by simply sectioning the brain at
 

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:37.880
by simply sectioning the brain at
different times after this injection to

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:37.890
different times after this injection to
 

00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:39.860
different times after this injection to
see how many cells turn red and as you

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:39.870
see how many cells turn red and as you
 

00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:42.170
see how many cells turn red and as you
can see here on the right hand side we

00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:42.180
can see here on the right hand side we
 

00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:43.850
can see here on the right hand side we
were really gratified to see that we

00:48:43.850 --> 00:48:43.860
were really gratified to see that we
 

00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:47.510
were really gratified to see that we
could see these fairly large volumes of

00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520
could see these fairly large volumes of
 

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:50.750
could see these fairly large volumes of
cells that get edited around in sort of

00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:50.760
cells that get edited around in sort of
 

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:53.300
cells that get edited around in sort of
a volume around the site of injection

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:53.310
a volume around the site of injection
 

00:48:53.310 --> 00:48:55.040
a volume around the site of injection
we've now done a lot of this kind of

00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:55.050
we've now done a lot of this kind of
 

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:57.950
we've now done a lot of this kind of
work with this mouse model and also now

00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:57.960
work with this mouse model and also now
 

00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:00.560
work with this mouse model and also now
increasingly with an actual mouse model

increasingly with an actual mouse model
 

00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:02.090
increasingly with an actual mouse model
of Huntington's disease and we're very

00:49:02.090 --> 00:49:02.100
of Huntington's disease and we're very
 

00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:04.820
of Huntington's disease and we're very
excited to to find that we can edit

00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:04.830
excited to to find that we can edit
 

00:49:04.830 --> 00:49:07.960
excited to to find that we can edit
about 30% of the cells in a given volume

00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:07.970
about 30% of the cells in a given volume
 

00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:11.780
about 30% of the cells in a given volume
it's really depends on the the amount of

00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:11.790
it's really depends on the the amount of
 

00:49:11.790 --> 00:49:14.230
it's really depends on the the amount of
the Cassadine protein that we inject and

00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:14.240
the Cassadine protein that we inject and
 

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:16.490
the Cassadine protein that we inject and
furthermore we're now in the process

00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:16.500
furthermore we're now in the process
 

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:18.140
furthermore we're now in the process
which kind of midstream in doing

00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:18.150
which kind of midstream in doing
 

00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:20.540
which kind of midstream in doing
experiments with this Huntington's model

00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:20.550
experiments with this Huntington's model
 

00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:22.640
experiments with this Huntington's model
a mouse model to figure out if we can

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:22.650
a mouse model to figure out if we can
 

00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:24.500
a mouse model to figure out if we can
actually see a therapeutic benefit to

00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:24.510
actually see a therapeutic benefit to
 

00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:27.470
actually see a therapeutic benefit to
the animals and we were excited to you

00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:27.480
the animals and we were excited to you
 

00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:29.480
the animals and we were excited to you
know we think we are and so that we

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:29.490
know we think we are and so that we
 

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:30.470
know we think we are and so that we
think this is actually going to be a

00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480
think this is actually going to be a
 

00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:32.360
think this is actually going to be a
strategy that's going to be really very

00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:32.370
strategy that's going to be really very
 

00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:34.070
strategy that's going to be really very
exciting to develop going forward and I

00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:34.080
exciting to develop going forward and I
 

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:36.200
exciting to develop going forward and I
want to share one other observation with

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:36.210
want to share one other observation with
 

00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:38.030
want to share one other observation with
you and that is that some very

00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:38.040
you and that is that some very
 

00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:39.830
you and that is that some very
interesting kind of fundamental biology

00:49:39.830 --> 00:49:39.840
interesting kind of fundamental biology
 

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:41.510
interesting kind of fundamental biology
came out of this because what we found

00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:41.520
came out of this because what we found
 

00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:43.160
came out of this because what we found
and again I'm not going to drag you

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:43.170
and again I'm not going to drag you
 

00:49:43.170 --> 00:49:44.570
and again I'm not going to drag you
through all of these panels here but

00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:44.580
through all of these panels here but
 

00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:46.880
through all of these panels here but
this is an experiment that we did to

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:46.890
this is an experiment that we did to
 

00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:49.070
this is an experiment that we did to
look at so again we we can tell when

00:49:49.070 --> 00:49:49.080
look at so again we we can tell when
 

00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:51.080
look at so again we we can tell when
cells have been edited by looking at

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:51.090
cells have been edited by looking at
 

00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:52.730
cells have been edited by looking at
when they turn red and then we can also

00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:52.740
when they turn red and then we can also
 

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:54.350
when they turn red and then we can also
stain them with different antibodies

00:49:54.350 --> 00:49:54.360
stain them with different antibodies
 

00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:56.780
stain them with different antibodies
that tell us what type of cell it was

00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:56.790
that tell us what type of cell it was
 

00:49:56.790 --> 00:49:58.280
that tell us what type of cell it was
whether it whether it was a particular

00:49:58.280 --> 00:49:58.290
whether it whether it was a particular
 

00:49:58.290 --> 00:50:00.470
whether it whether it was a particular
type of neuron or some other type of

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480
type of neuron or some other type of
 

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:02.510
type of neuron or some other type of
cell based on the proteins that are on

00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:02.520
cell based on the proteins that are on
 

00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:04.340
cell based on the proteins that are on
the surface that these antibodies will

00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:04.350
the surface that these antibodies will
 

00:50:04.350 --> 00:50:06.470
the surface that these antibodies will
bind to and these experiments when we do

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480
bind to and these experiments when we do
 

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:09.020
bind to and these experiments when we do
them showed us that well we get very

00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:09.030
them showed us that well we get very
 

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:10.790
them showed us that well we get very
nice editing in different kinds of

00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800
nice editing in different kinds of
 

00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:13.310
nice editing in different kinds of
neurons we saw no editing and a

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:13.320
neurons we saw no editing and a
 

00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:15.170
neurons we saw no editing and a
different type of cell called astrocytes

00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:15.180
different type of cell called astrocytes
 

00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:17.630
different type of cell called astrocytes
and and that's very interesting because

00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:17.640
and and that's very interesting because
 

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:19.130
and and that's very interesting because
these cells are all you know the right

00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:19.140
these cells are all you know the right
 

00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:21.150
these cells are all you know the right
so they're in very close proximity

00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:21.160
so they're in very close proximity
 

00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:22.079
so they're in very close proximity
and so there's something really

00:50:22.079 --> 00:50:22.089
and so there's something really
 

00:50:22.089 --> 00:50:24.210
and so there's something really
different about the way these cells we

00:50:24.210 --> 00:50:24.220
different about the way these cells we
 

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:26.760
different about the way these cells we
think uptake the caffeine protein and

00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:26.770
think uptake the caffeine protein and
 

00:50:26.770 --> 00:50:29.099
think uptake the caffeine protein and
the way they might respond to this DNA

00:50:29.099 --> 00:50:29.109
the way they might respond to this DNA
 

00:50:29.109 --> 00:50:31.079
the way they might respond to this DNA
cutter something that we're following up

00:50:31.079 --> 00:50:31.089
cutter something that we're following up
 

00:50:31.089 --> 00:50:32.309
cutter something that we're following up
right now to just understand

00:50:32.309 --> 00:50:32.319
right now to just understand
 

00:50:32.319 --> 00:50:34.020
right now to just understand
fundamentally what's distinct about

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:34.030
fundamentally what's distinct about
 

00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:35.400
fundamentally what's distinct about
these different cell types and the way

00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:35.410
these different cell types and the way
 

00:50:35.410 --> 00:50:38.160
these different cell types and the way
they respond to editing and I'm just

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:38.170
they respond to editing and I'm just
 

00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:39.839
they respond to editing and I'm just
gonna in the last couple of minutes I

00:50:39.839 --> 00:50:39.849
gonna in the last couple of minutes I
 

00:50:39.849 --> 00:50:41.880
gonna in the last couple of minutes I
just want to say a little bit about what

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:41.890
just want to say a little bit about what
 

00:50:41.890 --> 00:50:45.029
just want to say a little bit about what
I call responsible progress so this is a

that reason and I also want to just say
a couple of words about germline editing

00:52:34.589 --> 00:52:34.599
a couple of words about germline editing
 

00:52:34.599 --> 00:52:36.450
a couple of words about germline editing
so the type of editing that I was

00:52:36.450 --> 00:52:36.460
so the type of editing that I was

somatic cell editing making DNA changes
 

00:52:43.299 --> 00:52:45.359
somatic cell editing making DNA changes
that are not heritable but what about

00:52:45.359 --> 00:52:45.369
that are not heritable but what about
 

00:52:45.369 --> 00:52:47.249
that are not heritable but what about
editing the germline what if we were to

00:52:47.249 --> 00:52:47.259
editing the germline what if we were to
 

00:52:47.259 --> 00:52:50.249
editing the germline what if we were to
edit eggs or sperm or embryos where the

00:52:50.249 --> 00:52:50.259
edit eggs or sperm or embryos where the
 

00:52:50.259 --> 00:52:52.410
edit eggs or sperm or embryos where the
resulting DNA changes become part of the

00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:52.420
resulting DNA changes become part of the
 

00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:54.690
resulting DNA changes become part of the
whole organism and are then passed on to

this immediately made people start
 

00:53:20.979 --> 00:53:23.969
this immediately made people start
asking could this happen in humans and

00:53:23.969 --> 00:53:23.979
asking could this happen in humans and
 

00:53:23.979 --> 00:53:25.680

thinking about designer babies and you
 

00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:36.299
thinking about designer babies and you
know how soon were we gonna see designer

00:53:36.299 --> 00:53:36.309
know how soon were we gonna see designer
 

00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:39.269

babies and and so in the course of all

00:53:39.269 --> 00:53:39.279
babies and and so in the course of all
 

00:53:39.279 --> 00:53:41.279
babies and and so in the course of all
of this I I really realized that you

00:53:41.279 --> 00:53:41.289
of this I I really realized that you
 

00:53:41.289 --> 00:53:43.499
of this I I really realized that you
know as a person who was kind of you

00:53:43.499 --> 00:53:43.509
know as a person who was kind of you
 

00:53:43.509 --> 00:53:45.959
know as a person who was kind of you
know they're at the genesis of this this

00:53:45.959 --> 00:53:45.969
know they're at the genesis of this this
 

00:53:45.969 --> 00:53:47.479
know they're at the genesis of this this
technology that I really needed to be

00:53:47.479 --> 00:53:47.489
technology that I really needed to be
 

00:53:47.489 --> 00:53:49.799
technology that I really needed to be
involved in that public discussion about

00:53:49.799 --> 00:53:49.809
involved in that public discussion about
 

00:53:49.809 --> 00:53:52.920
involved in that public discussion about
how we would proceed to use this and

00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:52.930
how we would proceed to use this and
 

00:53:52.930 --> 00:53:54.239
how we would proceed to use this and
hopefully to use it in a responsible

hopefully to use it in a responsible
 

00:53:54.249 --> 00:53:57.329
hopefully to use it in a responsible
fashion and so that has led to a large

00:53:57.329 --> 00:53:57.339
fashion and so that has led to a large
 

00:53:57.339 --> 00:53:59.670

number of meetings and and and reports

00:53:59.670 --> 00:53:59.680
number of meetings and and and reports
 

00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:00.959
number of meetings and and and reports
that have been generated but I wanted to

that have been generated but I wanted to
 

00:54:00.969 --> 00:54:02.839
that have been generated but I wanted to
mention one in particular which is the

00:54:14.499 --> 00:54:16.469
of recommendations and I think the
interesting thing there is that the

00:54:16.469 --> 00:54:16.479
interesting thing there is that the
 

00:54:16.479 --> 00:54:18.989
interesting thing there is that the
recommendations were to proceed with

00:54:18.989 --> 00:54:18.999
recommendations were to proceed with
 

00:54:18.999 --> 00:54:22.289
recommendations were to proceed with
caution but not to necessarily stop and

00:54:22.289 --> 00:54:22.299
caution but not to necessarily stop and
 

00:54:22.299 --> 00:54:23.759
caution but not to necessarily stop and
I think what we've seen just in the last

00:54:23.759 --> 00:54:23.769
I think what we've seen just in the last
 

00:54:23.769 --> 00:54:26.459
I think what we've seen just in the last
few months in fact is that groups are

00:54:26.459 --> 00:54:26.469
few months in fact is that groups are
 

00:54:26.469 --> 00:54:29.219
few months in fact is that groups are
moving ahead with sort of testing the

00:54:29.219 --> 00:54:29.229
moving ahead with sort of testing the
 

00:54:29.229 --> 00:54:31.589
moving ahead with sort of testing the
validity and the and the the technical

00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599
validity and the and the the technical
 

00:54:31.599 --> 00:54:33.660
validity and the and the the technical
aspects of editing in embryos and the

00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:33.670
aspects of editing in embryos and the
 

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:35.400
aspects of editing in embryos and the
jury's out we don't really understand

00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:35.410
jury's out we don't really understand
 

00:54:35.410 --> 00:54:37.559
jury's out we don't really understand
fully what how these technologies are

00:54:37.559 --> 00:54:37.569
fully what how these technologies are
 

00:54:37.569 --> 00:54:39.690
fully what how these technologies are
going to work yet in embryos but I think

00:54:39.690 --> 00:54:39.700
going to work yet in embryos but I think
 

00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:41.279
going to work yet in embryos but I think
it's a technology that's coming and it

00:54:41.279 --> 00:54:41.289
it's a technology that's coming and it
 

00:54:41.289 --> 00:54:44.190
it's a technology that's coming and it
really does I think you know illustrate

00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:44.200
really does I think you know illustrate
 

00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:45.989
really does I think you know illustrate
to all of us that this is something that

00:54:45.989 --> 00:54:45.999
to all of us that this is something that
 

00:54:45.999 --> 00:54:47.710
to all of us that this is something that
is not science fiction

00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:47.720
is not science fiction
 

00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:48.940
is not science fiction
anymore right we're really it's really

00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:48.950
anymore right we're really it's really
 

00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:51.190
anymore right we're really it's really
it's a technology that's really almost

00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:51.200
it's a technology that's really almost
 

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:52.570
it's a technology that's really almost
here and we have to be thinking about

00:54:52.570 --> 00:54:52.580
here and we have to be thinking about
 

00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:54.580
here and we have to be thinking about
the implications and how we would feel

00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:54.590
the implications and how we would feel
 

00:54:54.590 --> 00:54:56.080
the implications and how we would feel
about this being used in in vitro

00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:56.090
about this being used in in vitro
 

00:54:56.090 --> 00:54:58.870
about this being used in in vitro
fertilization clinics for example and I

we also do a lot of work on the ethics
and societal implications of gene

00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:22.070
and societal implications of gene
 

00:55:22.070 --> 00:55:23.859

now to kind of help them talk to their

00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:33.890
now to kind of help them talk to their
 

00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:35.470
now to kind of help them talk to their
students and teach them about gene

00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:35.480
students and teach them about gene
 

00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:38.080
students and teach them about gene
editing but wait we're making a CRISPR

00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:38.090
editing but wait we're making a CRISPR
 

00:55:38.090 --> 00:55:39.220

through add gene org for example that
 

00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:43.839
through add gene org for example that
will be for teaching kids about how gene

00:55:43.839 --> 00:55:43.849
will be for teaching kids about how gene
 

00:55:43.849 --> 00:55:46.720
will be for teaching kids about how gene
editing works and that's it I just want

00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:46.730
editing works and that's it I just want
 

00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:50.320
editing works and that's it I just want

CRISPR Castine and of course we couldn't

00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:22.520
CRISPR Castine and of course we couldn't
 

00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:23.920
CRISPR Castine and of course we couldn't
do anything without funding and we're

00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:23.930
do anything without funding and we're
 

00:56:23.930 --> 00:56:27.280

CRISPR in my lab that helped us get
 

00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:40.000
CRISPR in my lab that helped us get
started on this whole wild adventure and

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:40.010
started on this whole wild adventure and
 

00:56:40.010 --> 00:56:59.790
started on this whole wild adventure and
thank you very much

we have some time for questions hello

00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:16.680
 

00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:19.110
so one of the most remarkable things

00:57:19.110 --> 00:57:19.120
so one of the most remarkable things
 

00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:22.020
so one of the most remarkable things
about this search and and cleave

00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:22.030
about this search and and cleave
 

00:57:22.030 --> 00:57:24.900
about this search and and cleave
mechanism is just how big the search

00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:24.910
mechanism is just how big the search
 

00:57:24.910 --> 00:57:29.040
mechanism is just how big the search
space is so can you say something about

00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:29.050
space is so can you say something about
 

00:57:29.050 --> 00:57:32.310
space is so can you say something about
how how long it takes and how what sort

00:57:32.310 --> 00:57:32.320
how how long it takes and how what sort
 

00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:35.130
how how long it takes and how what sort
of error rate or redundancy there is I

00:57:35.130 --> 00:57:35.140
of error rate or redundancy there is I
 

00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:37.350
of error rate or redundancy there is I
mean you know in the human genome say

00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:37.360
mean you know in the human genome say
 

00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:40.490
mean you know in the human genome say
there's three billion nucleotides and

00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:40.500
there's three billion nucleotides and
 

00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:43.260
there's three billion nucleotides and
that's a lot of searching what's the

00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:43.270
that's a lot of searching what's the
 

00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:45.630
that's a lot of searching what's the
sort of kinetics of such an approach for

00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:45.640
sort of kinetics of such an approach for
 

00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:48.120
sort of kinetics of such an approach for
the cell yeah it's a great question and

00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:48.130
the cell yeah it's a great question and
 

00:57:48.130 --> 00:57:49.410
the cell yeah it's a great question and
I don't I don't really have a great

00:57:49.410 --> 00:57:49.420
I don't I don't really have a great
 

00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:52.170
I don't I don't really have a great
answer for you we've done some work with

00:57:52.170 --> 00:57:52.180
answer for you we've done some work with
 

00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:54.060
answer for you we've done some work with
live cell imaging where you can

00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:54.070
live cell imaging where you can
 

00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:56.790
live cell imaging where you can
fluorescently label cast 9 and then

00:57:56.790 --> 00:57:56.800
fluorescently label cast 9 and then
 

00:57:56.800 --> 00:58:00.060
fluorescently label cast 9 and then
watch its kinetic behavior inside the

00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:00.070
watch its kinetic behavior inside the
 

00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:02.010
watch its kinetic behavior inside the
nucleus of a living cell we've done this

00:58:02.010 --> 00:58:02.020
nucleus of a living cell we've done this
 

00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:03.990
nucleus of a living cell we've done this
in Mouse cells and what those

00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:04.000
in Mouse cells and what those
 

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.420
in Mouse cells and what those
experiments show is that it's a protein

00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:06.430
experiments show is that it's a protein
 

00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:08.580
experiments show is that it's a protein
that has really rapid kinetics so it's

00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:08.590
that has really rapid kinetics so it's
 

00:58:08.590 --> 00:58:10.530
that has really rapid kinetics so it's
search it's certainly moving around the

00:58:10.530 --> 00:58:10.540
search it's certainly moving around the
 

00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:13.770
search it's certainly moving around the
DNA very quickly it's able to get into

00:58:13.770 --> 00:58:13.780
DNA very quickly it's able to get into
 

00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:16.200
DNA very quickly it's able to get into
even really highly compacted parts of

00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:16.210
even really highly compacted parts of
 

00:58:16.210 --> 00:58:20.010
even really highly compacted parts of
the genome with apparent kinetic ease we

00:58:20.010 --> 00:58:20.020
the genome with apparent kinetic ease we
 

00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:22.110
the genome with apparent kinetic ease we
don't know exactly how that operates at

00:58:22.110 --> 00:58:22.120
don't know exactly how that operates at
 

00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:24.330
don't know exactly how that operates at
a molecular level but we haven't been

00:58:24.330 --> 00:58:24.340
a molecular level but we haven't been
 

00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:26.520
a molecular level but we haven't been
able to really calculate the time it

00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:26.530
able to really calculate the time it
 

00:58:26.530 --> 00:58:28.500
able to really calculate the time it
takes you know you'd love to know that

00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:28.510
takes you know you'd love to know that
 

00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:29.790
takes you know you'd love to know that
right like how long does it take one

00:58:29.790 --> 00:58:29.800
right like how long does it take one
 

00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:32.700
right like how long does it take one
molecule of cassadine to find a target

00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:32.710
molecule of cassadine to find a target
 

00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:34.620
molecule of cassadine to find a target
site in the human genome for example and

00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:34.630
site in the human genome for example and
 

00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:36.000
site in the human genome for example and
it's been really hard to actually

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:36.010
it's been really hard to actually
 

00:58:36.010 --> 00:58:38.400
it's been really hard to actually
calculate that because we don't really

00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:38.410
calculate that because we don't really
 

00:58:38.410 --> 00:58:41.550
calculate that because we don't really
know how many molecules are in the

00:58:41.550 --> 00:58:41.560
know how many molecules are in the
 

00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:43.650
know how many molecules are in the
nucleus right so when we do an

00:58:43.650 --> 00:58:43.660
nucleus right so when we do an
 

00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:45.930
nucleus right so when we do an
experiment like what I described with

00:58:45.930 --> 00:58:45.940
experiment like what I described with
 

00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:48.660
experiment like what I described with
the the brain cell Nerone neuron

00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:48.670
the the brain cell Nerone neuron
 

00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:51.840
the the brain cell Nerone neuron
neuronal cell editing if we do that in a

00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:51.850
neuronal cell editing if we do that in a
 

00:58:51.850 --> 00:58:53.850
neuronal cell editing if we do that in a
dish where we add the protein to the

00:58:53.850 --> 00:58:53.860
dish where we add the protein to the
 

00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:56.400
dish where we add the protein to the
cells we see evidence for editing within

00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:56.410
cells we see evidence for editing within
 

00:58:56.410 --> 00:58:58.920
cells we see evidence for editing within
about two hours of adding the cast line

00:58:58.920 --> 00:58:58.930
about two hours of adding the cast line
 

00:58:58.930 --> 00:59:00.510
about two hours of adding the cast line
to the cells so that sounds like wow

00:59:00.510 --> 00:59:00.520
to the cells so that sounds like wow
 

00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:02.550
to the cells so that sounds like wow
that's pretty fast but what we don't

00:59:02.550 --> 00:59:02.560
that's pretty fast but what we don't
 

00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:04.470
that's pretty fast but what we don't
know is how many molecules actually got

00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480
know is how many molecules actually got
 

00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:06.270
know is how many molecules actually got
into the cell nucleus that are doing

00:59:06.270 --> 00:59:06.280
into the cell nucleus that are doing
 

00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:08.250
into the cell nucleus that are doing
that searching and likewise we don't

00:59:08.250 --> 00:59:08.260
that searching and likewise we don't
 

00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:11.280
that searching and likewise we don't
really know what the kinetics are of

00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:11.290
really know what the kinetics are of
 

00:59:11.290 --> 00:59:13.710
really know what the kinetics are of
interacting with off targets so sort of

00:59:13.710 --> 00:59:13.720
interacting with off targets so sort of
 

00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:15.210
interacting with off targets so sort of
you know closely matched but not

00:59:15.210 --> 00:59:15.220
you know closely matched but not
 

00:59:15.220 --> 00:59:17.460
you know closely matched but not
perfectly matched DNA sequences except

00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:17.470
perfectly matched DNA sequences except
 

00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:18.720
perfectly matched DNA sequences except
to say that there's a lot of evidence

00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:18.730
to say that there's a lot of evidence
 

00:59:18.730 --> 00:59:22.230
to say that there's a lot of evidence
now from many labs that there's a lot of

00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:22.240
now from many labs that there's a lot of
 

00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:24.210
now from many labs that there's a lot of
that going on but most of the time those

00:59:24.210 --> 00:59:24.220
that going on but most of the time those
 

00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:26.010
that going on but most of the time those
sites don't get cut so there's a

00:59:26.010 --> 00:59:26.020
sites don't get cut so there's a
 

00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:29.230
sites don't get cut so there's a
distinction between cast 9 binding

00:59:29.230 --> 00:59:29.240
distinction between cast 9 binding
 

00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:30.790
distinction between cast 9 binding
cast line cutting so my guess is you

00:59:30.790 --> 00:59:30.800
cast line cutting so my guess is you
 

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:32.380
cast line cutting so my guess is you
probably have to have a fair number of

00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:32.390
probably have to have a fair number of
 

00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:34.390
probably have to have a fair number of
cast nine molecules in the nucleus

00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:34.400
cast nine molecules in the nucleus
 

00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:36.850
cast nine molecules in the nucleus
because a lot of them may get hung up at

00:59:36.850 --> 00:59:36.860
because a lot of them may get hung up at
 

00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:38.230
because a lot of them may get hung up at
places in the DNA where they're not

00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:38.240
places in the DNA where they're not
 

00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:45.850
places in the DNA where they're not
actually making a cut actually that was

00:59:45.850 --> 00:59:45.860
actually making a cut actually that was
 

00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:47.950
actually making a cut actually that was
very closely related to my question it

00:59:47.950 --> 00:59:47.960
very closely related to my question it
 

00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:49.600
very closely related to my question it
was more about well the number of

00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:49.610
was more about well the number of
 

00:59:49.610 --> 00:59:53.590
was more about well the number of
molecules but how many pieces of RNA do

00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:53.600
molecules but how many pieces of RNA do
 

00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:55.000
molecules but how many pieces of RNA do
you think cast nine has to bump into

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:55.010
you think cast nine has to bump into
 

00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:57.130
you think cast nine has to bump into
before it finds the right one and then

00:59:57.130 --> 00:59:57.140
before it finds the right one and then
 

00:59:57.140 --> 01:00:01.090
before it finds the right one and then
go find its target area on the DNA how

01:00:01.090 --> 01:00:01.100
go find its target area on the DNA how
 

01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:03.850
go find its target area on the DNA how
many pieces of RNA or DNA yeah like I

01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:03.860
many pieces of RNA or DNA yeah like I
 

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:05.230
many pieces of RNA or DNA yeah like I
said my question was very similar to

01:00:05.230 --> 01:00:05.240
said my question was very similar to
 

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:08.500
said my question was very similar to
hers yeah so so once it once it finds

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:08.510
hers yeah so so once it once it finds
 

01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:10.810
hers yeah so so once it once it finds
its RNA guide right than that that

01:00:10.810 --> 01:00:10.820
its RNA guide right than that that
 

01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:13.330
its RNA guide right than that that
complex seems to be very high affinity

01:00:13.330 --> 01:00:13.340
complex seems to be very high affinity
 

01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:15.550
complex seems to be very high affinity
it doesn't really fall apart until it

01:00:15.550 --> 01:00:15.560
it doesn't really fall apart until it
 

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:18.180
it doesn't really fall apart until it
gets you know degraded so that's a very

01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:18.190
gets you know degraded so that's a very
 

01:00:18.190 --> 01:00:21.340
gets you know degraded so that's a very
tight interaction but the binding then

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:21.350
tight interaction but the binding then
 

01:00:21.350 --> 01:00:24.220
tight interaction but the binding then
then searching and cutting DNA seems to

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:24.230
then searching and cutting DNA seems to
 

01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:26.260
then searching and cutting DNA seems to
have different kinetics it's really

01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:26.270
have different kinetics it's really
 

01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:29.200
have different kinetics it's really
rapidly binding and releasing DNA and

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:29.210
rapidly binding and releasing DNA and
 

01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:30.730
rapidly binding and releasing DNA and
that's probably essential for its search

01:00:30.730 --> 01:00:30.740
that's probably essential for its search
 

01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:32.380
that's probably essential for its search
mechanism and I didn't I didn't mention

01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:32.390
mechanism and I didn't I didn't mention
 

01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:34.810
mechanism and I didn't I didn't mention
this but we have data showing that it

01:00:34.810 --> 01:00:34.820
this but we have data showing that it
 

01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:38.170
this but we have data showing that it
doesn't bind and slide along DNA to find

01:00:38.170 --> 01:00:38.180
doesn't bind and slide along DNA to find
 

01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:39.760
doesn't bind and slide along DNA to find
a target site rather it's binding and

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:39.770
a target site rather it's binding and
 

01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:41.470
a target site rather it's binding and
releasing DNA very quickly and that's

01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:41.480
releasing DNA very quickly and that's
 

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:43.300
releasing DNA very quickly and that's
actually probably a good thing because I

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:43.310
actually probably a good thing because I
 

01:00:43.310 --> 01:00:45.520
actually probably a good thing because I
think if it were a process of enzyme

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:45.530
think if it were a process of enzyme
 

01:00:45.530 --> 01:00:46.810
think if it were a process of enzyme
that could bind and slide it would

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:46.820
that could bind and slide it would
 

01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:48.880
that could bind and slide it would
probably immediately get stuck and sort

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:48.890
probably immediately get stuck and sort
 

01:00:48.890 --> 01:00:51.520
probably immediately get stuck and sort
of hung up in chromatin for example but

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:51.530
of hung up in chromatin for example but
 

01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:53.050
of hung up in chromatin for example but
that doesn't happen I think because of

01:00:53.050 --> 01:00:53.060
that doesn't happen I think because of
 

01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:56.800
that doesn't happen I think because of
this rapid release kind of action I see

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:56.810
this rapid release kind of action I see
 

01:00:56.810 --> 01:00:58.450
this rapid release kind of action I see
I was really curious whether you thought

01:00:58.450 --> 01:00:58.460
I was really curious whether you thought
 

01:00:58.460 --> 01:00:59.740
I was really curious whether you thought
it was existing in some sort of

01:00:59.740 --> 01:00:59.750
it was existing in some sort of
 

01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:01.630
it was existing in some sort of
scaffolding complex but sounds like not

01:01:01.630 --> 01:01:01.640
scaffolding complex but sounds like not
 

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:03.730
scaffolding complex but sounds like not
so with the speed of things that's what

01:01:03.730 --> 01:01:03.740
so with the speed of things that's what
 

01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:08.849
so with the speed of things that's what
we think okay thank you

01:01:08.849 --> 01:01:08.859
 

01:01:08.859 --> 01:01:11.499
keep this one going did you say at the

01:01:11.499 --> 01:01:11.509
keep this one going did you say at the
 

01:01:11.509 --> 01:01:15.309
keep this one going did you say at the
beginning that purified DNA purified

01:01:15.309 --> 01:01:15.319

that's right okay yeah hi thank you very

01:01:24.339 --> 01:01:24.349
that's right okay yeah hi thank you very
 

01:01:24.349 --> 01:01:26.589
that's right okay yeah hi thank you very
much great talk and thanks for making

01:01:26.589 --> 01:01:26.599
much great talk and thanks for making
 

01:01:26.599 --> 01:01:28.720
much great talk and thanks for making
the trip to CMU what are the

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:28.730
the trip to CMU what are the
 

01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:32.410
the trip to CMU what are the
implications for the the epigenome it

01:01:32.410 --> 01:01:32.420
implications for the the epigenome it
 

01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:33.819
implications for the the epigenome it
all of this I mean I'm sitting here

01:01:33.819 --> 01:01:33.829
all of this I mean I'm sitting here
 

01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:36.640
all of this I mean I'm sitting here
thinking well does it matter and does

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:36.650
thinking well does it matter and does
 

01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:38.499
thinking well does it matter and does
you know the epigenome wraps around the

01:01:38.499 --> 01:01:38.509
you know the epigenome wraps around the
 

01:01:38.509 --> 01:01:43.870
you know the epigenome wraps around the
DNA and controls it and you can activate

01:01:43.870 --> 01:01:43.880
DNA and controls it and you can activate
 

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:46.120
DNA and controls it and you can activate
a DNA by for example methylation loss

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:46.130
a DNA by for example methylation loss
 

01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:48.190
a DNA by for example methylation loss
but how did how does this alt have you

01:01:48.190 --> 01:01:48.200
but how did how does this alt have you
 

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.779
but how did how does this alt have you
thought about that how it ties together

01:01:49.779 --> 01:01:49.789
thought about that how it ties together
 

01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:51.970
thought about that how it ties together
yeah so so she's asking about the

01:01:51.970 --> 01:01:51.980
yeah so so she's asking about the
 

01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:54.249
yeah so so she's asking about the
epigenome meaning DNA that's been

01:01:54.249 --> 01:01:54.259
epigenome meaning DNA that's been
 

01:01:54.259 --> 01:01:57.460
epigenome meaning DNA that's been
chemically methylated for example and

01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:57.470
chemically methylated for example and
 

01:01:57.470 --> 01:02:00.370
chemically methylated for example and
and ways that the cell controls the

01:02:00.370 --> 01:02:00.380
and ways that the cell controls the
 

01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:02.200
and ways that the cell controls the
expression of genes without actually

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:02.210
expression of genes without actually
 

01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:04.599
expression of genes without actually
modifying the actual DNA sequence and

01:02:04.599 --> 01:02:04.609
modifying the actual DNA sequence and
 

01:02:04.609 --> 01:02:06.849
modifying the actual DNA sequence and
you know the interesting thing about

01:02:06.849 --> 01:02:06.859
you know the interesting thing about
 

01:02:06.859 --> 01:02:09.430
you know the interesting thing about
caste 9 is that it's a it's a great

01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:09.440
caste 9 is that it's a it's a great
 

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:11.579
caste 9 is that it's a it's a great
platform for any kind of DNA

01:02:11.579 --> 01:02:11.589
platform for any kind of DNA
 

01:02:11.589 --> 01:02:14.259

manipulation site-specific manipulation
 

01:02:14.269 --> 01:02:16.029
manipulation site-specific manipulation
and you know there's been a number of

01:02:16.029 --> 01:02:16.039
and you know there's been a number of
 

01:02:16.039 --> 01:02:18.249
and you know there's been a number of
nice papers on this not from us from

01:02:18.249 --> 01:02:18.259
nice papers on this not from us from
 

01:02:18.259 --> 01:02:19.630
nice papers on this not from us from
from many others there's a beautiful

01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:19.640
from many others there's a beautiful
 

01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:21.099
from many others there's a beautiful
paper that just came out and sell from

01:02:21.099 --> 01:02:21.109
paper that just came out and sell from
 

01:02:21.109 --> 01:02:23.229
paper that just came out and sell from
Rudolf jaenisch for example where he

01:02:23.229 --> 01:02:23.239
Rudolf jaenisch for example where he
 

01:02:23.239 --> 01:02:25.710
Rudolf jaenisch for example where he
showed that you could do really nice

01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:25.720
showed that you could do really nice
 

01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:29.499
showed that you could do really nice
epigenetic modification of the genome in

01:02:29.499 --> 01:02:29.509
epigenetic modification of the genome in
 

01:02:29.509 --> 01:02:32.229
epigenetic modification of the genome in
a targeted fashion using a modified

01:02:32.229 --> 01:02:32.239
a targeted fashion using a modified
 

01:02:32.239 --> 01:02:35.140
a targeted fashion using a modified
version of caste 9 so I think that opens

01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:35.150
version of caste 9 so I think that opens
 

01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:36.999
version of caste 9 so I think that opens
the door to yet another whole

01:02:36.999 --> 01:02:37.009
the door to yet another whole
 

01:02:37.009 --> 01:02:38.979
the door to yet another whole
interesting realm of biology where we

01:02:38.979 --> 01:02:38.989
interesting realm of biology where we
 

01:02:38.989 --> 01:02:41.710
interesting realm of biology where we
can really explore how much epigenetic

01:02:41.710 --> 01:02:41.720
can really explore how much epigenetic
 

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:44.319
can really explore how much epigenetic
changes are controlling things and you

01:02:44.319 --> 01:02:44.329
changes are controlling things and you
 

01:02:44.329 --> 01:02:46.089
changes are controlling things and you
know in the end I wonder if that might

01:02:46.089 --> 01:02:46.099
know in the end I wonder if that might
 

01:02:46.099 --> 01:02:49.470
know in the end I wonder if that might
actually be a better way to do clinical

01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:49.480
actually be a better way to do clinical
 

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:52.089
actually be a better way to do clinical
sort of applications because you don't

01:02:52.089 --> 01:02:52.099
sort of applications because you don't
 

01:02:52.099 --> 01:02:54.759
sort of applications because you don't
have to worry about DNA recombination

01:02:54.759 --> 01:02:54.769
have to worry about DNA recombination
 

01:02:54.769 --> 01:02:55.749
have to worry about DNA recombination
and things like that

01:02:55.749 --> 01:02:55.759
and things like that
 

01:02:55.759 --> 01:02:59.799
and things like that
due to cutting or cancer exactly so

01:02:59.799 --> 01:02:59.809
due to cutting or cancer exactly so
 

01:02:59.809 --> 01:03:01.569
due to cutting or cancer exactly so
right thinking about cell proliferation

01:03:01.569 --> 01:03:01.579
right thinking about cell proliferation
 

01:03:01.579 --> 01:03:07.799
right thinking about cell proliferation
right we have time for one more question

01:03:07.799 --> 01:03:07.809
 

01:03:07.809 --> 01:03:13.630
brief question so I've been looking and

01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:13.640
brief question so I've been looking and
 

01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:16.690
brief question so I've been looking and
it seems that most of the cast proteins

01:03:16.690 --> 01:03:16.700
it seems that most of the cast proteins
 

01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:18.160
it seems that most of the cast proteins
that are in use for gene editing are

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:18.170
that are in use for gene editing are
 

01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:20.559
that are in use for gene editing are
from human pathogens like a

01:03:20.559 --> 01:03:20.569
from human pathogens like a
 

01:03:20.569 --> 01:03:21.829
from human pathogens like a
Staphylococcus in years

01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839
Staphylococcus in years
 

01:03:21.839 --> 01:03:24.289
Staphylococcus in years
but from what I know it was originally

01:03:24.289 --> 01:03:24.299
but from what I know it was originally
 

01:03:24.299 --> 01:03:26.299
but from what I know it was originally
discovered in archaea is there a reason

01:03:26.299 --> 01:03:26.309
discovered in archaea is there a reason
 

01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:29.449
discovered in archaea is there a reason
that the the human pathogens are in use

01:03:29.449 --> 01:03:29.459
that the the human pathogens are in use
 

01:03:29.459 --> 01:03:32.239
that the the human pathogens are in use
more than the other versions so crazily

01:03:32.239 --> 01:03:32.249
more than the other versions so crazily
 

01:03:32.249 --> 01:03:35.630
more than the other versions so crazily
enough up until very recent some very

01:03:35.630 --> 01:03:35.640
enough up until very recent some very
 

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:36.829
enough up until very recent some very
recent work that we did with Jill

01:03:36.829 --> 01:03:36.839
recent work that we did with Jill
 

01:03:36.839 --> 01:03:39.349
recent work that we did with Jill
Banfield there were no examples of cast

01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359
Banfield there were no examples of cast
 

01:03:39.359 --> 01:03:41.959
Banfield there were no examples of cast
line in any archaea so there's lots and

01:03:41.959 --> 01:03:41.969
line in any archaea so there's lots and
 

01:03:41.969 --> 01:03:43.999
line in any archaea so there's lots and
lots of CRISPR systems in archaea but no

01:03:43.999 --> 01:03:44.009
lots of CRISPR systems in archaea but no
 

01:03:44.009 --> 01:03:45.499
lots of CRISPR systems in archaea but no
no cast lines

01:03:45.499 --> 01:03:45.509
no cast lines
 

01:03:45.509 --> 01:03:47.269
no cast lines
none of this type right so they're

01:03:47.269 --> 01:03:47.279
none of this type right so they're
 

01:03:47.279 --> 01:03:49.400
none of this type right so they're
they're mostly only in bacteria and

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:49.410
they're mostly only in bacteria and
 

01:03:49.410 --> 01:03:51.709
they're mostly only in bacteria and
furthermore for reasons that are not

01:03:51.709 --> 01:03:51.719
furthermore for reasons that are not
 

01:03:51.719 --> 01:03:55.069
furthermore for reasons that are not
entirely understood yet the ones that

01:03:55.069 --> 01:03:55.079
entirely understood yet the ones that
 

01:03:55.079 --> 01:03:57.439
entirely understood yet the ones that
have been the most effective for gene

01:03:57.439 --> 01:03:57.449
have been the most effective for gene
 

01:03:57.449 --> 01:03:58.759
have been the most effective for gene
editing that at least the ones have been

01:03:58.759 --> 01:03:58.769
editing that at least the ones have been
 

01:03:58.769 --> 01:04:01.189
editing that at least the ones have been
tested for that so far have been those

01:04:01.189 --> 01:04:01.199
tested for that so far have been those
 

01:04:01.199 --> 01:04:03.650
tested for that so far have been those
coming from these pathogenic bacteria

01:04:03.650 --> 01:04:03.660
coming from these pathogenic bacteria
 

01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:06.529
coming from these pathogenic bacteria
and I don't I can't explain why that is

01:04:06.529 --> 01:04:06.539
and I don't I can't explain why that is
 

01:04:06.539 --> 01:04:07.969
and I don't I can't explain why that is
but that's just that's the observation

01:04:07.969 --> 01:04:07.979
but that's just that's the observation
 

01:04:07.979 --> 01:04:10.969
but that's just that's the observation
so you might be bringing this up because

01:04:10.969 --> 01:04:10.979
so you might be bringing this up because
 

01:04:10.979 --> 01:04:13.429
so you might be bringing this up because
there was recent work posted on a

01:04:13.429 --> 01:04:13.439
there was recent work posted on a
 

01:04:13.439 --> 01:04:15.620
there was recent work posted on a
preprint server the bio archive that

01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:15.630
preprint server the bio archive that
 

01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:18.229
preprint server the bio archive that
showed that people have some people at

01:04:18.229 --> 01:04:18.239
showed that people have some people at
 

01:04:18.239 --> 01:04:21.410
showed that people have some people at
least have an Tabo antibodies to these

01:04:21.410 --> 01:04:21.420
least have an Tabo antibodies to these
 

01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:23.209
least have an Tabo antibodies to these
cast line proteins because maybe they've

01:04:23.209 --> 01:04:23.219
cast line proteins because maybe they've
 

01:04:23.219 --> 01:04:25.160
cast line proteins because maybe they've
been exposed to those bacteria over

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:25.170
been exposed to those bacteria over
 

01:04:25.170 --> 01:04:27.229
been exposed to those bacteria over
there the you know they're a lifetime

01:04:27.229 --> 01:04:27.239
there the you know they're a lifetime
 

01:04:27.239 --> 01:04:30.009
there the you know they're a lifetime
and nobody knows yet if those levels of

01:04:30.009 --> 01:04:30.019
and nobody knows yet if those levels of
 

01:04:30.019 --> 01:04:32.689
and nobody knows yet if those levels of
antibodies will you know interfere with

01:04:32.689 --> 01:04:32.699
antibodies will you know interfere with
 

01:04:32.699 --> 01:04:35.359
antibodies will you know interfere with
with cast 9 but even if they did I would

01:04:35.359 --> 01:04:35.369
with cast 9 but even if they did I would
 

01:04:35.369 --> 01:04:37.130
with cast 9 but even if they did I would
argue that I think there's lots of other

01:04:37.130 --> 01:04:37.140
argue that I think there's lots of other
 

01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:39.620
argue that I think there's lots of other
cast lines in nature that are yet to be

01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:39.630
cast lines in nature that are yet to be
 

01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:41.689
cast lines in nature that are yet to be
tested for this that could be useful and

01:04:41.689 --> 01:04:41.699
tested for this that could be useful and
 

01:04:41.699 --> 01:04:44.269
tested for this that could be useful and
also there's just a huge amount of going

01:04:44.269 --> 01:04:44.279
also there's just a huge amount of going
 

01:04:44.279 --> 01:04:46.939
also there's just a huge amount of going
on right now in you know various kinds

01:04:46.939 --> 01:04:46.949
on right now in you know various kinds
 

01:04:46.949 --> 01:04:48.620
on right now in you know various kinds
of bioengineering laboratories that are

01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:48.630
of bioengineering laboratories that are
 

01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:50.569
of bioengineering laboratories that are
engineering these proteins in different

01:04:50.569 --> 01:04:50.579
engineering these proteins in different
 

01:04:50.579 --> 01:04:54.019
engineering these proteins in different
ways so I think that's not likely to be

01:04:54.019 --> 01:04:54.029
ways so I think that's not likely to be
 

01:04:54.029 --> 01:04:59.299
ways so I think that's not likely to be
a showstopper for this I hope that you

01:04:59.299 --> 01:04:59.309
a showstopper for this I hope that you
 

01:04:59.309 --> 01:05:00.620
a showstopper for this I hope that you
will be able to stay for the reception

01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:00.630
will be able to stay for the reception
 

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:04.590
will be able to stay for the reception
which is easy to find right in this room

01:05:04.590 --> 01:05:04.600
which is easy to find right in this room
 

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:08.260
which is easy to find right in this room
