00:00:00.332 --> 00:00:02.260
- We're asked, "Which of
the following vectors have

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.767
"the same x component as vector a?"

00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:07.966
And they tell us to
"Select all that apply"

00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.761
This is vector a right over here

00:00:09.761 --> 00:00:12.865
and we only have to concern
ourselves with the x component.

00:00:12.865 --> 00:00:14.351
That's what they're asking us about.

00:00:14.351 --> 00:00:16.416
Let's think about what
it's x component is.

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:18.200
We're starting at this
point right over here,

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.120
which has an x value of negative two and

00:00:23.542 --> 00:00:25.000
we're going from x equals negative two

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.316
to x is equal to negative five.

00:00:27.316 --> 00:00:29.986
Our change in x, another
way to think about it,

00:00:29.986 --> 00:00:31.635
our x component.

00:00:31.635 --> 00:00:34.154
We're going from negative
two to negative five.

00:00:34.154 --> 00:00:37.543
Our x value goes down by three.

00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:43.209
Our change in x is
equal to negative three.

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:45.670
That would also be the
x component of vector a.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.448
We could say that vector a is equal to,

00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:53.213
it's x component is negative three.

00:00:53.213 --> 00:00:55.047
We're not concerning
ourselves with our y component

00:00:55.047 --> 00:00:58.483
but we see that our y goes up by one.

00:00:58.483 --> 00:01:00.387
So it's negative three comma one

00:01:00.387 --> 00:01:04.190
but we just care about our x component.

00:01:04.428 --> 00:01:06.088
Let's think about what other vectors here

00:01:06.088 --> 00:01:07.759
have an x component of negative three.

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:09.033
That, if we start at our initial point

00:01:09.033 --> 00:01:11.003
and go to the terminal point,

00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:13.224
our x value has gone down by three.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.664
We're gonna start with vector b here.

00:01:17.664 --> 00:01:19.803
And let's see, if we start there

00:01:20.815 --> 00:01:23.713
our x value is three at our initial point,

00:01:23.713 --> 00:01:26.008
our starting point for that vector.

00:01:26.008 --> 00:01:29.835
Then, to go to the x value
of the terminal point

00:01:29.835 --> 00:01:33.733
we once again went down by three.

00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:35.335
This has the same x component.

00:01:35.335 --> 00:01:39.068
Vector b is going to be

00:01:39.068 --> 00:01:41.524
negative three comma something.

00:01:42.226 --> 00:01:44.014
I will select that one.

00:01:44.014 --> 00:01:45.893
Let's think about vector c.

00:01:45.893 --> 00:01:49.795
Vector c starts here
at x equals negative 4

00:01:49.795 --> 00:01:52.415
and then it ends at x equals negative one.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.063
It's x component is going to look,

00:01:56.063 --> 00:01:57.254
one way to think about it, our change

00:01:57.254 --> 00:01:59.477
in x is going to look like this.

00:01:59.477 --> 00:02:01.265
You might be tempted to
say this is the same thing.

00:02:01.265 --> 00:02:03.308
It has a length of three but notice,

00:02:03.308 --> 00:02:04.864
we're not going three to the left,

00:02:04.864 --> 00:02:07.697
the way that we did in
vector a or in vector b.

00:02:07.697 --> 00:02:09.462
We're going three to the right.

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:13.364
Here our change in x is positive three

00:02:13.364 --> 00:02:16.452
and so vector c is going to be

00:02:16.452 --> 00:02:19.912
positive three comma something.

00:02:19.912 --> 00:02:21.328
It's not gonna be vector c.

00:02:21.328 --> 00:02:23.023
Now let's look at vector d.

00:02:23.023 --> 00:02:26.226
Vector d starts over here, it's x value is

00:02:26.226 --> 00:02:28.363
negative six and we're going from

00:02:28.363 --> 00:02:32.565
x equals negative six to
x equals negative nine.

00:02:32.565 --> 00:02:34.609
Once again we have gone down.

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:37.442
Our change in x is negative three.

00:02:37.442 --> 00:02:39.254
That has the same x component.

00:02:39.254 --> 00:02:41.206
If I were to say vector d

00:02:41.206 --> 00:02:44.341
I would say it's negative
three comma something.

00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:45.618
I haven't figured out what these are

00:02:45.618 --> 00:02:47.582
but I don't need to for this problem.

00:02:47.582 --> 00:02:49.958
So vector d also has the same x component,

00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:53.272
an x component of negative
three and we're done.
