00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.780
Let's look at the answer to our DRAM
technology quiz which was asking us,

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.400
why not use a normal transistor and
a capacitor when making DRAM?

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.590
Is it because trench
cell is easier to make?

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.220
This is not true.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.360
The trench cell is not easier to make.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.660
It requires us to bury
something into the silicon.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.040
So this one is actually incorrect.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.940
Trench cells are more difficult to
make than capacitors, technologically.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.170
Trench cell is more reliable.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.810
This is also not true.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.350
Trench cell let's us make
cheaper DRAM chips.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.830
It looks like trench cells
are more difficult to make, so

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.619
the chips will be more expensive.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.380
But remember that the cost
of a chip grows quickly

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.100
when the area is increased and decreases
quickly when the area is decreased.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.610
The trench cell occupies a lot less
area on the chip than the transistor and

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.830
the capacitor normally would.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.590
So, if we want to build a chip that has
the same number of bit with the trench

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.480
cell, or this way, the trench
cell results in much smaller and

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.230
thus way, way less expensive chips.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.140
So this really is the correct answer.
