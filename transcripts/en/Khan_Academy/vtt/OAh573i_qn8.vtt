00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.920
Let's do some more matrix
multiplication examples,

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.020
because I think it is all about
seeing as many examples

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.220
as possible.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.040
So let's do what may seem to be
a more difficult problem,

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.520
and it might not be even
clear that we can

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.740
multiply these matrices.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.760
And maybe that's the first thing
we should think about.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.635
So let's say I wanted to
multiply the matrix-- I'll do

00:00:18.635 --> 00:00:22.670
it relatively small so we
don't run out of space.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:33.510
3, 1, 2, minus 2, 0, 5.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:43.320
Let's say I want to multiply
that times the matrix, minus

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:51.900
1, 0, 2, 3, 5, 5.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.360
I'm just making up
these numbers.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.000
So the first thing you might
be wondering is, well can I

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.500
even multiply these matrices?

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.177
Because you know from the
first video we did on

00:01:00.177 --> 00:01:03.040
matrices, that you can't
add these two matrices.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.180
This term corresponds to this
one; this one corresponds to

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.920
this one; but this term
corresponds to nothing over

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.280
here so you couldn't add or
subtract these matrices.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.160
So the question is, can I
multiply these matrices?

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.140
Well, what did we learn about
multiplying matrices?

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.780
We know that, for example, if
this is going to result in

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.360
some matrix--

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.540
However we don't know even what
the dimensions are yet

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.630
until we work through this
example, although there is a

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.470
quick way for figuring it out.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.910
So this first term here, the
upper left term, where does it

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.080
get its row information from
and where does it get its

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.890
column information from?

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.610
Well, it gets its row
information from here.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.280
So it is essentially this
row times which column?

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.430
Times this column, right?

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.210
And we can actually take the dot
product of this row vector

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.060
and this column vector because
they have the same length.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.380
This is a column vector but it
has a length of 3, right?

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.520
But it's a 3 by 1, it has
three elements in it.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.240
And this is a 1 by 3 row vector,
but it also has three

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.730
elements in it.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.270
So we actually can take the
dot product or we can

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.770
multiply these two.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.500
And similarly we can multiply
this times this whole thing to

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.950
get this term right here.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.380
And we can multiply this thing
times this thing to get this

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.730
term, and then this
thing times that

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.350
term to get that term.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.100
So it actually turns out that
you can-- so what kind of a

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.880
matrix is this?

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.080
Let's call it that this is
matrix-- let me switch to

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.920
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.830
So this is matrix A.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.640
And what are it's dimensions?

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.640
It has 2 rows, 1, 2,
and 3 columns.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.130
So it's a 2 by 3 matrix.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.970
We're multiplying it times B.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.320
And what are B's dimensions?

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.670
Well, it has 3 rows, 1, 2, 3.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.920
So it is a 3 by-- and how many
columns does it have?

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.700
1, 2-- 2 matrix.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.160
So it turns out that we can
multiply two matrices.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.710
You can say that the number--
if, on the first matrix-- the

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.750
number of columns is equal to
the number of rows in the

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.360
second matrix.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.190
So here, 2 by 3 times 3
by 2, we can multiply.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.120
For example, we could
have multiplied, if

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.840
this is matrix C.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.410
I don't know if I take
so much time to keep

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.440
bolding these things.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.710
And I don't care how
many rows it has.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:34.580
It can have n rows,
n times a columns.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.380
I can multiply it times
matrix D, as long as

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.990
matrix D has a rows.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.430
As long as you can say these
two inner numbers are the

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.950
same, right?

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.130
This 3 is the same as 3.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.250
And why does that matter,
what was the logic?

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.490
Because this row will have 3
elements because there's 3

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.470
columns, and each column
vector here will have 3

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.050
elements, because
there's 3 rows.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.760
That's where intuition comes
from, but if you had to do it

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.990
really quickly you say 2 by 3,
3 by 2, this number is equal

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.160
to that number, I
can multiply.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.040
So let me clear up some
space and let's do the

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.220
multiplication.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.470
Let's do some multiplication.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.920
I'm debating where I should do
it, actually I think I should

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.550
do it down here maybe because
I'll have more space.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:19.500
So let me do it down there;
I don't have to

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.529
erase anything else.

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:24.700
So let me get some
space ready.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.250
OK, this will take up
a lot of space.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.150
So to get this row 1, column
1 element, what do I do?

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.420
I multiply this vector
times this vector.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.040
I take the dot product, right?

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.020
So it's 3 times negative 1-- I'm
just going to write it all

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:47.600
-- 3 times minus 1, plus 1
times 0, plus 2 times 2.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.170
There, we got the first term.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.350
So the second term here,
what am I going to do?

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.500
I'm going to multiply that
vector times that row vector

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.200
times this column vector.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.830
And I think you're getting the
hang of this, and really the

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.970
hardest part about this is
staying focused and not making

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.290
a careless mistake.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.820
And not getting it confused
with rows and

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.360
columns and all that.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.290
It just sends blood to your
brain, but it's not

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.920
that hard, I think.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.440
So what do we do?

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.880
We multiply this row vector
times this column vector to

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.420
get row 1, column 2, right?

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.030
Because this row,
row 1, column 2.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:36.030
3 times 3, plus 1 times 5,
plus 2 times 5, right.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.230
We're just multiplying the
corresponding terms, the third

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.200
term times the third term, the
second term times the second

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.620
term, the first term times
the first term.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.340
Although, in this case they're
going down, in this case

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.830
they're going left and right.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.150
Oh, we add them all up.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.240
OK, so now we're in the second
row, and we get our row

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.890
information from the first
vector-- and let me do a red

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.630
that I never use because I think
it's kind of tacky, this

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:58.320
red right here.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.720
So I'm going to multiply
this row vector

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.790
times this column vector.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:11.530
So it's minus 2 times minus
1, plus 0 times 0,

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.015
plus 5 times 2.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.900
We're almost done.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.550
Let me see-- I don't like this
color at all-- and now we're

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.760
going to multiply this row,
because we're in this bottom

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.390
row, we're in row 2, column
2, to row 2, column 2.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:42.720
So it's minus 2 times 3, plus
0 times 5, plus 5 times 5.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.310
And then if we simplify, let's
see, this is minus 3 plus 0,

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.110
plus 4, so this-- if I have
my math correct--

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.460
simplifies to 1.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:59.450
9 plus 5 is 14, plus 10 is 24.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:06.170
This is 1, 24, and then minus 2
times minus 1 is 2, plus 10,

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.970
so this is 12.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:14.830
And then minus 2 times 3 is
minus 6, plus 10-- this is 0--

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.290
so minus 6 plus 10 is 4.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:18.710
So that's interesting.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.070
When I multiplied a 2 by 3
vector times a 3 by 2 vector,

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.090
what did I get?

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.640
I got a 2 by 2 matrix.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.930
A 2 by 3 matrix, a 2 by 3 times
3 by 2 matrix, I got a 2

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:32.180
by 2 matrix.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.160
And where do you see a 2 by 2?

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.255
Well, it's like this got
multiplied with this, and what

00:07:37.255 --> 00:07:40.700
we have left over is
a 2 by 2 matrix.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.580
So in general-- well actually,
before I go into the general,

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:44.610
let me ask you a question.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.060
Could I have multiplied the
matrices the other way?

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:51.710
Could I have multiplied-- so
this right here that is A

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:55.100
times B, or you can sometimes
write this AB, and we'd bold

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.840
it all up so we know
it's matrices.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.300
So could we have multiplied
B times A?

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.450
Let me clear this down
here and let's try.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.450
Let's see if we can multiply
B times A.

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:08.150
I think you can already suspect
that, since I'm asking

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.820
the question, maybe
you cannot.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.180
Let's clear up some space.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.470
Let's try to do it the other
way around, let's try to

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.550
multiply B times A.

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:28.000
So B is minus 1,
0, 2, 3, 5, 5.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.730
And A is-- I'm switching
the order-- 3, 1,

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:34.130
2, minus 2, 0, 5.

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:36.140
And I tend to put brackets
around my matrices.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.960
Some people have these
big parentheses.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:42.039
It's just all notation; there's
nothing particular

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:43.590
about notation.

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:45.510
So let's see if you can
multiply these.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:48.830
So we learned that you get the
row information from the first

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:50.220
matrix and the column
information

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:50.950
from the second one.

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:57.530
So this term, in theory, should
be that row times what?

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.730
Well, actually, it turns out
that you can multiply them.

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:04.140
Why?

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:09.470
Because this is a 3 by 2, and
this is a 2 by 3, right?

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:12.360
So we're going to take that row
times what?-- times this

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.010
column to get the first
term, right?

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:16.820
So what is it going to be?

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:18.310
It's going to be minus 1.

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:20.540
So I actually thought I was
doing a counter example, but

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.930
actually because this too is the
same as this, or when you

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:27.400
switch the row this is
the same as this, you

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.160
can multiply them.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.040
So I wanted to do a counter
example, but hey.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.290
Let's just work through this
because it never hurts to see

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:33.020
another example.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:34.200
And you can see that I just
do this on the fly.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:34.910
So let's do this.

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:38.380
And actually ahead of time, how
large will this matrix be?

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.560
Well, this is interesting.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.100
It's actually going to
be a 3 by 3 matrix,

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.030
a much bigger matrix.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:45.370
Let's work it all out, and maybe
you want to pause it and

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:46.030
try it yourself.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:57.640
This row times this column, so
minus 1 times 3, it's minus 3,

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.930
3 times minus 2 is minus 6.

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:06.330
And then it's going to be this
row times this column.

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.980
So it's minus 1 times 1 plus
3 times 0, so that's

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.640
just minus 1, right?

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.250
Because 3 times 0 is 0.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:17.100
And then, that was that one,
then there's the middle one,

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.580
and now we get the
row 1, column 3.

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:20.750
So row 1, column 3.

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.750
So it's that row times
this column.

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:27.670
You can tell, this is often
better done by a computer.

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:32.140
Minus 1 times 2 is minus 2 plus
15-- 3 times 5-- so minus

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.940
2 plus 5 is 13.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.330
Let's keep going.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.030
So now we're going to take--

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:42.760
I'm sweating, this is so
computationally intensive--

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.670
We're taking this row times
each of these columns.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:46.770
And actually we are going to
learn later that there are

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:49.880
multiple ways of actually
thinking about how this

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.130
multiplication happens, even
multiple ways by computer, but

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:53.840
this is the traditional way.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.070
So this row times each of
these columns, right?

00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:01.830
So 0, 5, so 0 times 3 plus 5
times minus 2, that's minus

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:06.830
10, and it's 0 times
1 plus 5 times 0.

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:08.840
That's easy, that's 0.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:14.150
0 times 2 plus 5 times
5 is 25-- almost

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:15.690
there, almost done.

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:18.580
Now we're going to take this row
and multiply it times each

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.320
of these columns.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:25.620
So 2 times 3, that's 6,
plus minus 10, so

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.700
that's minus 4, right?

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.330
2 times 3 plus 5
times minus 2.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.470
Yes, that's minus 4,
6 minus 10, right?

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:36.670
We have 2 times 1 plus
5 times 0, that's 2.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:43.590
Then you have 2 times 2 plus 5
times 5, so 4 plus 25 is 29.

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:48.180
And of course that first term,
minus 3 minus 6, so

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:50.640
this is minus 9.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.840
So there you have it.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.160
We multiplied the 3 by 2 matrix
times a 2 by 3 matrix,

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.960
and we got a 3 by 3 matrix.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.240
And where did that
3 by 3 come from?

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.970
Because this 3 is the number of
rows in the first matrix,

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:05.720
and this 3 is the number of
columns in the second matrix,

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.130
which makes sense because we got
our row information from

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:10.830
the first matrix and our column
information from the

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.300
second matrix.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.610
Now let me actually show
you an example

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:18.360
that you cannot multiply.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:22.120
So what if I wanted to multiply
a-- let me do a very

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:26.680
simple example-- what if
I wanted to multiply

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.850
the matrix, 2, 1.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:33.430
And really, all this is,
is a row vector.

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:43.720
And let's say that I wanted to
multiply this times-- I don't

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:48.160
know, so this is a 2 by 1.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:52.080
So then let me say I want to
multiply this times-- so let

00:12:52.080 --> 00:13:04.270
me think of something--
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:06.860
Now, can I multiply this?

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:07.450
Well, what do we have?

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.950
This is a 3 by 2 matrix.

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.560
Can I multiply these
two matrices?

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.960
Well, what do we have to do?

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.680
We get our row information
from here, and our column

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:19.440
information from here--

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:23.080
Oh sorry, this isn't 2 by 1,
this is 1 row, two columns.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.390
This is a 1 by 2, right?

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:26.770
That's a 1 by 2 matrix.

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:30.150
So can you multiply the 1 by
2 times a 3 by 2 matrix?

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:33.545
So we get our row information
from here, so we essentially

00:13:33.545 --> 00:13:37.490
have to multiply this by this
times this column to get our

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:39.360
first element, then this
times this column to

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.260
get our second element.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.760
And I don't know what happens
from there, but let me-- well,

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.110
can we multiply?

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:46.700
Just the way we have defined our
multiplication, or the dot

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.390
product, can we multiply?

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:52.600
Let's see, 2 times
1 plus 1 times 2.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.440
Then we don't have anything
to do with the 3.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.470
So the way that we've defined
matrix multiplication, you

00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:59.110
cannot multiply these
two matrices.

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:01.060
And you didn't have to go
through that exercise.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:03.930
You could've looked at the
dimensions, 1 by 2, and this

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:06.780
is a 3 by 2.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:11.020
This 2 is not equal to this 3,
the number of columns in the

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:14.080
first are not equal to the
number of rows in the second.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.250
So you can not multiply
those two matrices.

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:19.270
So that's something interesting
to think about.

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:22.050
And they're actually examples,
and it's a good exercise for

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:26.100
you to think about it, where
you can multiply A times B,

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.270
but you can't multiply
B times A.

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:30.930
So I want you think about
examples where that happens.

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:34.540
But anyway, I'm pushing 15
minutes, and I will see you in

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.190
the next video.
