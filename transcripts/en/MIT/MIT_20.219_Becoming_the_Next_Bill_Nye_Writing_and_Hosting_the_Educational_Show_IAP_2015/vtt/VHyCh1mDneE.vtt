00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.950
JOSH: OK, so let's turn
the page to storyboarding,

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.710
which, for us, no matter
what sort of video

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.330
you're doing-- live
action, animation,

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:45.425
or some sort of combination--
is vital to the process.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.260
And here's why.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.300
It allows you, basically,
a lot of freedom

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.140
to not have to make any really
high stakes creative decisions

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.750
and just be creative
at a very early stage.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.850
You don't have to commit
to any sort of production

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.600
at that point.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.460
That's why we do it.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.550
And it's why we
share with clients

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.040
before we commit to
doing any animation,

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.262
because it's very time
consuming for us to animate.

00:01:22.262 --> 00:01:23.720
And we want the
client to know what

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.470
we're doing before we commit
to doing any of that really

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.485
labor-intensive work.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.805
It serves as a blueprint
for timing and visual flow.

00:01:33.805 --> 00:01:38.630
So you can get a sense of
the pacing of the video,

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.120
whether or not, as
Elizabeth was saying,

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.300
things are going to get
stale at a certain point.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.550
It can help you make those
sorts of creative decisions

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.330
without having to commit
a lot of resources.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.940
The storyboard can
reveal where you're

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.950
going to need to shoot, what
props you're going to need,

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.710
the types of shots
you're going to employ.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.370
All that decision
making gets made

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.729
in the storyboarding process.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.680
And another, really
crucial thing

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.240
is, so often when we're
doing a storyboard,

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.490
we realize that the script
needs to be different.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.450
You write something-- maybe
you have some visual sense when

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.560
you're writing a script.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.960
And that's good, because--
and I've done it a lot.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.690
So a lot of times I
am thinking visually.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.250
But I'm not always
thinking visually.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.690
And I'm not-- it's not my
strong suit all the time

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:33.764
when I'm script writing.

00:02:33.764 --> 00:02:35.930
So a lot of times, we'll
be in a storyboard meeting.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.730
And we'll say, well, this
line is just sort of dumb.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.810
Why don't we say this so
that we can show this?

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.500
So that integration of
visual and oral-- the voice--

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.970
is a really crucial
part of storyboarding.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.350
So that's why we storyboard.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.550
And let me just
show you an example

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.500
of one of our storyboards.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.560
There are many different
ways to storyboard.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.780
But I'll just show
you one example.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.710
The first is--
well, I'll show you

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.460
the storyboard for this video
we did for NASA, actually.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.020
And it was produced
by WNET in New York.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.960
And they asked us to
create a series of videos

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.380
about different physics topics.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.950
And this one is on
centripetal force.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.230
So I'll just switch
over to-- let's see,

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:40.205
episode-- So this
is essentially--

00:03:40.205 --> 00:03:42.340
this is our storyboard method.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.100
We do an Excel spreadsheet
with three columns--

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.270
shot, narrator, and notes.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.845
Very simple-- email me, and
I'll send you this storyboard.

00:03:51.845 --> 00:03:56.270
And you can use it in
your own work if you want.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.870
Imagine you've
got a tennis ball.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.380
So we start the shot
on the tennis ball.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.302
We either pull back--
we'll watch the video.

00:04:03.302 --> 00:04:05.010
I can't remember if
the camera pulls back

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.150
or we jump cut or something--
attached to a piece of string.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.680
And we pull back further.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.360
And you start swinging it.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.670
And then-- when did we
have this idea for the dog?

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.000
I mean, probably this came
in the storyboard meeting.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.030
Like, OK, we'll have this nice
dog element to the experience.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.430
In circles-- and so
gradually, the camera's

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.440
getting further back.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.856
And now we can see
the background.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.790
"Whoa now, watch
out for your buddy."

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.370
This is not for
adults, by the way.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.870
I'm sorry.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.120
I should've mentioned that.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.850
This is for, like, elementary
and middle schoolers.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.350
So if you find this a
little facile and dumb,

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.720
just imagine you're
13 years old.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.580
"Watch out for your buddy."

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.560
So the guy on the
skateboard ducks down.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.530
And then he goes past and waves.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.910
Let's take-- so we start
with-- my attitude about this,

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.564
in a lot of cases, is
to start with action.

00:05:12.564 --> 00:05:14.730
Like, start with something
that's really compelling.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.150
Like, some-- you don't
have to start, right away,

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.030
explaining things.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.550
Just sort of start with
imagining something or doing

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:23.070
something.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.840
There's that old
comment, I think--

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.160
this is Hemingway said this, he
talked about "in medias res."

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.320
Start in the middle of things.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.990
So don't start with
elaborate explanations.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.650
Just start in the
middle of the action.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.650
So something needs
to be happening

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.860
at the beginning of a video.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.800
So that's why we
chose to start--

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.035
you got this ball spinning.

00:05:44.035 --> 00:05:45.160
There's something going on.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.700
There's this dog.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.210
There's the kid
skateboarding by.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.080
You're starting
with a high level

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.450
of engagement and interest.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.720
Let's take a closer look
at the fascinating physics

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.590
of this simple action.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.050
And then we go into the
more detailed analysis

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.180
of what's really going on.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.310
We talk about f equals
ma-- Newton's second law--

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.107
and how it relates
to objects moving.

00:06:12.107 --> 00:06:14.190
So I'm not going to show
you the whole storyboard.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.920
But you start to get a sense of
how we put this thing together

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:23.590
visually in a very methodical
way before we did any work-- I

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.450
mean, this is work-- but
before we did any animation

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:28.890
or illustration.

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.610
And I think John did all
the artwork for this.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.410
And it's very basic.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.080
She's basically a stick figure.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.460
John makes really
nice stick figures.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.753
So he has that talent.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.940
So let me just
show you the video.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.325
And it came out of that process.

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.400
Hold on a second.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:58.920
There we go.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.760
Whoops, that's
not the right one.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.880
Here we go.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.370
This is a minute and 46.

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.440
So our challenge was
to do these topics

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.792
in about a minute and a half,
a minute and 45 seconds.

00:07:21.792 --> 00:07:22.750
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.860
-Imagine you've got a
tennis ball attached

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:25.980
to a piece of string.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.160
And you start swinging
it in circles.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:28.930
Whoa, now!

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.700
Watch out for your buddy!

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.350
Let's take a closer look
at the fascinating physics

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.040
of this simple action.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.650
You've probably heard of
Newton's second law of motion

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.490
as it relates to objects
moving in a straight line.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.600
Turns out, Newton's
second law also

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.870
tells us about the
net force on an object

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.570
as it moves in a circle.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.320
When an object
moves in a circle,

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.420
its velocity changes direction.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.430
Since the velocity's
changing, that

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.270
means we have an acceleration.

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:56.060
And we know from
Newton's second law

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.250
that if we have an acceleration,
we have a net force.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.080
Now back to our spinning ball.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.380
For objects undergoing
circular motion,

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.580
the net force on the object is
called the "centripetal force."

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.800
It's a weird sounding word,
but it's Latin for the phrase

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.270
"center-seeking."

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:14.570
It's named centripetal because
the centripetal force always

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.800
points to the center
of the circle.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.900
The ball has a
tangential velocity.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.580
So if you suddenly
cut the string,

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.920
it would fly off in whatever
the tangential direction was

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.960
at the moment you made the cut.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.650
But assuming you
don't cut the string,

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:30.900
and you keep swinging the ball,
the ball's tangential velocity

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.010
is constantly
changing directions.

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.210
This means the ball
is accelerating.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.000
And the reason it's
accelerating is

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.020
due to the centripetal force.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.140
The centripetal force
acting on the ball

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.580
is constantly directing
the ball towards the center

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.340
of the circle, your hand.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.570
This, combined with
the ball's velocity,

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:49.810
keeps the ball
swinging in a circle.

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:52.620
The same centripetal force that
keeps the tennis ball swinging

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.455
in a circle also keeps
roller coasters on the track

00:08:55.455 --> 00:08:57.590
as they go through
a loop-de-loop.

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:00.410
So the next time you're having
a blast on a roller coaster,

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.707
you can thank the
centripetal force.

00:09:02.707 --> 00:09:03.290
[END PLAYBACK]

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:11.200
JOSH: OK, so that's a
pretty short little ditty.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.750
But you can-- I just wanted
to show you how we built it.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:22.990
And this next thing is-- I'm not
going to show the whole thing.

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:24.760
But it's interesting.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.370
This is a video, a sort
of an insider look at how

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:30.057
Pixar does their storyboarding.

00:09:30.057 --> 00:09:31.640
And I'll just play
a little bit of it.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.920
And then perhaps you can
watch the whole thing

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:34.680
on your own time.

00:09:37.496 --> 00:09:38.340
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.880
-All right, so this section
is the storyboarding process.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.040
And this is where, instead
of writing with words,

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.090
we write with drawings.

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:48.120
And we put them on
little pieces of paper.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.930
And it's sort of seeing the
movie in comic book form.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.790
And we'll do a section
of the movie at a time

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:56.200
and we'll pin them
all up on boards.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.060
And then, when we get
a certain chunk done,

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.610
we'll show them
to the directors.

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:02.247
Or they will show them to us.

00:10:02.247 --> 00:10:04.830
And, I don't know, it's kind of
complicated thing to explain--

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.955
-Well, you know, that was
a really good description

00:10:06.955 --> 00:10:09.214
of about how better
to describe--

00:10:09.214 --> 00:10:10.380
-Something better than that.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:10.879
-Yeah.

00:10:10.879 --> 00:10:11.985
-Well, we could show it.

00:10:11.985 --> 00:10:12.860
-Yeah, let's show it.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:13.610
-With storyboards.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:15.030
-With storyboards.

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.870
OK, this is the
storyboarding process,

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:21.250
as illustrated by Joe
Ranft, our head of story.

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:24.820
-Yes, so there's the
little, cute, Mr. Storyboard

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:28.702
Artist working very diligently
and happily in January.

00:10:28.702 --> 00:10:29.660
-And he has a deadline.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.846
He's working hard
to do his sequence.

00:10:31.846 --> 00:10:34.220
Every time he does a drawing,
he pins it up on the board.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.803
And there, he stands back when
he gets done with his sequence.

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:38.960
And he says, hmmm, did
I do it the best way?

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.030
And storyboarding
actually balances, like,

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.730
composition, cutting, staging,
acting, writing, everything

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:49.470
that goes through the storyboard
artist's mind as he's doing it.

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:52.970
-So he'll try another pass at
it a couple more times until he

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:54.541
feels he's got it just right.

00:10:54.541 --> 00:10:55.040
-Just right.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.090
-It's perfect.

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.040
-So he calls in the
story department--

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:58.831
-And the directors.

00:10:58.831 --> 00:11:00.360
- --and, of course,
the director.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.580
-There you can
see John Lasseter.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:02.413
Looks just like him.

00:11:02.413 --> 00:11:05.140
-Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.090
Thanks, Joe.

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:09.110
-And then Joe-- or whoever's
pitching, the little storyboard

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.405
artist, in this case--
will pitch the sequence.

00:11:11.405 --> 00:11:14.270
And in the middle of the
pitch, John gets an idea.

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:15.287
-We all get ideas.

00:11:15.287 --> 00:11:17.745
And that's one of the great
things about storyboarding here

00:11:17.745 --> 00:11:21.140
at Pixar is it is a free-for-all
once we get in this.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.460
And everybody is out,
coming up with ideas

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.190
to make the sequence better,
to make the film better.

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:29.180
And when the pitch
session is done,

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.600
inevitably there
is lots of ideas

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.020
to make the sequence better.

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.304
The storyboard artist
kind of wakes up from it.

00:11:35.304 --> 00:11:37.470
-Right, and we're infamous
for putting all our notes

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:38.290
on little post-its.

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:38.710
-Yeah.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:41.043
-That's why you see all the
little yellow squares there.

00:11:41.043 --> 00:11:42.970
And so we'll all leave,
all excited about

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.120
the great new ideas we've got.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.604
And then the storyboard artist--

00:11:46.604 --> 00:11:48.770
-Mr. Storyboard Artist goes
back and thinks about it

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:52.010
and starts over with all
his notes that he has to do.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:55.650
Joe Ranft often calls it--
the storyboarding process--

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:57.680
not storyboarding,
but "story-reboarding"

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:01.480
because we work on it,
redo it, redo it, redo it,

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.860
to make each sequence, to make
the entire film as best as we

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.256
possibly can be.

00:12:06.256 --> 00:12:07.630
In the next section,
you're going

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:11.220
to see Joe Ranft, our head of
story on A Bug's Life pitching

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.660
to Co-director Andrew Stanton.

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:14.300
-Me.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.790
-And I think Bob's
in there, too.

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:17.664
-I think Bob Peterson,
one of our story guys.

00:12:17.664 --> 00:12:20.740
-He's pitching the circus
sequence from A Bug's Life.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:21.890
Enjoy.

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:24.250
-OK, so Slim and Francis
are hit by the spotlight.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:25.950
They're not too excited.

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:28.690
And Slim says, tra la la la
la, spring is in the air.

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:31.460
And I'm a flower with
nothing interesting to say.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.166
And then they go,
ah, look, a bee.

00:12:34.166 --> 00:12:36.000
And then Heimlich
comes running forward,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.700
I am a cute, little bumblebee.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.110
Here I come!

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:42.047
I want to catch up
with your flowers!

00:12:42.047 --> 00:12:43.630
-Oh, oh, oh, I've
got it, I've got it.

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:45.270
What if, like, he
just can't catch up?

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:48.120
He's like-- it's just so
heavy, it's just hard for him

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.010
to catch up to Slim.

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:51.430
-Slow down, slow down!

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:52.403
So he's like--

00:12:52.403 --> 00:12:53.210
[PANTING]

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:55.378
you flowers, slow
down, slow down!

00:12:55.378 --> 00:12:58.126
-Right, right.

00:12:58.126 --> 00:12:59.042
-Yeah, right.

00:12:59.042 --> 00:12:59.950
That would be great.

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:01.260
You flowers are too fast!

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:02.430
You're running too fast.

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.527
Slow down, you guys!

00:13:04.527 --> 00:13:05.110
-That's great.

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:06.790
-OK, that'd be good.

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:09.327
-OK, so then he's
chasing after them

00:13:09.327 --> 00:13:10.660
and Heimlich runs by the stands.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.520
And there's a little
kid eating candy corn.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:13.061
And he stops.

00:13:13.061 --> 00:13:16.350
And he turns around and he
goes, oh, candy corn, here!

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:18.840
I, oh-- you have
to let me eat it!

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.340
Oh!

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.950
And his stomach is grumbling.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:25.367
And he can go, let me help you,
let me help you to finish it!

00:13:25.367 --> 00:13:25.991
-Wait a minute.

00:13:25.991 --> 00:13:27.910
Is a candy corn funny?

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:29.293
-We were thinking of red vines.

00:13:29.293 --> 00:13:30.376
-Would red vines be funny?

00:13:30.376 --> 00:13:32.520
That's a little bit
tough for a fly to hold.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.191
-There's those little
sombrero jujubes.

00:13:34.191 --> 00:13:35.190
Those are kind of funny.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.945
-The question is, what would a
fly like as far as candy goes?

00:13:37.945 --> 00:13:38.445
-Well, dots.

00:13:38.445 --> 00:13:39.725
But we already
have a character--

00:13:39.725 --> 00:13:41.410
-Candy corn is pretty funny,
though, because it's really,

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.890
like-- it's a big triangle.

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:43.848
I think that actually--

00:13:43.848 --> 00:13:44.520
-OK.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.030
Yeah, that's why--

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.580
-More identifiable.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.205
-I think we should
go with candy corns.

00:13:47.205 --> 00:13:49.761
Like, is it too Halloween?

00:13:49.761 --> 00:13:50.260
-Nah.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:51.180
-No, OK.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.180
So he goes, Oh,
candy corn, here.

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.455
Let help you to finish it.

00:13:55.455 --> 00:13:55.955
-Great.

00:13:55.955 --> 00:13:57.800
That's great.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.800
-Tra la la la la.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.050
Spring is in the air.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:04.681
And I am a flower with
nothing interesting to say.

00:14:04.681 --> 00:14:05.180
-Ah!

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:05.679
-A bee!

00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:08.080
-I am a cute little bumblebee!

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:08.580
-Ah!

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:09.580
-Here I come!

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.580
-Ah!

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:14.080
-Slow down, you flowers!

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.090
Oh!

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:16.790
Candy corn!

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:19.107
Here, let me help
you to finish it!

00:14:19.107 --> 00:14:20.360
[END PLAYBACK]

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.560
JOSH: So they obviously--
they went with the candy corn.

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.060
ELIZABETH: Before you move on--

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:25.420
JOSH: Go ahead.

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:26.265
ELIZABETH: --share
the storyboard

00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:27.617
that came from Science Out Loud?

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:28.450
JOSH: Oh sure, yeah.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:31.121
ELIZABETH: Sorry, I totally
forgot that I had this.

00:14:31.121 --> 00:14:31.620
JOSH: OK.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:32.852
ELIZABETH: Not to--

00:14:32.852 --> 00:14:33.560
JOSH: No problem.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:34.518
ELIZABETH: Sorry, Josh.

00:14:34.518 --> 00:14:36.791
JOSH: No problem, here.

00:14:36.791 --> 00:14:39.600
ELIZABETH: Thanks.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.240
We've been seeing all these
very gorgeous storyboards.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:46.356
Like, even-- you guys
talk about how it's not

00:14:46.356 --> 00:14:47.696
when the real work starts.

00:14:47.696 --> 00:14:50.860
But obviously that takes
a lot of time and talent.

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:55.810
So this was a
storyboard that Ashley

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:59.360
did for our very first episode
of Science Out Loud, just

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.680
to show you how basic it can
be and still be effective.

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.140
So she did an episode
on exoplanets.

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:09.120
Ashley's K-12 video-- ooh!

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:13.150
And what we discovered after
she storyboarded this--

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:17.380
she's talking about a very
abstract, cosmic topic.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.240
So obviously we
can't go into space,

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.500
which made deciding what
the visuals were going

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.270
to be surprisingly
difficult. Or maybe it

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:24.520
should have been unsurprising.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.290
But we were newbs at the time.

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:28.710
So it was hard.

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:31.060
But she-- literally just
drawing stick figures,

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:34.210
aligning them with her text.

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:37.420
And when we were looking at the
storyboard, we were like, wow.

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:40.720
There's not really a whole lot
going on, except for her just

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.610
standing there.

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:46.330
And basically half
of the video was

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:50.920
going to be an animation
without her on screen.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:56.800
And there would have been no
way for us to really anticipate

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.850
the extent to which she was
missing from screen until she

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:02.760
storyboarded this out for us.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.120
And so she tweaked
not only her visuals,

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.870
but she ended up
tweaking her script a lot

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:13.550
after she did this to make room
for scenes in which she could

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:17.180
be more present, where it could
be more than a fully animated

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:18.160
video.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.600
But in case you wanted
to see, we actually

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:28.590
kept the first six frames pretty
similar to her original plan.

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:32.010
And we just tried to alter
the animations to make

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:33.170
it a little more engaging.

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:36.830
So I'll show you the
first part of her video.

00:16:46.397 --> 00:16:47.380
[AUDIO  PLAYBACK]

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:48.800

[END AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:56.720
So this was-- this
animation was actually

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.530
done by our first editor.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:16:59.910
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:02.220
-25 years ago, most
people would have told you

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:05.233
that there are only nine
planets in the universe.

00:17:05.233 --> 00:17:07.150
Since then, we've lost one.

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:08.216
Sorry, Pluto.

00:17:08.216 --> 00:17:10.660
But we've discovered
thousands of others.

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:11.470
So what happened?

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:14.170
Did astronomers suddenly get
a new pair of glasses and now

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:15.890
we're meeting all of
our new neighbors?

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:16.839
Well, no.

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:19.430
It turns that we could've seen
these exoplanets all along.

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:24.030
But we only recently figured out
exactly where and how to look.

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:27.356
We call these new
planets exoplanets, or--

00:17:27.356 --> 00:17:28.170
[END PLAYBACK]

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:30.010
ELIZABETH: So,
because we knew what

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:33.310
she wanted to do with the
animations ahead of time

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:36.520
because of her story board,
that allowed us to direct her

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.560
while we were shooting
to put her hands down,

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.530
to look up at the ceiling,
and all that stuff.

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:43.950
And I'll show you one
more storyboard that was

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:46.169
done a little bit differently.

00:17:46.169 --> 00:17:47.585
And then I'll let
Josh talk again.

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:53.910
But Alex actually just did
pictures for some of them.

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:58.230
So he did an episode on how
carbon nanotubes are made.

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:03.010
And he had this sort of
"imagine a blank" opening.

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:06.910
And so he just took pictures
of the locations and types

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:08.270
of places that he wanted to go.

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:10.480
And then, from there,
he literally just

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.910
drew stick figures.

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:15.770
So you don't have to draw
anything crazy beautiful--

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:16.920
no offense to Alex.

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.010
But this was
actually very helpful

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:24.632
for us as well to see how
the pacing of his demos

00:18:24.632 --> 00:18:25.340
were going to go.

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:28.410
So we altered his script
again after he made this,

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:31.110
because we realized that it
was a lot of just him sitting

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.110
at a table demoing things.

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:35.160
And we decided that
there needed to be

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.020
something a little more visually
engaging besides him just

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.725
at a table.

00:18:39.725 --> 00:18:43.600
But he's talking about
how a thread made out

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.850
of carbon nanotubes could
lift up something as heavy

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:47.730
as an elephant.

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:52.000
We quickly realized that we
wouldn't have footage for that.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.440
But this is again,
really basic-- nothing

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:59.850
too crazy-- but helped us a lot
in the planning of the video.

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:03.674
So I'll show you the
first couple bits of his.

00:19:11.578 --> 00:19:13.454
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:13.454 --> 00:19:14.870
-Imagine a material
that would let

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:18.270
you use your phone for
weeks without a charge

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:23.790
or would let you build
an elevator to space.

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:25.605
These elevators and
batteries can one day

00:19:25.605 --> 00:19:28.300
exist with a material
called "carbon nanotubes."

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.110
Carbon nanotubes are tiny.

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:32.070
Take this human
hair, for example.

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:35.380
You need 10,000 carbon
nanotubes to make a rope

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:37.470
as big as this hair.

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:40.710
Despite being small,
they're really strong.

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:42.687
This cotton string holds
up this lego car fine.

00:19:42.687 --> 00:19:44.395
But if it was made
from carbon nanotubes,

00:19:44.395 --> 00:19:46.597
it could hold up a real car.

00:19:46.597 --> 00:19:47.180
[END PLAYBACK]

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:48.670
So originally he
was going to talk

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:50.342
about this model
of carbon nanotubes

00:19:50.342 --> 00:19:51.800
at the very beginning
of the video.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.840
But after we saw
the storyboard, we

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:56.250
thought that we should wait
until later on to explain it

00:19:56.250 --> 00:20:00.475
and just hit them with
this example first.

00:20:00.475 --> 00:20:01.850
So I just wanted
to show you guys

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:05.110
that so you knew that your
storyboards don't have to be

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:09.414
anything super complicated.

00:20:09.414 --> 00:20:13.190
JOSH: Cool, thanks.

00:20:19.977 --> 00:20:21.933
OK, let's see.

00:20:26.334 --> 00:20:30.010
All right, so just some--
we're almost done with this,

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:31.170
by the way.

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:35.600
But some quick tips for
storyboarding-- and I

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.040
guess this was something that
Elizabeth was just saying.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.610
It doesn't have to
be a work of art.

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:43.520
Stick figures work.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.130
Focus on details that matter.

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:49.050
We don't draw a
lot of backgrounds.

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:52.970
We just draw the bare
minimum of elements

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:56.120
that will get across the
intention of the scene

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.310
or the shot, rather.

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.580
It should include a
composition and camera angles.

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:03.670
Is this a wide shot?

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:06.136
Is it a close-up?

00:21:06.136 --> 00:21:07.760
What is the cam--
you might make a note

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.060
about what the camera's doing.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:09.960
Is it pulling back?

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:10.870
Is it on a dolly?

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:12.059
Is it tracking something?

00:21:12.059 --> 00:21:14.600
ELIZABETH: And just so you guys
know, since we haven't really

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.400
talked about that stuff
yet, that's a lot of stuff

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:20.270
that Chris is going to
talk about tomorrow.

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:24.480
So I would suggest that you
try to keep that stuff in mind

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.760
and then maybe revisit it again
after Chris talks about it

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:28.530
tomorrow, too.

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:28.795
JOSH: Yeah.

00:21:28.795 --> 00:21:30.630
ELIZABETH: And you can also
ask him while he's here, too.

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:31.130
JOSH: Right.

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:33.969
AUDIENCE: You know
I'm not supposed to--

00:21:33.969 --> 00:21:36.510
ELIZABETH: It's OK if you have,
like, spoilers in the class--

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:37.850
JOSH: Yeah.

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:40.940
And Chris-- I mean, Chris
knows the grammar of this stuff

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.436
better than I do.

00:21:42.436 --> 00:21:44.060
Admittedly, I didn't
go to film school.

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:48.010
So we use terms of
art in our studio that

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:49.900
probably aren't appropriate.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:54.090
But the camera's
close-up on this guy.

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:56.250
The camera's far
back from this guy.

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:59.860
The camera's moving
while this guy's talking.

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.240
That sort of--
any of that stuff.

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.422
Don't be constrained by--

00:22:03.422 --> 00:22:04.880
AUDIENCE: Too many
technical terms.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:05.380
JOSH: Right.

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:10.650
AUDIENCE: What about aspect
ratio of, like, the paper

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:13.040
that you're using in the
shot that you're gonna use.

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.151
Eight and a half by 11
turned sideways, like--

00:22:15.151 --> 00:22:15.650
JOSH: Yeah.

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:17.940
AUDIENCE: Or is there another
shortcut that's helpful?

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.690
JOSH: Yeah, well a note card
is a very-- turned sideways

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:24.510
is perfect, is a good
16 by 9 approximation.

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:30.365
The template that I'm going to
give you guys is widescreen.

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:34.670
But yeah, definitely
have to think

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:37.340
about those sorts of things.

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:41.255
You don't want to be
doing it in a 4 by 3 box.

00:22:41.255 --> 00:22:42.880
You want to think
about the full frame.

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:48.622
And this is sort of stupid.

00:22:48.622 --> 00:22:49.580
I don't why I put this.

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:52.610
Make them easy to read
visually and understand.

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:56.210
So I think one thing I
wanted to really stress

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:58.730
is that, for us-- and I
think, for most people,

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:00.770
as you saw on the Pixar
video-- storyboarding

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:02.900
is a collaborative process.

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:07.440
So you can't--
this is a process.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.030
This kind of art
is something that

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:12.020
comes out of a lot of different
minds working together

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:13.950
creatively.

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:19.500
And so the story-- one reason to
make the storyboard really easy

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.410
to understand is
that somebody else

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:23.680
is going to have to
use it and work on it.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.160
It's not just what's
inside your head.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:29.520
This is a part of a process
that collaborators are all

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.120
working on.

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.150
So it has to communicate
very effectively.

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:36.030
ELIZABETH: And I haven't
mentioned this formally yet,

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:39.770
but obviously, if you're going
to be hosting your video,

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:43.090
you can't simultaneously
be shooting it as well.

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:46.420
So the way that's going to work
is we'll partner you guys up,

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:49.820
or we'll figure something out
to where basically, you'll be

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:51.430
shooting someone else's video.

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:54.310
And someone else will
be shooting yours.

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:56.800
And the storyboard is going
to be really important

00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:00.240
for that reason, because
you have to somehow give

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.160
the instructions to
whoever's shooting for you

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.880
exactly how you
want things framed,

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.480
how you want your shot to look
like and things like that.

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.600
So I agree completely.

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.930
It's a very collaborative
and necessary thing.

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:13.120
JOSH: Yeah.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:16.580
If there's time,
make a few boards.

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:19.580
Like, a lot of times
people in our office

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:22.547
will make some boards
independently of each other.

00:24:22.547 --> 00:24:24.130
And then we'll bring
them all together

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:25.810
and see what we've all got.

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:27.920
Sometimes that's
part of our workflow.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.040
If you have time,
storyboard the same script

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.599
in a couple of different ways.

00:24:32.599 --> 00:24:35.015
You might get different ideas
with different perspectives.

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:40.760
And as I said before,
revise the script as needed.

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.970
Sometimes a great visual
idea doesn't line up

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:43.640
with the script.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:47.130
Focus on visual story, not
adherence to your script.

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:49.810
So if you come up with a
cool idea, and you may--

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:51.730
you know this is hard
to-- I can say this.

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:54.832
But you just have to experience
it to really understand it.

00:24:54.832 --> 00:24:56.290
You might come up
with a cool idea,

00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:58.540
but the script doesn't quite
match what you're saying.

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:02.000
So don't feel like you're
locked into that script.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.560
And finally, the
storyboard is only a guide.

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.980
Changes are often made in the
production and editing process.

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:11.630
So all this stuff
is very plastic.

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:12.740
You're moving it.

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:13.950
You're changing it as you go.

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:19.890
All right, so how to
make a storyboard.

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:21.940
We brought some paper templates.

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:26.120
You can use note cards,
We don't use note cards.

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:28.160
But it's actually
an interesting idea,

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.270
which is that-- then, if you
put one scene or one shot

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:33.480
on each card, you can start
moving the cards around

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.580
on the wall, which
might be interesting,

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.970
an interesting way to do it.

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:40.330
And each frame should
include the script line

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:42.970
and basic direction notes.

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:44.770
We don't always do that.

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:48.140
But we, at minimum, we
include the script line that's

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:51.250
coordinated with the shot.

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.050
So let's workshop.

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:59.310
And there's a couple
different ways we can do this.

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:09.800
Well, first let me go over
what I think this basic format.

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:14.620
John and I will sit up here
and storyboard a script.

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:18.980
And what that script is, I want
to talk to you about a minute.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.905
And then, once we've done
some of it-- maybe over 30

00:26:21.905 --> 00:26:25.390
or 45 minutes-- we'll
break you into small groups

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:29.130
and you'll continue the same
script, storyboarding it.

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:31.300
You'll do a few-- some
frames on your own.

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:34.160
We'll walk around and help you.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.180
And then you guys will
present what you have.

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:41.120
And we'll just and
share and discuss them.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:41.620
Yeah?

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:43.411
AUDIENCE: Josh, how do
you feel about using

00:26:43.411 --> 00:26:45.250
PowerPoint for storyboarding?

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:45.964
JOSH: That works.

00:26:45.964 --> 00:26:46.880
That would work great.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.170
AUDIENCE: In my brain, that
would be a better tool--

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:50.784
JOSH: Yeah, sure.

00:26:50.784 --> 00:26:52.200
ELIZABETH: That's
what Ashley did.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.985
She made hers on PowerPoint.

00:26:53.985 --> 00:26:56.347
JOSH: Yeah, that would work
great-- Keynote, PowerPoint,

00:26:56.347 --> 00:26:57.180
that would be great.

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.240
And you don't have to
use these paper sheets.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:02.255
But unless you have
a Wacom with you,

00:27:02.255 --> 00:27:04.130
it can be difficult to
draw on your computer.

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:12.350
So the script that we're
going to storyboard,

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:16.080
we can either do a
script that we've already

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:19.100
done-- that we've already
written and storyboarded

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:19.740
and produced.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:22.980
But it would be-- it would
be wonderful to storyboard it

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:25.090
again with all of your input.

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:29.170
Or we can take one script
that you guys are currently

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:33.480
working on and just get
started on it with you.

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.880
So either someone-- is-- someone
is either a victim or very

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:43.160
lucky or some combination
of the two in this.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.575
Who votes for storyboarding
one of our scripts?

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:52.730
OK, who votes-- OK, so fine.

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:55.555
So it sounds like you want to
storyboard one of your scripts.

00:27:55.555 --> 00:27:58.810
ELIZABETH: They might not raise
their hand for that, either.

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:00.354
We've got a quiet crew.

00:28:00.354 --> 00:28:02.020
JOSH: All right, who
wants to storyboard

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:03.742
one of their scripts?

00:28:03.742 --> 00:28:06.100
Oh, come on, guys.

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:06.850
This is absurd.

00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:07.336
ELIZABETH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:07.336 --> 00:28:08.711
AUDIENCE: I find
mine is trivial,

00:28:08.711 --> 00:28:11.272
but the one I showed you
yesterday-- is that--

00:28:13.897 --> 00:28:15.480
ELIZABETH: Oh, you
mean the hotel one.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.146
AUDIENCE: Yeah, because
it's shot there.

00:28:17.146 --> 00:28:20.960
ELIZABETH: Yeah, do
you have-- should

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.310
we just storyboard
the latest script

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:25.714
that you uploaded to the Tumblr?

00:28:25.714 --> 00:28:27.630
AUDIENCE: It's the one
I showed you yesterday.

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:33.475
ELIZABETH: So he's got an
idea that he hasn't fully

00:28:33.475 --> 00:28:34.490
scripted yet.

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:35.260
JOSH: Oh, OK.

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:35.760
Yeah.

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.426
ELIZABETH: It might
be easier if we have

00:28:37.426 --> 00:28:38.997
actual, like, text to a line.

00:28:38.997 --> 00:28:40.580
JOSH: Yeah, we need
a script for sure.

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:42.246
ELIZABETH: Just for
logistical purposes.

00:28:42.246 --> 00:28:45.435
Does anyone have-- it's not
going to be your entire script.

00:28:45.435 --> 00:28:47.810
It's just going to be a portion,
a couple scenes from it.

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:50.390
Does anyone feel comfortable?

00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:53.029
And it's OK if you end up
changing it completely, too.

00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:55.570
AUDIENCE: Could we do enough of
one that you've already done?

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:57.486
Because if mine has to
be-- I'm just thinking,

00:28:57.486 --> 00:28:59.786
from a learning perspective,
that it might be really

00:28:59.786 --> 00:29:01.522
interesting also to match
that with--what you are--

00:29:01.522 --> 00:29:02.530
actually ended up doing?

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:04.029
JOSH: Yeah, and I
thought that, too.

00:29:04.029 --> 00:29:06.220
That was kind of what
we were planning to do.

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:09.362
But I didn't want to
make it all about us.

00:29:09.362 --> 00:29:11.070
But if you think it's
instructive, then--

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:13.217
AUDIENCE: I think that
might be nice to have

00:29:13.217 --> 00:29:15.675
that framework for everyone,
since everyone else is copying

00:29:15.675 --> 00:29:16.830
off of it as well.

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:19.120
JOSH: OK, cool.

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:23.610
So I do have a script here.

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:25.300
AUDIENCE: Do you guys
all have pencils?

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:28.144
Or should I grab some--

00:29:28.144 --> 00:29:31.090
ELIZABETH: Do you want
them to do pen or pencil?

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:33.025
JOSH: It doesn't matter.

00:29:33.025 --> 00:29:34.146
It doesn't matter.

00:29:34.146 --> 00:29:35.770
Pencil's nice because
you can erase it.

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:41.710
Yeah, so I think what
we'll do is we'll

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:49.450
start off with John working.

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:51.120
And then we'll all chime in.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.777
And then you can
see how John works.

00:29:52.777 --> 00:29:54.110
And then you can do it yourself.

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:56.890
Does that make sense?

00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:57.390
Yourselves.

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:01.980
I have the script, actually.

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:05.450
So you can see what
I was hoping we do.

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:10.320
This is a video, another
one of those WNET episodes

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:15.210
on mass and force.

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:16.930
I hope I printed
out enough of these.

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:18.081
I may not have.

00:30:18.081 --> 00:30:19.080
ELIZABETH: We can share.

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.690
JOSH: OK.

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:24.690
Some people are going to
have to share, unfortunately.

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:29.450
OK, so John-- we use
Flash a lot, just

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:33.020
for illustration and
for storyboarding

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:35.080
and for some
animation components.

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.100
I won't go into all that.

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:42.110
But what John has here
is a Wacom tablet.

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:46.330
And it allows us to just get
our ideas in the computer,

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:48.530
basically.

00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:50.922
So I need the script.

00:30:50.922 --> 00:30:53.874
AUDIENCE: Yeah, let me help.

00:30:53.874 --> 00:30:56.340
We can share this one.

00:30:56.340 --> 00:31:02.360
JOSH: All right, so let's just
focus on the first paragraph.

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:08.090
And in order for this work,
please chime in and participate

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:13.072
in this process because
what'll end up happening

00:31:13.072 --> 00:31:15.530
is we'll end up with exactly
the same thing we already did.

00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:16.696
And I don't want to do that.

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:22.960
"Mass is a measure of
an object's ability

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:26.850
to resist being
accelerated by force.

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:28.940
That means the more
massive an object is,

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:31.400
the harder it is to make
it move if it's at rest

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:36.070
or to stop it if it's moving."

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:38.670
So thinking about
the need to make

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:40.790
the beginning of the
video very interesting

00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:43.110
and to immediately
engage the viewer,

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:44.600
how do we want to
start this one?

00:31:51.572 --> 00:31:55.556
AUDIENCE: Maybe somebody
being pulled by a force

00:31:55.556 --> 00:31:59.050
and they're trying
really hard to resist?

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:01.340
JOSH: OK.

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:03.340
"Mass is a measure
of an object."

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:05.000
So we've got an object.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.416
What kind of object do we want?

00:32:08.416 --> 00:32:09.872
AUDIENCE: Well, a fat man--

00:32:09.872 --> 00:32:10.372
JOSH: Huh?

00:32:10.372 --> 00:32:12.330
AUDIENCE: A fat man.

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:13.130
JOSH: A fat man.

00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:13.860
Something big.

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:15.420
Something iconic.

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:21.140
Something that really
symbolizes mass.

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:23.060
AUDIENCE: A building, a
monument or something?

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:24.690
JOSH: A building, a monument.

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:26.440
How about-- what were
you gonna say, Josh?

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.946
AUDIENCE: I was
thinking of just the

00:32:28.946 --> 00:32:35.927
but in some kind of like
stone, like a big stone that

00:32:35.927 --> 00:32:37.090
says "mass."

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:38.390
JOSH: OK, that could work.

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:40.320
AUDIENCE: And it falls
down in the dust.

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:40.850
JOSH: OK.

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:42.780
AUDIENCE: A brass weight.

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:44.487
JOSH: A brass weight, yeah.

00:32:44.487 --> 00:32:45.830
AUDIENCE: An anvil?

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:48.450
JOSH: An anvil-- those
are iconic things, yeah.

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:52.800
AUDIENCE: A one-ton thing that
gets dropped on someone's head.

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:57.720
JOSH: Yeah, that would be the
Looney Tunes approach for sure.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.470
It OK, so what do
you think, John?

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:04.960
Should we go with
something big that falls?

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:08.808
Is a good-- do we need the
word "mass" on the screen?

00:33:08.808 --> 00:33:10.480
AUDIENCE: Not really.

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.620
JOSH: OK.

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:14.610
AUDIENCE: Something
big that falls.

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:16.919
AUDIENCE: Stick with beer.

00:33:16.919 --> 00:33:20.370
JOHN: So beer could work.

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:27.450
JOSH: Why don't we do the--
let's go with-- let's try

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:30.996
out this idea of the word
"mass" being made out of stone.

00:33:30.996 --> 00:33:32.120
That's kind of interesting.

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:36.030
It falls and, like,
crumbles, like,

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:39.966
creates this sort of
cloud of dust and stuff.

00:33:39.966 --> 00:33:40.710
That sounds good.

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:52.300
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:52.800
JOSH: Yeah.

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.596
AUDIENCE: How many is
number of storyboards

00:33:55.596 --> 00:33:57.926
do you need for every
one of your ideas?

00:33:57.926 --> 00:34:00.867
Like, to what detail
do we need to go?

00:34:00.867 --> 00:34:02.325
JOSH: Yeah, that's
a good question.

00:34:05.177 --> 00:34:06.510
What you think about that, John?

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:07.801
JOHN: I think that's up to you.

00:34:07.801 --> 00:34:09.820
I mean, I'm a very
visual person.

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:14.350
So for me, I'd like to draw
maybe three or four frames

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:16.830
of this mass dropping down.

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:21.100
But for you, maybe you
could just make one drawing.

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:24.150
And next to the storyboard,
explain the action.

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:25.770
Explain what's going on.

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:26.659
JOSH: Yeah.

00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:29.264
A lot of times, we draw a red
arrows to indicate movement.

00:34:29.264 --> 00:34:30.639
So you could draw
the word "mass"

00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:33.570
at the bottom of the
screen with the clouds

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:36.448
and have a red
arrow facing down.

00:34:36.448 --> 00:34:38.239
ELIZABETH: I mean,
there's no right answer.

00:34:38.239 --> 00:34:41.450
This is really for your benefit
or the benefit of whoever's

00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:42.814
gonna be filming it for you.

00:34:42.814 --> 00:34:44.120
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:48.270
ELIZABETH: So we definitely
go the more rudimentary route

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:49.376
in general.

00:34:49.376 --> 00:34:50.000
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.541
ELIZABETH: But whatever would
make you feel most comfortable.

00:34:52.541 --> 00:34:55.499
I think a rule of thumb--
like, a bare minimum-- is

00:34:55.499 --> 00:34:58.530
that any time you're changing
the scene, like you're changing

00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:00.810
the camera angle or you're
changing the location,

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:03.690
you definitely want to do
another board for that.

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:13.430
JOSH: And John is drawing in,
like, just a horizon here.

00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:15.560
So you have a
sense of the scene,

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:19.376
just at a very
basic level, where

00:35:19.376 --> 00:35:21.000
the background is
going to be and where

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.400
the word is going to land.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:30.750
And I think that's enough
for the first line.

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:32.500
JOHN: And this is just
the beginning, too.

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:34.350
A lot times with
our storyboards,

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:36.680
we'll just draw out our ideas.

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:39.620
And then we'll come to the
end of the whole story board

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:41.020
and take a look at it.

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:43.352
And we'll say, well,
we have this ending.

00:35:43.352 --> 00:35:45.310
But it doesn't really
match with the beginning.

00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:47.910
So then we go back and maybe
we change the beginning

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:50.730
to more match the end.

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:52.360
We're just getting
all our ideas out.

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:55.720
But you're not locked into this
idea now that we've drawn it.

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:58.560
JOSH: Right, OK.

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:03.030
So, next line-- "That means
the more massive an object is,

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:05.170
the harder it is to
make it move if it's

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:11.870
at rest or to stop
it if it's moving."

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:14.440
And that-- yeah, so what do
you think about that one?

00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:19.660
We've got this object that's
fallen onto the screen

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:25.294
and now we're talking about
moving it and stopping it.

00:36:25.294 --> 00:36:27.102
AUDIENCE: I think
of a person who's,

00:36:27.102 --> 00:36:30.010
like, kind of doing, like,
the old pushing against it.

00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:30.510
JOSH: Yeah.

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:32.418
AUDIENCE: And their
legs are moving,

00:36:32.418 --> 00:36:33.850
but they're not going anywhere.

00:36:33.850 --> 00:36:37.150
JOSH: I think that's a
natural, very, very iconic way

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:38.870
of doing that.

00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:41.740
So we have a character
now who comes in.

00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:51.630
And, you know, like
this-- "oh god!"--

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:53.040
is trying to push this thing.

00:37:00.012 --> 00:37:03.249
AUDIENCE: I think that, for
the second portion, when

00:37:03.249 --> 00:37:06.486
the thing slides and the mass
will come sliding off the guy,

00:37:06.486 --> 00:37:08.976
he has to try stop
it by [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:08.976 --> 00:37:13.480
So he's, like, pinned
to the wall by the mass.

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.180
JOSH: OK.

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:20.570
What if this little
guy tries to push it

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:25.340
and then maybe an elephant comes
on the other side of the word

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:30.000
and pushes it-- and is effective
at pushing it towards him?

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.610
And then he has to,
like, go this to get it

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:34.100
to-- he's like, oh my god.

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:35.060
And he can't stop it.

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:36.895
And he gets pushed
off the screen.

00:37:36.895 --> 00:37:39.507
Something like
that, would that--

00:37:39.507 --> 00:37:42.882
AUDIENCE: How about
the screen tilts?

00:37:42.882 --> 00:37:44.090
JOSH: Oh, that's a good idea.

00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:45.460
AUDIENCE: I like that, yeah.

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:48.860
JOSH: So then it's-- gravity
is working on the word, then.

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:49.774
That could work.

00:37:49.774 --> 00:37:51.190
AUDIENCE: I really
like that idea.

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:52.250
JOSH: Yeah, yeah.

00:39:12.452 --> 00:39:13.910
And he tries to
get out of the way.

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:19.600
OK, great.

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.100
So that covers the
first paragraph for me.

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:24.730
Are you guys-- do you think
we're-- this is a good start?

00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:34.990
So let's start with
the next sentence.

00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:36.630
Are you all set?

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:38.600
OK.

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:41.780
"The nifty thing about mass
is that it doesn't necessarily

00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:45.160
have to do with size.

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:49.300
Think of a big pile of rocks
and a big pile of feathers.

00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:52.020
Both piles are the
same size or volume.

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:53.540
But it would take
a lot more effort

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:55.750
or force to move
the pile of rocks

00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:57.900
than it would to move
the pile of feathers.

00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:59.070
The reason?

00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:00.990
Rocks have more
mass than feathers

00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:03.660
because they're more dense."

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:05.780
All right, so how do
we tackle this one?

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.790
AUDIENCE: You could,
like, camera this big mass

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:12.990
thing and just [INAUDIBLE]
into a bunch of rocks.

00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:14.210
JOSH: OK, cool.

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:14.710
Maybe--

00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:15.394
AUDIENCE: I don't
know if you want

00:40:15.394 --> 00:40:17.508
to go away from the mass thing,
but if you want to keep it,

00:40:17.508 --> 00:40:18.870
then just-- I don't know.

00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:21.900
JOSH: That's nice-- I like the
idea of making it cohesive,

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:25.290
like it's all-- it's
all working together.

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:27.380
So maybe the mass
slides down the ramp

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:31.270
and hits something and breaks
apart into a pile of rocks.

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:33.660
So there's a pile of rocks
on one side of the screen.

00:40:36.570 --> 00:40:38.140
AUDIENCE: The birds.

00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:38.905
JOSH: What's that?

00:40:38.905 --> 00:40:41.530
AUDIENCE: And it hits the birds,
and then you get the feathers.

00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:43.170
JOSH: Oh, that's a good idea.

00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:45.045
That's an interesting idea.

00:40:45.045 --> 00:40:47.647
AUDIENCE: And you have a pile
of feathers and a pile of rocks.

00:40:47.647 --> 00:40:49.230
JOHN: Oh, so this
character is a bird?

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:50.042
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:50.042 --> 00:40:51.000
JOHN: I like that idea.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:51.666
AUDIENCE: Right?

00:40:51.666 --> 00:40:54.920
Now we've got organically
our rocks and our feathers.

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:57.192
JOSH: Yeah, so--

00:40:57.192 --> 00:40:59.900
ELIZABETH: Oh, I have a
clarification question.

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.409
So, in the script,
is it that the guy

00:41:02.409 --> 00:41:03.450
is running from the mass?

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:06.750
Or should he push back on the
mass when he starts to fall?

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:09.390
Oh, I guess he's doing
it on the first frame.

00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:10.640
JOSH: He's pushing against it.

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.760
And then it starts--
then things tilt.

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.100
And it starts to slide forward.

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:15.766
AUDIENCE: And then
he gives up because--

00:41:15.766 --> 00:41:18.655
JOSH: Yeah, but is
somebody suggesting

00:41:18.655 --> 00:41:20.840
that this guy's a bird?

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:21.630
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:24.440
JOSH: OK, so how are we going
to do this in a kind of fun,

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:28.554
nonviolent way, that
this bird, like--

00:41:28.554 --> 00:41:30.470
AUDIENCE: Tell us that
he had feathers, right?

00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:33.610
If we're not gonna kill a bird,
like, there's pillows, right?

00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:34.110
JOSH: Yeah.

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:37.470
AUDIENCE: How else could you
get a big pile of feathers?

00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:39.970
JOSH: Well, I mean they could
just sort of divinely appear,

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:42.847
like they could just fall
from the top of the screen.

00:41:42.847 --> 00:41:44.430
AUDIENCE: Someone
could walk on screen

00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:48.382
with a wheelbarrow full of
rock, dump it, and then carry

00:41:48.382 --> 00:41:51.260
on a bag of feathers that's
about the same volume.

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:54.230
JOSH: Yeah, yeah.

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:57.210
And let me back up for a
second, because let's think

00:41:57.210 --> 00:42:02.280
about this in terms of-- So
this first scene-- obviously,

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:04.160
we're talking about
animation here.

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:09.140
Like, we're not going to
do this live action, right?

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:13.090
But let's imagine that the next
scene-- the second paragraph--

00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:14.940
is live action.

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:18.510
So then we're talking about more
of like an idea like you have,

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:22.410
where you have some actual
people moving rocks around.

00:42:22.410 --> 00:42:27.990
And you have maybe somebody
dumping out feathers.

00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:32.130
Is that what we want to do--
is kind of a combo here?

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:33.220
I know I may be--

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:35.420
AUDIENCE: Well,
maybe bringing it

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:41.772
to [INAUDIBLE] the mass
where it falls into his hand,

00:42:41.772 --> 00:42:42.960
crushes it.

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.018
And he can see,
maybe it's like he

00:42:45.018 --> 00:42:47.109
puts it ont he table
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:49.400
JOSH: Oh, OK, so you're
talking about a nice transition

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:52.977
between-- that could
be interesting.

00:42:52.977 --> 00:42:55.060
ELIZABETH: Or you could
do overlay to transition--

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:55.850
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
with the overlay.

00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:58.410
ELIZABETH: That person in
the middle and the mass

00:42:58.410 --> 00:43:01.560
falls down next to him or
her and creates a rock pile.

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:02.290
And then--

00:43:02.290 --> 00:43:03.870
JOSH: Yeah, so then we have a--

00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:06.030
ELIZABETH: And then feathers
pop up or something.

00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:09.140
JOSH: Yeah, so then we have
a host at the-- throughout--

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:11.480
we start with a
host, a talking head.

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:13.760
And then we have the mass
fall down beside him.

00:43:16.922 --> 00:43:18.630
You see how this gets
complicated, right?

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:20.463
There's lots of different
ways to do things.

00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:29.410
Well, for the sake
of simplicity,

00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:31.410
let's continue as
if we're just going

00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:35.050
to animate this video, OK?

00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:36.580
Is that OK with you, Elizabeth?

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:38.170
ELIZABETH: Oh, absolutely not.

00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:38.670
No.

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:39.040
JOSH: OK.

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:40.250
ELIZABETH: Of course
it should be that way.

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:42.833
JOSH: Just so that we-- you guys
get the sense of the process.

00:43:42.833 --> 00:43:45.600
But you can already see that
there are so many options.

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:49.600
There's so many different
ways to do things.

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.175
OK, so back to our feathers.

00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:57.470
"The nifty thing mass is
that it doesn't necessarily

00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:59.100
have to do with size."

00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:04.970
All right, so
we've got this mass

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:07.030
that's rolled down the hill.

00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:09.790
And I like the idea of
hitting something and turning

00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:10.970
into a pile of rocks.

00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:12.583
Are we going to
go with that idea?

00:44:12.583 --> 00:44:14.750
AUDIENCE: And maybe
it goes off a cliff?

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:16.930
JOSH: OK, yeah, it
goes off a cliff.

00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:18.596
AUDIENCE: It could
hit a pillow factory.

00:44:18.596 --> 00:44:19.346
You could have a--

00:44:19.346 --> 00:44:20.915
JOSH: A pillow factory.

00:44:20.915 --> 00:44:24.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:25.840
That's funny.

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:26.940
Yeah, that's funny.

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:33.450
All right, so here
we have our cliff.

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:40.350
And this action will cover
the nifty thing about mass.

00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:07.800
And then, down in the
valley-- or the canyon--

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.490
is the Acme Pillow Company?

00:45:12.944 --> 00:45:14.321
ELIZABETH: I've seen this video.

00:45:14.321 --> 00:45:17.284
So it's really interesting.

00:45:17.284 --> 00:45:19.769
Yeah, it's different, this one.

00:45:19.769 --> 00:45:21.757
I really like this one.

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:31.720
JOSH: Pillows 'R' Us?

00:45:34.531 --> 00:45:35.031
That's

00:45:35.031 --> 00:45:35.614
AUDIENCE: Fun.

00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:46.720
JOSH: So we've got to do--
think of a big pile of rocks

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:49.093
and a big pile of feathers.

00:45:49.093 --> 00:45:49.593
Boom!

00:45:58.251 --> 00:46:00.180
AUDIENCE: So then maybe we cut--

00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:05.150
JOSH: Then we cut to a pile of
rocks and a pile of feathers.

00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:07.750
So this is a jump
cut to a close-up?

00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:21.610
AUDIENCE: Just
imagine these piles.

00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:34.409
JOSH: "Both piles are
the same size or volume.

00:46:34.409 --> 00:46:35.950
But it would take
a lot more effort--

00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:37.960
or force-- to move
the pile of rocks

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:41.580
than it would to move
the pile of feathers."

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:45.510
So maybe our protagonist,
our little guy

00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:54.910
who was holding the mass thing,
needs to come back in here.

00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:56.245
What should he do now?

00:46:56.245 --> 00:46:57.328
AUDIENCE: When [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:02.020
JOSH: Yeah, we could
do it that way.

00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:02.520
When is--

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:04.103
AUDIENCE: Could he
try to clean it up,

00:47:04.103 --> 00:47:07.640
with a broom or something?

00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:09.310
JOSH: Potentially, yeah.

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:16.080
Yeah.

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:20.254
Or maybe he-- well,
any other ideas?

00:47:20.254 --> 00:47:23.297
AUDIENCE: If you want, you could
add this-- you could take away

00:47:23.297 --> 00:47:25.124
with, like, a leafblower.

00:47:25.124 --> 00:47:28.772
Something that just blows off
and thunders off the screen.

00:47:28.772 --> 00:47:29.480
ELIZABETH: Yeah--

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:31.170
AUDIENCE: --blow the rocks.

00:47:31.170 --> 00:47:34.270
JOSH: That could work, yeah.

00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:36.022
AUDIENCE: By adding
onto that, maybe he

00:47:36.022 --> 00:47:38.094
tries to blow the rocks
and nothing happens.

00:47:38.094 --> 00:47:39.050
And he kicks it.

00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:42.856
And he injures his own toe.

00:47:42.856 --> 00:47:43.355
JOSH: Yeah.

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:52.220
So what do we have?

00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:56.055
A leaf blower, we have
a cleaning up scenario.

00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:06.894
You want to try the leaf blower?

00:48:06.894 --> 00:48:07.740
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:10.070
JOSH: Or anything else?

00:48:12.539 --> 00:48:14.080
JOHN: Is there any
way we can connect

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:15.370
this with the beginning?

00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:21.060
In the beginning, he's trying
to move this word, "mass."

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:22.280
Is there anything there?

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:26.880
Is he, maybe, the janitor?

00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:29.640
And this mass is in his way.

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:31.352
He doesn't like it there.

00:48:31.352 --> 00:48:33.310
And then he's trying to
do the same thing here.

00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:34.726
He's trying to
clean up this mess.

00:48:36.985 --> 00:48:39.350
I don't know, just
spitballing here.

00:48:39.350 --> 00:48:41.600
Is there a way we can tie
the two things together

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:42.747
is the question.

00:48:42.747 --> 00:48:43.372
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:48:46.348 --> 00:48:47.340
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:50.795
I was thinking that he's
running-- because he's

00:48:50.795 --> 00:48:51.920
running away from the mass.

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:54.565
So he runs along with the mass.

00:48:54.565 --> 00:48:55.606
And he crashes and booms.

00:48:55.606 --> 00:48:56.890
And he lands in the feathers.

00:48:56.890 --> 00:48:58.642
He's like getting away
from the feathers.

00:48:58.642 --> 00:48:59.683
This clears the feathers.

00:48:59.683 --> 00:49:03.410
Then he tries to get it off.

00:49:03.410 --> 00:49:05.250
JOSH: That's interesting.

00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:06.780
So it's what does it say here?

00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:09.930
"Think of a big pile of rocks
and big pile of feathers.

00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:11.750
Both files are the
same size or volume.

00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:13.291
But it would take
a lot more effort--

00:49:13.291 --> 00:49:14.810
or force-- to move
the pile of rocks

00:49:14.810 --> 00:49:18.290
than it would to move
the pile of feathers."

00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:20.250
So I think we're
back to a scenario

00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:22.540
where we need to have
some sort of-- we need

00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:23.805
to show force being exerted.

00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:30.230
So "It would take
a lot more effort--

00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:33.430
or force-- to move
the pile of rocks."

00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:37.490
So what sort of--
how can we show that?

00:49:37.490 --> 00:49:39.310
We almost already
showed it in a way.

00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:41.018
AUDIENCE: Maybe a
cleaning up crew trying

00:49:41.018 --> 00:49:42.660
to move them off the frame?

00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:44.820
JOSH: Yeah, or maybe
just our character

00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:47.440
trying to push this
pile of rocks again.

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:49.210
It's like, oh man, not again.

00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:50.864
I got to push something else.

00:49:50.864 --> 00:49:53.072
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering if
he should have a backpack,

00:49:53.072 --> 00:49:56.300
so he could--

00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:57.717
JOSH: What's that?

00:49:57.717 --> 00:50:00.050
AUDIENCE: We're heading towards
having a student, right?

00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:01.060
JOSH: Yeah, yeah.

00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:02.830
AUDIENCE: So maybe
he's our student.

00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:03.750
JOSH: Right, right.

00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:05.791
AUDIENCE: And that we
identify with the beginning

00:50:05.791 --> 00:50:08.310
as some thing that makes
him obviously a student.

00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:10.970
JOSH: He's on his way
to school or something.

00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:12.210
And this adventure happens.

00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:13.834
AUDIENCE: A kid would
obviously, like--

00:50:13.834 --> 00:50:15.130
JOSH: Yeah, yeah.

00:50:15.130 --> 00:50:17.009
And the audience is kids.

00:50:17.009 --> 00:50:18.050
This is middle schoolers.

00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:23.610
So we could add a note
to that first scene,

00:50:23.610 --> 00:50:25.015
like, kid with backpack.

00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:46.000
So we agree that--
so this kid is

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.470
going to try to move
these rocks in some way?

00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:52.099
He's trying to push them or
gets his back up against them

00:50:52.099 --> 00:50:53.640
and tries to get
them out of the way?

00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:59.400
AUDIENCE: I like the idea
of there's a clean-up crew.

00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:01.080
So there could be
two different kinds

00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:04.490
of [INAUDIBLE] on the right.

00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:06.180
Here are the feathers.

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:08.735
Or someone sweeping--
one of them.

00:51:08.735 --> 00:51:11.810
And the rocks would be just like
this construction truck-- beep,

00:51:11.810 --> 00:51:12.420
beep, beep.

00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:14.200
Then he comes in
and picks it up.

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:15.400
JOSH: Yeah.

00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:19.750
Does that really show the
notion of differing amounts

00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:23.082
of force being required?

00:51:23.082 --> 00:51:25.046
AUDIENCE: That's
a good question.

00:51:25.046 --> 00:51:26.519
AUDIENCE: Maybe less likely.

00:51:26.519 --> 00:51:29.310
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:29.310 --> 00:51:31.999
JOHN: Maybe you use the heavy
machinery to move the rocks.

00:51:31.999 --> 00:51:33.790
And then we just move
our little character.

00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:37.060
And he can move the feathers.

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:39.280
JOSH: Yeah, that could work.

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:41.350
Like, a big backhoe
has to move the rocks.

00:51:41.350 --> 00:51:46.000
But the character
is able to just

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.569
either blow on the
feathers or move them out

00:51:48.569 --> 00:51:49.610
of the way really easily.

00:51:59.410 --> 00:52:01.860
JOHN: Can you see
a little berm here?

00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:04.080
JOSH: OK, yeah, that's nice.

00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:07.835
That work?

00:52:07.835 --> 00:52:10.030
Does that "sell it," as we say?

00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:21.760
So we need to show
that the-- do we

00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:24.374
need to show the backhoe first?

00:52:24.374 --> 00:52:25.790
"It would take a
lot more effort--

00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:27.710
or force-- to move
the pile of rocks."

00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:30.270
And then we have another
shot-- "than it would

00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:44.240
to move the pile of feathers."

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:47.452
We see the rocks gone
in the next scene.

00:52:47.452 --> 00:52:49.450
JOHN: Right here they're gone?

00:52:49.450 --> 00:52:49.950
JOSH: Yeah.

00:53:39.102 --> 00:53:41.018
So he gets through-- so
the feathers are gone.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.580
And then we've got
another line here.

00:53:57.580 --> 00:54:01.290
"The reason rocks have
more mass than feathers

00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:10.756
because they're more dense."

00:54:10.756 --> 00:54:14.364
AUDIENCE: Maybe you could,
like, have a scale with, like,

00:54:14.364 --> 00:54:15.676
the backhoe with rocks on it.

00:54:15.676 --> 00:54:19.120
And you've got feathers
on it or something.

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:22.110
[INAUDIBLE]

00:54:22.110 --> 00:54:23.200
JOSH: Is it-- yeah.

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:26.780
AUDIENCE: That's why I was,
like, it's not a type of scale.

00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:29.014
JOSH: Right, right.

00:54:29.014 --> 00:54:31.430
I'm not a scientist-- and you
guys can help me with this--

00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:36.720
but does density really
equate to weight?

00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:38.790
If we just show them on
a scale, does that really

00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:41.372
show that one is more
dense than the other?

00:54:41.372 --> 00:54:42.538
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I guess not.

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:48.320
AUDIENCE: I mean, it's indirect.

00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:51.656
So maybe a better way
would be to address density

00:54:51.656 --> 00:54:52.930
more directly?

00:54:52.930 --> 00:54:53.430
JOSH: Yeah.

00:54:58.010 --> 00:55:02.840
Could we do something,
like-- just very simple,

00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:09.580
where we just-- the
character extends two hands.

00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:10.730
In one hand is a rock.

00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:12.600
And in the other is a feather.

00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:19.690
And we just-- and we
put the words more

00:55:19.690 --> 00:55:23.070
dense above the hand
with the rock in it

00:55:23.070 --> 00:55:26.030
or something like that?

00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:32.431
How do you visually say
something is more dense?

00:55:32.431 --> 00:55:33.930
Like, how do you
show that visually?

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:35.346
AUDIENCE: The
tractor, or whatever

00:55:35.346 --> 00:55:39.010
that heavy machine was, it
could be throwing the rocks off

00:55:39.010 --> 00:55:39.731
into the ocean.

00:55:39.731 --> 00:55:41.204
And you see the rocks sinking.

00:55:41.204 --> 00:55:44.641
And then the feathers are just
floating in the air, maybe just

00:55:44.641 --> 00:55:46.605
landing on the surface.

00:55:46.605 --> 00:55:48.112
JOSH: That's an
interesting idea.

00:55:48.112 --> 00:55:49.570
AUDIENCE: It
definitely shows that.

00:55:49.570 --> 00:55:52.215
And I'm not sure how
familiar the kids will

00:55:52.215 --> 00:55:54.312
be with the concept of density.

00:55:57.010 --> 00:55:59.826
But having the water--
sinking, floating,

00:55:59.826 --> 00:56:02.814
maybe-- makes the
point a bit better.

00:56:05.330 --> 00:56:09.515
AUDIENCE: You already
introduced volume.

00:56:09.515 --> 00:56:11.506
So I feel like to
introduce density

00:56:11.506 --> 00:56:14.784
wouldn't really be
doing, like, what

00:56:14.784 --> 00:56:15.992
came before, which is volume.

00:56:15.992 --> 00:56:17.533
I don't think it
would do it justice.

00:56:17.533 --> 00:56:20.210
Because density is
volume and mass.

00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:24.790
So if you're able to have volume
and then go to mass after that,

00:56:24.790 --> 00:56:27.380
I think that's where
they'd connect,

00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:29.280
that the mass could
be different even

00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:31.280
though the volume is the same.

00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:35.232
And you would still have
different densities.

00:56:35.232 --> 00:56:36.660
ELIZABETH: I mean,
the other thing

00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:38.730
is that the video isn't
really about density.

00:56:38.730 --> 00:56:42.041
The video is about
mass and acceleration.

00:56:42.041 --> 00:56:42.540
JOSH: Yeah.

00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:44.436
ELIZABETH: So it
may not even be--

00:56:44.436 --> 00:56:46.665
and, like, this is sacrilege--
but it may not even

00:56:46.665 --> 00:56:48.610
be that important
to really define

00:56:48.610 --> 00:56:50.970
what density is in this
particular video, which

00:56:50.970 --> 00:56:54.240
is why maybe it's
OK to say one's more

00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:55.700
dense than the other.

00:56:55.700 --> 00:56:58.060
It's like, a couple
minute video?

00:56:58.060 --> 00:56:59.791
JOSH: Yeah.

00:56:59.791 --> 00:57:01.290
ELIZABETH: The point
is really about

00:57:01.290 --> 00:57:05.220
how things that have more
mass require more force.

00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:06.960
If you start going
into density, I'm

00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:09.240
afraid that people
would also want

00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:12.850
to talk about what the
difference between weight

00:57:12.850 --> 00:57:13.820
and mass are, too.

00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:15.610
JOSH: Yeah, true.

00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:17.960
ELIZABETH: So again, it's
like, at what point are you

00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:20.633
branching off too much
from the point of the video

00:57:20.633 --> 00:57:22.600
and the main point of the story?

00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:24.100
JOSH: That's a good point, yeah.

00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:33.470
Well, "The reason rocks
have more mass than feathers

00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:36.480
because they're more dense."

00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:40.300
Yeah, so maybe--
I don't remember

00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:42.965
what we did in the video we
actually ended up producing.

00:57:48.310 --> 00:57:52.800
I think I would go with the
hand displaying the two things

00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:56.560
and think about how they're
essentially the same size.

00:57:56.560 --> 00:58:01.730
But one is very light
and one is this rock.

00:58:01.730 --> 00:58:02.745
It's dense.

00:58:02.745 --> 00:58:07.180
ELIZABETH: Can you-- is
it possible to zoom in

00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:08.430
on the rock?

00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:11.675
Because density is really that
there's more stuff per space,

00:58:11.675 --> 00:58:12.990
right?

00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:15.810
So somehow have the
rock bulge a little bit

00:58:15.810 --> 00:58:18.130
to show that frame
is like stuffed

00:58:18.130 --> 00:58:19.890
with as much stuff as possible.

00:58:19.890 --> 00:58:20.390
JOSH: Yeah.

00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:24.176
ELIZABETH: And then
show the feathers

00:58:24.176 --> 00:58:28.370
and show like a lot more air and
space in between the feathers.

00:58:28.370 --> 00:58:30.460
And you can still put
the label "more dense."

00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:33.200
But maybe there'd be some
sort of visual cue associated

00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:34.345
with that as well.

00:58:34.345 --> 00:58:35.345
JOSH: Yeah, potentially.

00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:42.025
This is a toughie.

00:58:42.025 --> 00:58:44.150
JOHN: So you're saying,
maybe, we cut to a new shot

00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:47.440
where we see a rock and
a feather side by side?

00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:50.000
And then maybe we
see like, a view

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.279
of each one under a microscope?

00:58:52.279 --> 00:58:53.820
ELIZABETH: Almost,
but again, I don't

00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:56.285
know if that's distracting
too much from the main point

00:58:56.285 --> 00:58:59.450
of the story.

00:58:59.450 --> 00:59:03.060
JOSH: Well, I like that
idea-- the microscope image.

00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:05.450
Like, we show like the
crystalline structure

00:59:05.450 --> 00:59:10.501
of the rock is really, it's like
a lot of stuff packed in there.

00:59:10.501 --> 00:59:11.974
AUDIENCE: What if he was poking?

00:59:11.974 --> 00:59:16.393
So you can't poke a rock but
maybe he takes out a pencil

00:59:16.393 --> 00:59:18.848
and pokes through the feather.

00:59:18.848 --> 00:59:20.321
We can do that [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:23.267 --> 00:59:25.722
AUDIENCE: I think
it's too complicated

00:59:25.722 --> 00:59:29.190
to go with this concept.

00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:31.111
Like, I don't know.

00:59:31.111 --> 00:59:36.675
The word "dense," like, I
don't think we have to-- I

00:59:36.675 --> 00:59:39.460
don't know if we have to
explain that right now.

00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:43.000
JOSH: Yeah, well, let's think
of another strategy here.

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:46.710
How necessary do you think
this line is in the script?

00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:50.000
I mean, is it vital to
the script itself, I mean,

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:51.733
to the whole story?

00:59:51.733 --> 00:59:53.300
I don't know, I
haven't given you

00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:55.080
guys a chance to
read the whole thing.

00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:57.770
But maybe this is
one of those moments

00:59:57.770 --> 00:59:59.280
where we take this line out.

00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:04.500
And we end the paragraph
with moving the feathers.

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:06.220
AUDIENCE: Well, it's far easier.

01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:08.160
JOSH: Yeah, it is easier.

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:10.470
And it might be one
of those moments

01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:15.532
where this line is a distraction
from the-- I think that's where

01:00:15.532 --> 01:00:16.990
we're struggling right now.

01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:18.620
JOSH: Yeah, yeah.

01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:22.380
So let's say, OK, we're going
to remove this line for now.

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:27.600
And some client is
gonna come to you

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:29.750
and say, well, why did you
guys take that line out?

01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:30.900
We really need that.

01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:33.200
And then you have
to argue for that.

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.310
That's all part of
the process, right?

01:00:35.310 --> 01:00:38.650
Like, well, we talked about
this for about an hour.

01:00:38.650 --> 01:00:41.220
And we realized that
this wasn't really

01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:42.687
important to the process.

01:00:42.687 --> 01:00:43.520
You know, and that--

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:45.186
AUDIENCE: How often
do you feel like you

01:00:45.186 --> 01:00:47.400
have to, like, you have
an artistic vision of what

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:49.221
direction it should go?

01:00:49.221 --> 01:00:50.470
JOSH: It happens all the time.

01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:50.840
Yeah,

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:52.000
AUDIENCE: And then
you have to comment?

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.580
JOSH: In my
professional opinion--

01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:55.430
and that's when I
have to sort of fake

01:00:55.430 --> 01:01:01.820
this professional persona--
we don't think you

01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:04.100
should have this
line in the script.

01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:07.980
And in retrospect, this
line is in the video we--

01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:10.530
but we didn't have 15 people
to talk about it with.

01:01:10.530 --> 01:01:12.690
We only had four.

01:01:12.690 --> 01:01:16.140
ELIZABETH: But do you see how--
like, are people OK with taking

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:17.280
that line out now?

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:19.546
Like, you see why maybe
that's a good choice?

01:01:19.546 --> 01:01:22.180
Would you have reacted
that positively

01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:25.945
to the idea of taking this out
maybe five days ago, before we

01:01:25.945 --> 01:01:27.315
had gone through this class?

01:01:27.315 --> 01:01:28.822
Because I feel that
is the reaction

01:01:28.822 --> 01:01:29.780
of a lot of scientists.

01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:31.529
Like, wait, wait,
wait-- this is accurate,

01:01:31.529 --> 01:01:34.120
but it's not precise, like
you were just talking about.

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:36.120
You have to talk about density.

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:37.760
And that's sort
of-- I mean, I want

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:40.760
to tie this back to the work
that you guys are doing now.

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:42.855
You guys see how this
process is really

01:01:42.855 --> 01:01:47.060
making you examine
what is truly necessary

01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:48.780
and what isn't to the project.

01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:51.150
Because this is going to
happen to your scripts, too.

01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:52.691
You're gonna sit
down and storyboard.

01:01:52.691 --> 01:01:55.080
And you're gonna rack your
brain over one sentence

01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:57.460
that you can't think of
an appropriate visual for.

01:01:57.460 --> 01:02:00.180
And maybe that's a key for you
to reconsider whether or not

01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:02.530
that part is truly vital.

01:02:02.530 --> 01:02:05.060
But you are not forced to
do that until you think

01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:06.960
about things like
storyboarding and think

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:10.380
about things like an overall
narrative to your video.

01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:13.980
Because otherwise you're going
to do what most scientists do.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:18.886
And I-- I mean, I say this
as a former amateur would.

01:02:18.886 --> 01:02:22.150
But the tendency is to just
throw as much information

01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:24.860
out there to cover
your grounds, right?

01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:26.770
JOSH: Yeah, and I
think-- if I remember

01:02:26.770 --> 01:02:30.960
correctly-- this script
was a lot more complicated.

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:33.990
We received a kind of rough
script from the client.

01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:37.680
And I had to edit it down
and get it into something

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:40.310
that worked for the medium.

01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:46.260
And we had some
discussions about well,

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:47.870
like, why can't we say that?

01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:51.490
I mean, exactly what you're
talking about happened.

01:02:51.490 --> 01:02:54.205
And I think that this one
just sort of slipped through.

01:02:54.205 --> 01:02:55.080
This one got through.

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.890
And, in retrospect,
maybe we shouldn't

01:02:56.890 --> 01:03:00.280
have produced that line.

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:03.040
But I love that we're
thinking about this.

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:06.090
I think this is a really cool--
this is a really important part

01:03:06.090 --> 01:03:07.100
of the process.

01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:08.975
AUDIENCE: This goes back
to the core concept.

01:03:08.975 --> 01:03:11.480
I mean, the core, number one
thing is know your audience.

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:13.940
Think about your audience.

01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:15.710
I was actually
earlier today helping

01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:18.590
one of my graduate fellows
apply for the master's

01:03:18.590 --> 01:03:21.600
in journalism program here.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:25.748
And she has to write a 500-word
piece on a science topic.

01:03:25.748 --> 01:03:30.510
And she was trying her hardest
to consolidate an experiment.

01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:32.440
And she was trying
to think about what

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:34.600
the lay audience cares about.

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:36.445
And it was so hard for her.

01:03:36.445 --> 01:03:39.965
And she distilled it down
to two and a half sentences.

01:03:39.965 --> 01:03:44.080
But I told her even that was
too much for a New York Times

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:47.550
piece, that no one cares about
which mice were chosen and why

01:03:47.550 --> 01:03:48.495
for this experiment.

01:03:48.495 --> 01:03:52.912
And then-- that this is the
crux of, like, what I think

01:03:52.912 --> 01:03:54.220
is one of the hardest things.

01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:54.740
JOSH: Right.

01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:57.640
And there was-- I think on
Monday we heard this phrase,

01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:59.120
"kill your darlings."

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.260
There's that--

01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:02.550
AUDIENCE: And that'll
come back [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:02.550 --> 01:04:03.930
It's my favorite.

01:04:03.930 --> 01:04:08.890
JOSH: Yeah, exactly.

01:04:08.890 --> 01:04:11.510
And I think, in
retrospect, introducing

01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:15.450
the notion of density into
this is a real distraction.

01:04:15.450 --> 01:04:17.520
It's not what this is about.

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:20.220
So yeah, I would
say let's strike

01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:24.670
that line-- that we have
the luxury of doing that.

01:04:24.670 --> 01:04:29.370
So I want to stop there
with our portion of it.

01:04:29.370 --> 01:04:32.520
And then kind of let you
guys break up into groups

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:35.750
and do maybe the
next two paragraphs.

01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:37.300
If you make it
further, that's fine.

01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:43.530
And then we'll walk around
and to you about your ideas.

01:04:43.530 --> 01:04:46.020
But-- so how many
of us are there?

01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:47.140
1-2-- there's seven?

01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:48.830
ELIZABETH: There are eight.

01:04:48.830 --> 01:04:49.380
JOSH: Eight?

01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:52.255
OK, so that is nice--
two groups of four.

01:04:56.284 --> 01:04:58.200
Yeah, I'll let you divide
up however you want.

01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:00.658
If you just want to go with
you four over here and then you

01:05:00.658 --> 01:05:01.920
four over here is fine.

01:05:04.450 --> 01:05:10.820
You guys from this-- are you
guys, I would say not all three

01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:13.820
of you guys together because you
know each other and all that.

01:05:16.530 --> 01:05:18.720
But yeah, that's let's
get started with that.

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:20.326
ELIZABETH: And if you guys
need to take a break to go

01:05:20.326 --> 01:05:22.551
to the bathroom, this is a
wonderful opportunity to do

01:05:22.551 --> 01:05:23.150
that since we're--

01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:24.191
JOSH: That's a good idea.

01:05:24.191 --> 01:05:24.740
Yeah, yeah.

01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:26.510
Let's take a break
before you start.

01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:27.887
Thank you.

01:05:27.887 --> 01:05:29.720
AUDIENCE: --the student
just standing there.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:33.160
So you could have
a teacher come in.

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:34.260
AUDIENCE: Second teacher--

01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:34.885
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:05:34.885 --> 01:05:38.390
And I guess they sit
down and it's like--

01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:40.740
JOSH: You could actually
use Elizabeth and me.

01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:41.634
That would be--

01:05:41.634 --> 01:05:43.842
AUDIENCE: -gotten behind a
word that you're like, oh,

01:05:43.842 --> 01:05:45.649
that's why we use
that word, right?

01:05:45.649 --> 01:05:46.190
I don't know.

01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:47.982
AUDIENCE: They sort
of like blow up.

01:05:47.982 --> 01:05:49.190
AUDIENCE: There were people--

01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:50.940
AUDIENCE: --stuff them
inside their shirt.

01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:52.186
And now they're really big.

01:05:52.186 --> 01:05:53.852
JOSH: These people
write a press release

01:05:53.852 --> 01:05:57.570
about a product that
hasn't been invented yet.

01:05:57.570 --> 01:06:00.740
So what do you guys got?

01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:01.660
Is this thing on?

01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:03.950
Sorry.

01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:06.110
Hot mic.

01:06:06.110 --> 01:06:07.280
All right.

01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:09.863
AUDIENCE: So we've, for
the third paragraph--

01:06:09.863 --> 01:06:14.470
what it takes to
show how-- "Picture

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:15.638
a student and a teacher."

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:18.128
So we have a student
and a teacher.

01:06:18.128 --> 01:06:20.120
So the student is
like, really happy.

01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:21.614
And then the teacher is like--

01:06:21.614 --> 01:06:23.606
[MAKING A FROWNING FACE]

01:06:23.606 --> 01:06:26.096
Plus he has to do this
exercise with you,

01:06:26.096 --> 01:06:29.090
I guess probably
to find [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:29.090 --> 01:06:30.740
And then he zooms out.

01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:32.490
And you see him there,
sitting on a chair.

01:06:32.490 --> 01:06:34.965
So then you show this shot
with him sitting on a chair.

01:06:34.965 --> 01:06:36.945
And I haven't drawn
the last one here,

01:06:36.945 --> 01:06:38.803
but, it's supposed
to show from, like,

01:06:38.803 --> 01:06:45.082
the corner angle where you see
the student being very small.

01:06:45.082 --> 01:06:48.463
And then the teacher
will be, like, massive

01:06:48.463 --> 01:06:50.340
to show the difference in this.

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:52.080
JOSH: So you do
the classic thing

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:57.110
where you have an above
shot for the student and a--

01:06:57.110 --> 01:07:00.930
from the bottom for the teacher.

01:07:00.930 --> 01:07:01.624
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:07:01.624 --> 01:07:03.290
JOSH: And they're
sitting in the chairs.

01:07:03.290 --> 01:07:03.930
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:07:03.930 --> 01:07:04.657
JOSH: OK, cool.

01:07:04.657 --> 01:07:06.990
AUDIENCE: I guess that stopped
with the third paragraph.

01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:07.990
JOSH: Yeah, I mean
that's enough.

01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:10.261
I mean it sounds like you
guys went further than that.

01:07:10.261 --> 01:07:12.010
AUDIENCE: Yeah, we
went further than that.

01:07:12.010 --> 01:07:14.160
JOSH: OK, go ahead and share it.

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:17.645
I'd be curious to see.

01:07:17.645 --> 01:07:23.910
AUDIENCE: Where are my-- Ah!

01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:26.260
So then he-- so he
just pushes him off.

01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:29.020
I guess he wants a
little bit of comical--

01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:30.730
so you can see from the side.

01:07:30.730 --> 01:07:34.448
But because he does rolling
chairs with this and things,

01:07:34.448 --> 01:07:37.801
so the kid will go "whee."

01:07:37.801 --> 01:07:40.200
Now there's physical distance.

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:43.275
But there's this little
line they put over

01:07:43.275 --> 01:07:46.380
to show there's a difference
between [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:48.110
JOSH: OK, cool.

01:07:48.110 --> 01:07:49.370
I like where that's going.

01:07:49.370 --> 01:07:50.078
That sounds cool.

01:07:50.078 --> 01:07:53.450
Did you guys have any thoughts
or feelings about the process,

01:07:53.450 --> 01:07:55.490
like-- does this give
you a sense of what it's

01:07:55.490 --> 01:07:57.320
really like to do
this stuff and have

01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:02.494
to run these scenarios through
your brain and visualize them?

01:08:02.494 --> 01:08:04.430
AUDIENCE: I think,
like, the big thing

01:08:04.430 --> 01:08:07.818
we found was you have this
text but, like, knowing

01:08:07.818 --> 01:08:09.270
how to read it.

01:08:09.270 --> 01:08:13.626
So like, we just-- with
that first student teacher--

01:08:13.626 --> 01:08:16.970
we read it like, "picture
a student and teacher."

01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:19.484
Like that's just-- if we
have a frame of a student

01:08:19.484 --> 01:08:21.525
[INAUDIBLE] a teacher,
that would slow that down.

01:08:21.525 --> 01:08:23.260
So we had to be like,
picture a student.

01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:25.050
Now picture a teacher.

01:08:25.050 --> 01:08:26.180
JOSH: Right, right.

01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:28.550
So you're thinking about
directorial sort of things,

01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:32.090
like how you're going to--
how the voiceover is going

01:08:32.090 --> 01:08:36.010
to change as a result of these
visual decisions you're making.

01:08:36.010 --> 01:08:37.700
Yeah, that's cool.

01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:40.640
You guys?

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:44.756
It sounded like there was less
of a hum going on over here.

01:08:44.756 --> 01:08:47.130
Did you guys-- what do you
have for that third paragraph?

01:08:50.978 --> 01:08:55.469
AUDIENCE G: Well,
basically we have

01:08:55.469 --> 01:08:58.960
the kid that's standing there
from the last part, you know,

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:02.115
where the feathers
have been swept away.

01:09:02.115 --> 01:09:05.029
And the teacher walks up
with two rolling chairs.

01:09:05.029 --> 01:09:06.598
JOSH: OK, cool.

01:09:06.598 --> 01:09:08.270
AUDIENCE G: They sit down.

01:09:08.270 --> 01:09:09.770
There's a poof of smoke.

01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:12.020
And that's where it
transitions to live action.

01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:13.140
JOSH: OK, I like that.

01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:15.778
That's a cool idea.

01:09:15.778 --> 01:09:17.925
AUDIENCE H: And the
teacher grows also.

01:09:17.925 --> 01:09:19.950
That's how we're
sure she's massive.

01:09:19.950 --> 01:09:21.399
JOSH: Oh, the teacher grows.

01:09:21.399 --> 01:09:25.026
In live-- How are you
going to grow the teacher?

01:09:25.026 --> 01:09:26.609
AUDIENCE H: We stuff
her with pillows.

01:09:26.609 --> 01:09:28.899
JOSH: Oh, that's funny.

01:09:28.899 --> 01:09:35.403
So, like, maybe a stop action,
where you take a frame.

01:09:35.403 --> 01:09:37.069
And then you put one
more pillow in her.

01:09:37.069 --> 01:09:38.279
You take another frame.

01:09:38.279 --> 01:09:42.640
And you get like-- and
then you do between frames.

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:45.060
And you've got, like,
maybe 30 or 60 frames

01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:49.170
of the student-- of this teacher
getting bigger and bigger.

01:09:49.170 --> 01:09:50.830
That could be really funny.

01:09:50.830 --> 01:09:52.509
Good idea.

01:09:52.509 --> 01:09:53.800
Any thoughts about the process?

01:09:58.291 --> 01:10:01.783
ELIZABETH: What was
the hardest part?

01:10:01.783 --> 01:10:02.283
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:10.160
AUDIENCE H: How to make it
visually engaging, I guess.

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:14.592
So have enough interesting
shots but not too much.

01:10:14.592 --> 01:10:15.300
JOSH: Yeah, true.

01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:16.930
It's like that fine line, right?

01:10:16.930 --> 01:10:19.170
You don't want to overdo it.

01:10:19.170 --> 01:10:21.520
You want to-- it
really, really boils

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:24.810
down to this kind of
empathy for the viewer,

01:10:24.810 --> 01:10:28.450
for their ability to
understand things.

01:10:28.450 --> 01:10:33.810
And maintaining this
balance between your desire

01:10:33.810 --> 01:10:39.060
to have them engaged and
their need to understand--

01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:42.582
and kind of threading that line.

01:10:42.582 --> 01:10:44.665
ELIZABETH: We'll talk about
this a little bit more

01:10:44.665 --> 01:10:46.004
during our editing lecture.

01:10:46.004 --> 01:10:47.587
And Chris will talk
about it tomorrow.

01:10:47.587 --> 01:10:49.778
But visual pacing
is another thing

01:10:49.778 --> 01:10:51.483
that storyboarding can show you.

01:10:51.483 --> 01:10:54.405
So again, I'm not, like,
balancing between the sides.

01:10:54.405 --> 01:10:58.340
If you have so many shots that
are just changing too quickly,

01:10:58.340 --> 01:11:01.715
then that can be a very
nauseating experience

01:11:01.715 --> 01:11:02.340
for the viewer.

01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:05.090
And I'm gonna show you guys a
rough cut of one of the videos

01:11:05.090 --> 01:11:06.840
that we made where
that happened.

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:08.568
And it just felt too rapid.

01:11:08.568 --> 01:11:11.780
So we slowed it down.

01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:15.910
JOSH: OK, yeah, that's
really good point.

01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:17.990
Two last really small things.

01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:19.750
We didn't get to talk
about After Effects.

01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:21.880
But it's essentially
a piece of software

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:25.120
that lets you layer
video and artwork on top

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:29.150
of each other in time.

01:11:29.150 --> 01:11:32.821
And I'm sure Elizabeth will
talk a little bit about it.

01:11:32.821 --> 01:11:34.320
But if you want to
email me, and you

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:36.280
have a specific thing
you want to animate,

01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:39.200
and you want some advice
about how to do it, feel free.

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:41.920
You can come by the studio and
say hey, I've got this problem.

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:43.410
How would I animate this?

01:11:43.410 --> 01:11:45.300
We can give you
some tips about how

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:47.279
you would go about doing it.

01:11:47.279 --> 01:11:49.940
ELIZABETH: And just so
you guys know, again, you

01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:51.271
have free access to Lynda.

01:11:51.271 --> 01:11:55.762
But there's a computer lab next
to 26100, the new media center.

01:11:55.762 --> 01:11:59.255
And all the Macs are
outfitted with FinalCutPro,

01:11:59.255 --> 01:12:02.748
After Effects, the entire
Adobe creative suite.

01:12:02.748 --> 01:12:04.744
And you guys have
access to it anytime.

01:12:04.744 --> 01:12:07.239
So if you're interested in
playing with that software,

01:12:07.239 --> 01:12:10.233
or going on a media
experience, let me know.

01:12:10.233 --> 01:12:13.709
AUDIENCE: Is After Effects
different from IS&amp;T?

01:12:13.709 --> 01:12:15.375
ELIZABETH: It is if
you're installing it

01:12:15.375 --> 01:12:18.675
on a machine at MIT homes.

01:12:18.675 --> 01:12:21.645
I can ask about maybe getting
a license for you guys

01:12:21.645 --> 01:12:22.635
just for this class.

01:12:22.635 --> 01:12:25.120
AUDIENCE: You can also
just sign up on Adobe

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:29.050
and get a month's free trial
of all the Adobe Creative Suite

01:12:29.050 --> 01:12:29.550
things.

01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:31.133
So you can just sign
up with any email

01:12:31.133 --> 01:12:32.962
and download the program suite.

01:12:35.710 --> 01:12:38.060
JOSH: And then the
last thing I wanted

01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:41.480
to do is to show you the video
that we actually ended up

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:43.210
producing for this script.

01:12:43.210 --> 01:12:55.800
So here we go.

01:12:58.610 --> 01:12:59.610
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:12:59.610 --> 01:13:01.490
-Mass a measure of
an object's ability

01:13:01.490 --> 01:13:04.350
to resist being
accelerated by a force.

01:13:04.350 --> 01:13:06.930
That means the more
massive an object is,

01:13:06.930 --> 01:13:10.470
the harder it is to make
it move if it's at rest

01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:13.580
or to stop it if it's moving.

01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:16.650
The nifty thing about mass
is that doesn't necessarily

01:13:16.650 --> 01:13:18.840
have to do with size.

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:22.770
Think of a big pile of rocks
and a big pile of feathers.

01:13:22.770 --> 01:13:25.550
Both piles are the
same size, or volume.

01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:27.330
But it would take
a lot more effort--

01:13:27.330 --> 01:13:29.720
or force-- to move
the pile of rocks

01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:32.170
than it would to move
the pile of feathers.

01:13:32.170 --> 01:13:33.150
The reason?

01:13:33.150 --> 01:13:35.160
Rocks have more
mass than feathers

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:37.120
because they're more dense.

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:39.220
To show how it's harder
to accelerate something

01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:42.940
with more mass, picture a
student and a teacher each

01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:46.410
sitting at rest in a rolling
chair facing each other.

01:13:46.410 --> 01:13:50.100
Let's also say the teacher is
more massive than the student.

01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:51.650
When they both push
off each other,

01:13:51.650 --> 01:13:53.800
they go rolling backwards.

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:56.670
Notice how the student
goes back much farther

01:13:56.670 --> 01:13:59.130
and faster than the teacher.

01:13:59.130 --> 01:14:02.800
The teacher accelerates less,
since she is the more massive

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:04.190
of the two objects.

01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:06.740
And it takes more
force to accelerate her

01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:08.510
than it does the student.

01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:11.580
All of this has to do with
Newton's Second Law of Motion--

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:13.600
f equals ma.

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:17.780
It says, for a set acceleration,
an object with more mass

01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:20.400
requires more force
to get it moving

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.680
at that set acceleration.

01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:25.160
As mass increases,
the force required

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:30.930
to accelerate or decelerate
that mass increases as well.

01:14:30.930 --> 01:14:33.070
Now don't you feel
massively smarter?

01:14:33.070 --> 01:14:35.000
-Mm-hmm.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:35.500
Whoa!

01:14:38.037 --> 01:14:38.620
[END PLAYBACK]

01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:41.870
JOSH: All right, so that's
what we ended up doing.

01:14:41.870 --> 01:14:45.280
So you can see how
the timing allowed

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:48.340
us to sort of cheat a few
lines, like the density line.

01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:51.570
We just sort of let
it play through.

01:14:51.570 --> 01:14:53.380
So there's some
moments here where

01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:56.570
you're allowing the viewer
to take in what's going on.

01:14:56.570 --> 01:15:00.100
There's not constant action
going on, you'll notice.

01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:03.890
But the action is
at key moments where

01:15:03.890 --> 01:15:09.900
we need to keep things--
This is so abstract.

01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:13.060
But again, there are
no right answers.

01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:16.140
But there some-- if
you do it long enough,

01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:18.440
you'll sort of start to get
a sense of what decisions

01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:19.900
to make.

01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:20.660
Yeah, question.

01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:22.970
AUDIENCE: How long did that
video take start to finish?

01:15:22.970 --> 01:15:25.750
Like, from storyboarding.

01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:28.460
JOSH: I would say, John, you
can help me remember all this.

01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:32.630
But you know, the script was
maybe a couple days, revisions

01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:33.420
and so forth.

01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:38.650
And then we probably sat
down for at least four

01:15:38.650 --> 01:15:42.720
to six hours-- almost a
whole day-- storyboarding it,

01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:43.310
every scene.

01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:46.846
It was a complex thing.

01:15:46.846 --> 01:15:48.350
We're not physicists.

01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:50.750
So we had to
understand this stuff.

01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:53.610
We had to do some
background research.

01:15:53.610 --> 01:15:56.930
About a day
storyboarding, and then

01:15:56.930 --> 01:16:00.840
about a total of
three people doing

01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:02.925
the animation and illustration.

01:16:05.710 --> 01:16:07.490
And that took maybe three weeks.

01:16:07.490 --> 01:16:12.163
So I'd say about a month
to do the whole thing.

01:16:12.163 --> 01:16:14.204
ELIZABETH: Real quick,
because you guys are going

01:16:14.204 --> 01:16:16.120
to stay on for another class?

01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:17.340
JOSH: Sure, I can do that.

01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:18.290
ELIZABETH: I mean, if you
need to go, that's fine.

01:16:18.290 --> 01:16:18.956
JOSH: That's OK.

01:16:18.956 --> 01:16:19.990
We can hang out.

01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:25.986
JOSH: So thanks guys,
thanks for listening.

01:16:25.986 --> 01:16:26.819
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:16:26.819 --> 01:16:30.596
[APPLAUSE]

01:16:30.596 --> 01:16:33.130
JOSH: Josh gave you
guys all his info.

01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:35.104
JOSH: Yeah, feel
free to get in touch.

01:16:35.104 --> 01:16:36.520
ELIZABETH: For
today's assignment,

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:38.540
you guys will be
storyboarding one scene

01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:42.490
from your script,
which is why it'll

01:16:42.490 --> 01:16:45.070
be a good idea to have some
semblance of a script together.

01:16:45.070 --> 01:16:47.319
I know that you're still
revising all that stuff, too,

01:16:47.319 --> 01:16:51.110
which is why we're only having
you storyboard one scene.

01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:56.372
And then tomorrow, Chris will
help you shoot that scene.

01:16:56.372 --> 01:16:58.830
So as far as the storyboard
goes, you can use these sheets,

01:16:58.830 --> 01:17:01.740
you can use PowerPoint,
you can use note cards.

01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:05.520
But just upload them
as images onto Tumblr.

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:08.220
And then all the assignment
details are on the syllabus.

01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:10.880
I wanted to mention--
this was something

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:14.200
that I was going to show
you guys during the editing

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:15.246
portion.

01:17:15.246 --> 01:17:22.610
But you can actually
storyboard in post-production

01:17:22.610 --> 01:17:24.270
after you've shot things.

01:17:24.270 --> 01:17:30.000
So this was an episode on snot
that I'd filmed with George.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.270
And basically, after we
got all of the raw footage

01:17:33.270 --> 01:17:35.420
from the first
takes, these are sort

01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:39.540
of like stills from each
major scene of the video.

01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:46.910
There was a portion where I did
a demo of this, like, fake snot

01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:47.780
that I made.

01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:50.540
But I had filmed it in
Katharina Ribbeck's lab

01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:52.497
and the sun had set.

01:17:52.497 --> 01:17:53.705
And my delivery was terrible.

01:17:53.705 --> 01:17:56.570
I was super tired that night.

01:17:56.570 --> 01:17:59.160
So there were a couple
things that jumped out to us

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:01.090
after we watched everything.

01:18:01.090 --> 01:18:03.620
One being that I am
lit very dramatically.

01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:07.650
And I wanted to have more of
a casual feel to my parts.

01:18:07.650 --> 01:18:10.070
And I felt like we
should only dramatically

01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:13.040
light Katharina Ribbeck.

01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:15.710
The other was that--
I thought, well, how

01:18:15.710 --> 01:18:17.710
bad was that decision really?

01:18:17.710 --> 01:18:19.660
Like, is it really
worth shooting again?

01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:22.210
So we shot it again
because we had the time.

01:18:22.210 --> 01:18:23.720
And then it was a
matter of deciding

01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:26.020
which set of footage to use.

01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:29.220
So what we're doing
right now is we just

01:18:29.220 --> 01:18:31.955
put together a cut of the
video using both clips.

01:18:31.955 --> 01:18:33.330
But another thing
that you can do

01:18:33.330 --> 01:18:35.450
is storyboard the
stills from the footage

01:18:35.450 --> 01:18:36.870
that you take day of.

01:18:36.870 --> 01:18:39.980
So here I can see
how that scene looks

01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:41.990
in the context of
everything else we shot.

01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:45.710
So I see that, like, I'm
wearing a lot of blue.

01:18:45.710 --> 01:18:48.040
The whole video
looks fairly blue.

01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:55.120
I look a lot more like Katharina
Ribbeck in this set of footage

01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:56.997
than I do the rest of me, right?

01:18:56.997 --> 01:18:58.830
Like the way I'm lit
in all the other scenes

01:18:58.830 --> 01:19:02.630
is really different from this.

01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:05.210
So that's what the re-shot
footage looks like.

01:19:05.210 --> 01:19:07.110
One-- the snot demo
went a lot better

01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:08.540
the second time we did it.

01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:11.050
My delivery was
also a lot better.

01:19:11.050 --> 01:19:14.410
But I'm also lit
a lot more flat.

01:19:14.410 --> 01:19:17.400
I actually think
that the footage

01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:20.450
that we had before-- it looks
a lot better, like the lighting

01:19:20.450 --> 01:19:21.990
is a lot more flattering.

01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:24.700
But it's a lot more
formal and traditional.

01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:27.550
And it's hard to know
how much that jumps out

01:19:27.550 --> 01:19:29.400
in the context of the
rest of your video

01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:30.860
until you line up
all these stills

01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:33.039
and you sort of
storyboard this way.

01:19:33.039 --> 01:19:34.830
So we haven't actually
finished this video.

01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:36.540
I'm in the process right now.

01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:39.320
Like, this is exactly
where I am with this video.

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:41.060
I thought I would
show it to you today

01:19:41.060 --> 01:19:42.893
since we've been talking
about storyboarding

01:19:42.893 --> 01:19:44.570
to show how you
can do it not just

01:19:44.570 --> 01:19:47.580
in pre-production, but also
after you've shot material.

01:19:50.910 --> 01:19:54.419
So we have about 20
minutes left in class.

01:19:54.419 --> 01:19:56.210
I thought that it would
be good to give you

01:19:56.210 --> 01:19:59.350
guys a chance to get started
on storyboarding your scene

01:19:59.350 --> 01:20:01.770
while we're around.

01:20:01.770 --> 01:20:03.830
So if you guys have
questions, I'll

01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:07.121
be here until the end of
class and a little bit later.

01:20:07.121 --> 01:20:10.170
You can ask Josh as
long as he's around.

01:20:10.170 --> 01:20:14.380
But does anyone have
any questions right now

01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:19.250
about what they
need to do tonight,

01:20:19.250 --> 01:20:21.360
about storyboarding, writing?

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:26.298
JOSH: How are your scripts,
like, what shape are they in?

01:20:26.298 --> 01:20:27.741
Are you happy with them?

01:20:27.741 --> 01:20:29.190
Do they still need more work?

01:20:29.190 --> 01:20:31.148
ELIZABETH: Yeah, we can
also talk about scripts

01:20:31.148 --> 01:20:34.070
right now, too, because take
advantage of Josh's background

01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:35.929
in writing as well.

01:20:35.929 --> 01:20:37.220
JOSH: How long are the scripts?

01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:40.490
What are you shooting for,
three minutes, two minutes?

01:20:40.490 --> 01:20:42.360
ELIZABETH: Like three
to four minutes.

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:44.850
Five is the absolute max.

01:20:44.850 --> 01:20:48.798
JOSH: We do 150
words per minute.

01:20:48.798 --> 01:20:51.715
I don't know if that's
something you guys have already

01:20:51.715 --> 01:20:52.256
talked about.

01:20:57.196 --> 01:20:58.678
AUDIENCE: How much is one scene?

01:20:58.678 --> 01:21:00.160
So what does that entail?

01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:08.780
ELIZABETH: Well, I think of
scenes as sort of locations

01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:09.900
almost.

01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:28.600
And so let me go back to--
sorry, my lap-- bye, Jamie.

01:21:33.979 --> 01:21:39.950
A scene kind of encompasses
a general statement.

01:21:39.950 --> 01:21:44.120
So that the way I
broke up the storyboard

01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:47.810
is I basically just did
stills of each scene.

01:21:47.810 --> 01:21:50.270
You can kind of consider
the whole top row

01:21:50.270 --> 01:21:52.260
as, like, a general
scene, one which is

01:21:52.260 --> 01:21:53.610
how I originally scripted it.

01:21:53.610 --> 01:21:56.090
It was just sort of like
the visual introduction

01:21:56.090 --> 01:22:00.430
to the video.

01:22:00.430 --> 01:22:02.380
But breaking it up
into scenes is nice,

01:22:02.380 --> 01:22:05.930
because then you'll notice if
one scene has a lot of text.

01:22:05.930 --> 01:22:08.980
And then you have a scene right
afterwards that's very short.

01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:11.550
And you just have a series
of really quick scenes.

01:22:11.550 --> 01:22:14.540
Maybe you can think about
restructuring or spreading

01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:17.280
out the material
a little bit more.

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:19.120
Because, like I said,
what you don't want

01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:23.970
is either really long
shots or really long scenes

01:22:23.970 --> 01:22:25.770
where you're not really
changing that much,

01:22:25.770 --> 01:22:30.090
or if you're doing too
many, really quick changes.

01:22:30.090 --> 01:22:31.040
But I don't know.

01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:34.401
I don't have a good definition
for what a scene technically

01:22:34.401 --> 01:22:34.900
is.

01:22:36.985 --> 01:22:38.693
JOSH: It's kind of a
unit of information.

01:22:41.328 --> 01:22:44.316
When I think about writing,
I think about paragraphs.

01:22:44.316 --> 01:22:47.802
This is kind of a
discrete unit that's

01:22:47.802 --> 01:22:50.590
imparting a certain
part of the narrative.

01:22:50.590 --> 01:22:53.540
And that's-- for
me, that's a scene.

01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:55.920
ELIZABETH: Yeah.

01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:59.440
I think the way I'd scripted
it, those four shots

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:00.660
are all different locations.

01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:03.870
But I listed it as scene one.

01:23:03.870 --> 01:23:06.460
Like, where you see
Professor Ribbeck

01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:08.940
and then I'm right
there in front of her,

01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:11.000
I also chunk that
together as one scene.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.880
But then, when we
were editing and sort

01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:16.010
of taking note of
all the clips, we

01:23:16.010 --> 01:23:19.080
denoted one as like scene
five and then the one

01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:22.410
after as scene five
A. But, in general,

01:23:22.410 --> 01:23:23.760
like it's the same sort of idea.

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:25.834
We're in her lab
in that portion.

01:23:28.696 --> 01:23:30.510
Does anyone have
any other questions?

01:23:30.510 --> 01:23:33.498
AUDIENCE: What was, like, the
motivation in using professor

01:23:33.498 --> 01:23:35.220
to--

01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:36.880
ELIZABETH: So, in
this particular one,

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:39.210
I wanted to highlight
the research that

01:23:39.210 --> 01:23:40.930
was going on here.

01:23:40.930 --> 01:23:44.890
And I also wanted to get her
involved because I knew her.

01:23:44.890 --> 01:23:47.880
And I really like her.

01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:50.560
And it was sort of
like a quirky breaking

01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:51.780
down the fourth wall moment.

01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:54.690
So what happens
in this scene is--

01:23:54.690 --> 01:23:57.390
I set it up in the previous
scene as saying snot

01:23:57.390 --> 01:23:58.930
is more than just this.

01:23:58.930 --> 01:24:00.090
And then it jumps to her.

01:24:00.090 --> 01:24:01.380
And she finishes my sentence.

01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:04.160
And she goes, it's actually xyz.

01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:05.670
And then it cuts
to a wider shot,

01:24:05.670 --> 01:24:08.450
revealing that I'm in
front of her, interviewing.

01:24:08.450 --> 01:24:10.420
And you see the camera
interviewing her.

01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:10.740
And I'm, like--

01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:11.160
[GESTURING TOWARDS PROFESSOR]

01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:12.409
And then I go, she would know.

01:24:12.409 --> 01:24:14.600
And then her name
sort of pops up.

01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:17.420
Partially because we wanted
to have her in the video,

01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:20.410
but we didn't want it
to be really formal.

01:24:20.410 --> 01:24:23.449
Because that shot is a very
traditional formal interview.

01:24:23.449 --> 01:24:24.740
So we wanted to make it quirky.

01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:27.610
And we also wanted to sort
of like informalize it.

01:24:27.610 --> 01:24:30.500
So that's why we
broke out of that.

01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:32.630
And I did the whole
like, she would now.

01:24:32.630 --> 01:24:36.234
And then we could make that
setup a little more fun.

01:24:36.234 --> 01:24:41.211
AUDIENCE: How do you think
about the authority of the host,

01:24:41.211 --> 01:24:41.710
right?

01:24:41.710 --> 01:24:45.162
Because you can say things
that are easily verifiable.

01:24:45.162 --> 01:24:46.870
But then if you're
going to say something

01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:50.310
about snot that, like, most
people don't know, then

01:24:50.310 --> 01:24:52.820
on whose authority
do you say this?

01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:54.780
I've watched like an
Alton Brown thing.

01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:57.720
And I was like, all
right, that's wrong.

01:24:57.720 --> 01:24:59.840
And like, but you are
talking about all the things

01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:00.860
I want to know.

01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:02.880
And now I don't know
when you're lying to me.

01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:05.175
ELIZABETH: Yeah, well,
I mean, part of it is,

01:25:05.175 --> 01:25:08.130
that's the responsibility
that you have as the host,

01:25:08.130 --> 01:25:10.150
is that the viewer
has, by default,

01:25:10.150 --> 01:25:11.760
placed their trust in you.

01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:14.610
I think with us, we're
not going to have as much

01:25:14.610 --> 01:25:17.100
of a problem to prove because
everyone knows that all

01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:19.090
the hosts are students at MIT.

01:25:19.090 --> 01:25:20.820
And in our YouTube
descriptions, we

01:25:20.820 --> 01:25:22.960
say that all the scripts
were fact-checked

01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:25.930
by postdoc researchers.

01:25:25.930 --> 01:25:28.160
For this, I mean, that
was one of the reasons

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:31.250
why we used her is because I
could explain her research.

01:25:31.250 --> 01:25:34.100
Or I could just have
her say it, which

01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:36.760
I thought was like a cooler
window into the world

01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:39.120
here, which is what I was
talking on the first day.

01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:40.911
How do you create the
window into the world

01:25:40.911 --> 01:25:43.830
that people don't
have access to?

01:25:43.830 --> 01:25:46.570
I also studied bioengineering
for my undergrad.

01:25:46.570 --> 01:25:48.700
So all the material
for the script

01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:52.860
came from the class I took
from Professor Ribbeck.

01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:58.480
But I think you don't take the
time in your video to introduce

01:25:58.480 --> 01:25:59.820
yourself necessarily.

01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:01.180
And maybe you should.

01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:03.217
That's always something
we've considered,

01:26:03.217 --> 01:26:05.550
is that something that we
need to introduce into Science

01:26:05.550 --> 01:26:06.500
Out Loud.

01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:08.990
The host saying at the
beginning, like, I'm Jack

01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:14.642
and I work at MIT's D-lab.

01:26:14.642 --> 01:26:16.850
And that's sort of what we
did with Lindsey's episode

01:26:16.850 --> 01:26:19.240
just a tiny bit.

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:22.820
But there are ways of
establishing authority

01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:24.580
where you don't have
to vocally do it.

01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:28.290
So in Lindsey's episode,
we filmed at MIT is D-lab.

01:26:28.290 --> 01:26:31.510
And instead of saying,
like, we're at MIT's D-lab,

01:26:31.510 --> 01:26:35.600
we just spent a few seconds
doing shots of the sign that

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:37.650
said D-lab, basically.

01:26:37.650 --> 01:26:42.084
If you guys want to see
it, I can show you later.

01:26:42.084 --> 01:26:43.750
But I don't have a
good answer for that,

01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:46.640
because I think that, even
if you're Stephen Hawking,

01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:49.560
people can question
your authority to say

01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:50.610
the things you're saying.

01:26:50.610 --> 01:26:53.210
And the point of the
video isn't necessarily

01:26:53.210 --> 01:26:57.060
to establish that-- or at least
the point of these videos.

01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:02.484
Your material should
be accurate, though.

01:27:02.484 --> 01:27:04.974
AUDIENCE: You showed us
the next slide, right?

01:27:04.974 --> 01:27:07.464
And you have this [INAUDIBLE]?

01:27:07.464 --> 01:27:09.810
ELIZABETH: Oh, yeah.

01:27:09.810 --> 01:27:13.230
So George made me
wear the goggles,

01:27:13.230 --> 01:27:15.770
partially because I think
he was trying to torture me.

01:27:15.770 --> 01:27:21.990
But there are some environmental
health safety standards.

01:27:21.990 --> 01:27:23.630
And since we were
technically in a lab,

01:27:23.630 --> 01:27:25.850
even though I wasn't
working with anything

01:27:25.850 --> 01:27:30.520
biohazard related, the lab
itself required goggles.

01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:33.440
So that's why I wore gloves
and a lab coat and goggles.

01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:37.060
If you guys plan on filming
in any sort of environment

01:27:37.060 --> 01:27:39.480
where that might be an
issue, we'll talk about it

01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:40.480
more during producing.

01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:43.640
But just keep that in mind, too.

01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:47.540
We took shots of me with
and without the goggles,

01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:48.520
just in case.

01:27:52.930 --> 01:27:53.910
Any other questions?

01:27:58.330 --> 01:28:02.900
OK, so I'll let you guys work.

01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:05.220
And we'll just sort
of circulate through

01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:07.840
and see if you need any help.

01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:10.140
But again, I just
wanted to give you

01:28:10.140 --> 01:28:15.660
some time to make the most
of the resources here.
