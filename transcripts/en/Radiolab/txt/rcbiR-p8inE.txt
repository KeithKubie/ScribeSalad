Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radiolab radio from W N y. S. C. E. Yup. Hey, this is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. Our topic today is goodness, goodness, selflessness. So we've done the math I as the map. Okay. So you ready for this? All right, I'm ready. Alright, so a while back we, we did this story that for us at least really stuck in our heads. It was a story that was, uh, asking this really deep question and the answer that we got to you answer didn't quite click right. I remembered that one. Yeah. Just to sort of, uh, set the table. The question was, why do people do good in the world? So we asked that question, looked at it from the perspective of genetics, computer science, all kinds of things. We ended up profiling these three extraordinarily heroically good people. Yes, they were heroes. They did remarkable things, each one. And we told their stories with that question in mind. Why do certain people do good in the world and others don't? Yeah. And so we're going to revisit that question today and the story that we told because I think we have something better and smarter to say about it. Final, something very peculiar to say about it as it turns out. Yeah. So we're gonna play you the original first and then we're going to come back and hopefully shed some new light on it. Yup. So here we go

Speaker 1:          01:19          again. This story just began with a simple question, that question. Let us,

Speaker 2:          01:24          well, for Koski two, a guy named Walter with cal scoop and I'm the executive director and the secretary of the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission. Cool. Well thanks for doing this. Can you just give us, uh, a little background on the hero fund? What is the Carnegie Hero Fund? Carnegie Hero Fund is a private operating foundation that was established by Andrew Carnegie in 1904. And what we do is recognize civilian heroism throughout the United States and Canada by giving an award called the Carnegie Medal. And accompanying the Carnegie metal is a financial grant. How much? Uh, well, currently the amount is $5,000. Wow. And how do you guys choose your heroes? We judged the heroic acts against a list of requirements. So then you have to have some kind of definition of hero, which includes some and excludes others. Yes, perfect. Basic definition, which is a civilian one meaning no military who voluntarily to leaves a point of safety.

Speaker 2:          02:21          Three to risk his own life or her own life, or to an extraordinary degree. Five. To save or to attempt to save the life of another human. Six. How about seven y, can you hear? Can you read that one more time? Okay. I wasn't reading that just came from memory. So what is it that happens in a person's mind at that pivotal moment when they decided to voluntarily, voluntarily leave a point of safety line of sight and your risk, their life to an extraordinary degree to save the life of another human? That's what we wanted to know. Should we just jump in? Okay. So the first one we have on our list is a Laura Shrek. Okay. That's file number seven three five four six and the award number is 8,005

Speaker 3:          03:01          I am Laura shrike. I'm from Matt Toon, Illinois, and I currently live in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

Speaker 2:          03:08          Oh Wow. Laura spoke with our producer, Tim Howard. Okay, so we're going back a little bit here. Yeah. 15 years back in the mid Nineties 1995 to 21 year old college students,

Speaker 3:          03:17          and I was driving through the country and I saw a woman getting mauled by a bull and a pasture. So she stomped to see what was going on, jumped out and started yelling at her to see what I could do. The woman was on the ground and the bull was 150 pound Jersey Ball, tossing her in the air and back on the ground. Wow. She was clearly struggling. And where were you? I was right on the other side of the fence, but the fence was electric.

Speaker 4:          03:50          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:51          so here's the moment that we find fascinating. At this point, Laura can either go forward through thousands of volts of electricity toward an angry bull that will likely mall her to, or she can stay safe.

Speaker 4:          04:08          No,

Speaker 3:          04:11          I want it. Hadn't just climbed through the fence and I don't remember ever feeling fi electricity. She says by the time she got through crazily enough and Labor had shown up and threw her a piece of pipe maybe about two feet long or she approached the woman who was still conscious the whole time she's yelling at me, hit the ball on the face as hard as you can and don't stop.

Speaker 2:          04:32          So Miss Shriek went up to the ball and uh,

Speaker 3:          04:37          it repeatedly diffuse two foot length of tubing. I think it distracted the bull enough where she was able to get out from under him. And as soon as we were outside the fence looking back into the pastor and the bull was literally right there at the fence, correct the ground a few times and snorted. He was not, he was not happy

Speaker 2:          05:02          to our question. When you were there at that fence and you had the choice to either stay put or to go through it, what was going through your mind? Was there a calculation?

Speaker 3:          05:13          No, I can't really say that. I mean you don't weigh your options or anything like that? I did not know. It was just, here's the problem, here's what I need to do. And something needed to happen.

Speaker 5:          05:26          Huh?

Speaker 2:          05:28          So there was no choice moment?

Speaker 5:          05:30          Not that I recall. No.

Speaker 3:          05:33          If nobody came to this woman's rescue, she would die. Unfortunately.

Speaker 2:          05:38          This is the usual explanation. Says Walter lobular no explanation. I couldn't stand there and not do anything. I would, I was compelled to act.

Speaker 3:          05:47          I didn't really take the time to think about what else could happen.

Speaker 2:          05:51          No, I can't say I ever really thought about my own life at that time. I mean, I think we just jumped ahead because we thought we'd try again. That's the voice. The next Carnegie Hero that, uh, Walter told us about William David Pennell, William Panel, who is the 8362nd person to receive the Carnegie metal. I produced your Lynne Levy tracked him down. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear. Oh, William David Pennell was 37 years old at the time of his heroic act. Was It 1999? Yes. I was, uh, early in the morning. It was like 3:19 AM in a small town near Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Monongahela, Pennsylvania. We was in bed sleeping and my wife heard a lot of crash. I actually didn't hear it from an adult. My one dog was carrying on. So right away I run down there. Mr Pennell went outside his house. There was a a very bad automobile accident.

Speaker 2:          06:41          A car crashed head on until utility pole was like whiplash up the windshield out from under the hood from the responded to the scene wearing only sweat pants or shoes or shirt or nothing on their chest in air foot. So here we are, bill standing in front of this ball of fire. There are three teenagers inside that car though he doesn't know it can either a do nothing or B go in through the driver's door and his big fellow slumped out the door. So I reached in and grabbed a hold of them around the chest, pull them from the driver's seat out to the ground. The meantime, the car was just like blazer and my neighbor was there. She was hollering. There's more of them in there. So I run back to the vehicle. We found that the front seat passenger was trapped in the wreckage. I finally got him loose and pulled him out. And currently Mr Pennell was aware that a third person was in the car. Third Young Man, Mr Pennell entered the car a third time. By then there was tires blown flames had grown to about three feet above the car's roof. The interior there, like the headline or at the car, the stuff was stripping like plastic Donald, my back. I mean I'm in there screaming, you know, somebody give me a hand in here,

Speaker 6:          08:01          but nobody, nobody would help. And uh, I reached in and grabbed a hold of the kid who was in the back by the scruff of the neck and pulled him out.

Speaker 2:          08:09          All right, so when you were coming out of your house and you're looking at that car, what was going through your head?

Speaker 6:          08:16          I'll just this to try to help. I mean, I, I did what any normal person would do. I mean, you know, I just kept saying this to somebody whose kid, you know what I mean? It's a time my daughter was like 16. And I'm saying to myself, you know, if something, God forbid, whatever happened to her, that I would hope someone would be there to help. Do you ever talk to your neighbors and ask them why they didn't come in there? Uh, you know what, that's funny you brought that up because no, I've never, never brought it up. Never brought it up. I don't know. I guess, uh, maybe I probably wouldn't like their answer. I don't know. Uh, I don't

Speaker 1:          08:55          know why. I've never asked him about what do you think is the difference between you and those other people who just sort of stood by? Uh, I, I couldn't answer that [inaudible] answer that. So our bull girl, she didn't know. This guy didn't really know either. Somebody must be able to tell us something about what they were thinking at that moment that allowed them, that gave them the courage to do what they did.

Speaker 2:          09:19          I can't give you a definite answer as to what propels people to do this. No,

Speaker 1:          09:23          we took one more shot with Walter and uh, after we take a quick break, we're going to hear one more hero story from him. That's when we come back. This is Sam.

Speaker 7:          09:32          You're calling from Denver, Colorado. Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world war information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

Speaker 1:          09:46          hi, I'm forming u s attorney. Prepare Rara. I have a show called, stay tuned. We talk to the best minds in politics, law and culture. Like our recent guest, Maggie Haberman, a couple of Trump advisors over the years have said to me that people close to him in variably begin to act like him. And that is true. I have observed that personally. You can hear, stay tuned on apple podcasts or anywhere you get your favorite shows. Jan, Robert Radiolab. We're back now with Walter Rakowski, who's going to tell us the third and final of his hero stories. He told us, well that of all the cases he's heard, this is the one that puzzles him the most.

Speaker 2:          10:28          The case of Wesley James Autry, a construction worker from a New York 50 year old man who did jump into the track that in a subway station to remove a fellow, a young man who had fallen onto the track. The gentleman was a six foot 280 pounds. He was, he was in earth and yet Mr Autry persisted despite the fact that a train was coming. There would come a point and let's, at least in my estimation, where you would have to say, I have to get out of here because I'm going to be killed on, I'm not suicidal, but Mr Autry didn't think that way. He and I parked in this in this manner. What he did was he lay a top the victim between the rails while the train passed over them in the farthest reaches of my imagination, I can see myself jumping onto a subway track to attempt the rescue. What I can't see myself doing is lying at top, the victim while the train passes over me.

Speaker 8:          11:31          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          11:32          making this story even more nuts. When we finally met up with Wesley Autrey on the platform where this incident happened under 35th and Broadway. He explained to us that his daughters had been with them.

Speaker 9:          11:44          Okay. And uh, how old are your daughters at that time? My daughter was four and six. And this, this them there should this picture. Oh my God, super cute. The one behind me is Shuki and this the baby Sashi.

Speaker 1:          12:01          So when they're standing there and this guy starts convulsing and then eventually falls off the platform onto the tracks, right as a train is coming, his choice is pretty stark. In order to save this complete stranger, he's got to leave his daughters behind potentially without a dad.

Speaker 4:          12:17          Yeah. I'm shaking and going into another seizure for some strange reason. A boys, I don't know, said that, don't worry about your own, to worry about your daughters. You can do this. So he jumps, runs to the guy. Is he conscious? No, no. Tries to grab the guy's hand and he's on my, grabbed his hand. We'll slip a pride in a way he slipped. I look up, the train is getting close. I grabbed his hand again, we'll slip apart just this goes up 50 feet, 20 feet, 10 feet, and then it's right there and all you can do is grab the guy, get them in a bear hug and flatten his body again against the guy as much as he can.

Speaker 4:          12:59          The first train car just grazed my cats train car went right over it. Train came to a stop over the five cars passed over us. I looked him in the eyes. Excuse me, you seem to have a seizure or something. I don't know you. You don't know me. So I just kept talking to him until he came through and he was like, well, where are we? I'm like willingly portrayed. He said, well, who are you? I said, I came down to save your life. So he kept asking me, are we dead or when heaven, I gave him a slight pinch on his arm. He's that hall. Just I see you. You are very much alive.

Speaker 4:          13:32          Have you, did you ever ask yourself at this point like what am I doing here when he asked it, what am I doing here? What about you ma? I can hear the two ladies. We had my daughter standing the man between their legs. I can hear that daughter screaming. So when that train come to a stop, I yelled up from underneath the train. Excuse me. I'm the father. We are okay. I just want to let my daughters know that, that I'm okay because I know that they are worried about me. Everybody started clapping. Can I ask you a question? So it's the point at which you said you heard a voice. Yes. That said, I can do this. I can do this. What's, what's what is amazing to me? Is it you left your daughter's right here and die after a guy. You don't know if he was a stranger. Total stranger. But you know what? The mission wasn't con completed. I was chose for that. You felt shows like you were cheating. I felt like I was a chosen lift for a religious person though. I would wonder why me? Well, you know what, uh, maybe 20 years ago I was supposed to be at a certain point

Speaker 1:          14:39          and then he explained to us exactly why he had jumped. He was the one guy who could, he said right before his feet left the platform, this one specific moment from his life flashed to mind

Speaker 4:          14:49          this thing that happened. You know, I had a gun pulled to my temple, but you know, it was a misfire. So you know a gun was put to your head and miss them. So you are almost dead for a second as the most dead, you know, so you think you might might've been spared for a spare for reason after that? Right.

Speaker 10:         15:07          A moment. He says when the gun went click and he didn't die, he always wondered why had God spared him that moment until he was on the platform and he saw the guy fall off. He says, then he knew,

Speaker 4:          15:19          this is why I can do this. I can do this. I can do this. That voice, when that boy said that you going to be okay, I knew everything was going to work out.

Speaker 10:         15:37          You know what I think at the end of the day. What's that? I don't think that there's an answer to the question we asked. I don't really hear real question. Why were you a hero? I don't think that any three of these here. I mean the last one had the longest explanation. He had been selected for some purpose, but does he know why he was calling? Not a clue. A CIA guy number three gives me something. What does he give you? Okay, so the first two, right? They have no idea. None. So there's just something in them that made them act. The guy number three is talking about circumstances like the world prepared him for that moment. Serendipity. So it makes me think, well, what if uh, circumstances are just right? Maybe any of us could do that. I'll get, I'll get a mailman. He, he used to say to me all the time, he says, how did you manage to do that up? Or how did you manage her pulling kids out? I don't know if I could've done that. I said, well, you know what? I'll say, you wouldn't do this or you wouldn't do that to you're put in that situation. In fact, when we asked Walter, how many nominations do you get a year, are they hard to find?

Speaker 2:          16:36          No, they are not hard at all to find a, we are fortunate to be living in a society regardless of what you hear elsewhere. We are fortunate to be living in a society where people do look out for others, even strangers.

Speaker 10:         16:48          He told us they've even had to up their guidelines to make it harder to win

Speaker 2:          16:52          simply because of the vast number for road deeds that, uh, happen in day to day life. Okay. Okay.

Speaker 1:          17:02          Um, I guess I gotta say that, um, we went with is feel good thought about about all the people who are doing good views. I honestly don't think we knew what to say to end that story. Well, it's nice to know that there'd be lot more good people than we thought, but we went and we, we were trying to figure out why people, why people who do that do that and why we're different or they're different than us. And at the end we didn't really get there. Ah, but then yeah, this guy walks in, you should say, just for our purposes who you are. Once again, I'm Robert Sapolsky, I'm a professor of neuroscience at Stanford and university. Robert has been on our program many, many times talking about any number of things and he had just come out with a book called Behav trying to explain why we do everything we do. It goes into the brain and the history, the culture, everything.

Speaker 11:         17:49          And we figured well maybe he would have something to say about our, our little puzzle. Yep. Probably. Well let me just let, just ask you, you've heard all three of these things. What does this, what do these three tails make you think? I think what we see with all three is how highfalutin moral reasoning plays like zero role in what went on there. More reasoning doesn't do anything. Right.

Speaker 1:          18:14          And you know, the first thing that Robert Spolsky told us, which maybe wasn't that surprising, is that when we were asking people what were they thinking, that was sort of the wrong question.

Speaker 11:         18:22          And everybody as you saw, we just gives the same answer, which is I wasn't thinking, I was feeling about what if this were my 16 year old daughter I hearing a voice or with the bull woman saying, I wasn't thinking like before I knew it, I had jumped in.

Speaker 1:          18:38          The evidence suggests Soboleski says that in situations like this, people just don't reason their way to a decision. That's not how it works.

Speaker 11:         18:45          Correct. People don't think their way to or moral decision, and in fact you give people enough time to really think their way in a circumstance like that. Most people think their way to concluding this isn't my problem or somebody else will take care of it or here's why it's their fault. So then we ask them, okay, if it's not thinking or moral reasoning, then maybe what these heroes are doing is there. They're feeling they're there, they're empathizing more than the rest of us, and that's why they do what they do. Ironically, probably not. I'm probably not. Yeah. Okay. So empathy, you're, you're feeling somebody else's pain, pain, whether it's pain, your toes on fire or pain, you're feeling the pain of somebody else. Pain is painful and if it's painful enough and acute and burning enough, what that translates into is I can't take it. This is too upsetting and you need to run away at some point. If you're mostly focused on my God, what were this to be? What would this feel like if this were happening to me? That's the predictor of people who don't necessarily don't very readily make that leap from feeling empathy to actually acting compassionately.

Speaker 1:          20:00          Oh, that's not what I expected you to say. I thought you were going to take it the other way. So you're saying, okay, when it's hot, when it's me, me, me, me, me, might, your pain is my pain. Those people are less likely to step forward. Yeah, well, they're less likely to actually go and do the compassionate thing. Spolsky told us that there have actually been studies that have found this, that when someone actually empathizes physically feels in other person's pain, they're more likely to turn away from it rather than step forward and try and alleviate that person's suffering.

Speaker 11:         20:31          You put somebody in a circumstance and for example, how many shocks are they willing to get to intervene to help somebody in some simulation game for example, and you look at is this the person whose heart rates sores when they see somebody else in this tough situation or is this the kind where it remains fairly steady, the ladder is more likely to act compassionately. So interesting. Okay, so what we're barreling towards here is it's not so much about moral reasoning, it's not so much about vast empathy, but it's about a type of empathy that allows you to remain detached enough to actually act. So emotional distance will create the humane or charitable act. Exactly. You need a certain amount of detachment. That's surprisingly where it comes in and that runs counter to so many of our instincts about what empathy should be about. And what I think we see here is probably the most reliable realm of people going in doing the heroic thing, which is when it's implicit, when it's automatic, when it's not, you sitting there reasoning through, well how many copies of my genes am I going to pass on if I do this or among my close relatives and where it's not empathy, oh am I feeling for this person or as this person or with this person or above this.

Speaker 11:         21:56          And instead, before I knew it, I had jumped in the river to save this child. And I think that's where you see some of the most interesting, reliably sort of heroic stuff when it's implicit, when it's automatic and know how a person can get that kind of compassion made implicit. Is it a, is it something you're born with or something cultural at your parents? Uh, or do you have any idea? The thing is we don't know a ton about the neurobiology of how a moral good goes from being a frontal task to an implicit task. But we know a ton about how that works in a much more mundane area, which is like you'll learn how to do something like you're a pianist and you're learning some new tough piece of music and there's this really tough trill and every time you're playing it, as you approach the trail, you're thinking, here at comes, remember, Tuck your elbow in and lead with your thumb and do this.

Speaker 11:         23:01          It is what would be called a declarative task, declarative, explicit knowledge. And that's completely about this part of the brain, the hippocampus talking to the frontal Cortex, and it's sitting there saying, here it comes, and remember how you do it and remember how you do it wrong, what happened last time and how great it felt when you talk to your elbow in. So remember to that. And then suddenly there's the day where you're playing the piece and you realize your four measures past the trill and you played it just fine. That's the first day you played it without having to think about it and jargon in the learning field is it has stopped being an explicit declarative task and it's become an implicit procedural task. That's the first time your hands, no would better than your head. Does me take somebody who's like beating the pants off of you a tennis and they've just done like some amazing backhand and crushed you and what you need to do strategically now is forced them to take that procedural knowledge and make it declarative again, stop at that point and give him this like obsequious smile.

Speaker 11:         24:06          I said, oh my God, you're an amazing tennis player. That was an amazing shot. How did you do that? Do you put your hand over on this side or that side and what about your butt? Are you scrunching your button on the left side or the right and you force him? It's like you make somebody like think very explicitly and procedurally how you go down flights of stairs and you're going to fall down the stairs because none of us have done stairs. Proceduralise since we were about two and a half years old, a bunch of professors had swarmed over our threes and released their first two of our three sims. They might've been ruined for the next experience, but if you let them do their natural thing, then they would rescue again. Maybe if they could just keep it implicit. Do you think that if it's implicit, do you think that, uh, that there's, it's a clean, it's a clean analogy.

Speaker 11:         24:51          I mean, do you think that that is the people for whom it is automatic? It's automatic because they've practiced it in some way in the way that like they probably in some way, yeah. For example, lots of studies were done as to which people in either Germany or Nazi occupied, uh, Europe, older Jews gave them shelter, put their own laws at risk and it wasn't predicted by level of education. There goes all that moral reasoning stuff and it wasn't even particularly predicted by things like religiosity was people who had simply been raised, you do the right thing. It was automatic. It was implicit for them. They didn't have to sit there and think about or feel about it was automatic because that, thank you mommy and Daddy. Is that what that is? Thank you mommy. Daddy, rabbi priest. What is that? I think it's mostly that, but of course it's messier than playing a trail on a piano or doing a tennis backhand.

Speaker 11:         25:52          I mean people first learned about it and you literally can see the transition from which part of the brain's handling the task. So the initial view was, okay, that's how you do trills on the piano. But then you see something even more amazing, which is more complex stuff happens. My, my father in his last years had a pretty severe dementia. Um, he was a professor, he was an architectural historian and he reached a point where he could not identify the names of all of this kids consistently, didn't know where he was, what decade, etc. But prompt him and he could give you this totally lucid, opinionated, cranky, entertaining, 10 minute lecture on the history of flying buttresses and then come back two minutes later and prompt him again and he'd give you the exact same one again. For him, that was as implicit as, you know, the tennis player doing the backhand or playing the trolls on the piano.

Speaker 11:         26:50          When I fully expect when I'm demented, someday I'll give this exact lecture that I just gave in. I can do it over and over and over until the student's complaint. So all sorts of stuff. More complex than a tennis backhand becomes implicit. I think what we're seeing with the woman with the bowl there in the electric fence is some incredibly high level abstract stuff becomes implicit as well. You don't like fling your elbow way out to the right when you do the trill and you don't stand by and watch somebody being like done in you just before you know it, you don't reason. You don't feel you just do it. Before I knew it, I had run in there. No. Is this one of your lectures? Do you talk about this very thing? Um, in other words, when we come and visit you in 13 years, will you be treating us with this very elect? Precisely. Empathy. Empathy is an interesting topic. Sit down. This will be on the final.

Speaker 12:         27:51          Okay, good.
