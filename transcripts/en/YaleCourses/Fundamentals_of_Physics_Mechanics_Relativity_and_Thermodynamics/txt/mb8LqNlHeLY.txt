Speaker 1:          00:00:00       All right, class. Welcome back. This is Howard. Uh, last two weeks we're going to have a slightly different schedule for the problem sets. I'm going to assign something today, which is due next Wednesday, giving you enough times so you can plan your moves. Then I will probably give you one last problem set with two or three problems on whatever I do near the end. We'll have to play it by year. Okay, so this is another new topic on thermodynamics, a fresh beginning for those who want a fresh beginning and her songs and stuff you probably have seen in high school, some of it at least. So the whole next four lectures are devoted to the study of heat temperature, the heat transfer, things like that. So we are going to start with the intuitive definition of temperature everybody has. So hang on to that. That's the right, the right intuition. But as physicists, of course we want to be more precise, more careful. So let's say you have the notion of hot and cold. Even that requires a little more, uh, precision that introduces the notion of what is called thermodynamic equilibrium. Just like mechanical equilibrium. This is a very important concept,

Speaker 1:          00:01:40       so I'll tell you what equilibrium is with a concrete example. If you take a cup of hot water, then you'd take another cup of cold water. Each cup, if you wait a sufficiently long, is set to be in a state of equilibrium. As long as the cups were isolated from the outside world and not allowed to cool down or heat up, we think they maintain a certain temperature. We say it's in a state of thermal equilibrium because this temperature does not seem to change. Now we have not defined what temperature is precisely, but we can talk about whether whatever it is has changed or not chains, so it will send me down to some temperature. It'll maintain the temperature. Be Very careful. If you'd leave a cup of coffee in this room, it will cool down because the room has got a different temperature. What I'm talking about, a cup of coffee that's been isolated from everything. It maintains the temperature. Here's another cup of cold drink with at what we feel is a lower temperature. You had both in a state of equilibrium. Equilibrium is when the macroscopic properties for the system, I've stopped changing.

Speaker 1:          00:02:57       If you don't pour one of cups into the other one, that's going to be a period when the system is not in equilibrium in the sense that it doesn't have a well defined temperature. For example, if you just bought it from the top, the hot stuff is at the top of cold stuff in the bottom. That's a period of transition when you really cannot even say what the temperature of the mixture is. Some parts of some parts are called that system doesn't have a temperature. What'd you wait long enough till the two parts of gotten to know each other? They will turn into some undrinkable mass, but nice thing is it'll have a well defined temperature. That's again a system in equilibrium, so you've got to understand that temperature and thermal equilibrium represent gross macroscopic properties and that aren't always defined at the microscopic level.

Speaker 1:          00:03:48       It's no secret. We all know that everything is made of atoms and molecules. The atoms and molecules that form the liquid or the gas always have well defined states. Each molecule has a certain location, certain velocity, but at a macroscopic level, when you don't look into the fine details, focus on a few things like temperature. They don't always have a well defined value. That's what you got to understand. Things have a well defined value when they have settled down, how long does it take to settle down? That's a matter of what system you're studying, but generally you can all tell when it has settled down. Here's another example. Suppose you take a gas and you'll put it inside this piston here with some gas inside you've put some weights and everything is in equilibrium. You say this in equilibrium because the macroscopic things things so you can see with your naked eye, nothing is changing.

Speaker 1:          00:04:42       It's going to just sit there, but if you suddenly now remove, say a third of the weights, the Piston is going to rise up, shake it on a little bit, maybe settled down in the new location. If you wait a few seconds, then the new location will act again, settled down and you won't see anything with the naked eye that looks like anything has happened in between UNC, the piston moving, the gas is turbulent, the pressure is high in some region, low in some regions than it's set in stone. This is the notion of systems are in equilibrium and in between the states of the system which are not in equilibrium. No benefits system is in equilibrium. We can assign to the temperature that we call t, right? No, we don't know anything about this temperatures, so we're going to build it up from scratch. Other than your instinctive feeling for what temperature is.

Speaker 2:          00:05:40       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:40       One of the laws of thermodynamics called the zero plot. Is it a club? Because they wrote down the first law. Then they went back and had an idea of what is even more profound and they said, we'll call it zero o'clock zero law says if a and B at the same temperature and B and c at the same temperature than Amc at at the same temperature. I see this belief in the audience thing. Why do you call this a lot? Look, I think that is the key to would being able to speak about temperature globally is the assumption that if I take a thermometer and measure something there, then they come back and the thermometer here and it reads the same number than I may conclude these two entities which never met each other directly but also at the same temperature. That's not, uh, that seems pretty obvious to you. But that is the whole notion of temperature is predicated on the fact that you can define an attribute called temperature that can be globally compare between two systems that never met directly but met a third system.

Speaker 3:          00:06:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:46       So once we hate, once we have some idea of hot and cold, let us decide now to be more quantitative. It's like saying, you know, somebody stall in shot is not enough. We go into how tall, how many feet, how many inches, how many millimeters. So we want to get quantitative. All we have right now is notion of hot and cold. So what we tried to do is to find some way to be more precise about how hard and how cold. So what people said is, uh, let's look at some things in the world that seemed to depend on temperature. One thing that seems to depend on temperature is the following. You take this meter stick in the National Bureau of standards, kept them some glass case at some temperature. You pull it out or make a duplicate of it. You pull it outside and leave it in the room. What you may find this, if the room was hotter than the glass case, this rod then expense to a new length. So one route is outside the case, one rod is inside the case. So the comparison is meaningful. Nothing has been done to this guy in the air condition glass case, but this one is expanding. So one way to define temperature is to simply ask how long is this rod? And somehow correlate the length of the rod with temperature by some fashion.

Speaker 1:          00:08:03       So you can do that. So what do you need to do that? What you need to do first is to define, put some markings on it so that for each extra, something that grows, we can say the temperature has gone up by some amount so that we need units for temperature. That's completely arbitrary. And do you need some standards? Just like this meter stick, you know, it's not nothing intrinsic in nature. The water meter, we just made it up and say, let's call that a meter. In the case of the meter, the zero applies. If you bring a meter stick next to mine and we agree, you can take the meter stick somewhere else and define that to be the meter. Because if the stickers, as long as that one and as long as that one, then those two are equal in length. But temperature, you similarly going to use this rod and say if this rod as a certain length when then when it kept on top of this bucket of some fluid and at the same length when I keep it on that bucket, then the two buckets that are at the same temperature.

Speaker 1:          00:09:01       So we can use markings on this ride compared to the unexpanded length as a measure of temperature. So what people do is to pick something a little easier than this, right? They notice the liquids expand when you heat them. That's why you know, summer day if you fill your gas tank, you have to leave some room at the top to the overflow can come out at the top are, you shouldn't fill it completely, otherwise it'll bust the tech. So liquids expand. So one way to measure temperature, maybe fix some liquid, put it there and then put it on hot rooms and maybe watch the liquid expand to the new height.

Speaker 3:          00:09:44       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:09:44       And then just try some markings and each marking can be a certain temperature,

Speaker 1:          00:09:51       but people had a better idea than this one. They add the following idea of thermometer where you have a lot of fluid in the reservoir, a very thin tube evacuated at the top and the fluid then is here. So what's clever about this is that if this expanse but 1% you right, you should be good enough to see 1% increase in height. If this fluid expense by 1% in volume, that one person in volume and it planes sub this narrow tube can claim to quite a bit. The extra volume you get by expansion will be the area of this tube flames, the extra delta x way with that expense. So you had a magnifying the expansion by making all the expander fluid claim of this extremely narrow too. In fact, the tube is so narrow, you cannot probably even see it well, which is why they're a little prison that magnifies the, the Medicare your alcohol in a thermometer. Okay, so we have some way of following temperature. Now we can draw some lines, arbitrary lines. It doesn't matter. That can be zero. That can be filed, that can be 19 you just got to make sure there's monotonic.

Speaker 1:          00:11:04       Then whenever it's on 21 we may argue that 21 is no harder than 90 what do you want a better scale than that? Even though that's mathematically adequate and practice what people decide yes to do it as follows. They said we want to set up thermometer so that people all over the world in different parts of the world, different countries, different labs can all agree. So we will make it possible for everyone to make their own thermometer. By the following recipe, we will dip this guy in a bucket which has got some ice and some water that's called the melting point of water. So that uh, are the freezing point of water up melting point of ice or the freezing point of water. It doesn't matter. We notice that as water cools down in the world around the suddenly ice, he was big into farm. We go to the temperature at which that happens for the first time and we dipped the thermometer there and whatever reading they get, we will postulate to be zero degrees centigrade. That is just a definition.

Speaker 1:          00:12:09       We believe that's a good definition because people all over the world can do that. Of course, if you live in Kuwait, that's not going to work for you. There no ice, but they've figured out when the parts of the world where you had ice, this is a very good definition. You get ice, you got zero degrees. Then they said, let's find another universally accessible thing, which as you all know is the boiling point of water. If you put water on the stove, it heats up and he'd up and heats up and suddenly it begins to bubble and boil and evaporate. That temperature is going to be called a hundred degrees, hundred degrees centigrade.

Speaker 3:          00:12:49       Then

Speaker 1:          00:12:50       you take this call in between zero and a hundred and you divided into 100 equal parts

Speaker 1:          00:12:58       and that is postulated to be the temperature anywhere between zero and a hundred if you've gone 79% of the way to the top from here to here, the temperature is 79 degrees because that's how the Dignitas and introducing that to some degree of scale and you guys know that are different scales. You can have the fat in height scale, you can have any other skill in which what you want to call the freezing point is different. Somebody thinks a zero, somebody thinks it's 32 and you can again call this something else and you can divide this interval in 200 parts, 180 parts of whatever you like, but the philosophy is the same. You have to find two points which are reproducible conveniently and divide the region between them into some number of equal steps. If it's a hundred equals steps, you say it's a centigrade scale provided the lowest one is called zero.

Speaker 1:          00:13:51       The sow, you have thermometers. Now, there are some problems with this one problem is that the boiling point of water does not seem to be very reliable because if you boil water on in Aspen for example, you know it doesn't seem to boil. It seems to boil more readily than in the plains. You can ask how do you know that maybe it is still doing the same thing. I know that because I try to cook something, Cook some rice or vegetables, I find they don't cook at all. Then where it boils before it cooks. That way we know it's probably boiling earlier in the mountains then in the plains, so who's going to decide what the real temperature is so you have to be more careful when you say a boiling point and freezing point because things don't boil. The don't seem to boil at a certain predictable and fixed temperature.

Speaker 1:          00:14:49       This is very deep arguments I've never appreciated fully when I was learning the subject, et Cetera. Saws sick like definition because you may not know that the temperature is changing because this is the mometer by postulate it's going to be the temperature by definition. How can it be wrong? What's wrong is that it's not, we know it's not a reliable method because physical phenomenon, like when your rice, we'll cook. I'd not reproduced by the boiling point of water. It cooks in the plains doesn't Cook in the mountain, so we know the boiling point is to blame the rice, the rice, that's all we know that that's not a good measure. So nowadays people are much fancier measures and I will tell you a little bit about that, but for a long time this was a very good start. Don't worry about the fact that water boils at differently in different altitudes.

Speaker 1:          00:15:36       You could go to sea level and that's a good enough to definitions. Sea level is pretty much constant all over the world and you can see the pressure that sea level is the pressure at sea level, just the road g eight of the atmosphere. Okay, so that's the usual definition of temperature. Now the trouble started when people realize that if you make a thermometer with your favorite fluid, maybe mercury and I make one with alcohol, they will agree at zero and they will agree with a hundred because that's how you fixed it. You read it so zero everyone says zero hundred everyone says hundred but how bout 74 degrees or 75 degrees? I saved 75 if my fluid has claimed three fourths of the way to the top at that point, yours may not have claimed three fourth of the way. In other words, you've got two things, two graphs with a zero and a hundred agree.

Speaker 1:          00:16:31       One graph may be like this one made me like that so that when I think it is 75 you may think of 72 or 100 people agree because we are cooked it up that way. In other words, it's not true that all liquids expand at the same rate, so you will have to then pick one liquid and say we were by that liquid and when that liquid is gone halfway, we would say it's 50 degrees, so you'll have to pick a liquid, you will have to have an international convention. You know that's the alcohol lobby and those don't know alcohol lobby. They argue. Finally they found out a much better solution than these liquids. They found out that if you use a gas, you can define temporary reducing gases which have some very, very nice properties and this is the gas thermometer that I'm going to tell you now. So he had a sub. You'd build the gas thermometer.

Speaker 4:          00:17:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:27       You take some gas in their container. The typical container for me and all, whenever I draw anything, thermodynamics, it's going to be gas inside some cylinder, which then waits on him and that defines a pressure that the guests, of course the pressure will be the mg of these weights divided the area of the cylinder. That's the pressure plus atmospheric pressure and the volume is this, whatever the volume is, base times height. Here's what we asked you to do. Take the product of pressure at times volume for any sample of guests. Take some gas, put it in this tank and now put it on different surfaces like a hot plate like a stove like Pablo water and measured the temperature using some standard methods up to that point, like a mercury thermometer. What you'll notice is that the temperature measured by some reasonable scheme show us that the product that p times B lies on a straight line. If you connect the dots, you find the product. PV is linear in this temperature variable and this is zero degrees and this is hundred degrees. No. Here's the beauty of the gas thermometer. If you take a different gas and you put different amount of different gas in a different cylinder, you want to get some other graph may look like this.

Speaker 1:          00:19:11       What do you that does the run? That's a hundred but most important thing is that's also a straight line. That's also a straight line. It is the following application. You guys can prove out your own leisure, which is that if I think that my gas has claimed 56% of the way of this height to the top for the temporary, that is 56 degrees. I ask, what's your gas done? You'll find his answer [inaudible] to 6% of the way. It's a property of straight lines. You can show that if it took two straight lines, whatever, be the slope. If they agree, if this is zero, this is a hundred it's got a different slope. When you have claimed for the halfway point, draw a line at 50 degrees and ask what does any gas done. They will all have claim to the halfway point from the 0.2 100 point. In other words, gas thermometers will not only agree at the end points where they must buy construction. They seem to agree all the way in between, but that is one requirement. This gas has to be very dilute.

Speaker 3:          00:20:23       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:20:24       More diluted is the better it comes up to take neon or freon at whatever you like. Don't pump it up with a lot of gas. Put the least amount of gas you can get away with. Then you find all gases have the property that if you calibrate them a zero and a hundred, they agree in between that clear to you. Take the product p Times v off your gas by putting it on different surfaces. Measure the product, plot this graph, um, been able to, whenever you're on ice, you call it zero. Whenever they run a boiling water, you call it a hundred, you find the join, they're connected by a straight line. Then every point in between you've divided equally leads to equal increase in the product p Times v. So Pre Times v for the gas is better than the volume of mail courier volume of water because it doesn't depend on the gas.

Speaker 1:          00:21:20       So everybody can use the gas thermometer. That's why we prefer the gas thermometer. This is the interesting issue about a measurement or definitions and sick league definitions. You gotta be careful. The last submitted, I love you to pick anything you like that varies with temperature and use that as a definition of temperature as a thermometer. So why have some thermometers preferred over the others? The preferred over the others. If the laws of nature take the simplest form when described in terms of those thermometers, in other words, stick a meter stick. What makes a good meter stick photo standard? You say the one that doesn't expand but we don't know what that means because that means the stick is the standard by definition is right, but in then you will soon find out. That's not really that simple because there are good and bad meters sticks, but example the same meter stick at one time of the year, doesn't matter his own length at a different time of the year. Then we know that it's not a good meter sticks. Similarly, there are good and bad thermometers and people at Avon, the gas, that moment, this way if you have a gas that more metered, something very interesting came out of it. Gas at one. If you cool it below zero.

Speaker 3:          00:22:33       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:22:34       and you asked which way is it going? I don't know how low you could go. In the old days, people couldn't go far below zero, but nowadays we can go to 1 billion of a degree above a certain point. I tell you now, uh, these thermometers indicates somehow the product PB vanishes at a temperature which is minus two 73.16.

Speaker 3:          00:22:56       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:22:58       So I just think that that is something very special about that temperature because if you took another gas, well I'm going to do a little cheating here that also extrapolate that same temperature. So all gases, all aghast anemometers say that is something very special about this temperature because that's when our pressures all vanish. So as you cool if given amount of gas, even at a given volume, if you keep the volume constant and ask what pressure do I need, how many weights to have to put on that decreases and vanishes at this temperature? And this is called the absolute zero of temperature.

Speaker 3:          00:23:38       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:23:40       it's called absolute zero for many reasons. One is that unlike zero of the Centigrade, which is by no means the absolute lowest possible temperature, the absolute zero is the lowest possible temperature. Why? Because the gas pressure can be reduced and reduced and reduced, but the worst that can happen, it can go to zero. That's it. You cannot go below having no pressure. We'll find in other ways. Also, this is the temperature at which you will see conceptually no for the cooling as possible. That'll record you don't understand what hot and cold mean, but right now this is all guests. Anemometers pointed this temperature, so people decided, you know what calling this the zero is kind of artificial. That's based on human obsession, that water. But if you think the loss of scientists claim the whole universe, what about planets where there's no water,

Speaker 1:          00:24:38       right? You cannot describe, suppose you're talking to at different civilizations, planet of the Apes. You want to tell those guys, uh, we're going to set up a temperatures. Zero is when water freezes and they say, what is this thing called water? You know the stuff you drink? Well, you don't know what these apes are drinking. Maybe they're drinking, meeting or hydrogen gas, liquid hydrogen, we don't know. On the other hand, you say, uh, take any vapor and wait till the product of the pressure and volume go to zero. Let's call that the zero. That's a universal standard is not paid to something called water. It was fine for a while but it is not fine as a universal aspiration but the diameters, so zero temperature is going to be set from here. Once they did that, they call that zero. They needed one other temperature and they decided that if you're starting the new temperature scale, you will put the zero knock at the centigrade, but this is now called Kelvin and everything will follow a straight line, but to define the what one degree means, you've got to define one of the temperature.

Speaker 1:          00:25:47       That's how we defined a straight line. That temperature would be called two 71 3.16 but at this point it's called the triple point of water. What's the triple point of water? You know water and ice can coexist and you know that water and steam can coexist at a hundred degrees, but we're burying the pressure and temperature and volume. You can actually find a certain magical point in which bought ice water and steam can't coexist simultaneously. It cannot pick between those three options. Ice Floating on water is when water is not decided whether to be ice or to be water. That's a coexistence point of two things. And when the water starts boiling in your store, that's been water and steam coexist. But I'm saying that a certain conditions of pressure and temperature and volume so that water ice and will coexist. No, that is a unique situation. You cannot get to that by any other means.

Speaker 1:          00:26:50       And that temperature we will call plus two 73.16 in this absolute units. So basically what you've done by going to the absolute units as your shifted the zero to more natural point where all grabs meat, then you define the one degree Kelvin to be so that to 73.16 that Kelvin brings you to the triple point of water. So if you find that confusing, I'm just saying the boiling point of water is not a fixed number. You go to the mountains to changes, but only under one condition can water and ice and steam coexist. That cannot be, you cannot get that any other way. So everybody will agree on that particular situation and that will be called to 73.16 Kelvin. Now that is a rule. Apparently you can say degrees centigrade. You're not supposed to say degree Kelvin. That's a big deal made and a lot of books I keep forgetting and said, in fact I forgot again and nothing terrible has happened to me.

Speaker 1:          00:27:53       So I don't think you should pay too much attention to whether you can call something degree Kelvin or simply Kelvin. I think purpose of language is to have no ambiguity's but when I say degree Kelvin and I find that you guys don't get confused, I don't think that's a big deal. What you'll find if you're a very erudite person, you will never write degree killed. But having said that, don't hold me to those standards. I just don't feel any affiliation to this particular completely are artificial and empty convention. But you have supposed to remember if you take the GRE or something, it's not called degree Kelvin. Okay, so as far as we're concerned, the Kelvin scale, it's like the Centigrade scale except the zero has shifted to here. That's it. That's the temperature scale you will use. That's the absolute temperature. Whenever I write t from now on, I'm talking about Calvin, not centigrade.

Speaker 1:          00:28:51       Now that's all about heat. I mean all about temperature. Now I'm going to talk about heat. So heat is denoted by the symbol queue and you got to ask yourself, what are we talking about when we talk about heat, again, let's use your intuitive sense of what heat is. You say, I have a bucket of water, I want to heat it up, and how do you do that? You put the bucket on top of something else which you'd think is harder, and when the two are brought together, somehow the water begins to feel harder than harbor. So we say we've heated the water and we say we are transferred heat. Now people were not sure what really was being transferred. What is it that's going from the store to the water? Why? Why is it that the stove, if it's not plugged in is getting cooler and the water is getting hotter? They just decided to call it the calorie fluid.

Speaker 3:          00:29:46       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:29:47       They imagined that it a certain fluid which is abundant in hot things and not so at and cold things. When you put hot and cold together, this magical fluid flows from hot to cold and in the process heaps up the quality and they decided to measure it in calories and so you have to define what accountability is. In other words, you want to ask how much heat does it take to heat this bucket of water and the rules they made up was we are going to define something called accountability where the number of calories you need is equal to the mass of water, times the change in temperature and that's going to be counted. These other words, if I had a container with 10 grams of water and the temperature went up, I'm sorry, this is mass of water in grams.

Speaker 3:          00:30:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:30:48       At one gram of water and you did something to it and the temperature went up by seven degrees. You will have by definition pumped in seven calories. If this was a kilogram of water, listen to be called a kilo candidate, so sometimes I use grams and calories. Sometimes you use kilograms and kilo calories, but the definitions are consistent. If you put a kilo in the grand, put a kilo in the calories.

Speaker 3:          00:31:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:20       Now suppose you say, I don't want to just talk about water. I want to talk what he thinks. Something else. Maybe I want to hit the grandmas copper, so then you write down the following rule. Yeah, morning to heat. It takes the heat up. Anything pick your own favorite material goal. Then the amount of heat I think we can all appreciate must be proportional to the amount of stuff you're trying to heat up. That's somewhat intuitive notion. If you've got one chunk of gold that takes some number of calories, do you have a second, second identical chunk? By definition, that should take the same number of calories you put them together. It is clear that whatever this calorie fluid is, you need double that so it's got to be a proportional to the mass of the substance and has gotten a proportional to what you're aiming for. Namely an increase in temperature, but this is true for any substance whether they are eating copper or wood gold, no matter what you're heating it is through the heat. Nita is proportional to mass and at the temperature, so what is it that distinguishes one material from another? We put a number here and that number is called the specific heat speciphic feet. This is a property off that material.

Speaker 1:          00:32:44       You got to understand certain formulas will depend on certain parameters in a genetic way and some things that depend on the actual material. In fact that a similar quantity, I mean maybe I'll take a second to tell you. If you go to the liquids that I said we're expanding, you can do the same thing. Take a rod and started eating it and ask how much will it expand if I, he did buy some on belt the tea.

Speaker 3:          00:33:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:15       What will it be proportional to? Can anybody think of what it may be proportional to? Yes. Depends on the original length of the right and the why is that? Why do we think it's got to be proportional to the length of the Rod? Yeah, it's based on what it had before. Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:33:35       Hold on.

Speaker 1:          00:33:40       That's correct. I think the way you, one way to say that is take a meter, stick it expand for some amount, put another meter, stick next to it. That expense pay the same amount by definition of identical things that for the two meters stick, we'll expand by twice as much. So we put the length of that. So don't matter to what you're heating a block of wood block of Steve. This is true, but then the fact that he has different effects on copper versus wood is the pain is indicated by putting a number here. That Alpha is called the coefficient of linear expansion.

Speaker 1:          00:34:19       And that depends on the material. These are true no matter what you are heating. So these specific numbers, these coefficients, these alphas that come in are going to come and all the time. So you should get used to that. He has another one. Let's play this game one more time. We can ask how much is the volume of a body changed when I heat it or the chain of the volume again, would it be proportional to starting volume times the increase in temperature. Then you put another number that's called the Coefficient of volume expansion and that depends on the material. So if you take copper, copper will have a certain alphabet I end, we'll have a different alpha would. We'll have a different outfit it material. We'll have a different alpha. This is the property of the material. If you say, well, I had something and when I heated it up by one degree, increase by nine inches, another one increased by two inches. Is it clear that the first one expands more readily? It's not because the first one could have been a my long second one. Could I be in a foot long? So you have to pick out certain factors that are universal and the rest of it you put into a property of the material.

Speaker 3:          00:35:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:26       Similarly, many companies, specific heat, you ask how much he does it take to eat. Some object. It depends on the mass. It doesn't matter what your heating. Depends on increase in temperature because that's the purpose of adding heat's always going to be linear. In the Delta t this one is a property of the material and by definition see equal do one calories per gram or the one kilo calorie per kilogram for water. Once you've got to remember one calorie per gram for water, you said definition. Once you define water to have a specific, either one calorie per gram, you can define specific kid for other materials by the following process. So what do you do? You take a container, put some water in it. Let's assume the container, a zero mass. I don't have to worry about it. It's an approximation. If you're worried about that, you know, take a huge container so that the volume of water dominates the surface area of the container anyway.

Speaker 1:          00:36:33       Containers neglected. You got some water. This water is served some initial temperature t one and I have some new material lead and I want to find its specific heat. So I take the lead in the form of pellets and they hit the lead pellets with some temperature deep too, and I dropped these guys into this water. That'll be an example where initially the led is an equilibrium. Maybe on a furnace, a temperature, tea to water is an equilibrium maybe in the room, uh, temperature t one. Then I put the pellets into the water. There'll be period when the temperature is not defined. Then soon they'll settle down for some common temperature called tea.

Speaker 1:          00:37:21       We will now postulate this is a postulate are a lot. The total change in Q is zero. In other words, if Q is lost by one body and gained by another body, the loss and the gain was equal. It's the new law. You can make up all the new laws you want. You don't have the right, but this is the law you first make. In that case, what can you say in this particular problem, in any of these heat problems, I urge you to draw. The following picture is one temperature. Here's another temperature. Here's the final one which we don't know what we can measure with a thermometer and measure it. Then you say the mass of the water. Then specifically the water, which is one time Delta t which is the final temperature minus the initial temperature data for the led pellet master. The led that is going to symbol PB time specific heat, which I don't know. Times change in temperature, which is the final minus d two is equal to zero. The summer fall, the MC Delta t zero.

Speaker 3:          00:38:41       Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:38:42       This is the gain of heat of the water. This if you work it out, we'll be a negative number because you can see [inaudible] is below initial t. This will turn out to be negative and the positive and negative will add up to zero. So what does it you don't know? Well, you know the mass of the water specifically to water is one by definition. The final anti want to measure it, but thermometers, mass of letters for you to measure. These are known. You can find c, so this is a birthday present for you guys. If you ever see this in an exam, jump on this first because you've been doing this in high school. I know kids love this kind of calorimeter problems. Yes,

Speaker 3:          00:39:22       I'm looking at the volume and expands linear labor wasn't the problem with the liquid bettering liquid volume.

Speaker 1:          00:39:35       Yes, that's correct. So the real point is if everything expanded linearly, we won't have the disagreement between between different thermometers. So it turns out to an excellent approximation. The channel length is proportional to the length, but it's not exactly proportional to that will be terms involving higher power. So like not only that specific either materials is also not a constant. We say specifically the waters one, it turns out at a certain temperature range, it will be one at a different range. In fact, it's not quite one. I totally long back. Everything I tell you is wrong. It's the question is how many decimal places do you have to go to before you honored my fallacies? Personally, keep materials is not a constant. It's a big industry. Calculating the specific heat of materials starting from atoms and quantum mechanics. So none of the things treated as constants that ever constant, including two alphas and Betas.

Speaker 1:          00:40:34       I can always find it by saying Alpha itself may depend on the temperature and also the dependence on element. I'd be linear, but you should also look at dimensional considerations and say if it's not l if you want to put an l square in the as a correction to the formula to mass the units, the l squared has to be divided by another length to keep the units. What are the links do we have? It may turn out to be the intro comic spacing. So once the atomic properties come into play, then you can find ways to calculate corrections. So all these laws are in fact very tentative approximate. These are pretty ancient physics. I think the way I do the physics course here, sometimes I'm the 1600 sometimes in the 1400 sometimes in the year 2000 so it's going back and forth. This is way back when people did not even know about atoms. So they would try to do the best they can. And what you found in empirically is that once you find a specific heat for lead, right, you solve for it, then you can do another experiment using that value and you finally use the right values. Delta Q does add up to zero. Again, when you say adds up to zero, accept a zero to very good approximation during that park. Now that he parked, when people do more than what I could run experiments, everything has shot up.

Speaker 1:          00:41:48       In fact, specific kids of art materials seem to go to zero and yet when he approached absolute temperature, you have to understand the laws of quantum physics to know why that happens.

Speaker 3:          00:41:59       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:42:00       so this is the period when people are probing temperature ranges, which are our own room temperature are boiling and freezing point water, which is a very narrow window and temperature. We look at the history of the universe. You've got incredibly high temperatures near the Big Bang and even now the rest of the is bait at some temperature. That happens to be very, very low, which is near three degrees. It's called the black body radiation from the big bang. So the temperature of the universe goes through huge ranges and only when you probe different ranges you see different physics. If you come to Sloan lab, you can go to temperatures were below one degree Kelvin or hundreds of Calvin and we heard a talk last year physics that 1 billion of a Calvin. Do you want to cool them and cool Devon cooldown zero degrees Kelvin. See that I go zero.

Speaker 1:          00:42:46       Kelvin is a barrier. We're not able to cross just like the velocity of light is something we are not able to cross. You said our big surprises, the fact that velocity has an upper limit, not obvious even to Newton. Why not? Why not put rockets and Papa rockets? Likewise when I build better than better refrigerators, the reason you cannot go below zero is when you go to zero. All the mechanical attributes like pressure simply vanish and they cannot have negative values. You will see more about this when you understand he in greater depth anyway. Right now Delta Q equals zero is the rule you use. I'm sure you guys know how to do these problems. No, that is a little twist that comes in. I just want to mention that to you. The twist is the following, so I take some ice ice. By the way, it's not always at zero.

Speaker 1:          00:43:34       You know you can go below zero, your refrigerators several degrees below a several tens below zero. So let's take ice and let me measure. I take this container, I put some ice, I'd say minus 30 degrees. I've gone to San Degrade now so we can relate to ice and I put it on some source of heat and I watch how many calories are coming in. Let me add in the device that'll pump in a fixed number of calories every second. So that's a function of time. I'm expecting the temperature of this to go up. Do you understand that in every second I get some number of calories and those number of calories that are going to produce for me and see Delta p, m and C and constants. So Delta Q is proportionally developed a t. If you divide both by the time elapsed and the rate at which the temperature rises will be the rated with the heat flows into the system if see it displaying at a steady rate, temperature should rise and indeed it does. Temperature of the ice goes from minus 30 to minus 20 to minus 10 and so on. But once it hits zero, it gets stuck. I know heat that's coming in, but it's not getting harder. But I notice that the ice is beginning to melt. That will be a period between here and here. When I pump in calories, I don't get any increase in temperature, but I get conversion of ice into water

Speaker 1:          00:45:09       and that'd be a PD. And when this guy, I looked like some water with some chunks of ice floating on it, and until all the ice is converted to water, the whole system is stuck at that temperature. That's a very interesting property. You know, if you really took a real pot and you put a chunk of ice on it, you know what will happen, right? The bottom of the ice will melt. It may even evaporate. That's not what I'm talking, but because that's not a system where there's a globally defined temperature. I want you to hit the ISO slowly. The minute you put a little bit of calories, give it enough time for all these guys to share that heat so that the whole system has one single common temperature and let's watch the temperature rise. I'm saying it gets stuck at zero, but your calories are getting you something. They're converting ice into water. Then you can ask, okay, what penalty do I have to pay? That's called the latent heat of melting and again, I know only in calories per gram. It's 80 calories per gram for waters. Some of your Delta Q now goes not to raise the temperature. What do melt? Some amount of stuff, uh, at the latent heat of melting, that's so much. Q you need to melt that. I'm on the stuff and the El varies from substance a substance, but water is 80 calories per gram. If you want to melt mercury from solid medicare, the liquid mercury, it'll have a different number. Then once everybody has become water, then that uniform system of water and started growing

Speaker 1:          00:46:51       and this is called a phase change. Face changes when it changes its atomic arrangement from a regular airwaves, for example, the forms a solid into a liquid in a solid, everybody has this place, you can shake it around where you are, but liquid you can run around the specific heat of eyes is not the same as the specific heat of water, so you've got to be careful. Even though it's still made up of water molecules, the calories needed to hit one grammar wise, roughly half of what it takes to heat one gram of water. So in these problems don't make the mistake. Okay. Then you go along and I guess you know what the next stopping point is. When you come to 100 degrees again, it gets stuck, delay everybody flip prices and then you get steam. Then you can have super heated steam, which is even higher than a hundred degrees, so that's the latent heat of vaporization.

Speaker 1:          00:47:42       I really don't want even want to write something. I think it's 500 and something calories for the brand. That's information I don't carry in my head so you can, if I tell you I took some ice at minus 30 and I dumped in 5,000 calories, where will it end up? You've got the first spend a few calories going from here to here. You've got some more money left. You can start melting this. Maybe you'll run out of stuff there. Then that's what you will have some amount of water and some are more device. You got even more calories at your disposal. You can melt it all and start heating it. You may come this way and you may be running out of calories if not, keep going here and there and there. You may end up there if you've got enough calories or one can ask a question, how many calories does it take to convert ice at minus 30 to say water and a hundred we'll will have to hit. You'll have to do the MC Delta t for that m times the latent heat for this Mc Delta t for that and m times latent heat of vaporization for that.

Speaker 1:          00:48:47       So the kind of problems you can get are fairly simple most of the time.

Speaker 3:          00:48:52       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:48:53       Only kind of problem where you can really get in trouble is the following. I will mention that to you. Suppose I take some water and some ice. So this is zero. The Isis, I'd say minus 40 water. This at plus eight in fact, let me make that also at plus 40 I bring them together and ask you what will happen. No, this is the subtle problem. If, if you had to, if he had water that party and he had water the 20 you can easily guessed that it'll end up somewhere in between. You can calculate that was more subtle. You've got water at 40 you've got ice at minus 40 you bring them together and ask what happens? Well, the answer will depend on how much of this stuff you have. If by water at 40 you mean the Atlantic Ocean and bay. I assume in a couple of ice cubes, we know what's going to happen.

Speaker 1:          00:49:49       These guys are going to get clobbered. They're going to melt. You will end up somewhere here. Then you can easily calculate the final temperature by saying mc time, this Delta t for water in magnitude is going to be the he'd given to this. He'd given to this as the MC Delta t to come here than the heat to melt some more device than the heat to raise this amount of water to that final temperature. Then you can solve for the final temperature. So if you want to solve this problem and I give you some mass for this ice of water and I give you some mass for the ice, you can first make the optimistic assumption that you will end as water, but at an unknown temperature, we call it unknown temperature. T. This is the t one. This is the t to write your equations except you like one more term there.

Speaker 1:          00:50:37       That's the heater takes to melt the ice you solve for t. If you get a positive answer, you can use it because he's assumption that you ended up on water meant you hit it up. The ISU melted the ice in the water, then he hit it up the water from zero to the final water. But if it did the calculation got a negative value of t. That answer cannot be blindly used because the assumption that you're on the other side of ice is wrong. Then you can try something else. Uh, you can assume you're down here.

Speaker 1:          00:51:09       If you think you're down here, then you'll simply heated the ice from here to here. This water you're brought down to zero sucked out MC Delta t from that, then you've taken out now the latent heat of melting. You take out heat when you freeze and then you'd take an even more to come down here. Then all those losses of the original water is equal to the gain of the size. You can assume it here, you can solve for this STI when you solve for this tea. If you've got a negative number, then you're okay. That will be good assumption. If I say I sprinkled two drops of water on a big iceberg, we know it's going to end up his eyes and that's a good starting point. But if I give you a numbers which are kind of wishy washy, but I don't know whether this will win or that will win, that is the third possibility.

Speaker 1:          00:51:55       The third possibility is at the end of the day you ended up here with some amount of water and some of them are device at zero degrees, so that's a third option. You may have to consider if neither of them works, then the question is not what is the final temperature, but what's the question then what do you want to know in that case, how much his eyes and how much is water? That's the question and there are several ways to figure that out. Let me just say in words, I don't want to do this Algebra because for you guys should be fairly easy. If it's the question of suppose both of the things I try fail. I took a positive t as soon as I'm up here and I assume the ice melted and they get a negative answer that shot down. You take a negative t and assume everybody froze and that doesn't work.

Speaker 1:          00:52:48       Then I'm down to this option which is some amount of water and some are more device and the question is how much is left? You solved that by doing the following. You say all this eyes went from here to there. It does that by absorbing that MC, Delta t you know, massive VI's and specifically device times delta t, maybe it was minus 40 the Delta t is plus 40 you give that heat to this guy that hit you suck out of this guy. When you suck that out of this guy first you'll bring this to zero. Then you still have some more heat you can extract from. You will use that to convert water into ice at the price of 80 calories per gram. Maybe you can freeze five grams or five kilograms of water. That'd be the extra eyes lest we be. Whatever water you started with, the total mass will be the same. But if you've got 60 grams of water, you bring the 60 grams to zero and you still have some more heat to be extracted. Maybe you'll convert 10 grams to ice and 50 will remain is water. So the final answer will be 50 grams of water, 10 grams of ice plus whatever grams of ice you started with.

Speaker 1:          00:54:03       That's what the most complex heat exchange problem. If you guys want me to tell you some more, I will add. I can, we'll want, I don't know what your you on this. Do you understand what you have to do? Any it's problem. Okay, so it's the conservation of a heat that's applied. So the most tricky part is phase change. When you got to face change, you got to remember that the Formula Mc, Delta t delta Q has one more term that one more turn is this. Okay. So next question we ask is what's the mandate in which he managed this to flow? We say you've got this calories man. How does it flow? What the rate is, what makes it flow? So it turns out that are the popular ways where he transferred. One is called radiation.

Speaker 3:          00:55:05       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:55:06       radiation. This, when the heat energy leaves some hot body and comes to you without the benefit of any medium like heat from the sun, so that's really electromagnetic radiation. That comes from heart glowing objects and that actually comes to you and electromagnetic radiation doesn't need air, doesn't need anything. In fact, if it needed it, we will not get any heat from the sun because there is no medium, which means the earth and the sun. Most of it just back here. If you'd pick one of these space heaters, no, with glowing red cars and you feel warm. If I pump start pumping the or bedroom, of course you will be dying very rapidly, but your last thoughts will be, I am still warm because the radiation will keep coming to you. Okay. That's radiation heat that are lots of laws for radiation. I don't want to give them to you because there are formulas memorized. Memorize. Do. You don't understand too much of the physics right now other than to say it's electromagnetic radiation, whatever that means. We haven't gotten to that yet. That's what comes from there to here. It can come and back. Vacuum doesn't need a medium is the key. Then the second way of heat transfer is called convection.

Speaker 1:          00:56:26       So convection is explained by this following example. You got water, you put it on a hot plate. Then in the lower part of it, the water gets hot. When it gets hot, it expands and when it expands, the density goes down. Therefore by boy lasa buoyancy, it will start raising up. Remember I chunk of water belongs in water. I chunk of something else who lower density will float to the top, but the point is water doesn't have a fixed density. If you heat it up, the density goes down. So the water guys downstairs have a lower density. They're like a piece of cork. They will rise to the top. When the rise to the top, the cold water with the higher density will fall down, so you will set a bit color hot races to the drop in. Coal comes down and this also happens in the atmosphere. On a hot day, the ad next to the ground gets really heated up and it rises in the call. That comes down and they set up this thermal cards. So here you're trying to equalize the temperature between a region which is called in the region, which is heart by the actual motion off some material.

Speaker 1:          00:57:34       In radiation you don't have the medium transferring heat because the medium is not even present in radiation. In convection, the medium actually moves. The hot guys physically moved to the other players in the coal guys come here and by that process the heat is transferred. Heat transfer I want us to focus on is a little more quantitatively is conduction. So heat conduction is something you've all experienced. I mean if you have a skillet, why does it have a wooden handle? Simple reason. If you had a steel handle,

Speaker 3:          00:58:14       okay, you

Speaker 1:          00:58:15       put it on the hot stove and you put your hand here, the fact that your body is at whatever 98 degrees and this one has gotten us 200 degrees, you're going to have heat flow from here to here. So we want to understand what's the rated with heat flows from hot end of the colon. So you can imagine that rod of some cross section, a one end of the ride isn't some reservoirs at some temperature t one other than there's a temperature t too. By the way, I'm not introducing a new term called reservoir. Reservoir is another body like you and me, except it's not like you and me. It's enormous. It is so big that it's temperature cannot be changed. You can sit on it, you will fry and you'll evaporate, but it's temperature will not change. Nobody's really a reservoir. If you drop an ice cube in the Atlantic, you lower the temperature of the Atlantic but were negligible amount.

Speaker 1:          00:59:08       So take the limit of Atlantic, goes to infinity, then you have a reservoir. So reservoirs have one label, namely what? Cyber temperature. So something big enough can be, this room is like a reservoir. You put a cup of coffee, you say it, it'll come to room temperature. Actually they don't temporaries that meets the coffee, not halfway but slightly up. Right. But the room is large enough so that we can attribute to the room temperature, quite independent of bodies that go in and out of it. So this is connected on the left during the anonymous tank of maybe a water ice mixture at zero degrees. This is a water steam mixture, maybe 100 degrees. You put a rod there. We know he is going to flow from the heart body from the heartland of the cold end and we wanted write a formula for how much heat flows per second. Again, I'm going to write these formulas over and over again. You got to ask yourself what will it depend on? What are the properties it'll depend on in general, independent of what the rod is made of. Can you think of one? Yes. You said the cross section of where did we say what reason can you give for cross?

Speaker 5:          01:00:21       Yes, yes.

Speaker 1:          01:00:31       Okay. Let me repeat this argument. You take one ride, I put convenience listed. Just take it to be a rectangular rod. Take another Rod, rectangular Rod. They will both transfer the same amount of heat for a given amount of time. Just glue them together and say, here is my new rod. We know it's going to transmit twice the amount of heat, so it's going to be proportional. The area and why is the heat flowing? It's flowing because of a temperature difference, so that's always there. That's the underlying force for heat transfer. That's the dynamics in thermodynamics. That's what makes the heat flow, but then we find as an empirical fact that if these two reservoirs were separated by that distance, then the heat flow is a lot less than when they are closer. It seems to depend on how much temperature differences packed in spatially, so you want to divide by Delta x is not infinite decimal.

Speaker 1:          01:01:29       It's the length of the rod separating the heart and cold hands. In other words, if you dilute the temperature difference over one mile, the heat flow will be correspondingly reduced. Whereas the pursuit temperature difference between a very small spatial separation, that'd be very robust flow of heat. That's what we were saying. This happened to be true. You realize independent of what material I'm talking about when I said one rod was one rod is arts. It doesn't matter what it's made of. Again, having put all these factors, which you can argue on general grounds, you have to now ask what happens when this, the copper rod versus silver rod versus wouldn't drive. So you've got to put one more number, which is capped by here, not care you guys kappa and it's called the uh, the thermal conductivity of that material. Sometimes you put a minus sign, a minus sign just means it flows from hot to cold.

Speaker 1:          01:02:31       I don't care whether you put the plus sign or don't put the minus sign. Anybody knows that the heat is going to flow from hot to cold. So just remember that, that action of flow and that's all I had a board, the sign here, this cap buys the property of the material. Once again, let me tell you, you can say, well, uh, I had two reservoirs, hot and cold. I connected them with two different rods. This rod carry twice the amount of heat, but a second I see other rock isn't necessarily better conductor. No, maybe it had 10,000 times across section. So what do you want to do is to make the playing field level and compare rots at the same cross section. Same temperature difference, same length. Then ask who conducts more heat. That depends on the material and that's the thing you pulled out specific to the material that is a property of water, copper, steel as the heat conductivity.

Speaker 1:          01:03:27       Okay. Now final topic. Is this going to be more of a hand waving? Now I don't want to get into too many details. It really has to do with the water is heat. The old days people just said it's a fluid and they postulated the conservation law for the fluid. You can postulate what you want. You got to make sure that it works and it seems to work in the sense that all the delta cues in any reaction add up to zero, but then people were getting hints that maybe this thing that we call heat is not entirely independent of other things we have learned. So where do you get the clue? One clue is long back when we studied mechanics, we talk about two cars. They come and collide. They slam into one big lump. Now you've got no kinetic energy, no potential energy.

Speaker 1:          01:04:17       Potential energy is always zero. They're moving on the same height. Kinetic energy was one half MBA squared for this one, half MV squared for that. At the end there's nothing, no kinetic, no potential. We just gave up and said, look, conservation of energy doesn't apply to this problem. We just say it's in the lasting. On the other hand, we find whenever that happens we find the bodies become hot. Here's another thing you can do. It can take a cannon ball, drop it from a big tower, the south. Some people in the French army, I think first detected this feature. You drop cannon balls from a big height. When they hit the sand, they start heating up or you drill a hole in the canon that what counts somebody did, and you also notice that you need to constantly pour water to keep the drill bit from heating up.

Speaker 1:          01:05:07       You find very often mechanical energy is lost and things heat up, so you get a suspicion, whatever the underlying mechanism, maybe that is a rule that says if you lose so much mechanical energy that you cannot account for, then it translates into a fixed number of calories. If that is the case, then we'll at least get a dictionary on between calories and Jules. So Jules is energy. You can see calories as energy. You cannot see that was going to be the premise. But first you've got to prove that every time you lose some number of jewels, you get a fixed amount of calories and that experiment is do the jewel, is a jewel experiment. It's very, very simple and tells you the whole story. You have a little container in with that is a pattern. This is a shop with a pulley. And then so wait here.

Speaker 1:          01:06:06       So I try to imagine this guys, you got rope wrapped around the top pulley and when you let this weight go down, you're going to go down like this. It's going to spend the shop. I put some water in here and I have some friends that are sticking out, so the return up the water, so it's like this thing, the egg beater, right? In fact, I try to do the experiment with the egg beater, the summer to a bunch of high school kids and I got totally humiliated because nothing happened as planned, okay? But the idea is the same. You agitate the water in some fashion, but this guy did it in a particular simple way. My egg bidding was not good enough. You'll see them maybe in a while. Why that's not good. What he did was to put these parents, let the weight go down from there to here.

Speaker 1:          01:06:55       Now we can keep track of how much mechanical energy is lost, right? Because of this mass was addressed and it dropped the hide. AMG dropped high date. It's supposed to have MGH can energy. Let's say it's got some kinetic energy, which is not equal. The MGH MGH minus kinetic energy is missing. Some number of jewels are gone. The water gets hot. When the water gets hot, you can immediately ask how many calories was supplied the water, because that water, it heats up the same way. Whether or not you put it on a hot plate or whether or not you churn. It doesn't seem to depend on how it got hard. This has the same effect. This is water is hard in every real sense. So you must have put some calories so you can find out how many calories you put in by looking at the master water specifically, the water is one looking at the increase in temperature.

Speaker 1:          01:07:52       So some jewels are missing, some calories have been pumped into the water. The new ask is of a proportionality between jewels and the calories. And you find that is, and that happens to be four points to Jewel's for a candidate. In other words, if you can expand 4.2 joules of mechanical energy, you got yourself one calorie to be used for whatever heating purposes. So in the example of the collide in cars, this had some energy that has some energy, all measured in juggles the slam together they come to rest. That means you can take those many jingles, divide by 4.2 and get some number of calories. Imagine the whole car is made out of copper. Then those calories will produce an increase in temperature, right equal to Delta Q is Mc, Delta t. That will be the rising temperature of the car. In fact, there'll be other losses because you heard the sound well, that's some energy gone.

Speaker 1:          01:08:53       You won't get it back. Maybe it sparks are flying. That light energy that's gone. If it's a project all that out, you find that in the end the calories explain the missing jewels so that made people think that this is just another form of energy because if you add this to your energy balance, there is no reason to go on apologizing for the law of conservation of energy. Law of conservation of energy is not in fact violated even at the inelastic collisions. If you include heat as a form of energy and the conversion factor is 4.2 joules per calorie, but the question is, what right do you have to call it? Energy. Energy. We think primarily when he says somebody is energetic, give me that. Someone's running around my endlessly back and forth. Entities associated with motion. These two cars were moving and where every right to say they have energy.

Speaker 1:          01:09:48       How about potential energy will live. This star card starts climbing up the hill and slows down. We think it's got potential. You let it go. It'll come back and give you the kinetic energy. So most people's idea of energy, just candidate energy that is lost and yet you get calories in return. So you ask yourself, what can it be? Well, the correct answer to that came only when we understood that everything is made up of atoms. Once you grant that, everything is made up of Adams. Then it turns out that kinetic energy of Adams is what we call heat, but it can be very careful. Take a tank full of gas. I throw it at you. That whole tank is moving. That's not what I call heat. Okay. That motion, you can see I'm talking about a tank of gas that doesn't seem to be going anywhere yet.

Speaker 1:          01:10:40       It got motional energy because the little guys are going back and forth. So what we will find this, what I'm going to show you next time is that if you kept track of the kinetic energy of every single molecule in this car, every single molecule in that car before and after, and you added them up, you will get exactly the same number. The only difference will be originally the car has got global common velocity, macroscopic velocity. You can see on top of it, it's random motion of the molecules that make up the car. So does the other car, when they slam together, the macroscopic motion is completely gone and all the motion is thermal motion, but it's still Kennedy, Kennedy. And that's what we will see the next time.
