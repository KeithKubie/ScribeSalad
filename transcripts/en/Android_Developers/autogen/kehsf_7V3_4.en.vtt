00:00:04.417 --> 00:00:07.708
 When I was young, games were developed only by big companies. 

00:00:07.708 --> 00:00:12.438
 Now any two friends can meet together at leisure and develop games. 

00:00:12.583 --> 00:00:15.375
 The Balloons was one of the first great games we developed, 

00:00:15.417 --> 00:00:16.667
 It is a classic balloons game. 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.042
 It was the first thing everyone said 

00:00:19.083 --> 00:00:21.333
 It is difficult and impossible, not fun for users. 

00:00:21.417 --> 00:00:22.500
 Although we have an audience, 

00:00:22.583 --> 00:00:26.067
 But not asking for comments hurt us a lot. 

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:29.705
 We first have to simplify things and make them clearer, 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.003
 Growth will then become easier. 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.375
 One day, we had the idea of ​​developing a cat and piano game. 

00:00:36.458 --> 00:00:40.167
 Joe thought, "What if you were a cat, 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.417
 Going down and preparing you a small gift? " 

00:00:42.458 --> 00:00:46.857
 We said, "This is a simple idea, and it may work." 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 "KleptoCats" is a virtual pet 

00:00:49.083 --> 00:00:52.078
 You will not need to bear any kind of responsibility. 

00:00:52.125 --> 00:00:55.245
 The game is very easy, where you will find a cat and an empty room. 

00:00:55.292 --> 00:00:57.205
 Just tease her and ask her to leave. 

00:00:57.208 --> 00:00:59.322
 "I'll be back soon," she says. 

00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:01.473
 Then come back with a surprise. 

00:01:01.875 --> 00:01:04.782
 To encourage players to continue playing, 

00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:10.375
 We try to improve the sources of fun and the aspects that make the games interesting. 

00:01:10.458 --> 00:01:12.875
 We believe it at times 

00:01:12.917 --> 00:01:16.177
 When you make a surprise gift for you, the game offers a lot of emotions. 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.375
 It is a kind of gifts offered by Gasha machines, 

00:01:18.417 --> 00:01:21.250
 Where you get a gift you do not know what. 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.417
 We have a very close relationship with users. 

00:01:24.458 --> 00:01:28.000
 We read all their comments, and everything they tell us. 

00:01:28.083 --> 00:01:30.450
 We always take them into consideration. 

00:01:30.458 --> 00:01:32.083
 We launch games on Android first 

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:34.083
 Because it provides us with a platform for experimental use. 

00:01:34.125 --> 00:01:37.205
 KleptoCats 2 is part of the beta platform, 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.708
 Which helped us a lot because fans of the game liked them 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.695
 Participation in that process. 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.443
 Where they feel close to us when developing the game. 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.667
 I remember we are at some point 

00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:50.338
 We argued about any better icons. 

00:01:50.417 --> 00:01:54.125
 We designed a symbol that we liked but did not like very much. 

00:01:54.208 --> 00:01:56.708
 We decided to use the A / B test on the Store ... 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.060
 When we did the tests between the different symbols 

00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:02.195
 We've seen an app download increase of 30%. 

00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:08.502
 We continue to expand our team to help us develop more games. 

00:02:08.583 --> 00:02:10.405
 We plan to introduce "KleptoDogs" which are similar 

00:02:10.405 --> 00:02:12.228
 "KleptoCats" but with the use of dogs. 

00:02:12.292 --> 00:02:15.250
 Our audience asked for it, to see what would happen. 

00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:19.042
 I think the hardest side and the most fun 

00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:22.065
 For developers in Latin America when launching games, 

00:02:22.125 --> 00:02:24.432
 Is the process of launching the game itself. 

00:02:25.083 --> 00:02:26.005
 Continue developing games. 

00:02:26.005 --> 00:02:28.693
 Do not stop developing games and do not take too long. 

00:02:28.693 --> 00:02:30.220
 You do not need to develop an excellent game. 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.865
 You will gradually learn from each and every feedback you receive 

00:02:32.875 --> 00:02:35.250
 Your efforts will ultimately lead you to success.
