00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:10.118
Say two people are walking down the street,

00:00:10.118 --> 00:00:11.662
and they bump into each other.

00:00:11.662 --> 00:00:14.139
They'll just shake it off and walk on.

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.549
Sometimes that happens with molecules too.

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:19.000
They just bounce off each other, and that's that.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.458
But what if two people were to bump into each other,

00:00:21.458 --> 00:00:22.625
and during that collision,

00:00:22.625 --> 00:00:24.380
one person's arm got severed

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.838
and reattached to the other person's face?

00:00:27.838 --> 00:00:29.418
Now that sounds really weird,

00:00:29.418 --> 00:00:31.298
but it's similar to one of the many ways

00:00:31.298 --> 00:00:33.757
that molecules can react with each other.

00:00:34.726 --> 00:00:36.928
Two molecules can join and become one.

00:00:36.928 --> 00:00:39.040
One can split apart and become two.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.871
Molecules can switch parts.

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:43.760
All these changes are chemical reactions,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.964
and we can see them happening around us.

00:00:45.964 --> 00:00:48.140
For example, when fireworks explode,

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.520
or iron rusts,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.211
or milk goes bad,

00:00:50.211 --> 00:00:51.304
or people are born,

00:00:51.304 --> 00:00:52.186
grow old,

00:00:52.186 --> 00:00:52.816
die,

00:00:52.816 --> 00:00:54.139
and then decompose.

00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:57.622
But chemical reactions don't just happen willy nilly!

00:00:57.622 --> 00:00:59.537
Everything has to be right.

00:00:59.537 --> 00:01:01.748
First, the molecules have to hit each other

00:01:01.748 --> 00:01:03.591
in the right orientation.

00:01:03.591 --> 00:01:05.759
And second, they have to hit each other hard enough,

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:07.637
in other words, with enough energy.

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:09.096
Now you're probably thinking

00:01:09.096 --> 00:01:11.818
that a reaction just happens in one direction and that's it.

00:01:12.463 --> 00:01:13.484
Sometimes that's true.

00:01:13.484 --> 00:01:15.845
For example, things can't unburn

00:01:15.845 --> 00:01:17.305
or unexplode.

00:01:17.935 --> 00:01:20.973
But most reactions can happen in both directions,

00:01:20.973 --> 00:01:22.893
forward and reverse.

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:25.340
There's no reason that our face-arm guy

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.071
can't bump into armless girl,

00:01:27.071 --> 00:01:30.371
reattaching that arm back to its original socket.

00:01:30.371 --> 00:01:31.944
Now let's zoom out a bit.

00:01:31.944 --> 00:01:32.830
Now let's say that you've got

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.506
a thousand people on the street,

00:01:34.506 --> 00:01:35.864
and all of them start with their limbs

00:01:35.864 --> 00:01:37.530
normally attached.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.825
At the beginning, every collision is a chance

00:01:39.825 --> 00:01:43.861
for Person A to transfer an arm to Person B's face.

00:01:43.861 --> 00:01:44.841
And so at the beginning,

00:01:44.841 --> 00:01:45.939
more and more people end up

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.963
with arms attached to their faces or arms missing.

00:01:48.963 --> 00:01:51.431
But as the number of people with arm-faces

00:01:51.431 --> 00:01:53.271
and missing arms grows,

00:01:53.271 --> 00:01:56.725
collisions between those people become more likely.

00:01:56.725 --> 00:01:58.586
And when they bump into each other,

00:01:58.586 --> 00:01:59.605
guess what?

00:01:59.605 --> 00:02:02.564
Normal-appendage people are reproduced.

00:02:02.564 --> 00:02:05.531
Now the number of limb transfers per second forward

00:02:05.531 --> 00:02:07.530
will start high and then fall,

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.279
and the number of limb transfers per second backward

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:12.368
will start at zero and then rise.

00:02:12.368 --> 00:02:13.788
Eventually they'll meet,

00:02:13.788 --> 00:02:14.877
they'll be the same.

00:02:14.877 --> 00:02:15.993
And when that happens,

00:02:15.993 --> 00:02:19.247
the number of people in each state stops changing,

00:02:19.247 --> 00:02:21.338
even though people are still bumping into each other

00:02:21.338 --> 00:02:23.051
and exchanging limbs.

00:02:23.603 --> 00:02:25.087
Now how many people do you think

00:02:25.087 --> 00:02:26.724
there are in each state?

00:02:26.724 --> 00:02:27.880
Half and half, right?

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.674
No, well, maybe.

00:02:29.674 --> 00:02:30.768
It depends.

00:02:30.768 --> 00:02:32.138
It could be 50/50,

00:02:32.138 --> 00:02:33.302
but it could be 60/40

00:02:33.302 --> 00:02:34.177
or 15/85,

00:02:34.177 --> 00:02:35.230
or anything.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.672
We chemists have to get our little, gloved hands dirty

00:02:38.672 --> 00:02:41.146
- ah, well, we're in a lab so not really dirty -

00:02:41.146 --> 00:02:43.156
to figure out what the actual distribution

00:02:43.156 --> 00:02:44.901
of molecules is.

00:02:44.901 --> 00:02:46.409
Even though each of limb transfers

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:49.510
is a pretty dramatic event for the people involved,

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:50.443
if we zoom out,

00:02:50.443 --> 00:02:53.003
we see population numbers that don't change.

00:02:53.003 --> 00:02:55.443
We call this nirvana equilibrium,

00:02:55.443 --> 00:02:58.014
and it doesn't just happen with chemical reactions.

00:02:58.568 --> 00:02:59.828
Things like gene pools

00:02:59.828 --> 00:03:02.487
and highway traffic show the same pattern.

00:03:02.487 --> 00:03:04.736
It looks pretty still from 30,000 feet,

00:03:04.736 --> 00:03:06.335
but there is lots of crazy stuff

00:03:06.335 --> 00:03:07.595
happening on the ground,

00:03:07.595 --> 00:03:10.440
you just need to zoom in to see it.
