00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.840
So the answer to this question is the top combination, the G and C. Remember

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.320
that the G and C combinations reduce lactase

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.120
expression into adulthood, without lactase we can't digest

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.240
lactose and so we're going to show symptoms

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.850
of lactose intolerance. So this top scenario will

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.320
give us lactose intolerance whereas the bottom scenario

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.230
allows for maintained expression of lactase into adulthood.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.230
So, we're going to be able to digest lactose

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.760
and we're not going to show symptoms of lactose intolerance.
