FEMALE SPEAKER: Please join me
in welcoming to Google New

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.480
York, Alex Guarnaschelli.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.420
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Thank you.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:06.670
Thank you.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.850
Do you love my homey
that I brought in

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:11.510
the front row texting?

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.210
How are you?

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:14.860
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's right.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.910
We got a lot of people here
that are psyched.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.550
So at Google, passion is huge.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.600
We are passionate people.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.510
We take on passionate
projects.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.610
And I was curious as to how
you turned, and when you

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.590
turned, your passion for food
and cooking into a career.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:33.610
What triggered it?

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.172
What triggered the passion even
before it was a career, I

00:00:36.172 --> 00:00:38.620
should say?

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.410
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Well, I
would say that I'm not a

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.850
terribly organized person, and
that I don't really think

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.960
things happen that clearly.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.590
My mother cooked with
wild abandon.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.330
My mother's a cookbook editor.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.250
And I know we're no longer in
an age where books are the

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.970
most relevant form
of information.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.290
But when I was growing
up they really were.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.700
And my parents are two nerdy
academics that met while they

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.580
were getting their respective
PhDs at Yale.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.680
My dad got his PhD in European
history specializing in

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.660
Napoleonic warfare
and was a TA.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.710
And my mother was getting a
PhD in Russian studies.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.330
You can't make this stuff up.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.150
So my mother conveniently speaks
fluent Russian just in

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.980
case anything goes down.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:36.050
And my father knows more about
Napoleon than Napoleon did.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.620
So they met.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.780
They got married at Yale.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.970
Suffice to say, you can imagine
that books were kind

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.010
of an important thing.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.960
So they got married.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.170
And I grew up in a very
big nine-room

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.220
apartment in midtown.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.370
It's rent-controlled, people.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.500
My dad told me the rent they
pay the other day.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.733
And I just kind of twitched.

00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:02.050
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, god.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.420
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: But
they deserve it.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.410
FEMALE SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.720
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: So my
mother had 1,000 books.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.790
My dad 1,000 books.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.350
You multiply that
by 80, and you

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.630
have my parents' apartment.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.160
So I grew up in a place
where my wallpaper was

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.300
bookshelves and books.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.180
And I think that that has a
profound effect on you or

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.350
consciousness, whether you
realize it or not, when you

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.890
run around the apartment where
you live and there's nothing

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.060
but books and manuscripts.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.580
And my mother's process for
editing a cookbook was to take

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.860
the manuscript and cook every
single recipe in it.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.150
The consequence, or the result,
was in 1980 when she

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.070
started really delving
into cookbooks.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.290
She did a cookbook called
"Classic Indian Cooking."

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.690
So that cookbook came out
30, 32 years ago.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.050
It's still in print.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.160
I mean, what?

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.120
A black-and-white Indian
cookbook with no photographs?

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.480
You can still buy it at
Barnes and Noble.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.890
I go and I look for it.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.610
I'm like, I'm going to Barnes
and Noble just to see if that

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:01.540
book is sitting on the shelf.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.030
I'm not going to buy it.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.660
So we spent a year eating Indian
food, which was very

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.140
confusing because I'm
Italian American.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.030
And my father loves Napoleon
and France.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.590
And my mom was making
all these souffles.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.080
And then all of a sudden we were
eating lentils and dals

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.260
and spices and all this stuff.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.240
And my father doesn't really
care for Indian food because

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.580
it doesn't have any butter
or eggs, so to speak.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.030
So he called it the
mowed lawn phase.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.160
He said that everything tasted
like a freshly mowed lawn.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.990
Which I really disagree with.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.970
FEMALE SPEAKER: I disagree.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.450
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: So that
was an interesting year.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.600
And then the year after that,
she did a book called "The

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.590
Splendid Table," by Lynne
Rossetto Kasper, which was the

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.780
food of Emilia-Romagna.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.550
So for a year, we went from
lentils and dals to balsamic

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.480
vinegar and parmigiano
reggiano ad nauseum.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.250
My father said, if I see another
drop of balsamic

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.640
vinegar in this house,
I'm leaving.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.950
She then did a book called
"The Cake Bible,"

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.980
by Rose Levy Beranbaum.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.670
So that was not good because
that was really an elastic

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:06.920
waist year.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.450
And the thing about my mother
is all the while there was

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.209
this other pulsating
undercurrent of reading and

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.079
cooking from issues of "Gourmet"
magazine that she

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.920
had bound into binders.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.350
I think my mother has 30 years
of "Gourmet" bound in books.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.930
So she would make a cake from
Rosy Levy Beranbaum's "Cake

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.710
Bible," and then make a pie from
a 1974 November issue of

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.910
"Gourmet" magazine and say,
do you feel that this cake

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.930
relates to this pie at all?

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.740
How do you think pie
has changed?

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:43.990
I'm 13.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.200
This was just really practice
for "Chopped." I mean, it's

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.240
funny, I know.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.960
But it's also insanely true.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.350
The fork was in the air.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.172
And my mom would say,
how does it taste?

00:05:03.172 --> 00:05:05.800
So there was never just a moment
of eating that was just

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.880
sort of like--

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.530
and let's get this
out of the way.

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.150
I love Doritos.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.980
I love Oreos.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.750
And I love Fruit Loops.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.990
I also really love ice cold skim
milk, Fruity Pebbles, and

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.500
a scoop of Haagen-Daz chocolate
chocolate chip in

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.930
the middle of it.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.440
So let's get the junk
food out of the way.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.880
I like junk food.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.390
And I'm cool with that.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.640
So there was just this constant
interview process.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.120
So she cooked from all
these manuscripts.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.440
And guess what happens when you
are an editor and you go

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.690
through a book and you cook
everything in it and you edit

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:38.580
it that way?

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.160
You wind up with a great book
because it's been sort of

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.620
lived through the
editor's eyes.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.790
And the net result is that my
mother has been behind many

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.070
iconic cookbooks, including the
1997 revision of "The Joy

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.300
of Cooking," which my
mother took on.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.440
And that, she spent three
years doing, sleepless.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.160
I was working at Restaurant
Daniel at the time.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.270
And he used to serve lunch.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.500
So I would get up at 4:00 and
go to the restaurant to be

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.100
there by 4:30, 5 o'clock.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.440
I'll talk about what
I ate when I worked

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.930
at Daniel in a minute.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.620
So I would get up and she would
be still up, with her

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.920
glasses off, you know, this
close to the manuscript.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.130
And I'd say, what's up?

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:28.190
And she'd say, does this look
like a Malpeque oyster or not?

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.590
And she'd showed me a drawing
of an oyster.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.830
So we'd go back to that moment
with the pie, the cake, the

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:32.990
comparisons.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.860
There was never a moment
where it wasn't a quiz.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.030
And I said, you know,
it looks a little

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:37.860
round around the edges.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.375
It looks a little Blue
Point, if you ask me.

00:06:39.375 --> 00:06:40.625
What?

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.110
The next day, mom,
how are you?

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.320
Does this look like
a Belgian waffle?

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.190
Three years of that.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.590
The result is that that book
also has really endured, that

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.220
particular edition of "The Joy
of Cooking." So needless to

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.550
say, I spent a childhood steeped
in food in a very

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:59.750
peculiar way.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:04.040
The net result is I never once
thought about becoming a chef.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.630
I never once thought
about being

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.450
passionate about cooking.

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:11.870
And it never gave me any inkling
or idea about what I

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.080
wanted to do with my life.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.050
And I hope that that's
OK with you guys.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.620
Because I think a lot of people
come to me and they

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.870
say, I'm passionate.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.840
And I say, cool.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.430
I might not be today.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.760
I know this is this big moment
where there's a payoff for you

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.020
as an audience, where I say to
you all this stuff happened,

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.520
and, oh my god, I
became a chef.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.460
And unicorns flew out
of the refrigerator.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.600
And there were rainbows
and star decals.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.580
And I got a gold medal
and whatever.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.880
No, actually, zero
of that happened.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:50.360
When I went to college, I ate
a lot of Rice-A-Roni.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.450
Good stuff, by the way.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:52.500
Don't tell anybody.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.200
FEMALE SPEAKER: You know
this is Google.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.660
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Go to
Google and tell secrets.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.450
Good idea.

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:00.530
So I made a lot of cakes.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:02.520
It was, like, dude, so-and-so's
birthday, can you

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.120
make a cake?

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.310
And I just liked doing it.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:04.950
I just did it.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:09.330
I made these pans of lasagna
with shoplifted pieces of

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.130
mozzarella.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:13.230
That stuff's expensive.

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:16.080
And I just cooked a lot, but in
that kind of random college

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.150
way like, dude, I made
some ramen and I put

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:18.810
a bay leaf in it.

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:20.060
It's good.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:27.550
So, again, I get back to this
idea that I was steeped in

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:29.440
food the whole time, and
I'm disorganized.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.680
And I didn't make
the connection.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.330
But when I woke up on graduation
day, I thought I'm

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.100
going to decide by the end of
the day what I'm going to do

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.169
with the rest of my life
and that's it.

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:39.610
So I promptly drank a beer.

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.600
Because if you're going to
have a day like that, you

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.770
should probably have
a beer at 9 AM.

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:46.300
I had a couple.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.140
They were cold.

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.240
There were good.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.610
That cheap beer, you know that
crappy beer that doesn't

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:52.860
really have a label?

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.560
So I graduated from college, and
I started working in the

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.090
kitchen for free to kind of
explore this idea about

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:04.080
whether I wanted to spend the
money on getting a degree in

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.760
cooking and whatever else.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.930
And I never looked back.

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:11.860
The disorder, the chaos, the
anarchy, the peril, the

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.740
danger, the abuse, the
lack of skill--

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:19.240
all those things were just too
compelling to turn down.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.460
FEMALE SPEAKER: So it wasn't
so much passion.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:24.550
It was just, sounds
like, destiny.

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:30.280
Did you have another thought of,
you know, maybe I will be

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.730
a Spanish teacher.

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.830
I mean, you have Napoleon.

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:35.570
You've got someone who's
fluent in Russian.

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:36.770
You're eating Indian food.

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:40.430
Why not just go a completely
different route?

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:43.280
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: No,
this has been my

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.190
dilemma with myself.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:47.630
I question whether you actually
can connect with your

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:50.660
passion until you do something
so many times that you

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:52.150
actually become really
good at it.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.180
And that, in fact, is when you
actually can say you're

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.010
passionate.

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:57.290
I think Roger Federer is
probably super passionate

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:59.270
about tennis.

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:00.850
You notice that?

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.140
I'll bet you Al Pacino
is really

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.140
passionate about acting.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:09.810
I think it takes a long time
to get good at something.

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:12.350
And depending on your inner
struggle, I think it can take

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:17.060
you even longer to think that
you're good at something.

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.370
I'm still getting there
myself, without

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:22.820
joke, a lot of therapy.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:26.680
23 years of cooking and starting
to feel like I'm kind

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:31.200
of getting the hang of
this cooking thing.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.250
But I question.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:32.530
FEMALE SPEAKER: I think so.

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:34.220
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
I think it's OK--

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.600
FEMALE SPEAKER: I think
everybody here would agree

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.260
that you've got the
hang of cooking.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:38.560
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: No, no.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.810
That's sweet.

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.610
I think it's OK to not be sure
if you're passionate, or be

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:48.680
confused and decide later.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.650
But then you can get drunk at
a cocktail party and tell

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:51.355
everybody you're passionate.

00:10:51.355 --> 00:10:52.010
It's cool.

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:52.750
Like, get it out.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.240
Work it out.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.650
Get on that emotional
treadmill.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:56.250
Let it out.

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:57.110
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's kind of
when the passion comes out,

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:58.160
after a couple cocktails.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.900
And you're like, I just love
ramen with bay leaves.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:01.880
It is the best food.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.500
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: I mean, for
me, I call my fourth-grade

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.275
boyfriend and say,
I loved you.

00:11:05.275 --> 00:11:05.890
I did.

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:06.810
I really loved you.

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:10.120
And his wife is like, he has
to get off the phone now.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.190
FEMALE SPEAKER: I think we're
going to have to bring her

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:14.640
back for a whole different
interview about that.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.690
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: And
I'm censoring as I go.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:18.770
FEMALE SPEAKER: Maybe we should
have had you drink a

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:19.820
beer before you got up here.

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.040
I didn't think about that.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:21.300
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: No, no.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.420
Those days are over,
believe me.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:24.980
FEMALE SPEAKER: So, the book.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.230
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Yeah.

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:28.330
FEMALE SPEAKER: First question,
did your mom help

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:29.380
you edit this?

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:34.420
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
No, not at all.

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.480
She only saw the book after I
turned in the final revision

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.630
to my editor.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:41.070
I left on the coffee table.

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:41.730
What do we call it?

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:43.040
A dummy, a dummy.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.500
So the manuscript, loose.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.440
But color photographs,
assembled the way

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.280
it's going to look.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.800
So, in essence, it just
needs to be folded and

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.160
bound at that point.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.240
And I left it on the
coffee table.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.190
And I came home and my mom was
sitting there like a cat on a

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.745
windowsill like when you've been
gone for three days and

00:11:59.745 --> 00:12:01.210
you didn't leave any food.

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:04.040
That where have you
been bitch look?

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.420
My mother gave me that
look and she

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:08.140
said, I read your book.

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.070
I said, you did?

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:11.810
I left it.

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:13.000
I cleaned the whole room
out and put the

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.734
manuscript on the table.

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:18.160
I was like, you found it.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.520
And she said, I really
love it.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.490
You're a real writer.

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:23.160
So that was really cool.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.380
And then she was like,
it better sell or I'm

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:27.150
going to freak out.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:30.760
FEMALE SPEAKER: So passion or no
passion, you have a career

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:31.870
that is larger than life--

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:36.520
Iron Chef, TV celebrity chef,
world renowned executive chef.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.330
Why did you decide to write
a cookbook now?

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.030
And what was your inspiration?

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:43.190
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: You wouldn't
write a cookbook--

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:44.720
I mean, you wouldn't direct
a movie if Steven

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.440
Spielberg was your dad.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.310
So it took a long time.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:52.030
But I thought, you know, that
I had all these experiences.

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:55.970
Interspersed throughout the book
are page stories that are

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:59.680
just little isolated moments,
most of them pretty hideous.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.880
But some of them, I think, if
you're not a chef, but you've

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.540
had-- everybody works
in a community,

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:06.880
in a group of people.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.610
Everybody fears failure.

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:10.550
Everybody has moments
of vulnerability.

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:12.940
And I think that that's
universal.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:17.410
And those stories that I put
peppered throughout the book

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:20.210
are those kind of moments
the way I live them.

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:22.140
You know, you live them
with a laptop or

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:23.400
with a search engine.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.110
And I live them with onions.

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:26.840
There isn't really
any difference.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.650
I think we come up
against the same

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:31.100
kind of internal dialogue.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.270
And I thought that I would write
about that and then in

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:36.810
the interim give a lot of
recipes that are the

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:39.250
culmination of a lot of things
I learned working in

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:41.710
restaurants and recipes I
developed that just always

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:44.410
work mixed with the stuff
that I really actually

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:45.925
like to cook at home.

00:13:45.925 --> 00:13:48.340
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's the
question, so why did this book

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.160
focus more on the old-school
comfort food?

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.680
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Yeah, I
didn't want to write a chef-y

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.700
cookbook with dehydrated
ham chips.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:54.980
It's just not my style.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:58.360
I mean, I can make
stuff like that.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:02.880
But I thought that I go to
a cookbook and I open it.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.890
And I'll buy anything
anywhere.

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:06.290
I don't care.

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:08.910
I mean to say, I'll go to the
other end of the earth to buy

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.980
an eye of newt to make
something specific.

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:15.155
But I'm attracted to and drawn
to cookbooks where I open it

00:14:15.155 --> 00:14:17.640
and I say, I can make a couple
of these recipes from what I

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:18.950
already have at home.

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:21.220
And I really wanted the book
to have that feeling.

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:22.280
I think it's part of
being old-school.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.620
It's like you're all
in a little ghetto.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:28.880
You've got that knife you won
because you were the ninth

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.620
customer at a gas
station one day.

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:31.460
And you really like it.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.450
And you have these fancy knives
you got for Christmas

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:37.570
two years ago, but you like
that crappy knife.

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:41.420
You have a jar of oregano that
your parents brought you back

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:43.890
from a cruise of Capri
six years ago.

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:48.200
And you're wondering if the
oregano's still good.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.350
You wonder about the expiration
date of the baking

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:51.920
powder in your cabinet
that you've used

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.170
twice in eight years.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.130
I live the same way.

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:57.950
I think we all do.

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:02.650
And I wanted the book to make
you feel like you could live

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:05.257
in that kind of context with
yourself and be imperfect and

00:15:05.257 --> 00:15:08.420
be human and cook, and make
some stuff that you like.

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.370
Or just read it and not make a
thing, and tell everybody that

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:14.480
you made every recipe
in the book.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.500
You could do that, too.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.400
FEMALE SPEAKER: I may.

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:21.520
I love that you focus on old
school, but what is your

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.970
definition of old school?

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:24.320
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: I'm
glad you asked that.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.040
For me, I looked
up old school.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:27.990
Because I like the term.

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:29.240
I'm like, dude, that's
so old school.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.380
And I'm thinking, what the
hell is old school?

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:34.140
Well, I discovered that old
school for me is anything that

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:35.580
I really like, period.

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:37.190
That's actually my
own definition.

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:38.700
I'm like, dude, that's
old school.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.910
That shoelace is old school.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:42.120
It doesn't matter what it is.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:49.630
But I read that it is a moment
where you realize something in

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:55.750
its original form serves as an
inspiration for you to explore

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:56.680
new things.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.290
So I like the idea that you
could define old school by

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:03.170
saying, like, that's
the OG idea.

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:07.160
And then you can do all this
stuff, because it smacks of

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.930
that original feeling.

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:11.980
And I think food is
so about feeling.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:13.010
It's about the weather.

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:17.020
It's about whether you
had a crappy morning.

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:21.460
It's about what you like to
eat, what you find, what

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:22.570
resonates with you.

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:26.000
I mean, I'm sure you all have
some food that you have, you

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.270
know, that no one but you
needs to understand.

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:30.970
And you eat it.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:33.250
Probably have many.

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:36.720
And that, really, by the way,
also connects to culture.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.010
How you grow up, what kinds of

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:39.120
ingredients you grew up eating.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:43.010
Those are the tastes that
are familiar to you.

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:44.940
And, again, I go back
to my childhood.

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:46.440
It was very confusing.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.510
I have two Italian
American parents.

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:51.290
My father's family's
from Naples.

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:55.070
And my mother's family
is from Sicily.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:58.180
But my father cooked Chinese
food for a hobby.

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:01.160
So we had this whole cabinet
of soy sauces.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:05.770
I mean, 80 kinds of soy sauce
and vinegar and corn starch

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:09.140
and rice flour and woks.

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.069
And then my mom was over
here baking cakes and

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:12.290
making Indian food.

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:15.569
I don't know what the food
of my childhood.

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:20.089
I don't know how you would
define it, like disaster.

00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:24.190
But the net result was I felt
that old-school comfort food,

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:26.560
it was sort of my way of saying
these are the things

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.530
that resonate with me.

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:31.050
And I tried not to make
it too hodgepodge.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:35.860
I mean, to have a souffle with
kimchi is sort of like, OK,

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:37.490
who are you?

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:38.770
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's actually
another question I

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:40.540
had, is that the recipes are

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:41.790
diverse, but they're connected.

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:45.260
And I'm just curious about how
you approached putting

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.030
together, curating
if you will, this

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:48.610
collection of recipes.

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:49.410
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Yeah,
my mother cooked a

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:50.320
lot of French food.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.800
She cooked from all of Julia
Child's books, and Craig

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.910
Claiborne, and Dione Lucas,
and James Beard.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:59.650
To just such a point where we
would sit down and my mom

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:03.514
would say, Julia says this
tastes like this.

00:18:03.514 --> 00:18:08.115
And I'm like, mom, the padded
van is always parked outside

00:18:08.115 --> 00:18:09.580
if things get bad.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:12.610
But she lived and
breathed these--

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:15.190
I'll call them characters
because I think that their

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:21.040
recipes in their books sort of
added powder and made you feel

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:25.010
as if there was an actual person
or form that took shape

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:25.960
in your own kitchen.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.930
So she lived with these
characters.

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:34.340
And the food that I ate, I'd
have to say, was fundamentally

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.030
French in technique
and in style.

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:38.670
And I think that's why I ended
up going to France.

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:42.810
Because I felt that that was
where I thought I could really

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:45.360
learn how to cook, or build the

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.890
building blocks of cooking.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:50.450
So the food here is actually
closet French.

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:54.720
And then I hang American
things on it.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.990
It's a French tree with
American ornaments.

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:00.380
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's
kind of awesome.

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:05.930
So in the book, there's
a line that I loved.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:07.830
It says you do not need a
well-stocked kitchen.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.590
Whatever equipment you gravitate
towards is what you

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:12.320
should have.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.080
I loved that.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.680
Because people are like, you
need this and this and this.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.460
Or maybe it's just me being
like, oh, I want

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:18.440
this, and I want this.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.230
And, oh, I should
have everything.

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:21.930
But I love that it's like,
no, it's whatever

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:23.260
you gravitate towards.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.360
For me, I guess it's
everything.

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.030
But I'm curious, what do
you gravitate towards?

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:33.740
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: My kitchen's
so embarrassing.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.830
I don't have a nice
kitchen at home.

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:37.410
And I kind of like that.

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:38.940
It kind of takes the
pressure off.

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.980
I know this is where you think
I say I have a Viking and a

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.360
Sub-Zero and all this
other stuff.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.330
And I actually don't.

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:50.750
I have like a GE 1960s
thing, ovens.

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:52.880
My mother had the same one
when I was growing up.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.840
So I think there's that.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.940
But what do I gravitate
towards?

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:02.400
I probably have 200 or
300 knives at home

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.240
in boxes and drawers.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:08.770
I mean, you've got to figure
that's normal, right?

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:12.260
I mean, it feels normal to me.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:13.980
I'd been given many knives.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.880
I've been sent many knives.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.540
I've bought many knives.

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.000
I've bought knives of people
that I've admired thinking

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.206
that if I had their knife,
I would be like we them.

00:20:23.206 --> 00:20:24.780
Do you ever do that?

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:28.260
Like, if you put on a Superman
costume, you are Superman?

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:32.100
Not if you get it at the Duane
Reade, probably not.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:33.440
So I have a lot of knives.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:36.130
And I like knives.

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:38.970
But the ones I like are probably
the ones I recommend,

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:41.640
the Sabatier, which
is like $6.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:46.000
That paring knife, honestly,
when I compete in kitchen

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.030
stadium on Iron Chef, I take
two of those with me.

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:51.550
And I have one on either side.

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.040
Because when you're nervous,
you know, you--

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.620
it's like when you're
searching for

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:55.870
a pen at your desk.

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:00.455
If you have an important call,
I mean, I'm the type I'll put

00:21:00.455 --> 00:21:01.860
pens all over my desk.

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.820
So that I'm like, uh-huh, I know
I can grab anywhere and

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:05.690
there's a pen.

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:07.420
This knife is like my Woobee.

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.830
It's like the lioness,
like the blanket.

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:12.220
So I have at least two of
those at all times.

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:16.400
I like a microplane
grater a lot.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.230
I think you can microplane
anything--

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:21.590
not human beings, but
other things.

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:23.250
I think a Vita-Prep blender.

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:24.030
It's expensive.

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:26.940
It's the one indulgence
I believe in.

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:29.250
And then just that weird
accumulation.

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:31.560
I like All-Clad pans a lot--

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.530
not the fancy ones with the
copper this, that, the other--

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:36.250
just that straight-up
stainless steel.

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:39.960
And I like a cast
iron skillet.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:43.750
That's probably all I really
need to function.

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:44.810
But, boy, do I have--

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:46.565
I mean, I have a sea
urchin cutter.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:52.440
I have a quail egg crimper.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.000
I mean, I have boxes of stuff.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.396
And I open it up, and I'm
like what, like, really?

00:21:58.396 --> 00:22:00.870
I have eight different
cheese wires.

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:03.670
What's wrong with me?

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:09.010
But I in my actual kitchen, I
try to keep it to a dull roar.

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:11.200
FEMALE SPEAKER: I can only
imagine what kind of roars

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.460
come out of that kitchen.

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:17.850
So writing this cookbook, I
always like to ask-- maybe not

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:19.660
passion, but discovery--

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.480
so what was your favorite
discovery?

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:27.240
Or a strong moment you had
during the writing this book,

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.670
the creation of this book?

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:29.180
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: I didn't.

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:30.890
I don't think I had any.

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:31.460
FEMALE SPEAKER: You
just went for it?

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.980
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: It's
embarrassing, but honest.

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:37.190
I think I had had so many
moments of discovery, and I

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:39.960
had collected them all, that
the book was almost like a

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:42.520
scrap book of photographs that
had already been taken.

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.800
And it was actually very easy
for me to put together.

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:48.040
And I know this is the part
where I say I sweat and cried

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.230
and I listened to Adele.

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:50.960
And I drank bourbon
for five years.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.200
And here is this book,
this baby.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.440
But it really wasn't
like that.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:57.430
I think I had been writing
this book for probably a

00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:01.240
decade or two, and just really
needed to have the courage and

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:03.850
the confidence in thinking that
someone would like to

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:08.400
hear about it or share it with
me by binding it into a book.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:12.620
FEMALE SPEAKER: Did you have any
books that you read while

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.235
you were writing yours?

00:23:14.235 --> 00:23:14.755
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: So many.

00:23:14.755 --> 00:23:16.820
How much time you got?

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:18.510
There's a book called "The
Gourmet Cooking School

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:20.120
Cookbook" by Dione Lucas.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:24.260
That's a woman, a chef, and food
writer we don't really

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:25.430
talk about a lot.

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:28.550
The book, I think,
is from 1965.

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:33.230
That book, I sleep with it under
my pillow just in case I

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:34.740
forget anything.

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.970
I like "The Zuni Cafe Cookbook"
by Judy Rodgers.

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:40.280
That really speaks to me.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:43.540
I like "Sunday Suppers at
Lucques." That's Suzanne Goin.

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.660
FEMALE SPEAKER: Interesting.

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:48.020
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: There's a
Morimoto book-- and I think

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.860
it's just "Morimoto"--

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:50.710
that's awesome.

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:52.140
And there's all these
pictures.

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:57.120
And he sandwiches, pieces of
fish in between kombu, which

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:00.980
is a seaweed that actually has
like a sort of unappealing

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:02.940
white film on it that
is actually a

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:04.700
natural form of MSG.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:09.360
And he vinegars the seaweed to
kind of moisten and activate,

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.620
and then puts the fish and
sandwiches it, and then let's

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:12.890
it sit for an hour or so.

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:15.630
And when you take it out, it's
sort of been salted and

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:17.550
marinated with the seaweed.

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:18.680
Come on, how cool is that?

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.880
Are you kidding me?

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.350
Who's going to think of that?

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:24.290
And, again, I get back to this
idea that Julia Child's not

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:24.970
going to do that.

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:28.560
She's going to do
something else.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.870
So I like culture.

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:32.220
I think it's kind of cool.

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:32.760
Seaweed?

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:33.710
I mean, really?

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:37.050
So when I go to the beach and,
like, seaweed washes on my

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:41.025
toe, I'm like, you,
old friend.

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:46.300
FEMALE SPEAKER: For us amateur
cooks in the room, is there,

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.790
like, one cookbook that
you would say buy

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:50.200
this, beside yours?

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.260
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: FEMALE
SPEAKER: Oh, yeah, no.

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:54.490
Honestly, I know I'm biased
because my mother edited it,

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:57.210
but if I was freaking out and
really wanted a book to kind

00:24:57.210 --> 00:25:02.090
of have and feel like I got a
lot in it, first of all, "The

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:03.330
Joy of Cooking" any edition.

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:07.030
But the 1997 one, it really
goes through--

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:08.450
I mean, I go to that
book constantly.

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:12.080
When I'm stuck, I say, what
kind of sauce can I make?

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.670
And I flip through the
sauce section.

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:15.800
I just flip and scan
the pages.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.575
Or the poultry section.

00:25:17.575 --> 00:25:20.410
Or I want to remember one little
nuance about a type of

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:22.500
fish, I use it.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.810
It's a reference book with
recipes that work.

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:27.950
And that's pretty critical.

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:29.420
So that would probably
my guess.

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:31.330
I also really like "The Fannie
Farmer Cookbook,"

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:33.620
may she rest in peace.

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:35.920
But Marion Cunningham's "Fanny
Farmer Cookbook"--

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:36.320
awesome.

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.590
First cookbook I ever
really cooked from.

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:40.590
My parents are very
late sleepers.

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:42.260
And I'm an only child.

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:44.808
So I was starving.

00:25:44.808 --> 00:25:47.290
And I would flip through
the cookbooks.

00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:49.630
And she had these recipes
for corn bread and

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:50.560
coffee cake and stuff.

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:51.750
And there was a few
ingredients.

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:53.180
And I thought, I can do this.

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:58.760
So I would get up and bake,
and just eat a lot.

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:03.090
But, again, it has nothing to
do with becoming a chef.

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:06.150
It was kind of kooky.

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:08.270
Spend your life steeped in
something and don't realize

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:08.730
you want to do it.

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:11.020
I wanted to be a marine
biologist.

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:12.760
FEMALE SPEAKER: That actually
doesn't surprise me, again,

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.650
given the range that
you came from.

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:16.740
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Yeah, but
instead of researching and

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:19.272
tagging fish, I caught
them and cooked them.

00:26:19.272 --> 00:26:21.680
FEMALE SPEAKER: So you are like
a marine biologist in

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.390
some sort of ways.

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:24.120
I mean, you have a sea
urchin cutter.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.760
It's got to count
for something.

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.260
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: I feel that
I'm going to land in the

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:29.980
gates of hell, and there's going
to be lobsters strewn

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.160
everywhere on lawn chairs,
like, she's here.

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:38.680
Chef anxiety dream
right there.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.270
A little peek into
my crock pot.

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:44.140
FEMALE SPEAKER: I see that as
a Google Doodle right there.

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:48.940
So shifting a bit into
kind of technology--

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.810
in this digital age, how do you
see technology changing

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:53.970
the way you cook and how
you approach food?

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:55.580
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: It doesn't
do much for me.

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.920
I use Google, specifically.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:04.180
FEMALE SPEAKER: Good.

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:05.360
We're happy to hear that.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.420
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: When I am
thinking about a topic, I

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:08.610
first Google something.

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:09.320
And I scan.

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:15.220
And I find the images organized
in the ingredient or

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.380
the specific thing I'm honing
in on very helpful.

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:20.950
They're the easiest,
most fluid jumping

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:22.950
off point for me.

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:24.200
But then I go to my books.

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:30.240
I'm a little bit traditional
like that.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.785
I say, oh yeah.

00:27:31.785 --> 00:27:33.430
You know, somebody says
let's make a menu

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:34.690
inspired by the 1960s.

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:38.770
So I'll Google 1960s recipes,
1960s supper

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:39.720
clubs, dinner menus.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.050
And I'll look through.

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:43.090
And then I'll say, I remember
this and that.

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:46.710
And that provides sort
of my coat rack.

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:49.590
And then the hangers hanging
on it are the books and the

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:52.350
recipes that pertain
to that topic.

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:56.970
So I guess I do use technology
to kind of focus my thinking.

00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:59.230
But I happen to really
love cookbooks.

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:00.470
I have a very large
collection.

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:04.190
So I think I don't move away
from that as my bedrock

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:07.202
because I am passionate
about it.

00:28:07.202 --> 00:28:09.260
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hey,
there it is.

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:10.830
But what about restaurants?

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:13.370
So social media and
the increase

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:14.440
in user-based reviews.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.960
How has that changed the dining
experience in your

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:17.400
restaurants?

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.340
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: I don't
care about that.

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:19.550
FEMALE SPEAKER: Really?

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:22.140
It doesn't bother you if you
walk into a restaurant and

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.350
you've got 50 people with
their phones out taking

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:26.240
photographs of food?

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:26.500
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: No.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:27.180
It's a free country.

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.180
FEMALE SPEAKER: What
about comments?

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:30.190
User-based comments?

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:32.000
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: No.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.050
I mean, I think it all comes
out in the wash.

00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:38.990
I think if people are going to
go somewhere, it's because

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.780
they have a feeling.

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.530
Or there's something that's
making them go to that place,

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:44.840
gravitate towards that,
or be curious.

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:48.350
I think sites like Yelp and
other stuff, I think they can

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:48.930
be harmful.

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:51.300
I think they can be helpful.

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:52.570
What am I going to do?

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:56.590
I mean, if I really got into the
topic the way I've gotten

00:28:56.590 --> 00:29:00.310
into the topic of cooking with
my personality type, I

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:01.090
wouldn't be here right now.

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:03.860
I'd be home obsessing about
Yelp, Citysearch,

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:05.670
this, that, the other.

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:07.690
I think people are going
to feel what

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:09.780
they're going to feel.

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:12.460
I think it's a shame when I see
a review and it seems like

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:15.700
someone had a bad experience for
whatever set of reasons.

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:18.340
And the restaurant takes
the heat for it.

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:20.360
I think sometimes people
legitimately have terrible

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.760
experiences in restaurants.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.290
And they write about it.

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:25.790
That's everyone's right.

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:28.880
What can I do?

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.750
I don't care if people
take pictures.

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:33.220
When they don't come, and they
don't eat the food, and they

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:34.710
don't pay take pictures?

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:36.210
That's when I'll worry.

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:37.900
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's
very true.

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:39.540
I think you should share that
with a lot of other

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:39.710
restaurants.

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:41.640
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: By the way,
you know, I mean, being

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.630
on TV and on "Chopped" and
stuff, I've gotten some real

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:45.510
doozy emails.

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:47.610
I've gotten hate mail.

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:50.060
And so I called my dad
when I got my first

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:52.280
piece of hate mail.

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.180
Do you want me to tell
you what it said?

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:55.060
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.130
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: It's
got a profanity.

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:57.090
Is that OK?

00:29:57.090 --> 00:29:58.220
FEMALE SPEAKER: I
think that's OK.

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:00.710
We'll edit it out.

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:01.750
Famous last words.

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:02.620
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: There
was like serious

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:03.440
thumbs up over there.

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:04.510
FEMALE SPEAKER: There were
serious thumbs up?

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:05.970
OK, then I'm not taking
the heat for this.

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:07.480
Go for it, and they'll
edit it out.

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.020
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: No,
it's not that bad.

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.830
But it just said, fuck
you, you bitch.

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:14.810
Let's see you make a
dish in 15 minutes.

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:15.640
So I woke up.

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.930
And it was like 6:00 AM.

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:18.010
And I'm bleary-eyed.

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:18.870
You know, one-eye open.

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:19.690
I go to the bathroom.

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:20.490
I take my phone.

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:21.946
And there's that.

00:30:21.946 --> 00:30:24.092
FEMALE SPEAKER: That is
not a good morning.

00:30:24.092 --> 00:30:24.970
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
I called my dad.

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:26.070
I was like, everybody
hates me.

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:27.020
I'm not doing this anymore.

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:27.640
I cant believe it.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:28.090
Oh, my god.

00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:30.130
I've spiraled into
a world of hate.

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:30.600
I don't know what.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.470
I'm going to move somewhere
and hide in a bunker.

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:35.290
And my dad said,
congratulations.

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:38.430
You're starting to matter.

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:39.120
FEMALE SPEAKER: Very true.

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:41.470
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: And
I was like, really?

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:43.090
So I don't know.

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:46.880
I kind of think that emotion
on the internet and with

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:49.600
technology can be complicated
and layered.

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.160
I've gotten four-page
handwritten letters.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.380
These are the reasons my husband
and I hate you and

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:55.460
hate to watch you.

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:56.110
Four pages.

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:57.360
I'm like, you guys
are watching.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:02.510
You wrote me a four-page
letter.

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:03.810
They're like, we don't
like your shirt.

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:04.910
We don't like the
way you look.

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:06.120
We don't like your nose.

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:07.450
What's wrong with your hair?

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:08.140
Who are you?

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:09.510
What do you know?

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:12.620
I'm like, damn, this thing
is like 10 pages.

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:15.381
I'm like, you like me.

00:31:15.381 --> 00:31:16.720
You know what I mean?

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:17.810
You've got to do that.

00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:20.520
You've got to make lemonade
out of the lemons.

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:21.950
I read the social media.

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:22.890
I read the reviews.

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:24.550
And sometimes I say, well,
you know what?

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:26.050
That's true.

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:28.060
I got to go check on that.

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:30.360
Someone wrote, like, you need
to vacuum the rug in your

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:31.910
entrance way.

00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:33.230
And I was like, that's
not true.

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:34.010
And I went down to
the restaurant,

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:35.660
and it was like gross.

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:36.660
I'm like, dude, what's up?

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:37.440
I'm vacuuming the rug.

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:41.170
I'm like, oh my god,
Yelp is right!

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:44.280
So, I learn sometimes.

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:46.230
There's a lot of truth
in what people write.

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:46.650
FEMALE SPEAKER: Sharing
of information.

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:48.260
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: And then
sometimes there isn't.

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:50.600
And, OK.

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:51.400
FEMALE SPEAKER: Very
interesting.

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:55.090
So speaking of "Chopped"
and other things.

00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:58.250
So you run two serious
kitchens in New York.

00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:01.240
And you are also a TV
food personality.

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.230
Have to know, is there anything
behind the scenes on

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:06.630
your shows that would
surprise people or

00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:07.880
that we wouldn't expect?

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:11.230
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
I don't know.

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:14.570
I guess my first instinct is to
say something very simple,

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:17.490
which is that all that
stuff is real.

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:19.990
I think that's why we watch it
and it resonates with us.

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:22.220
You know, people say, do they
know the ingredients before

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:23.320
they open the basket?

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:24.250
Are they briefed?

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:25.080
Are they--

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.770
the answer is absolutely not.

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:28.740
They open the basket.

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:29.500
They pull it out.

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:30.750
They sit there for
two seconds.

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:32.910
And Ted says, your
time starts now.

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:35.920
One time we had to delay for a
minute after they opened the

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.360
basket because there was
of a lighting issue.

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:39.790
They changed the basket.

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:42.280
And they gave them
a new basket.

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:43.250
It was like five minutes.

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:45.410
They changed the basket.

00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:47.530
So that's why the show is--

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:49.960
why it resonates with you.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:51.280
It's because they
open the basket.

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:52.120
They get the ingredients.

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:52.810
And that's it.

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:56.560
And what comes out of you is
just that primal first thought

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:57.190
that you have.

00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:59.700
You know, I call it like your
little chef planet that you go

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:01.750
to in your brain where you have
like six or eight things

00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:04.210
that you actually truly really
know how to make.

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:05.720
And you've got to live
in there, no

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:06.820
matter how hard it is.

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:09.010
Everybody has a couple
dishes they can make.

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:10.770
It may be an egg.

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:12.810
It may be toast.

00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:15.030
But you have those six or seven
things that if I give

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:16.890
you a "Chopped" basket,
you would go

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:19.180
to that little planet.

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:21.210
And I have one too,
by the way.

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:25.380
And it's never been enough
for my liking.

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:29.770
When I did "Next Iron Chef", I
mean, my chef planet was like,

00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:32.620
you have, what's the Dr. Seuss?

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:33.450
The Lorax?

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:35.830
You know, when they pick all the
truffle out of trees and

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:37.110
there's no trees left?

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:38.795
Like, I had no truffle
[INAUDIBLE]

00:33:38.795 --> 00:33:40.060
trees left on the island.

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.790
I was like, god, I
need more stuff.

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:48.730
And you can't mine for
gold all the time.

00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:50.450
So it's really real.

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:52.560
And it's so hard.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:55.660
People sit home and they're
like, this is so stupid.

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:56.660
Why are they making that?

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:57.600
I know what I would make.

00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.600
I would make this or that.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:02.580
When you're in the context,
you're literally thinking, why

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:03.130
am I doing this?

00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:05.074
It's like when you go on a
roller coaster and it clicks,

00:34:05.074 --> 00:34:07.930
clicks, clicks, clicks, clicks
up, and if it's about to drop.

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:10.639
And you're like, why
am I doing this?

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:12.040
Why?

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:16.760
And then you finish and you
go, I feel invigorated.

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:19.360
I feel like I've come to life.

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:24.710
People come to life on
"Chopped." It's like an

00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:26.199
out-of-body experience
for people.

00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:27.610
People are like, I want
to do this again.

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:29.320
And I'm looking at them like,
you just got chopped.

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:33.420
People say we want to
come back tomorrow.

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:36.899
And I'm looking at them like,
I don't understand.

00:34:36.899 --> 00:34:40.340
What don't you understand?

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:41.500
But it's just so neat.

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:44.739
So I guess behind the scenes
is really real.

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:45.380
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah?

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:45.600
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Yeah.

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:46.440
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's
very cool.

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:47.670
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
Kind of cool.

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:50.091
It's also hideous.

00:34:50.091 --> 00:34:51.300
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hand in hand.

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:55.560
So looking towards the future,
first question, we do a chef

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.440
competition here every year.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.040
Will you come and be a judge?

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:00.910
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: OK.

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:02.370
FEMALE SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:03.620
Awesome.

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.370
She says yes.

00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:08.620
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: I'm going
to bring security.

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:15.010
FEMALE SPEAKER: And you know
something else is that I'm

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:17.030
really bummed about is to hear
about The Darby, because it

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:18.830
was especially so
close to Google.

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:19.520
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:20.530
FEMALE SPEAKER: We'd go over
for drinks after work.

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:21.930
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: The
Darby has closed.

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:24.830
FEMALE SPEAKER: And
it was so great.

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:25.100
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: I know.

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:25.920
It's sad.

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.350
FEMALE SPEAKER: But do you have
any details of what's

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:28.790
going to be going on
in that space?

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:29.755
And are you going
to be involved?

00:35:29.755 --> 00:35:30.530
Because we hope so.

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:31.680
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
I don't think so.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:33.900
I don't think so.

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:39.680
I'll say it bluntly and honestly
for a change of pace.

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:43.730
That space at The Darby was
originally a supper club

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:46.210
called Nell's for many,
many years.

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:48.750
And when I was growing up,
it was where Prince

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:49.515
would go and play.

00:35:49.515 --> 00:35:51.050
And Stevie Wonder
would hang out.

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:53.100
And Mick Jagger would
go and sing.

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:56.530
It was just one of those kinds
of places that sort of

00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:59.570
magically drew a lot of
talent, sort of like a

00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:02.260
speakeasy in it's truest form.

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:06.420
But, to me, that's a spirit
animal that's a tiger.

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:10.050
And we tried to make it into
a Persian house cat.

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:10.680
FEMALE SPEAKER: Interesting.

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.880
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: And the
spirit animal of that place is

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.420
an impromptu venue.

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:18.950
I think it isn't sort of clouded
by a food, almost.

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:21.670
As strange as that
is for me to say.

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:23.930
It's a speakeasy and a place
where people can go and seek

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:27.870
refuge and perform and dance
and sing and drink.

00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:29.840
And I think that's what
it really needs to be.

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:33.080
So I'm kind of happy for it.

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:34.860
I don't mind.

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.020
I think it's going to be its
true spirit animal now.

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:39.790
And I think that the people that
I work with are the best

00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:41.900
people for that job.

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:44.580
They love that it was
Nell's and Plum and

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:45.680
all these other places.

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:48.500
And they'll honor the tradition
in the way that

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:49.580
place is supposed to be.

00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:50.940
I know that may sound odd.

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:54.110
I never thought I'd
speak like this.

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:55.990
Because I went to them and I
said, I'm the only one is

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:58.330
going to be out of a job here.

00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:01.310
But I don't think we
should, you know.

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:02.870
That's not what it is.

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:05.040
FEMALE SPEAKER: But
I also hear that

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.420
Butter is opening up.

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.040
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: We have
a Midtown restaurant.

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:09.200
Yeah.

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.180
Which is where I grew up.

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:11.610
FEMALE SPEAKER: Is that for
the next generation?

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:11.920
Why Midtown?

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:14.000
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
I like that.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.230
It's a butter for the
next generation.

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:19.410
I think something
just happened.

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:21.950
I'm going to put that top
of the Google search.

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:22.520
FEMALE SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.700
I can't take credit actually
for that verbatim.

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:27.450
But I will think you should
absolutely use that.

00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:27.820
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
I don't know.

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:29.380
We'll see.

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:30.440
It's an interesting space.

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:31.210
It's big.

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:31.990
It scares me.

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:36.490
I go in there and I look
at all those seats.

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:40.590
It's like if you've been
headlining an act at a Ramada

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:43.540
Inn in New Jersey and then
you go to Carnegie Hall.

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:45.590
That's sort of how it feels.

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:46.580
I like Ramada Inn.

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:48.800
I'm not dogging New
Jersey or Ramada.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:51.650
So if there's anybody from New
Jersey, I like New Jersey.

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:53.410
I serve a lot of produce
from New Jersey.

00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:55.045
It's not the Garden
State for nothing.

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:00.000
But that's how it feels.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:00.670
Very daunting.

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:02.960
FEMALE SPEAKER: So not only am
I lucky enough to work right

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.980
by The Darby, but I also
used to work right

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:06.200
next door to Butter.

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:09.770
And I spent many a paycheck
at that bar just--

00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:10.510
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Thank you.

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:12.300
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes,
thank you.

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:14.070
Thank you.

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:15.670
I also was lucky enough
to go into the

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:16.750
basement a couple times.

00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:18.950
I don't remember much of it.

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:21.250
But is there going to be a
basement in the Midtown?

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:21.650
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: No.

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:23.590
FEMALE SPEAKER: No basement?

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:25.460
Interesting.

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:27.910
If you are just saying that
because you don't want people

00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:28.910
to know about the basement?

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:30.200
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: No.

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:30.990
FEMALE SPEAKER: If you
do open a basement,

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:31.870
can I get an invite?

00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:33.120
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: No.

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:38.660
FEMALE SPEAKER: So we're
going to finish up with

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:41.590
finish-the-sentence
type of questions.

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:44.930
And we have a couple minutes for
Q&amp;A. So if anybody wants

00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:48.470
to ask some questions, there's
mics in the back of the room.

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:51.290
And then we'll be wrapping up
in just a couple minutes.

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:54.220
So finish this sentence.

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:57.670
Old-school cooking is?

00:38:57.670 --> 00:39:00.190
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: New-school
thinking.

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:02.020
FEMALE SPEAKER: New-school
cooking is?

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:05.320
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Old-school
cooking.

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:06.590
FEMALE SPEAKER: I am
challenged by?

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:11.090
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
Knowing where I am

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:13.910
at any given moment.

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:18.150
Not buying $400 worth of produce
at the green market

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:19.530
when I went there to
buy two peaches.

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:24.210
FEMALE SPEAKER: Three things
that are always in my

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:25.690
refrigerator are?

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:27.640
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
Dijon mustard,

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:31.680
several jars, all half-used.

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:32.580
Cornichons--

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:33.380
little pickles?

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:36.020
And lemons.

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:37.200
FEMALE SPEAKER: Interesting.

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:41.350
My favorite pop culture
guilty pleasure is?

00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:43.130
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Oh, give me
an example of a pop culture

00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:43.900
guilty pleasure.

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:44.580
Food?

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:45.230
Junk food?

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:47.680
FEMALE SPEAKER: No, like TV.

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:50.230
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Oh, how much
time you got? "Breaking

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:50.960
Bad."

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.160
FEMALE SPEAKER: Really?

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:53.400
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: I
love "Breaking Bad".

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:53.950
I'm obsessed.

00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:55.200
It's cooking.

00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:03.740
Walter White is cooking,
and he's acting more

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:06.040
and more like a chef.

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:10.490
I also love "Sons of Anarchy"
even though it's--

00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:11.670
FEMALE SPEAKER: Light
shows, very light.

00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:12.690
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: --grusomely
violent.

00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:14.350
I really struggle with that.

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:17.850
But, yeah, "Breaking Bad"
and "Sons of Anarchy."

00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:20.270
FEMALE SPEAKER: If I weren't
a chef, I would be?

00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:26.820
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: I would
like to try and become the

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:29.920
curator who presides over every
exhibit ever in the

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:32.040
Metropolitan Museum of Art.

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.290
FEMALE SPEAKER: Amazing.

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:36.870
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: A--

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:37.860
what do you call it?

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:39.390
A painting restorer?

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:43.080
I would like to restore the
Sistine Chapel again.

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:46.330
Or maybe a marine biologist.

00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:47.060
Yeah, definitely.

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:48.720
I want that big squid.

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:50.990
Where is he?

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:51.860
FEMALE SPEAKER: Waiting
for you.

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:53.840
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: I'm
going to cook him.

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:54.180
I'm sorry.

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:58.550
I want to tag and research him
and let him grow and evolve.

00:40:58.550 --> 00:41:01.320
FEMALE SPEAKER: Well, I know
we're all excited that you

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:04.850
chose to be a chef, passion
or not, choice or not.

00:41:04.850 --> 00:41:08.282
And I know we're all really
excited to see what you have

00:41:08.282 --> 00:41:08.860
cooking next.

00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:09.430
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Thank you.

00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:11.670
FEMALE SPEAKER: And when you're
back at Google, judging

00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:12.565
the Google chef competition.

00:41:12.565 --> 00:41:13.560
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
I'll be nice.

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:16.230
I promise.

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:18.020
FEMALE SPEAKER: So we have, I
think, a question back here?

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:18.720
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Yes?

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.070
AUDIENCE: Chef Guarnaschelli,
thank you for coming.

00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:20.770
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Hi.

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:22.740
AUDIENCE: You had said at the
beginning, you were going to

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:24.300
talk us out of being
chefs, I think.

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:27.210
And I have a special interest
in this because I have a

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:30.630
nephew at Johnson and Wales who
kind of lost the romance

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:34.600
of the commercial kitchen
after a summer of making

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.890
nothing but pico de gallo.

00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:38.300
So talk us out of being chefs.

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.480
Or don't talk us out
of being chefs.

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.760
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
How old is he?

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:42.520
AUDIENCE: 19.

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:44.000
So he's just finished
up his second year

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.710
at Johnson and Wales.

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:48.250
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: I don't
understand what was-- first of

00:41:48.250 --> 00:41:50.840
all, he doesn't like
pico de gallo?

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.310
I know that's funny, but I'm
actually being serious.

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:55.150
AUDIENCE: I think he
liked the first 500

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:56.770
pounds of pico de gallo.

00:41:56.770 --> 00:41:59.420
It was the second and the
third and the fourth 500

00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:02.900
pounds of pico de gallo that
got a little boring.

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:06.330
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: I think
that I am perpetually

00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:09.060
stimulated by repetition.

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.620
That's something I know about
myself that I learned.

00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:14.370
I like cooking the same things
again and again.

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:16.180
I like that feeling.

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:18.150
I like the process.

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:22.730
I'd say that's something that
would definitely make you lose

00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:25.060
your way if that wasn't
of interest to you.

00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:28.640
I don't think a lot of people
realize that, that cooking is

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.380
a manual craft.

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:31.080
It's manual.

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:32.220
It's manual labor.

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:35.560
And it does involve lots
of repetition.

00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:39.210
But I feel like as you're honing
your skills, where your

00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:42.070
learning to dice all the
vegetables to make a good pico

00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:45.820
de gallo and you're learning how
to cook beans, I presume

00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:49.660
you could add certain things,
like learn about epazote as

00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:52.530
something that you use to
cook black beans, how to

00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:53.620
cook them just so.

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:57.190
All the different skills that
are used to make a good pico

00:42:57.190 --> 00:43:00.860
de gallo are skills that you
then take and turn around and

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:04.850
use to make so many hundreds
of other dishes.

00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:08.400
That I worry that he doesn't
see sort of the value in

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.770
developing a skill set that he
can then use to do things he

00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:14.990
really does feel personally
passionate about making.

00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:18.470
I would say you have to work
in the type of restaurant

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:21.400
where the food resonates
with you.

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:24.210
I went to a restaurant where
I like the food.

00:43:24.210 --> 00:43:25.570
And I like what was
being made.

00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:26.690
I liked the way it tasted.

00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:29.450
I wanted to know how those
things came to be.

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:31.580
And I think if you're not
careful about that choice--

00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:33.020
because you're not going to make
a lot of money when you

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:35.000
start out no matter what,
you may as well be

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.830
broke and do some like.

00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:37.950
I mean, really.

00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:41.360
So I think maybe he shouldn't
work in a restaurant where

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:44.180
they make pico de gallo and
should work in a restaurant

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:47.060
where they cook and use
ingredients that he does find

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:48.600
stimulating.

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:50.160
And then he should also
cook at home.

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:53.260
And he should read maybe some
cookbooks and Google some

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:58.030
recipes and do all sorts of
other things to kind of put

00:43:58.030 --> 00:44:01.880
his own wood in his own fire
and not focus so much on

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:02.160
[INAUDIBLE].

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:04.400
Because cooking is
all repetition.

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.255
If he doesn't like the
repetition, I don't know that

00:44:06.255 --> 00:44:07.490
he'll ever--

00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:10.690
maybe a professional kitchen
is not the place for him in

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:12.240
the field of cooking.

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:15.500
Food styling for cookbooks,
for photography shoots for

00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:19.200
magazines, catering, jobs where
there are restaurants

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.000
where the menu changes
every day.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.810
And there are different
ingredients being used.

00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:24.440
He's just not in the
right place.

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:27.440
AUDIENCE: And nutrition and
working with food companies, I

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:30.480
mean he understands those
career options, too.

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:31.860
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: It doesn't
matter what you understand

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:35.520
about career options with
a field like cooking.

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:38.270
You have to figure out what you
actually want to spend all

00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:41.180
those hours doing
with your time.

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:44.430
And then when you hit on the
right thing, then you're not

00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:45.560
broke anymore, either.

00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:47.630
You're not rich,
but you're OK.

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:49.290
That comes after.

00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:54.200
And those kind of reversals that
I think don't exist in

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:57.450
the same way in a lot of other
fields can be very confusing.

00:44:57.450 --> 00:44:58.390
FEMALE SPEAKER: Interesting.

00:44:58.390 --> 00:44:59.550
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:00.070
FEMALE SPEAKER: Question
over there.

00:45:00.070 --> 00:45:00.920
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Tell
him he should be a

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:03.850
chef, goddamn it.

00:45:03.850 --> 00:45:04.230
Hi.

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:06.220
AUDIENCE: Yes, hi, Chef
Guarnaschelli.

00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:06.540
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Hi.

00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:07.500
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:08.340
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Sure.

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:09.080
AUDIENCE: A few things.

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:13.065
One, I didn't know your mother
edited "The Cake Bible." I got

00:45:13.065 --> 00:45:14.380
that book for my cousin.

00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:16.190
She's a caterer.

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:16.740
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Amazing.

00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:17.886
That's a great book.

00:45:17.886 --> 00:45:18.770
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I know.

00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:19.640
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: That
woman is crazy.

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:22.240
She's like 221 grams of flour.

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:24.420
You're like--

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:26.255
AUDIENCE: My blood sugar
was rising just by

00:45:26.255 --> 00:45:27.832
looking at the pictures.

00:45:27.832 --> 00:45:29.730
But I have a question.

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:33.920
So besides just pure
unadulterated passion for

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:39.790
food, or lack thereof, what's
necessary in your career?

00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:43.970
Because you're beyond, not
just a cook, you're a

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:46.950
television personality,
executive chef in multiple

00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:47.520
restaurants.

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:51.680
Can you tell us about some of
the extra things that go into

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:54.010
your career outside
of cooking?

00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:55.650
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Like what?

00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:56.975
Specifically?

00:45:56.975 --> 00:45:59.440
AUDIENCE: Like appearances
at Google.

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:05.535
Like public appearances,
management, and other aspects

00:46:05.535 --> 00:46:09.030
to being a television
personality.

00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:10.540
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: I don't
think I get your question.

00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:11.430
Boil it down for m.

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.910
Strip it.

00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:13.120
What is your question?

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:16.300
You want to know how
did I get into TV?

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:17.860
I'm not sure I know
the question.

00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:19.040
I'm not trying to
be difficult.

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:23.030
I'm trying to get at what
you're really asking.

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:30.160
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so a standard
cook would probably cook in a

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:31.290
restaurant, OK?

00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:34.990
But you're like on television
and "Chopped" and "Iron Chef."

00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:37.500
Can you describe exactly how
you got into that industry?

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:41.260
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Oh,
yeah, I wish I knew.

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:44.100
I really wanted to be a
competitor on "Iron Chef

00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:47.960
America." I watched "Iron
Chef." I still do.

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:51.440
And I liked the way it's a
show that focuses on one

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:54.660
single ingredient and where
people take it.

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:56.430
And I just thought it was
the coolest thing.

00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:59.100
And I had this fantasy that
Iron Chefs were like

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:00.660
superheroes.

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:05.470
You know, there's Aquaman and
there's Wonder Woman.

00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:09.490
It sort of was my own personal
chef iconography, I

00:47:09.490 --> 00:47:12.110
think, of some kind.

00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:14.820
So I really wanted to be on
that show as a competitor.

00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:20.930
So that took me a couple years
to get that opportunity

00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:24.890
through begging and pleading,
and went on the show and

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:28.940
realized that day that I
probably couldn't joke and

00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:32.130
banter and be myself and
express and share my

00:47:32.130 --> 00:47:36.600
personality and also
win the episode.

00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:40.930
I made that call that morning.

00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:44.350
I remember thinking you
can't do both these.

00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:45.570
Maybe some people can.

00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:46.150
I can't.

00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:48.230
And I knew that I couldn't.

00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:50.270
And when you have a lucid moment
about yourself, you

00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:51.410
should probably go with it.

00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:52.910
And I made a choice
that morning.

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:55.130
I thought, well, OK, so I won't
worry about winning.

00:47:55.130 --> 00:47:57.070
I'll make the best food I can.

00:47:57.070 --> 00:47:59.370
I'll express my personal
side as best I can.

00:47:59.370 --> 00:48:01.710
And I want to share
my personality.

00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:06.350
And I think that wound
up being effective.

00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:09.870
I got asked to be on "Food
Network Challenge" after that.

00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:12.520
And then they did the screen
test where I had to make a

00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:16.210
minestrone, a basic minestrone
with tomatoes and beans and

00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:17.110
vegetables.

00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:19.760
So they put the camera on me
in this little room at the

00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:20.190
Food Network.

00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:21.180
And I made the minestrone.

00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:22.060
And I cooked the whole thing.

00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:22.495
And I explained.

00:48:22.495 --> 00:48:23.380
And I smiled.

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:24.930
And I did all this stuff.

00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:27.780
And I finished the soup, and I
looked down and she said, you

00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:30.550
forgot the tomatoes.

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:33.720
And I thought, well,
this is a bust.

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:35.990
I mean, it's like pizza
without cheese.

00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:38.900
How's it going?

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:41.250
But then they said, you know,
you're really good.

00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:42.480
We can work with this.

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:45.640
And I did "The Cooking Loft,"
which was my first cooking

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:48.100
show, which was really awful.

00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:49.410
And I really didn't
like the show.

00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:51.720
So they said, do you want to
make more of this show?

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:55.030
And I said, I'd rather not be
on television than make this

00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:56.640
show because I don't like it.

00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:59.580
And I think that's a really
important moment there, where

00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:02.800
I walked away from something
that I was really starting to

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:06.340
like because I didn't think it
was good enough for my own

00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:07.940
personal internal set
of standards.

00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:12.960
And Bobby Flay kind of got
assigned to my case maybe a

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:15.950
year later to produce a
cooking show for me.

00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:17.950
And I made "Alex's Day
Off." And that was a

00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:18.850
whole different ballgame.

00:49:18.850 --> 00:49:21.040
He said, wear the clothes
you want to wear.

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.470
Say what you want to say.

00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:23.230
Cook what you want to cook.

00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:25.760
And I said, really?

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:28.300
That's what--

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:29.080
OK.

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:31.980
And the studio was right by
his house, his apartment.

00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:33.990
So he would come and drink
coffee with these mirrored

00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:35.580
sunglasses in the morning.

00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:37.160
And it would like fog
up his sunglasses.

00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:40.280
And he would stand there while
I was shooting the show, just

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:42.190
looking at me.

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:47.620
I mean, it was like being
watched by the police.

00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:53.660
And then they asked me to be
on "Next Iron Chef." And I

00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:55.310
really always wanted
to be an Iron Chef.

00:49:55.310 --> 00:49:56.430
And I'm a sucker.

00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:58.320
You know, I was like,
OK, I'll do it.

00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:01.470
How bad can it be?

00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:03.370
And it just kind of snowballed
from there.

00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:04.790
"Chopped" was an accident.

00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:05.890
They went to shoot the pilot.

00:50:05.890 --> 00:50:08.590
And I said I don't want to
be on that show at all.

00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:09.880
I'm sick that day.

00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:11.470
And they just hounded me.

00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:13.350
They just said, we think
you're right for this.

00:50:13.350 --> 00:50:15.940
We think you belong
on the show.

00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:17.260
I wasn't convinced.

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:20.190
And so I hate to answer your
question by saying it's kind

00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:20.880
of an accident.

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:23.810
But it was all born from one
singular idea that I was

00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:26.790
obsessed with being on "Iron
Chef America." And it

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:31.480
snowballed accidentally and
became some strange avalanche.

00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:33.720
AUDIENCE: And you became
an Iron Chef.

00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:35.680
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI:
Yeah, totally.

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:36.590
That's crazy.

00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:37.400
That never gets old.

00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:42.340
I get up every morning, I'm
like, I'm an Iron Chef.

00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:44.150
I'm like, on my tombstone,
I'm going to write Mom,

00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:45.090
Daughter, Iron Chef.

00:50:45.090 --> 00:50:47.300
This is so cool.

00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:49.120
When the curtain dropped and
my face was there, I

00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:52.030
was like I can die.

00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:53.500
I never thought I'd have
a moment like that.

00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:54.840
I still can't believe it.

00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:56.240
I have stars in my eyes.

00:50:56.240 --> 00:51:00.935
It's really hokey and sappy
and goopy and all true.

00:51:00.935 --> 00:51:01.440
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:02.490
Thank you.

00:51:02.490 --> 00:51:04.210
FEMALE SPEAKER: We actually only
have time for about one

00:51:04.210 --> 00:51:05.140
more question.

00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:06.790
I'm sorry, but--

00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:07.710
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:08.560
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Hello.

00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:11.290
AUDIENCE: I just wanted to
know, do you feel more

00:51:11.290 --> 00:51:14.350
pressure cooking on
"Iron Chef" or

00:51:14.350 --> 00:51:15.620
being a judge on "Chopped"?

00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:16.930
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Did you
write your question down?

00:51:16.930 --> 00:51:17.895
AUDIENCE: Yes, I did.

00:51:17.895 --> 00:51:19.145
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: OK, so you
were checking your phone.

00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:24.740
Oh, cooking on Iron Chef.

00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:26.610
Oh my god, cooking is so hard.

00:51:26.610 --> 00:51:29.520
To pick what you're going to
cook in that moment with that

00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:32.490
kind of thinking is-- there's
nothing like it.

00:51:32.490 --> 00:51:34.996
Sitting behind a desk on
"Chopped," I'm like, whew, I

00:51:34.996 --> 00:51:38.380
got a day off.

00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:39.976
Cooking, hands down.

00:51:39.976 --> 00:51:41.650
FEMALE SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:51:41.650 --> 00:51:44.010
Well, thank you so, so
much for coming in.

00:51:44.010 --> 00:51:45.260
ALEX GUARNASCHELLI: Thank you
for sharing your time.
