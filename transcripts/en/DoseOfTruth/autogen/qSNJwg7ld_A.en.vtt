yeah schizophrenia is a genetic disorder

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:04.940
yeah schizophrenia is a genetic disorder
 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.059
yeah schizophrenia is a genetic disorder
nobody knows what the genes are or how

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069
nobody knows what the genes are or how
 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.040
nobody knows what the genes are or how
they work but it's pretty clear there's

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050
they work but it's pretty clear there's
 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.490
they work but it's pretty clear there's
a genetic component if you can find the

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500
a genetic component if you can find the
 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.910
a genetic component if you can find the
Jews figure out what they do and come up

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920
Jews figure out what they do and come up
 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.730
Jews figure out what they do and come up
with real good treatments if lectures

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740
with real good treatments if lectures
 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.189
with real good treatments if lectures
for schizophrenia and possibly

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199
for schizophrenia and possibly
 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.710
for schizophrenia and possibly
Prevention's for schizophrenia that

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720
Prevention's for schizophrenia that
 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.599
Prevention's for schizophrenia that
indirectly is going to help to alleviate

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609
indirectly is going to help to alleviate
 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.089
indirectly is going to help to alleviate
the homeless problem right so I don't

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099
the homeless problem right so I don't
 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.040
the homeless problem right so I don't
know what to do about the homeless but

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050
know what to do about the homeless but
 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.600
know what to do about the homeless but
if you can figure out what to do about

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610
if you can figure out what to do about
 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.080
if you can figure out what to do about
schizophrenia that's gonna have some

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090
schizophrenia that's gonna have some
 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.930
schizophrenia that's gonna have some
impact on that yes it's basic yeah well

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940
impact on that yes it's basic yeah well
 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.970
impact on that yes it's basic yeah well
use you know your claim to some degree

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980
use you know your claim to some degree
 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.889
use you know your claim to some degree
is that these more complex social

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899
is that these more complex social
 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.900
is that these more complex social
problems should be decomposed into

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910
problems should be decomposed into
 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.090
problems should be decomposed into
isolated or micro problems and that

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100
isolated or micro problems and that
 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.950
isolated or micro problems and that
specific solution should be sought for

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960
specific solution should be sought for
 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.750
specific solution should be sought for
them and now that certainly strikes me

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760
them and now that certainly strikes me
 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.729
them and now that certainly strikes me
as an appropriate approach because

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739
as an appropriate approach because
 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.560
as an appropriate approach because
everybody is different not everyone is

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570
everybody is different not everyone is
 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.080
everybody is different not everyone is
for the same reason no no well that's

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090
for the same reason no no well that's
 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.000
for the same reason no no well that's
for sure that's for sure not everyone's

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010
for sure that's for sure not everyone's
 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.700
for sure that's for sure not everyone's
poor for the same reason any stretch of

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710
poor for the same reason any stretch of
 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.579
poor for the same reason any stretch of
the imagination that's right poverty is

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589
the imagination that's right poverty is
 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.300

doesn't have one cause no one please 50

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310
doesn't have one cause no one please 50
 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.820
doesn't have one cause no one please 50
and it's not merely caused by lack of

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830
and it's not merely caused by lack of
 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.560
and it's not merely caused by lack of
money either because that would be a

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570
money either because that would be a
 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.000
money either because that would be a
much easier problem to solve

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010
much easier problem to solve
 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.760
much easier problem to solve
unfortunately it's not so simple so the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770
unfortunately it's not so simple so the
 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.080
unfortunately it's not so simple so the
one thing that we're probably getting

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090
one thing that we're probably getting
 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.700
one thing that we're probably getting
toward the end one thing I would like to

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710
toward the end one thing I would like to
 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.070
toward the end one thing I would like to
leave your listeners with is really

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080
leave your listeners with is really
 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.160
leave your listeners with is really
optimism these are not dismal problems

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170
optimism these are not dismal problems
 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.830
optimism these are not dismal problems
in perpetuity because the genetic

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840
in perpetuity because the genetic
 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.490
in perpetuity because the genetic
approach I think and I've been kind of

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500
approach I think and I've been kind of
 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.649
approach I think and I've been kind of
out you know I'm kind of out there on

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659
out you know I'm kind of out there on
 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.960
out you know I'm kind of out there on
this this is not a mainstream view but I

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970
this this is not a mainstream view but I
 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.789
this this is not a mainstream view but I
think the more something is genetic the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799
think the more something is genetic the
 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.590
think the more something is genetic the
more likely it is we can change it for

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600
more likely it is we can change it for
 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.380
more likely it is we can change it for
the good and that's why we just should

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390
the good and that's why we just should
 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.569
the good and that's why we just should
study the genetics of intelligence

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579
study the genetics of intelligence
 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.899
study the genetics of intelligence
that's why I hope genes have more to do

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909
that's why I hope genes have more to do
 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.259
that's why I hope genes have more to do
with it that environment
