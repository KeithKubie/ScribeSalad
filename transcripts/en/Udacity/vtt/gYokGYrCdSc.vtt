Hello Andy Brown, that's my name. That's very nice. I

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.630
mean, this ticket has been assigned to you. Everything is

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.940
completely broken, the priority is high. That, it's pretty cool.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.000
&gt;&gt; Is it cool that everything is broken?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.910
&gt;&gt; Well that's not cool.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.310
