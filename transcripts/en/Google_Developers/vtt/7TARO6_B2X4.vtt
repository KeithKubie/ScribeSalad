00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.520
Some days, it feels like
I'm constantly on the move,

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.720
commuting to work,
running to the shops,

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.790
finding that underground
performance art space

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.000
my friend wants to meet at.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.680
I need all the help I can get.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.370
With the Google
Maps SDK for iOS,

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.480
you can help your
users find their way.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.946
I'm Jen Harrington, and
I'm going to show you how.

00:00:26.946 --> 00:00:28.320
Take this situation,
for example,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.690
of a couple of friends trying
to meet up before a show.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:31.523
[TEXT MESSAGE ALERT]

00:00:31.523 --> 00:00:33.040
Hey, I'm at the
cafe near the venue.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.530
Want to come by?

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.363
[TEXT MESSAGE ALERT]

00:00:34.363 --> 00:00:35.097
Where's that?

00:00:35.097 --> 00:00:35.930
[TEXT MESSAGE ALERT]

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.181
On the corner by my old place.

00:00:37.181 --> 00:00:38.013
[TEXT MESSAGE ALERT]

00:00:38.013 --> 00:00:38.840
Huh?

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:39.673
[TEXT MESSAGE ALERT]

00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:43.060
Um it's near that giant
tree, uh, opposite the bank.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.970
Gah.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.810
See how frustrating that was.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.590
That's because describing
location and place in the world

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.296
is hard, but it
doesn't have to be.

00:00:51.296 --> 00:00:53.420
Wouldn't it be great if he
could have just shown me

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.128
where he wants to
meet, instead of having

00:00:55.128 --> 00:00:57.140
to describe it with
crazy landmarks

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.674
or precise geographic
coordinates.

00:00:59.674 --> 00:01:01.340
Instead, this is how
it could have gone.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.173
[TEXT MESSAGE ALERT]

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.090
Hey.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.680
I'm here.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.257
Come by.

00:01:05.257 --> 00:01:06.090
[TEXT MESSAGE ALERT]

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.230
Oh, I think I know that place.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.966
Is it-- Yup, I know
that storefront.

00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:14.840
[TEXT MESSAGE ALERT]

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.312
Cool, I'm on my way.

00:01:17.312 --> 00:01:19.770
What happened under the hood
is that the app used the place

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.394
picker, so my friend
could very quickly

00:01:21.394 --> 00:01:24.002
specify the actual
business where he was.

00:01:24.002 --> 00:01:25.960
Then it drew that place
clearly on a map for me

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.200
so I knew where to go.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.850
I was able to dive in and
actually see the Streetview

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.130
imagery of the place he shared.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.240
The Google Maps SDK for
iOS expands the vocabulary

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.970
available to your
users when referencing

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.700
places and locations.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.390
Looking at another
example, I live in Sydney,

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.350
but my family's
all back in Canada.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.390
When my mom came to visit,
she only had two days

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.410
and she wanted to see
as much as she could.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.930
Thankfully, the Google Maps
APIs came to the rescue

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.388
and we used a transit app to
get her efficiently from place

00:01:53.388 --> 00:01:54.260
to place.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.800
All she had to do
was specify where

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.410
she wanted to go-- the
Opera House, the Harbor

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.899
Bridge, Coogee Beach, Then
she'd get a list of buses

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.440
next available and
walking directions

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.334
to the bus stops from
her current location.

00:02:05.334 --> 00:02:07.250
And where could she best
see this information?

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.110
On a map, of course.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.020
This is a great example of
connecting the API building

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.000
blocks together-- the
Places API Autocomplete

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.560
feature to get the information
on the destination,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.380
the Directions API to
get the bus schedule

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.330
and the walking paths
to the bus stops,

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.119
and the Map CPI to
actually show the routes.

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:26.410
Note that the Directions API
is actually a web service.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.989
It's being called by my server
and proxy to the client.

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.530
With all these great
features, you're

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.321
going to want to make
sure your app reaches

00:02:32.321 --> 00:02:33.920
as many users as possible.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.940
And you can trust the
Google Maps SDK for iOS

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.785
to scale with your user base.

00:02:37.785 --> 00:02:40.160
Your millions of users are
going to live around the world

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.037
and speak many
different languages.

00:02:42.037 --> 00:02:43.620
With Google's places
database covering

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.320
more than 100 million places
worldwide and every API being

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.750
tailored to suit the
languages of your users,

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.420
they will love you for
going Google on IOS.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.990
So get started integrating
Google Maps into your apps.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.730
Check out the documentation
and install the Google Maps SDK

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.710
Cocoapod.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.860
Once you start using the
Google Maps SDK for iOS

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.864
and see how nicely
everything fits,

00:03:04.864 --> 00:03:06.780
you won't be able to
imagine it any other way.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.130
