00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.300
Our treatment of matchings
wouldn't be complete,

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.430
without talking about the notion
of a perfect matching.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.700
Consider a bipartite graph, G,
where the size of the left and

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.660
the right hand side are equal.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.860
Then we say that a matching is perfect,

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.410
if it has the same
cardinality as the two sides.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.350
Another way of saying this is to
say that all vertices are matched.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.670
To review some of the key
concepts from the lesson so

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.490
far we'll do a short exercise.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.760
Assume the left and right hand sides are
of the same size and then the question

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.750
is which of the following imply
that there is a perfect matching.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.030
The fact that for
all subsets of the right hand side.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.260
The neighborhood of that set is at
least the size of the set itself.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.280
How about the fact that there
is a vertex cover of size L?

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.070
Or the fact that there is a matching
M that admits an alternating

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.180
Hamiltonian cycle.
