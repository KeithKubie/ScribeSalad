[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:08.810
JINGYU SHI: Hi, everyone.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.970
Welcome to Modern
Android Notifications.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:14.260
My name is Jingyu.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.449
I'm a developer advocate in
the Partner Developer Team.

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:18.990
PAUL MATTHEWS: And
I'm Paul Matthews.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.220
I'm a partner developer
advocate in London.

00:00:24.622 --> 00:00:28.000
So three years
ago on this stage,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.049
Chris Wren, an Android
engineer on the system UI,

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.510
gave this quote, and
it's a brilliant one.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.500
"Don't annoy the user.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.280
Respect them.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.210
Empower them.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.200
Delight them.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.782
Connect them to the
people they care about."

00:00:40.782 --> 00:00:44.510
And this is still
very much true today.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.480
So we will look at channels
and how you can use them

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.500
in your app, what's new in
notifications, and finally,

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.626
Digital Wellbeing, but first,
how to respect your users.

00:00:57.626 --> 00:00:59.920
So respect your
users' attention.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.970
Don't annoy the user.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.520
Respect them.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.510
Some useful tips-- so do
respect the user's settings.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.640
So if they've communicated
to you in your app

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.752
that they want a certain
setting for your notifications,

00:01:15.752 --> 00:01:16.960
then you should respect that.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.740
Don't try and override it.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.190
Don't try and ignore it.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.800
You should check that the
notifications you're sending

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.720
are not blocked, that
they do still want

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.700
to hear these notifications.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.340
And finally, if you are
capable in your app,

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.710
you should backup any
settings that they've

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.000
told you about notifications.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.820
And you should make
sure they're synced

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.960
over installs and over devices.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.850
You should use
well-structured notifications

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.260
in your app, so making use of
the styles that we provide,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.120
such as MessagingStyle,
InboxStyle, BigPictureStyle.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.380
And you should make sure
that your notifications

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.320
are relevant and timely.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.300
Great example is using
high priority FCM messages

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.120
to ensure that the user gets
the notification when you intend

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.040
them to get your notification.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.340
And prioritize posting the
notifications first, and then

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.320
making them look even
better, so downloading

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.415
assets and that kind of thing.

00:02:17.415 --> 00:02:19.387
Some don'ts, some basic don'ts--

00:02:19.387 --> 00:02:20.845
don't just send
these notifications

00:02:20.845 --> 00:02:22.430
and kind of forget about them.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.540
So we really want you to use
the platform features that

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.470
are there to help you.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.465
For instance, auto
cancel, making sure

00:02:28.465 --> 00:02:30.590
that your notifications
disappear when they should.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.710
Time outs, is a
notification really

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.634
relevant after four hours?

00:02:36.634 --> 00:02:38.960
And synchronizing
across the devices--

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.710
if you know that your user uses
your app on multiple devices,

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.560
like tablets and desktops,
you should try and synchronize

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.270
notifications that
they dismiss on one

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.190
or read on one across others.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.050
Don't send notifications
that are not actionable.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.300
The point of notifications is
that they're there to be used.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.100
By definition, the
user wants to know

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.590
something, which means they
generally need to do something.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.850
So don't send them
a notification

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.225
that just tells
them hey, we sync

00:03:04.225 --> 00:03:05.520
some stuff in the background.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.785
This is not the best
use of notifications.

00:03:07.785 --> 00:03:10.410
And finally, don't
annoy the user.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.340
So when you post a
notification to them,

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.390
you should use alert
once, and make sure

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.670
that they're not getting
buzzed like crazy,

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.880
as they're standing up on stage
presenting about notifications.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.880
And you should make sure
that the group notification

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.200
behavior is representative
of what you want.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.580
So if you're a chat app, maybe
children group notification

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.120
behavior, or summary if
you're something else.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.780
So respect the user.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.800
Otherwise, they might just
turn off your notifications.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.080
And then you've got no way
of communicating to them.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.000
They might choose to
uninstall your app, which

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.810
would be far worse.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.770
There are some platform features
that deliberately enable

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.570
notifications being turned off.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:57.110
For instance, you can see here
the notifications being posted.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.560
And the users maybe
keep swiping it away.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.340
And so now in P,
we prompt the user.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.710
Do you really care
about this notification?

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.460
Do you really want
to see this content?

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.290
This acts on channels.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.710
So if you're not describing
your channels correctly,

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.230
then this can lead
to some confusion,

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.320
and perhaps some
lost notifications

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.959
from the user's perspective.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.980
So let's talk more about
notification channels.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.250
They provide granular
control to your notifications

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.880
for the user.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.040
So you should empower the user.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.170
And clearly, channels are
the way to empower them.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.950
So let's look at
how to use them.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.355
Well first of all, they're
now required on all apps.

00:04:37.355 --> 00:04:39.430
They're required on API 26.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.680
And that should be
everywhere prevalent now.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.400
They help the user categorize--

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.730
they help you categorize
your notifications that help

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.200
the user to interact with them.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.680
But more on that soon.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.470
And finally, they allow the user
to customize their settings.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.607
So the user has the final say.

00:04:56.607 --> 00:04:58.190
So if you think
something is important

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.410
and they don't think it
is, they can tell you this.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.020
So let's look at
the best practices.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.737
Again, you should
allow the users

00:05:08.737 --> 00:05:11.195
to manage their notifications
through the channel creation.

00:05:14.414 --> 00:05:17.810
You should allow them to
maybe deep link into settings

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.014
to change these things.

00:05:19.014 --> 00:05:20.430
If they are
expressing an interest

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.650
of working with your
notification channels,

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.100
perhaps they want
to be able to change

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.290
the importance of something.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.990
So setting the right importance
level for a notification

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.920
channel seems like
an obvious one,

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.390
but it's so easy to overlook.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.880
And finally, user settings--

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.680
you should respect the user
settings, as we said earlier.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.070
But back them up where you can,
and don't try and abuse them

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.430
by deleting and recreating.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.870
Other don'ts are only
using one channel.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:56.100
This is a clear notification
smell, if you like.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.380
If you've only got one
channel in your application,

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.026
there's probably something
else you need to be looking at.

00:06:02.026 --> 00:06:04.570
If you provide poor
descriptions for users

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.070
so that they don't
really understand

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.630
what the purpose
of a channel is,

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:08.800
then they're not going to
be able to make the best

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.700
decisions.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.340
Or if you use wrong
or blocked channels,

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.320
then this is probably,
you know, they're

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.360
trying to communicate
to you that they

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.480
don't like this content.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.020
And you should respect that.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.670
And finally, spamming the user
with notification channels

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.330
is just not the
best way to proceed.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.970
So choosing your
channels can really

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.602
help, choosing your
channels carefully.

00:06:29.602 --> 00:06:31.060
You really should
think of the user

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.550
when you create your channels,
not your application, not

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:34.481
your architecture.

00:06:34.481 --> 00:06:35.980
Think of the user
and how they might

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.420
want to interact with your app.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.527
For instance, it's a bad
idea to try and create

00:06:40.527 --> 00:06:42.610
notification channels
around your importance level

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.160
that you find important.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.480
So hey, this is a really
high priority thing.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.370
This isn't what notification
channels are for.

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.120
You should group them
around categories

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.760
of notifications, for
instance, tagging in a photo,

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.170
or liked posts.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:57.910
Let the user
communicate back to you

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.680
how they see that
type of notification.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.010
You should also think about
creating notifications when

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:06.480
there is more control needed.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.790
For instance, if
I'm on a chat app.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:11.880
And I've got a general channel
for all chat notifications

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.690
coming in.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.210
But then I express an
interest in controlling,

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.450
like, a family chat
group, you should create

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:21.630
a channel at that point, and
allow the user to dive deeper

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:24.640
and have more finely
grained control.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.570
And finally, lazily
creating, so this comes back

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:31.000
to not creating too
many channels or groups.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.330
And that is if Jingyu never
receives a direct message

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.100
through your app,
maybe you don't need

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:42.060
to create the channel for that.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:46.350
And then the user can
provide feedback to you

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:49.221
to say, look, this is
useful or this isn't useful.

00:07:49.221 --> 00:07:50.470
And you should listen to that.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.010
So in Android P,
we added broadcasts

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:58.320
for listening in to
blocking or changing state

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.580
of your notification channels.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.170
You should understand those.

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:02.560
And you should react to them.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.893
You should maybe back them
up, so that the next time you

00:08:04.893 --> 00:08:07.910
create a channel on a different
device, it makes sense.

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:11.040
And finally, you can query
these APIs at runtime

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.610
also to find out how the user
interacts with your channels.

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:19.890
So now, look at what's
new in notifications.

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:22.010
JINGYU SHI: Thank you, Paul.

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.830
Let's now look at what else
is new in notifications

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.960
on Android 9.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.680
First, we added
some visual updates

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:33.020
to make the notifications
easier to read and scan through.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.610
As you probably noticed,
we added more padding

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:37.890
single notification.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:40.460
And we went back to
using the rounded corners

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:41.960
at the top and bottom.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.360
The other improvement
that we really love

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.790
is this smooth app
opening animation

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:48.980
that you're seeing
here on the slide.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.960
Instead of closing
the notification

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.480
and opening the app,
now the notification

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:57.050
transforms smoothly into
the app, which speeds up

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.150
the transition more than twice.

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.510
And you might ask, what do
you need to do to have this?

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:04.310
All you need to
do is to make sure

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.430
that you are starting
your activity directly,

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:11.310
and your activity
starts quickly.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:14.990
Since for most users,
the notifications

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:17.690
they care about the most
are the ones connecting them

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:19.880
with the people they care.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.090
So we enhanced our
MessagingStyle, our messaging

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:26.900
experience, by
adding a new person

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.980
class once you use API 28.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.130
And if you're using
MessagingStyle in notification,

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:37.160
you can see that we have now
moved the people's avatar

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.380
to the left of the notification.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:43.506
And you can set that avatar
by using the setIcon method.

00:09:43.506 --> 00:09:47.390
We also added support
for images and stickers

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:49.530
in the messaging notification.

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:51.990
By using site data,
you can add image

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:56.240
in your messaging
notification directly.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.890
The other feature that I love
on Android is direct reply.

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:03.900
But sometimes when I'm
replying to a notification,

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.480
I would accidentally
tap on the notification,

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.250
and that will open the app.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.140
And my response is lost.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:13.500
But on Android 9 you can
help the user with this.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.260
By retrieving the
draft from this extra,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.810
you can populate the
response in your app.

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:23.420
So make the user experience
better, delight them.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:27.120
If you already support
Smart Reply in your app,

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.230
we highly recommend that
you use the setChoices API

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:34.170
to also display them
in your notification.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.330
Instead of replying
to the notification,

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:41.624
user can now just tap
one of them to reply.

00:10:41.624 --> 00:10:44.710
OK, here's an example
we have for creating

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:47.770
MessagingStyle notification
using the new APIs.

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:52.260
So first, we're going to create
an instance, a person instance,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:53.370
here.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.450
So we're going to use
the person builder.

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:58.120
As you can see, we are
setting the names, the URI,

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.160
the icon for this person.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.690
And this is going to represent
the sender in a message.

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:07.330
And then we're going to
pass that to this message

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:08.710
that we're creating here.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.860
As you can see, we're passing
the instance of the person,

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.690
not like before,
where we were passing

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:15.700
the name of that person.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.940
And in this message, we also
want to include the image.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.910
So we're using the setData
method to include that image.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:27.260
And then after that,
we're adding this message

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:28.830
with another message.

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:31.370
So we're adding two messages
into this MessagingStyle

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:32.390
notification.

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:35.690
And then we're setting the
style into our notification.

00:11:39.426 --> 00:11:43.410
OK, so here's a quick summary of
some of the dos and don'ts when

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:46.560
you're using MessagingStyle.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.190
First, please use
MessagingStyle for messages.

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:52.290
And this also
applies for if you're

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:54.930
building for Android
Auto or Android Wear.

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:57.370
If you're sending
messaging notifications,

00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:59.130
please use MessagingStyle.

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:01.200
In the past, we've
seen developers

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.350
switching between MessagingStyle
and some other styles,

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:09.720
like BigPictureStyle, in
order to create that big image

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.950
expansion presentation.

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:14.860
But now with setData method
you don't need to do that.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.440
You can just use MessagingStyle.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.690
And this will create a
consistent experience

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:20.980
for the user.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.450
And it's always good to add
that icon for the people

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:25.720
in the notification.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.640
So we highly recommend that you
use setIcon to add that avatar.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.580
But if you don't
set the icon, we

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.110
will use the initial for
the name for that person

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:38.140
to create that
visual presentation.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:41.580
And finally, if your app
supports Smart Reply,

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.890
please add that into
your notification,

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:47.950
so you are creating a better
experience for the user.

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:51.360
And here's a few things
that you want to avoid.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.880
There are a lot of
good reasons to auto

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:58.020
cancel a notification, in order
to give the user a clean and up

00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.790
to date notification jar.

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:03.630
But after user replies to
a notification, a messaging

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:06.550
notification, this is
not one of those cases.

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:08.520
You would want to keep
that notification there.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.340
So if user want to return
to this conversation

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:12.840
and reply afterwards.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.790
So please don't cancel that.

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:16.770
And let the users
swipe away when they're

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.550
finished with the conversation.

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:22.600
The other bad behavior
that we've seen in the past

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:27.190
is some developers are
setting this empty name,

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:30.115
in order to achieve a
visual presentation.

00:13:30.115 --> 00:13:32.750
But on Android 9,
please don't do that.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:33.680
There are two reasons.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:38.140
One is because it will break on
Android 9, on the presentation.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:42.820
And the other reason is
because a person without a name

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:43.765
is not a real person.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.170
So up until now, we
will talk about how

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:51.490
you can reach the user--

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:54.040
how you can help your
user connect with people

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.700
they care about, and how you can
make your notification a better

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.150
experience for the user.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:03.160
But I want to hit pause
here, and look at app usage

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.390
from the other side.

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:08.380
Since as much as I want
to get that notification

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.180
from my friend and
family, I still

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:13.615
need time away from the device.

00:14:13.615 --> 00:14:17.530
So to help users with this, we
announced the Digital Wellbeing

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:19.490
at I/O this year.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:22.540
If you have a [INAUDIBLE]
device running Android 9,

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:25.530
I highly recommend that you
download it from the Play

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:29.231
Store, and sign up for beta.

00:14:29.231 --> 00:14:34.250
So this is what Digital
Wellbeing will show us.

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:37.390
It provides an overview
of our app usage

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:41.890
and provides dashboards
that shows our time spending

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:44.260
on each app, and the
number of notifications

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.210
that we've received.

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:49.690
I personally love using
Digital Wellbeing to learn

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:51.470
where I'm spending my time.

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:54.220
But sometimes I would
find that one or two apps

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:59.040
are sending me a lot of
notifications unexpectedly.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.560
So one question
you might have is,

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:04.380
how are these
notifications counted?

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:08.290
Since this is still in beta,
the counting method may change.

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:11.940
But the goal is to track
user interruptions.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:14.910
So in general, any newly
created notifications

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:16.260
are counted as one.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.905
And any updates that's
visible to the user

00:15:18.905 --> 00:15:21.630
are also counted
as one, which means

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:24.630
if you're sending a notification
to the block channel, that

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:26.860
is not counted here.

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:29.400
So in this case, I saw
this app is sending me

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.940
lots of notifications.

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:32.310
So I got curious.

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:33.940
I went into the dashboard.

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:37.840
And I opened that to see
the hourly breakdown.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.810
And as you can see here, I
got notifications every hour

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:43.200
that day.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.900
And even at 4:00
AM in the morning,

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.850
I got eight notifications.

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:52.130
So if these notifications
are high importance,

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:54.560
I would be woken up in
the middle of the night.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.020
But thankfully,
that's not the case.

00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:00.680
But if these notifications
are push notifications,

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:03.920
and they are sent using high
priority FCM message, which

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:08.280
means this app is constantly
waking up a deep dose device.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.940
If I want to have good
battery in the morning,

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.950
I might just uninstall this app.

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:16.640
But for now, I will turn
on DND, Do Not Disturb,

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.170
so that I don't get disturbed.

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:23.840
Digital Wellbeing also
provides ways for users

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.770
to disconnect and
reduce interruption.

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:31.190
And on Pixel 3, you
can even turn on DND

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:35.390
by simply flip your device,
which is super convenient.

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:39.980
But what if this is a super
important notification

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:43.112
that the user actually
wants to receive?

00:16:43.112 --> 00:16:46.490
So for those, here's
a few advice for you.

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:49.940
First, set the right category
to your notification.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.490
As we can see here in the
do not disturb setting,

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:56.632
user can choose what to
block and what to allow.

00:16:56.632 --> 00:17:00.860
And they can set exceptions
on calls, messages, reminders,

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.370
and events.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:04.470
If your notification
belongs to one of them,

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:07.609
please tag your
notification as such.

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:10.040
Here are listed a
few categories which

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:13.990
correspond to these
exceptions on the other side.

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:16.410
As I said, if your
notification belongs

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:18.780
to one of these
categories, please let us

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:21.770
know by tagging them.

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:24.480
The other advice that
we have is if this

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:28.230
is a notification coming
from another person, then

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:30.360
please tag your notification.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:34.620
As you can see here in the
do not disturb setting,

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:37.620
user can choose who they
want to get a notify from,

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:39.270
from their contacts.

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:43.950
So please add that person
in your notification,

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:47.440
and add the associated
URI, if possible.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:51.680
Doing this will allow you
to bypass do not disturb.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.940
But you should always remember
that when user turn on

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:58.100
do not disturb, they really
don't want to be disturbed.

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.380
So if you're sending
a notification that's

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:04.170
not expected, that
will really annoy them.

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:08.030
So please don't abuse these
APIs, which this brings us

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:11.326
back to the quote we
had at the beginning,

00:18:11.326 --> 00:18:15.010
where we're saying whenever
you're sending a notification,

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:16.540
please keep this in mind.

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:20.360
Don't annoy the user,
respect them, empower them,

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:23.500
delight them, and connect them
to the people they care about.

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:24.700
Thank you.

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:26.800
