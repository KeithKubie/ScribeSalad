00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.600
We've see now that we can apply
linear transformations

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.460
in different coordinate systems.
The transformations

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.290
that we've been performing
before have all been with

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.130
respect to the standard basis.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.540
So in the last video I said,
look, in standard coordinates,

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.520
if you have some vector x in
your domain and you apply some

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.930
transformation, then let's say
that A is the transformation

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.290
matrix with respect to the
standard basis, then you're

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.300
just going to have
this mapping.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.520
You take x, you multiply it by
A, you're going to get the

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.990
transformation of x.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.280
Now, in the last video and in
a couple of videos before

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.070
that, or actually the one right
before that, we said,

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:34.700
well, look.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.940
You can do the same mapping,
but just in an alternate

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.060
coordinate system.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.960
You could do it in some
coordinate system with respect

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.790
to some basis B, and that should
be the same thing.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.170
It should just be a different
transformation matrix.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.520
And in the last video, we
actually figured out what that

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.180
different transformation
matrix is.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.940
We had a change of basis, so
let's say we had this basis

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.340
right here.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.090
Let me actually copy and paste
everything so that we

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.370
understand what we did.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.869
So this was the example.

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:05.330
Let me copy it.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.620
Let me paste it up here, put all
of our takeaways from the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.870
last video up here and
paste it right here.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.950
For the last video we
said, OK, this is

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.830
my basis right there.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.025
And then we said-- let
me copy and paste.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.330
That was my alternate basis, and
then I have my change of

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.300
basis matrix and it's inverse.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.990
Those will be useful to
deal with, so let me

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.420
copy and paste that.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.700
OK, copy, And then I'm
going to paste it.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.150
Edit, paste.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.340
Maybe I'll just write
it over there.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.325
Not maybe the best order, maybe
I should have written

00:01:49.325 --> 00:01:51.680
that first, but I think
we get the idea.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.680
Then we want to write what our
transformation matrix is with

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.390
respect to the standard basis.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.790
And I wrote that write
over here.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.770
This was all from the last
problem, if you're wondering

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.070
where I got all this stuff.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.690
Let me copy and then
paste that.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.000
Edit, paste.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.520
So I'll paste that.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.430
And then the whole point of the
last video is we figured

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.890
out what the transformation
matrix is with respect to this

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.000
basis right here.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.830
So D, which was the big takeaway
from the last video,

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.280
was equal to this right here.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.860
Let me copy and paste that.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.980
Copy and paste.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.940
And so now we have all of our
takeaways in one place.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.890
Edit, paste.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.560
What I want to do in this
video is verify that D

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.460
actually works, that I could
start with some vector x-- let

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.140
me write it up here.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.570
Let's take some example
vector.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.900
So this transformation, it's
entire domain is R2, so let's

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.530
start with some vector x.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:13.450
Let's say that x is equal
to 1 minus 1.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.840
Now, we could just apply the
transformation in the

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.520
traditional way and get the
transformation of x.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.180
Let's just do that.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.840
The transformation of x is
just this matrix times x.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.940
And so what is that
going to equal?

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:26.340
Let me see.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.140
Maybe I can just do it
right here in this

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.260
corner to save space.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.330
So it's going to be this
matrix times x.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.210
So this first term right here is
going to be 3 times 1 plus

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.520
minus 2 times minus 1,
or plus 2, right?

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.810
Minus 2 times minus 1 is just 2,
so it's going to be 3 plus

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.640
2, so it's going to
be equal to 5.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.560
And then the second term right
here is going to be 2 times 1

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.980
plus minus 2 times minus 1.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.030
Well, that's just positive 2, so
it's going to be 2 plus 2,

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.090
so that is 4.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.940
So that's just the
transformation of x.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:12.860
Now, what is this vector x
represented in coordinates, or

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.279
I guess you could say, this
alternate basis coordinates?

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:21.000
So what is that vector x
represented in coordinates

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
with respect to this
basis right here?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.010
Well, you saw it before.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.910
I wrote them out here.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.150
Maybe it'll be useful
to do it right here.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.930
I'll copy this.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.280
Actually, let me copy
both of these.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.310
These will both be useful.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.640
Edit, copy.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.670
As you can see, if you want to
go from x to the x in an

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.640
alternate basis or the
alternate coordinate

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.080
representations of x, you
essentially multiply x times C

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.580
inverse, so that's why I'm
copying and pasting it.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.470
Let me copy, and then let me put
it up here so that we can

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:58.200
apply these, then paste
it right there.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:07.940
So if we want to go from x to
the B coordinates of x, I take

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.120
my x and I multiply it
times C inverse.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.820
C inverse is this thing
right here.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:19.690
So if I take x and I multiply
it times C inverse I'l get

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.220
this version of x.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.680
So let's do that.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.790
So this times that.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.430
Let me just put the minus
1/3 out front.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.610
It's going to be equal to minus
1/3 times-- let's see if

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.090
we can do this one in
our head as well.

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.950
So it's going to be 1 times 1
plus minus 2 times minus 1,

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.430
which is just positive 2.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.880
So it's going to be 1 plus
2, so it's going

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.780
to be equal to 3.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:50.570
And then it's minus 2 times 1,
which is minus 2 plus 1 times

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.730
minus 1, which is
just minus 1.

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.195
So it's minus 2 minus
1, so it's minus 3.

00:05:56.195 --> 00:06:00.480
So if we have minus 1/3 times
this, the B coordinate

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:10.620
representation of our vector x
is going to be equal to minus

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.550
1 and then 1, just like that,
which is actually interesting

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:16.260
for this example.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.510
It just kind of swapped
the first entry

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:20.800
and the second entry.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.190
Now, let's see what happens
when we apply D to x.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.690
So if we apply D to x, D should
be our transformation

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.640
matrix if we're dealing
in the B coordinates.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.610
So let's see what happens.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:40.990
If we apply D to x-- let me
scroll over a little bit, just

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.210
so we get a little bit
more real estate.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.620
So if we apply D to
x, what do we get?

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:52.590
And so this is going to be the
transformation, or this should

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:57.280
be the transformation of
x in B coordinates.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.290
So what is this going
to be equal to?

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:04.370
You have to multiply
this times D.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.540
So it's going to be minus 1
times minus 1, which is 1,

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.980
plus 0 times 1.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.050
So it's just minus 1 times
minus 1, which is 1.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.120
And then we're going to get 0
times minus 1 plus 2 times 1,

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.120
so 2 times 1 is just 2.

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.410
Now, for everything to work
together and assuming I

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:30.280
haven't made any careless
mistakes, this thing, this is

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.400
vector right here should be the
same as this vector if I

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.950
change my basis, so if I go
from the standard basis

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.420
to the basis B.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.640
When you go in that direction,
you just multiply this guy

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.720
times C inverse.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.260
And I'm just using this
formula right here.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.750
If I'm in the standard basis and
I multiply by C inverse,

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.140
I'm going to get the B basis.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.100
So let's see what I get.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.530
So this guy, I'm going to
multiply him times C inverse.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:08:00.510
Let me do it up here just
to get some extra space.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:04.450
So I'm going to multiply
the vector 5, 4.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:06.890
I'm going to multiply
that by C inverse.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:14.950
We're going to have minus 1/3
times 1 minus 2 minus 2, 1,

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:15.660
just like that.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.550
So this is going to be equal
to-- Ill just write the minus

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:19.590
1/3 out front.

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:25.700
We have 1 times 5, which is
5, plus minus 2 times

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.030
4, so 5 minus 8.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:36.490
And then we have minus 2 times
5, which is minus 10.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.230
And then we have
plus 1 times 4.

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.230
Minus 2 times 5, which
is minus 10, plus 1

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:42.609
times 4: plus 4.

00:08:42.609 --> 00:08:46.530
So this is equal to minus
1/3 times minus

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:47.930
3, and this is what?

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:51.360
This is minus 6.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.920
If you multiply the minus 1/3
times it, all the negatives

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.700
cancel out, and you get 1 and
2, which is exactly what we

00:08:58.700 --> 00:08:59.200
needed to get.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.220
When you take this guy and you
change it's basis to basis B

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.230
or you change its coordinate
system to the coordinate

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:09.830
system with respect to B, you
multiply it by C inverse, you

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:10.900
get that right there.

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:15.990
So literally is the B coordinate
representation of

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.080
the transformation of x.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.680
We just did it by multiplying
it by C inverse, which is

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.800
exactly what we got when we took
the B coordinate version

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:30.440
of x and we applied that matrix
that we found, the

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.960
transformation matrix with
respect to the B coordinates,

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.890
and you multiply it times
this guy right here.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.190
We got the same answer.

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.470
So it didn't matter whether we
went this way around the

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:41.680
little cycle or we
went this way.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.800
We got the same answer.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.350
This isn't a proof, but it shows
us that what we did in

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:47.920
the last video at least works
for this case, and I literally

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.770
did pick a random x here.

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:52.790
And you can verify it, if you
like, for other things.

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:55.700
Now, you should hopefully be
reasonably convinced that we

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.650
can do this, that you can change
your basis and find a

00:09:58.650 --> 00:09:59.690
transformation matrix.

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:02.570
We've shown how to do it, but
the obvious question is

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:03.970
why do you do it?

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.520
And someone actually wrote a
comment on the last video,

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:14.330
which I think kind of captures
the art of why you do it.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.520
I'm not looking at the comment
right now, but if I remember

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.750
correctly, they said their
linear algebra teacher said

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:23.680
that linear algebra is the art
of choosing the right basis.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.930
Let me write that down.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.430
Or you could imagine, the
right coordinate system.

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:38.440
And why is there a right
coordinate system?

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.230
Maybe I'll put little quotes
inside the quotation.

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:44.650
What does it mean to have the
right coordinate system?

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:47.510
Well, if you look at your
original transformation matrix

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:50.750
with respect to the standard
basis, it's fine.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:51.750
It's got this 2 by 2.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.340
But if you performed matrix
operations with this, you've

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.100
go to do some math.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.460
And if you had to perform it
over and over, if you have to

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:02.470
perform it on a bunch of
vectors, it is what it is.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:05.570
But when you transfer your
bases, when you go to a new

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.950
basis, when you went to this
basis right here, all of a

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:10.720
sudden, you find that
the transformation

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.610
matrix is much simpler.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.060
It's a diagonal matrix.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:17.290
When you multiply a diagonal
matrix times something, you're

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:19.870
literally just taking its
scaling factors of the first

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:22.640
and second terms. When you
multiply this guy times some

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.220
vector-- we did it here.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:30.080
When you multiplied this guy
times this vector, you

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.460
literally just scaled the first
term times minus 1 and

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:36.340
you scaled the second
term by 2.

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:37.540
So it's a much simpler
operation.

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:40.010
And you might say, hey, but we
had to do all of that work of

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.470
multiplying by C inverse to get
there, and then once you

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:45.650
get this answer, you're going
to multiply by C to go back

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:48.340
into standard coordinates, you
know, that's a lot more work

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.780
than just what you save here.

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.610
But imagine if you had to
apply D multiple times.

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:57.730
Imagine if you had to apply D
times D times D times D to x.

00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:58.570
Let me say it this way.

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.920
Imagine if you had to apply A
times A times A or you have to

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:06.210
apply A 100 times to some vector
up here, then applying

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:09.060
A 100 times to some vector
would be much more

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.870
computationally intensive than
applying D 100 times to this

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:15.200
vector, even though you had a
little bit of overhead from

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.330
converting in this direction
and then converting back.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.600
So in a lot of problems,
especially in computer science

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.090
frankly, or some other
applications you might be

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:27.830
doing, you want to pick
the right basis.

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.880
The computations for many
problems get a lot simpler if

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:35.400
you pick the right coordinate
system.
