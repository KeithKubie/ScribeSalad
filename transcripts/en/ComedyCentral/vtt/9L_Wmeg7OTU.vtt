00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.140
SO I SPEAK FOR ALL GAMERS WHEN I
SAY THE

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.640
MEDIA SHOULD STOP TALKING TO
CRITICS LIKE ANITA SARKEESIAN.

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:08.208
HERE NOW TO BE TALKED TO IS
MEDIA CRITIC AND CREATOR

00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:20.454
OF THE WEB SERIES FEMINIST
FREQUENCY, ANITA SARKEESIAN

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:21.421
[APPLAUSE]
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:25.926
LET'S PUT THIS ON THE LINE,
OKAY.

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:29.162
LET'S CALL THIS WHAT IT IS.

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:32.432
YOU AND THE OTHER FEMI-NAZIS
IN THE GAMER WORLD ARE COMING

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:35.169
FOR A BALLS TO CUT EM OFF AND
PUT THEM INTO A LITTLE FELT

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:38.805
PURSE AND TAKE THEM AWAY SO WE

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:40.507
HAVE TO PLAY YOUR NON-VIOLENT
GAMES, RIGHT.

00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:43.944
&gt;&gt; NO. THAT'S NOT TRUE.

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:46.613
&gt;&gt; IT'S A CULTURE WAR. IT'S A
SUBCULTURE WAR.

00:00:46.647 --> 00:00:48.182
&gt;&gt; THERE IS SOMETHING GOING
ON, AND WHAT IT IS IS WOMEN

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:51.652
BEING HARASSED AND THREATENED
AND TERRORIZED.

00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:54.688
&gt;&gt; AFTER YOU FIRST ATTACKED
GAMERS AFTER ENJOYING LOOKING

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:58.392
AT BIG BREASTED WOMEN WITH TINY
ARMOR THAT BARELY COVERS THEIR

00:00:58.425 --> 00:01:00.861
NIPPLES. WHAT'S WRONG WITH
THAT? I LIKE WHAT THAT

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:08.168
LOOKS LIKE. I'M A MAN BABY, NEWS
FLASH, I LIKE IT.

00:01:08.202 --> 00:01:11.872
&gt;&gt; ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THAT
IS IT ACTUALLY REINFORCES THE

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:15.776
CULTURE MYTH THAT WOMEN ARE
SEXUAL OBJECTS AND SEXUAL PLAY

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:20.247
THINGS FOR MALE AMUSEMENT AND
WE'RE NOT.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.749
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WE'RE SAVING
THEM. THEY'RE DAMSELS IN
DISTRESS.

00:01:22.783 --> 00:01:23.851
I'M SAVING THE PRINCESS.

00:01:23.884 --> 00:01:26.787
AM I SUPPOSED TO LET THE
PRINCESS DIE? IS THAT WHAT YOU

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.654
WANT.

00:01:27.688 --> 00:01:28.856
THAT'S KINDA HARSH, THAT'S KINDA
HOSTILE.

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:31.592
&gt;&gt; MAYBE THE PRINCESS COULDN'T
BE A DAMSEL AND SHE COULD SAVE

00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:32.593
HERSELF.

00:01:32.626 --> 00:01:35.495
[CROWD CHEERING]
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THEY'VE GOT GAMES.

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:40.634
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU BROUGHT A
POSSE.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:41.869
&gt;&gt; I'M WELL LIKED.

00:01:41.902 --> 00:01:46.006
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SO YOU'VE BEEN THE
OBJECT OF CRITICISM YOURSELF.

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.074
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:48.208
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT HAPPENED AT
UTAH STATE UNIVERSITY.

00:01:48.242 --> 00:01:51.144
&gt;&gt; THERE WAS A THREAT THAT
SOMEONE E-MAILED TO THE SCHOOL

00:01:51.178 --> 00:01:54.181
SAYING THAT THEY WOULD COMMIT
THE BIGGEST SCHOOL SHOOTING, A

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:57.484
MASSACRE IF I WAS ALLOWED TO
SPEAK.

00:01:57.518 --> 00:02:01.522
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BY CRITICIZING
THESE, YOU SAY WOULD YOU CALL

00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:06.593
THEM MALE FANTASY GAMES OR MALE
FANTASY OBJECTIFICATION OF WOMEN

00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:07.027
GAMES.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.761
&gt;&gt; SOME OF THEM.

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.663
&gt;&gt; Stephen: GIVE ME SOME
NAMES.

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:10.898
NAME SOME NAMES.

00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:15.802
&gt;&gt; SO IN THE WORK THAT I DO, I
LOOK AT HUNDREDS OF EXAMPLES OF

00:02:15.836 --> 00:02:17.070
VIDEO GAMES.

00:02:17.104 --> 00:02:19.706
&gt;&gt; Stephen: CAN YOU THINK OF 3?
&gt;&gt; I CAN BUT IT'S A BIGGER ISSUE

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.911
TO TALK ABOUT THE INDUSTRY AS A
WHOLE AND HOW IT PERPETUATES

00:02:23.944 --> 00:02:28.415
THESE IDEAS OF SEXISM AND
MISOGYNY AS OPPOSED TO GRAND

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:29.650
THEFT AUTO FOR EXAMPLE.

00:02:29.683 --> 00:02:31.485
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHY DO YOU THINK
THAT WOMEN ARE BEING THREATENED.

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:36.957
IT'S ALMOST ENTIRELY WOMEN WHO
ARE BEING THREATENED IN GAMER

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.357
GATES.

00:02:37.391 --> 00:02:38.492
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:41.562
&gt;&gt; Stephen: CHRIS KLUWE HAS
TALKED ABOUT THIS, OTHER MEN

00:02:41.595 --> 00:02:42.763
HAVEN'T BEEN THREATENED.

00:02:42.796 --> 00:02:44.198
WHY DO YOU THINK WOMEN ARE BEING
THREATENED IN THIS EXCHANGE.

00:02:44.231 --> 00:02:47.267
&gt;&gt; I THINK WOMEN ARE PERCEIVED
AS THREATENING BECAUSE WE'RE

00:02:47.301 --> 00:02:50.737
ASKING FOR GAMES TO BE MORE
INCLUSIVE.

00:02:50.771 --> 00:02:53.240
WE'RE ASKING FOR GAMES TO
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE EXIST AND WE

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:54.141
LOVE GAMES.

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:57.778
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHY NOT HAVE A
SEPARATE GAME.

00:02:57.811 --> 00:02:59.346
HAVE SEPARATE BUT EQUAL GAMES.

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.048
[LAUGHTER]
&gt;&gt; WELL WE DO HAVE LOTS OF

00:03:01.081 --> 00:03:01.982
DIFFERENT KINDS OF GAMES.

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:03.383
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT ARE YOU
COMPLAINING ABOUT.

00:03:03.417 --> 00:03:05.953
&gt;&gt; THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS WE HAVE

00:03:05.986 --> 00:03:09.690
THIS WIDE RANGE OF GAME THAT
WE'RE SEEING MOBILE GAMES, WE'RE

00:03:09.723 --> 00:03:12.526
SEEING INDY GAMES, WE'RE SEEING
THIS INFLUX OF DIFFERENT KIND OF

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:15.195
GAMES AND THAT'S WHAT GAMERGATE
IS RESPONDING TO.

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:18.065
THEY'RE ACTUALLY RESPONDING TO
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE SAYING

00:03:18.098 --> 00:03:22.503
GAMING CAN NO LONGER BE THIS
LITTLE BOY'S CLUB ANYMORE.

00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:27.207
MANY OF US WOMEN HAVE BEEN
PLAYING GAMES OUR WHOLE LIVES.

00:03:27.241 --> 00:03:29.943
SO THEY'RE LASHING OUT BECAUSE
WE'RE CHALLENGING THE STATUS QUO

00:03:29.977 --> 00:03:35.048
OF GAMING AS A MALE DOMINATED
SPACE.

00:03:35.082 --> 00:03:39.620
[APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU SEE.

00:03:39.653 --> 00:03:43.223
YOU HEAR THE APPLAUSE FOR THE
IDEA OF A MALE DOMINATED SPACE.

00:03:43.257 --> 00:03:49.363
WHAT ABOUT THE ACCUSATIONS OF
COLLUSION BETWEEN DESIGNERS,

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:50.197
FEMINISTS AND JOURNALISTS.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.465
DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT
IT IS.

00:03:51.498 --> 00:03:53.834
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ETHICS IN
GAMER JOURNALISM.

00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:55.302
DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW HUGE THAT
IS.

00:03:55.335 --> 00:04:00.174
WHAT IF THERE WAS NO ETHICS IN
HOLLYWOOD JOURNALISM.

00:04:00.207 --> 00:04:03.343
[LAUGHTER]
IF WE CAN'T TRUST ENTERTAINMENT

00:04:03.377 --> 00:04:05.379
TONIGHT OR TMZ, WHERE WOULD WE
BE.

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:08.382
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT FOR GAMER
JOURNALISM.

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:10.684
&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT IS A SORT OF
COMPELLING WAY TO REFRAME THE

00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:13.220
FACT THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY AN
ATTACK ON WOMEN.

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:15.189
ETHICS AND JOURNALISM IS NOT
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN ANY WAY.

00:04:15.222 --> 00:04:17.191
IT'S ACTUALLY MEN GOING AFTER
WOMEN IN REALLY HOSTILE

00:04:17.224 --> 00:04:21.128
AGGRESSIVE WAYS.

00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:24.231
THAT'S WHAT GAMERGATE IS ABOUT.
IT'S ABOUT TERRORIZING

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:33.140
WOMEN FOR BEING INVOLVED IN THIS
INDUSTRY, THIS HOBBY.

00:04:33.173 --> 00:04:36.243
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OFF SUBJECT, BUT AS
A MAN, AM I ALLOWED TO BE A
FEMINIST.

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:39.746
&gt;&gt; DO YOU BELIEVE THAT WOMEN
SHOULD HAVE EQUAL RIGHTS TO

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.582
MEN AND WE SHOULD FIGHT FOR
THOSE RIGHTS.

00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:42.349
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SURE.

00:04:42.382 --> 00:04:46.119
&gt;&gt; GREAT, THEN YOU'RE A
FEMINIST.

00:04:46.153 --> 00:04:48.388
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ANITA SARKEESIAN,

00:04:48.422 --> 00:04:51.425
FEMINIST FREQUENCY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
