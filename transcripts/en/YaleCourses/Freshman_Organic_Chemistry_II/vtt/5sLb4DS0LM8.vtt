1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.610
So as you remember the first semester we studied bonding and molecular

2
00:00:05.611 --> 00:00:10.020
structure.
And then toward the end we did some sort of thermodynamics,

3
00:00:10.021 --> 00:00:12.870
which is what connects structure to energy,

4
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.320
which is what determines what chemistry will happen.

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.800
So this semester we're going to talk about that chemistry,

6
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.490
about reaction mechanisms and about using these reactions to do synthesis.

7
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.910
And we'll also do some spectroscopy around the middle of the semester.

8
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.770
So just a brief,
uh,
uh,
excursion through what we're going to be doing.

9
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.120
The first two quarters of the semester are going to be on how mechanisms are

10
00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:42.990
discovered and understood in terms of structure and energy.

11
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.910
What we talked about last time.

12
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.980
So first we'll look naturally enough that the simplest reactions there can't be

13
00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:52.650
anything much simpler than just cleaving of bond.

14
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.450
But remember there's also the possibility of making a bond at the same time.

15
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.980
You break a bond and we introduce these ideas last semester,

16
00:01:01.981 --> 00:01:05.340
of course.
So we're going to start with free radical substitution.

17
00:01:05.341 --> 00:01:07.650
One of the earlier reactions to be studied,

18
00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:11.760
as you remember in the 1830s and France.
Uh,

19
00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:13.020
but we're going to talk about,

20
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.370
use it to talk about the concepts of reactivity and seal activity.

21
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:18.930
When you can get different products,

22
00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:23.910
how do you control or predict which ones you'll get?
Uh,
then,

23
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.270
uh,
the nice thing about free radicals is they're not charged,

24
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.150
so they're relatively insensitive to solve it.

25
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.710
So you can just think about the molecules themselves reacting,

26
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.560
whether it's in the gas phase or solution,
more or less the same thing,

27
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.880
but it's quite different when I ends are involved either as starting materials

28
00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:46.050
or products or both,
cause then solve a defects are very important.

29
00:01:46.051 --> 00:01:50.090
So as we go from free radicals,
we're then going to do solve a defect,

30
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.450
uh,
and then go on to nuclear fillic substitution reactions,

31
00:01:54.451 --> 00:01:56.970
which almost always involve ions.

32
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.580
Either is starting materials or products or both.

33
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.020
And you got to use that as an example of showing how people go around about

34
00:02:04.021 --> 00:02:06.680
proving of mechanism.
Hey,

35
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.540
then we'll have the first exam on February 2nd.

36
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.080
Then we'll go on to electrophilic addition reactions to alkenes and how kinds

37
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.310
you'll recognize that things,
these are concepts we introduced last semester,

38
00:02:20.311 --> 00:02:25.170
but this time we're going to focus on how you know about how they work and we're

39
00:02:25.171 --> 00:02:28.230
going to talk there especially about the role of nuclear files.

40
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:30.690
You usually call these additions electrophilic,

41
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.320
but there's quite often a very important nuclear affiliate concept,
uh,
uh,

42
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.750
component as well.

43
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.350
Then we'll get onto polymers and their properties for just a lecture or two and

44
00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:47.220
then conjugation air [inaudible] and Perry cyclic reactions,

45
00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:49.200
which you'll know what they are when we get to them.

46
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.270
Then we'll have the second exam and then we'll have an interlude about

47
00:02:54.271 --> 00:02:58.410
spectroscopy and go on to more focus on synthesis.

48
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.650
So first spectroscopy for structure and also for studying dynamics of molecules

49
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:08.200
and reactions.
So ultraviolet visible spectroscopy,
electronic,

50
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.300
uh,
I,
our spectroscopy vibration,
which we've talked about a good deal already.

51
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.620
Um,
magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance.

52
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.100
Then onto aromatic substitution and finally carbonyl chemistry and the concepts

53
00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:25.630
of oxidation and reduction.

54
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:29.110
Then we'll have the third hour exam and the last quarter of the course.

55
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:33.520
Then we'll be more having to do with carbon eel chemistry,
acid derivatives,

56
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.730
substitution taking place at the carbon eel group,

57
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.150
a reactivity adjacent to the carbonyl group,

58
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.640
the classical condensation reactions.

59
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.640
Then something about carbohydrates and fishers,

60
00:03:45.641 --> 00:03:49.420
classical proof of which isomer is which of glucose.

61
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.680
And finally we'll talk about some complex synthesis will be talking about

62
00:03:53.681 --> 00:03:55.510
synthetic ideas all through this,

63
00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.970
but a of both unnatural and natural products.
Then we'll have the final,

64
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.820
so that's how long you have to endure.

65
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.431
Okay,

66
00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:10.060
so at the end of last semester we were talking about energy and how it related

67
00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:14.350
to things that free energy determines what can happen at equilibrium.

68
00:04:14.351 --> 00:04:18.640
And remember it was all statistics and the statistics filtered down to give us

69
00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:23.230
this handy relationship at room temperature that an equilibrium constant is 10

70
00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:25.990
to the minus three fourths of the difference in free energy.

71
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.210
Or if you're not worried about entropy,

72
00:04:28.211 --> 00:04:31.930
the the difference in and therapy in the heat of the molecules.

73
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.130
So that's both energy and entropy,
the Gibbs free energy.

74
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.130
But there's a completely independent question,
which is,
will it happen?
You know,

75
00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:46.300
graphite is more stable than diamond as a form of carbon,

76
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.790
but the advertisers tell us that a diamond is forever just because it's not as

77
00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:56.200
stable doesn't mean to look convert in any reasonable time.
So the question,

78
00:04:56.201 --> 00:05:00.460
so the questions of kinetics are just as important as the questions of

79
00:05:00.461 --> 00:05:04.240
equilibrium or at least almost as important.
Uh,

80
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.220
and we saw last time that we could approach this by studying lots of trajectory,

81
00:05:09.221 --> 00:05:10.690
trying to trajectories,

82
00:05:10.691 --> 00:05:14.650
trying to calculate how all the atoms move and going from one arrangement to

83
00:05:14.651 --> 00:05:18.760
another one.
But that really provides too much detail.
In fact,

84
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.510
over the last couple of weeks we've had interviews from people who are applying

85
00:05:22.511 --> 00:05:26.710
for a faculty position here and a number of them are talking about fancy new

86
00:05:26.711 --> 00:05:30.730
ways of actually looking at one molecule at a time as it react,

87
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:32.290
right?

88
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:37.270
So that you actually could do something getting closer to trajectories.

89
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.830
But really that's more detail than we want.
Uh,

90
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.310
we want to summarize things statistically to know what's going to happen in a

91
00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:50.170
flask.
So we have collective concepts and therapy and entropy.

92
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.370
And then we can have a,
a reaction coordinate diagram.

93
00:05:54.371 --> 00:05:58.250
Remember we rolled the marble on that thing last time on that potential energy

94
00:05:58.251 --> 00:05:59.084
surface.

95
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.020
Or we could slice along with potential energy surface and looked at the starting

96
00:06:03.021 --> 00:06:08.021
material that transition state and the products or uh,

97
00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:09.500
we could,
uh,

98
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:14.420
simplify things to notice that this is just as a sequence of three species.

99
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.010
The starting material,
which is molecules that we know about the,

100
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.630
the transition state,

101
00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:24.770
which we don't know about and the products which we know about.

102
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.880
So our challenge is going to be to try to figure out something about the

103
00:06:28.881 --> 00:06:33.020
transition state given what we know about the starting material and their

104
00:06:33.021 --> 00:06:36.770
products because it's energy relative to those others is going to determine

105
00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:38.310
rates.
Uh,

106
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.950
so we have a then free energies with just these three species rather than trying

107
00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:49.580
to look at a detailed trajectory.
Okay.

108
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.720
Now,
so free energy determines what can happen at equilibrium,

109
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.800
but also how fast it happens at kinetics.
And for that purpose,

110
00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.350
we need to know that how much,

111
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:04.760
what the energy is either the free energy or the heat at least of the transition

112
00:07:04.761 --> 00:07:06.080
state.
Okay.

113
00:07:06.081 --> 00:07:11.081
And remember we talked about this last time that in the Irish iris a transition

114
00:07:11.301 --> 00:07:12.170
state theory,

115
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:17.210
the rate constant for the reaction per second is 10 to the 13th times.

116
00:07:17.211 --> 00:07:21.680
That sort of equilibrium constant between the starting material in the

117
00:07:21.681 --> 00:07:26.030
transition state.
So again,
we can use at room temperature that three fourths,

118
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.810
Delta g when we express it in kilocalories per mole.

119
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:36.170
So we want to use energy is to predict equilibria and also to predict rates

120
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.801
first.

121
00:07:36.801 --> 00:07:41.801
For the very simplest one step reactions and no reaction is conceptually simpler

122
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:47.090
than just breaking a bond in the gas phase to give Adams or free radicals.

123
00:07:47.091 --> 00:07:50.380
So we need to know the energy for that.
Now,
uh,

124
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.790
in the textbooks that I've handed out to you,

125
00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:56.570
their tables like this one that give bond association energies,

126
00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:00.320
how much energy does it actually take to break a bond?
A,

127
00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.470
this particular one is from a text we used to use in the course called

128
00:08:03.471 --> 00:08:05.950
streetwise or and half cock.
Uh,

129
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:10.430
that was in 1993 but as of 2003,

130
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:14.810
there is a new set and you can see that these don't change very much in time.

131
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:19.070
98 became 9,900,
11 became 113.

132
00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:22.880
Some of them are a little bigger.
81 became 85 and so on.

133
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:27.950
And these values I refer to as Ellison's,
I've mentioned him last semester,

134
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.880
there's Barney Ellison,
uh,
he and his friends,
uh,

135
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:36.170
compiled these new values and he's going to come and talk to you about how he

136
00:08:36.171 --> 00:08:40.940
did this in April.
Sometime he can't get out of a boulder.

137
00:08:40.941 --> 00:08:45.170
Now he's all snowed in out there.
Colorado.
Okay.

138
00:08:45.171 --> 00:08:49.880
So this is his,
his table of a molecular bond association.

139
00:08:49.881 --> 00:08:54.881
Energies for losing h from something are h becomes our plus h atom are radical

140
00:08:56.791 --> 00:09:01.770
plus h atom.
So these are experimental bond in therapies and as you can see,

141
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:06.660
some of them are known to very high precision.
Like h two is known to,

142
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.750
uh,
six significant figures,
right?

143
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:11.730
Most of them of course aren't know them that well,

144
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:14.730
but most of the ones in this table are known pretty darn well.

145
00:09:14.731 --> 00:09:17.970
Plenty accurately enough for our purposes.
Okay,

146
00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:21.840
let's see if we can understand some of these so that we don't have to memorize

147
00:09:21.841 --> 00:09:25.770
the table.
Let's look at the bonds from h to halogen.

148
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.960
You'll notice as we go down to a larger halogens from fluorine,

149
00:09:30.961 --> 00:09:32.640
chlorine,
bromine,
iodine,

150
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:37.680
we go from one 36 to one oh three to 87 to 71 quite a difference.

151
00:09:37.681 --> 00:09:39.660
And in the energy involved.

152
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.860
So the idea is that larger halogens don't overlap as well with the hydrogen,

153
00:09:44.861 --> 00:09:49.230
so they don't make as strong a bond at their normal bond distances and there's

154
00:09:49.231 --> 00:09:52.980
less electron transfer to the halogen.

155
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.500
So whereas HF looks like that,

156
00:09:55.501 --> 00:09:59.490
and the two electrons are lowered quite a bit in Hci,

157
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:03.990
the net amount of lowering of the electrons in forming the bond isn't nearly as

158
00:10:03.991 --> 00:10:07.380
much.
So that makes sense to us.
Okay,

159
00:10:07.381 --> 00:10:10.680
so less electron stabilization means a week or bond.

160
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:14.250
Now here's the table too,

161
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:19.580
which is a bond and therapies for various atoms or groups attached to various

162
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:25.770
carbon hydrocarbon radicals.
Okay,

163
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.940
so let's just look at the,
uh,
here.
We have the,

164
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:34.260
previously we looked at at,
uh,
h attached to halogen.

165
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.930
Now we're looking at methyl attached to halogen.

166
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.840
And you see there's a very similar trend.

167
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:42.870
It's strongest for fluorine week or for chlorine,

168
00:10:42.871 --> 00:10:47.130
weaker still for rural and my bro mean and weakest for iodine.
Okay,

169
00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:52.380
so many of the same features,
but let's try to understand different radicals.

170
00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:56.310
So we're going to look at the bonding of age to methyl ethyl ice,

171
00:10:56.311 --> 00:10:57.720
approachable and t butyl.

172
00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:02.460
And the first thing you notice about this is that they're all almost the same

173
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:07.050
right here in the house.
As we went down the halogens,
it varied by,
uh,

174
00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:11.850
by 60 kilocalories per mole.
But as we go across these different methyl,

175
00:11:11.851 --> 00:11:13.560
ethyl ice appropriate t boodles,

176
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:17.250
they're all a hundred kilocalories per mole plus or minus five.

177
00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:22.080
So now we're going to look next lecture at this in some more detail and see if

178
00:11:22.081 --> 00:11:26.100
we can understand why they vary at all.
But they don't very,
very much.

179
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:27.390
On the other hand,

180
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:32.750
some hydrocarbon radicals have substantially different ones like vinyl and Allie

181
00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:38.160
fennel and Benzel.
The vinyl and federal are much stronger,

182
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:43.160
10 kilocalories stronger.
The Benzel and Allie Hill are,
uh,

183
00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:45.960
about 10 kilocalories weaker.
Right?

184
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.880
So let's see if based on what we,
uh,
uh,
we did last semester,

185
00:11:50.881 --> 00:11:53.980
we can understand why this might be so,
uh,

186
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
are these unusual bond association energies to be explained as unusual bonds

187
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:05.520
that is the bonds are unusually strong or weak or is that the radicals are

188
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.460
unusually strong or weak?
This is compared to what?
Right?

189
00:12:09.461 --> 00:12:13.150
We have the starting material and go to the products where the bond is broken.

190
00:12:13.151 --> 00:12:17.350
We go up and energy by these amounts.
Okay.
The question is,

191
00:12:17.351 --> 00:12:20.860
are things unusual because the starting bond does not,

192
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.590
is weak or unusually strong,
right?

193
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:28.510
Or is it because the radical is unusually stable or unusually unstable?

194
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.420
Right?
Compared to what?
So,

195
00:12:31.421 --> 00:12:36.280
let's look at a couple of these cases and see if we can understand a first,

196
00:12:36.281 --> 00:12:37.450
let's look at vinyl,

197
00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:41.500
which is the h attached to a carbon that's double bonded.

198
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.490
Now,
if we look at the radical,
we see that we have a somo.

199
00:12:45.491 --> 00:12:49.180
So there's the possibility for interacting with something and changing its

200
00:12:49.181 --> 00:12:50.014
energy.

201
00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:55.320
But notice that the homos and Lumos that it might interact with our Pi and Pi

202
00:12:55.930 --> 00:13:00.930
Star and there's no special stabilization because they're perpendicular to one

203
00:13:01.481 --> 00:13:03.910
another.
There are [inaudible],
there's no overlap.

204
00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:08.440
So there's no reason that having this double bond should make that radical,

205
00:13:08.441 --> 00:13:12.070
unusually stable.
Right?
Even though,

206
00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:15.610
and notice that it's not that that in fact is,

207
00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:20.260
is hard to break as if this were unstable,
but it's neither stable or unstable.

208
00:13:20.261 --> 00:13:23.560
It's just what it is.
Okay.
On the other hand,

209
00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:27.940
if we look at the starting material where we have this ch bond notice that as

210
00:13:27.941 --> 00:13:32.230
compared to these others,
which are a hundred plus or minus five,

211
00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:37.030
that this one is made from an sp squared carbon,
right?

212
00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:40.480
So very good overlap.
So in this case,

213
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.320
it's that the bond is unusual,
the bond is unusually strong.

214
00:13:44.321 --> 00:13:48.870
The radical is nothing special.
It's very hard to break.
Okay?

215
00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:53.590
Now if we,
so it's hard.
It's 111 okay.

216
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.630
The same thing is true in the federal radical where again,
the,

217
00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:03.520
the ch bond we're talking about is attached to a double bonded carbon right

218
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.460
here.
It's part of a benzene ring,
but again,

219
00:14:06.461 --> 00:14:11.080
the unusual energy orbitals in the ring are perpendicular.

220
00:14:11.081 --> 00:14:15.700
They don't overlap with the singly occupied orbital we're talking about,

221
00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:19.930
right?
Therefore,
nothing special here.
But again,

222
00:14:19.931 --> 00:14:24.500
it's an SP squared carbon to hydrogen bond.
And again,
it's unusually strong.

223
00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.560
113 kilocalories per mole.

224
00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:31.570
So these are unusual because the starting material has an unusually strong bond.

225
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:32.890
Okay.

226
00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:37.870
Now let's look at these others alley and benzol where it's an unusually easy

227
00:14:37.871 --> 00:14:39.610
bond to break.
Okay,

228
00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:45.120
now we looked at the allium radical where we've broken h off this carbon and now

229
00:14:45.731 --> 00:14:49.090
what's different about that as compared to the ones above?

230
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:54.110
We broke the h off,
we got a p or a bottle that has the uh,

231
00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.200
the singly oc single occupancy.

232
00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:02.240
Anybody got an idea about whether it's going to be usual or unusual?

233
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.770
Yeah,
Sebastian,
pardon me?
Uh,

234
00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:13.460
now it can mix with the Pi star cause it's going in and out of the,

235
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:17.960
of the plane.
Right?
So now it overlaps with the Pi and Pi Star.

236
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:21.920
Now what's that going to do?
Well,
here's the singly occupied orbital,

237
00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:25.640
the red one here.
Here's Pi star vacant.
They'll mix.

238
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:29.930
That would suggest that the single electron would go down in energy,
right?

239
00:15:29.931 --> 00:15:31.970
That would be good.
However,

240
00:15:31.971 --> 00:15:35.780
we should also think about the fact that there's an unusually high homo

241
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.960
associated with the blue orbitals there,
the Pi orbital,

242
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:44.560
so we could consider instead the pie and now we see that that would shift this

243
00:15:44.691 --> 00:15:48.440
electron up.
But these two electrons would go down.
Again,

244
00:15:48.441 --> 00:15:52.040
you would win more down than up right now.

245
00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.080
So this is a little schizophrenia on the part of the single he occupied oracle

246
00:15:56.081 --> 00:16:00.080
or does it move up or down?
The answer is no.

247
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.800
Right.
One of them pushes it down.
The other pushes it up,

248
00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:06.470
stays the same place it started.
Right?

249
00:16:06.471 --> 00:16:10.700
But the others go up and down.
Right?

250
00:16:10.701 --> 00:16:13.100
The ones that came from the Pi and the Pi Star.

251
00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:17.900
So you get net stabilization doing due to this pair of electrons going down.

252
00:16:17.901 --> 00:16:20.000
So we have this special Alec,

253
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:24.560
it's called stabilization from mixing the Somo with that pot,

254
00:16:24.561 --> 00:16:27.560
with the Pi and Pi Star orbitals adjacent to one another.

255
00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:31.760
So this radical is unusually stable.
On the other hand,

256
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:36.620
the starting material,
the bond was just a regular old sp three ch bond.

257
00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:38.690
Nothing special there.
Okay?

258
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.470
So as compared to here where the starting material was unusual,

259
00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:47.330
unusually strong here,
the product is unusually stable,
right?

260
00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:52.520
And the same thing is true so that it's easy to break 89 kilocalories per mole.

261
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:57.710
And the same is true for the Benzel radical where the p orbital on the adjacent

262
00:16:57.711 --> 00:17:01.700
carbon again,
can overlap with the Pi System of the benzene ring.

263
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.980
So you get special stability and it only takes 90 kilocalories per mole.
Okay?

264
00:17:06.981 --> 00:17:11.981
So that we can understand these special cases of a bond strengths of a bond and

265
00:17:15.351 --> 00:17:17.300
therapies.
Okay.

266
00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:22.780
Now we spoke last semester about the halogenation of alkanes.

267
00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.580
So you're at ease.

268
00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:30.610
We can use these bond association energies to do some calculations about the

269
00:17:31.041 --> 00:17:35.960
possibility of doing halogenation of alkanes.
So let's just take as an example,

270
00:17:35.961 --> 00:17:39.940
methane,
some various die halogen,
uh,

271
00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.270
molecules.

272
00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:45.650
And we can trade partners a double displacement sort of reaction as they called

273
00:17:45.651 --> 00:17:49.620
it in the early days and make methyl acts and Hx,
right?

274
00:17:49.621 --> 00:17:53.340
So we break the red bonds and form the green bonds.

275
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:57.180
So we have a cost to pay and breaking bonds.

276
00:17:57.181 --> 00:18:00.870
We had a return from making the bonds and we're going to see whether we get a

277
00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:05.010
net profit from trying to run this operation.
Okay,

278
00:18:05.011 --> 00:18:08.730
so we're going to do it for fluorine,
chlorine,
bromine,
and I are done.
Now,

279
00:18:08.731 --> 00:18:11.610
of course,
in all those cases,
the ch bond is the same.

280
00:18:11.611 --> 00:18:15.330
It's 105 kilocalories per mole by now,

281
00:18:15.331 --> 00:18:18.810
but the halogen halogen bonds are different.
Right?

282
00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.910
It's a strongest for you.

283
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:27.000
It's fairly weak for flury,
strong for chlorine,

284
00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:32.180
but then weaker again for rural mean at back to the start for die done.

285
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:35.610
Right.
What does that tell you?

286
00:18:35.611 --> 00:18:38.910
That as you go down the rows of the periodic table,

287
00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:44.130
you don't get some monotonic up or down in the bond strength,

288
00:18:44.131 --> 00:18:45.330
but it goes up and down.

289
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:49.170
What do you infer from that kind of thing when you get curves?

290
00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:54.400
Yeah,
Q factors.
Uh,

291
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:58.480
there must be at least two factors involved in this.
Okay.

292
00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:02.560
And those factors are probably the overlap of the Sigma Bond,

293
00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:07.630
which is best for fluorine,
fluorine,
but the interaction of unshared pairs,

294
00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:12.700
which is worst for fluorine.
Okay?
So you have two things going on,
okay?

295
00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:13.300
Anyhow,

296
00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.780
we can add those two together to see what it's going to cost us to break those

297
00:19:16.781 --> 00:19:19.180
two bonds.
Uh,

298
00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:23.260
and there are the values that are in the range of 150 kilocalories per mole.

299
00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.140
But then when we do the reaction,

300
00:19:26.141 --> 00:19:31.060
we're going to profit by making the bonds on the right so that we have various

301
00:19:31.061 --> 00:19:35.470
values for the carbon x bond that we got out of that table we just showed.

302
00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:41.050
And for the Hx Bod and there's the return we get.
Okay.
Now is this,

303
00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.990
are these going to be favorable reactions?
Well,

304
00:19:43.991 --> 00:19:47.950
in the case of a fluorine,
it's wildly favorable.

305
00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:50.980
It's favorable by 109 kilocalories per mole,

306
00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:55.600
<v 1>right?
But,</v>

307
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.770
<v 0>uh,
it's only 19 kilocalories per mole for chlorine,</v>

308
00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.280
only nine for bromine,

309
00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.170
and it's 12 kilo calories uphill in the case of iodine.

310
00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:13.450
So you're not going to make a profit if you try to set up a factory to convert

311
00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:17.650
methane and iodine to methyl iodide and Ahi.

312
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:23.020
In fact,
you'd want to run it the opposite direction,
right?
Okay.

313
00:20:23.021 --> 00:20:25.480
But the others,
at least overall are favorable.

314
00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:30.310
So we know from equilibrium now that for three of the Halogens,

315
00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:32.650
this reaction should be favorable.

316
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:38.080
And for one of them it should be unfavorable,
right?
So,

317
00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:42.190
but how about the rate?
How fast will it be?

318
00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:47.830
Okay?
Now if this were the mechanism,
first you break bonds,

319
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:53.160
then you change partners and reattach the activation energy for getting up to

320
00:20:54.011 --> 00:20:55.720
the transition state for this,

321
00:20:55.721 --> 00:21:00.430
where both bonds are broken is going to be this cost,
right?

322
00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:04.540
So his break two bonds that make to a plausible mechanism,

323
00:21:04.541 --> 00:21:07.720
could we get our rate that's reasonable on the basis of that?
Well,

324
00:21:07.721 --> 00:21:11.260
how do you go about,
if you know the activation energy you have to get to,

325
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:14.440
how do you go about calculating the rate,
Debbie?

326
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:20.530
Right?
It's 10 to the 13th per second times 10 to the

327
00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:27.490
10 to the minus three fourths of that energy.
Okay?
So let's think about it then.

328
00:21:27.491 --> 00:21:30.250
In this case,
suppose we take one of these,

329
00:21:30.251 --> 00:21:34.120
it's about 140 right?
So at room temperature,

330
00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:39.340
300 Kelvin,
which is where your approximation works,
the three fourths,
right?

331
00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:44.470
We find that it's 10 to the 13th per second times 10 to the minus one oh six

332
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.350
three fourths of one of these numbers,
right?

333
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:51.280
So it'll be 10 to the minus 93 per second,
right?

334
00:21:51.281 --> 00:21:55.240
That's a very unfavorable number.
So forget that.

335
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:59.380
There's no way of mechanism like that could work under at room temperature.

336
00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:01.700
What might you be able to do to,

337
00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.380
to realize such a reaction in,
yeah,

338
00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.870
Amy higher temperature.

339
00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:12.220
So he's supposed to go to 3000 Kelvin instead of 300 Kelvin.

340
00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:17.590
Now instead of three fourths,
it's three fortieths.
Okay?

341
00:22:17.591 --> 00:22:19.540
So if we go to 3000 Kelvin,

342
00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:24.840
then it's 10 to the 13th times 10 to the minus 10.6 which would be 250 times a

343
00:22:25.061 --> 00:22:27.460
second.
Right?
So that's,

344
00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:32.670
that would be accessible except that there probably is something else that could

345
00:22:33.821 --> 00:22:38.050
happen when you're at that very high temperature.
Okay?
So,

346
00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:40.750
so that this fundamentally,

347
00:22:40.751 --> 00:22:45.751
this is not a reasonable mechanism and we already know a better way to go about

348
00:22:46.211 --> 00:22:50.840
it from looking at these potential energy surfaces for,
uh,

349
00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:54.250
transferring and out of,
in between two other atoms.
Okay.

350
00:22:54.251 --> 00:22:59.170
Remember we start with h plus h two and then we can move around on this surface

351
00:22:59.171 --> 00:23:03.790
and have for colinear three ages,
we can get the energy for different,

352
00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:08.530
uh,
differences between two of the H's and the other two H's,

353
00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.113
right?

354
00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:13.630
So there's the product we want to go to where a hydrogen has been transferred

355
00:23:13.631 --> 00:23:16.240
from the right to the left.
And one way to do it,

356
00:23:16.241 --> 00:23:20.800
the way we've been talking about is to go by way of three separate Adams,

357
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:25.870
right?
Which means we go up there way up in energy,
very slow.

358
00:23:25.871 --> 00:23:28.600
And once we get there,
then we go down,
hey,

359
00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:33.910
but it's very hard to get up to this plateau,
okay?
On the other hand,

360
00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:35.320
as we know from the marble,

361
00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:40.000
the way it actually works is to transfer a hydrogen between two rather than to

362
00:23:40.001 --> 00:23:42.100
break a bond first and then make a bot.

363
00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:46.400
So make it as you break it that way and that's going to be much faster.

364
00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:50.960
So this kind of displacement reaction is the way we want to do it to make a new

365
00:23:50.961 --> 00:23:54.560
bond as we break the old one,
okay,

366
00:23:54.561 --> 00:23:57.650
that's how we're going to do it and we already talked about this last semester.

367
00:23:57.651 --> 00:24:00.080
First you take fluorine and you break its bond,

368
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:04.880
that's going to require some energy,
okay?
But once you have the free radical,

369
00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:09.290
then you can transfer a hydrogen atom making a bond as you break a bond.

370
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:12.560
So going through that pass rather than over the big plateau.

371
00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:16.700
And now the product of that is hcl one of the products you want,

372
00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:21.140
but the other one is another free radical made without having to spontaneously

373
00:24:21.141 --> 00:24:25.930
break a bond and now it can react with cl two to give the other product we

374
00:24:25.931 --> 00:24:29.720
bought in the chlorine atom and we then have been go back to the beginning and

375
00:24:29.721 --> 00:24:32.900
this free radical chain,
and this is what we talked about last semester.

376
00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:35.870
Okay?
Another way of writing.

377
00:24:35.871 --> 00:24:40.160
The same thing is to say we can have the starting materials here at the top,

378
00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:45.020
left and bottom right,
the halogen and the,
uh,
and the Alkane and first,

379
00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.110
and when we can have an x out of that,
we got somehow,

380
00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:53.000
it could be by heat breaking a relatively weak bond.
It could be by light,

381
00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:57.200
it could be by some chemical reaction that generates a free radical.

382
00:24:57.201 --> 00:24:58.700
But somehow we get a radical,

383
00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:03.350
then it can react in a hydrogen atom transfer to give one of the products,

384
00:25:03.351 --> 00:25:06.080
the green xh chair at another radical,

385
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:10.220
and it can react with the halogen to give the other product and go back where

386
00:25:10.221 --> 00:25:11.054
you started.

387
00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:16.520
So what we have is a cyclical machine that just cranks round and round,

388
00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:22.340
right?
So what is,
it preserves the radicalness of the situation.

389
00:25:22.341 --> 00:25:25.580
You don't have to break any new bonds spontaneously,

390
00:25:25.581 --> 00:25:27.170
only to get the first radical.

391
00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:32.600
Now we're going to talk about this some more also later on.
Uh,
but,

392
00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:36.920
but,
uh,
to look now at how we're going to rearrange things.

393
00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:40.490
If you wanted to have a mechanism for a very reasonable rate,

394
00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:44.090
what you're going to do is trade to of these columns,
right?

395
00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:47.030
Instead of breaking two and then making too,

396
00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:52.240
we'll trade those two columns so that on the left we make and break on the

397
00:25:52.911 --> 00:25:56.120
right.
In step two we make and break,
right?

398
00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.890
So now when we look at how much each of these take,

399
00:25:58.891 --> 00:26:03.440
step one now in the case of fluorine is actually favorable,
right?

400
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:08.480
Step two is wildly favorable that the case of Florida and overall it's very

401
00:26:08.481 --> 00:26:12.260
favorable as we knew.
But now you can see that these others,

402
00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.780
although overall favorable,

403
00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:19.580
one of the steps is unfavorable but not drastically unfavorable,

404
00:26:19.581 --> 00:26:24.380
only uh,
two or 10 or 20 kilocalories per mole.

405
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:26.720
That kind of barrier,
you could get over.

406
00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:30.350
You can't get over the barriers of 50 kilocalories or more,

407
00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:32.630
but so now you have two steps.

408
00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:37.190
Each of them are very simple make as you break out of transfer,
right?

409
00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:39.440
And of course here,

410
00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:42.380
the first one is so high that you're not going to be able to get over it.

411
00:26:42.381 --> 00:26:45.480
And even if you could,
you wouldn't give their product,
it would run,

412
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:50.150
the reaction would run backwards.
Okay,

413
00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:54.680
so how can we,
so we know the energies of the,

414
00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:58.910
of the starting material and products for each of these steps,

415
00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.940
but we don't really know the activation energy,

416
00:27:01.941 --> 00:27:05.330
how much you have to come up before you come down,
right?

417
00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:09.570
And that's what we're going to be starting to look at next lecture,
right?
Is how,

418
00:27:09.571 --> 00:27:14.571
how can we predict the activation energy for a simple one step reaction if we

419
00:27:15.711 --> 00:27:19.280
know how exothermic or endothermic it is.

420
00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:26.130
But even if we could predict the rate of step one or step two,

421
00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:29.460
there's still a problem because this,

422
00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:33.180
the overall process is not just one step,
it's two steps.

423
00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:36.870
And how would we know the overall rate if there are two reactions,

424
00:27:36.871 --> 00:27:39.420
steps going on.
This is a little more complicated.

425
00:27:39.421 --> 00:27:44.421
So we're going to take a little digression now to learn to cope with complex

426
00:27:45.181 --> 00:27:48.120
reactions that involves several steps.
Okay?

427
00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:52.440
So this is a digression on reaction order and complex reaction.

428
00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:55.650
Now the reaction order is the kinetic,

429
00:27:55.710 --> 00:28:00.450
the rate analog of the law of mass action that we talked about at the end last

430
00:28:00.451 --> 00:28:02.040
time.
Remember just statistical,

431
00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:06.060
how likely is it that they're going to be two things next to one another,
right?

432
00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:09.600
The same thing getting next to one another is the same problem.

433
00:28:09.601 --> 00:28:13.170
If they things are going to react with one another in getting to the transition

434
00:28:13.171 --> 00:28:14.070
state as well.

435
00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:19.460
So there's going to be a dependence of rate on concentration the same way that

436
00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:23.550
equilibrium depends on concentrations as we saw last semester.

437
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000
And moreover this dependence of the rate on concentration can give us

438
00:28:29.701 --> 00:28:33.720
information about what kinds of mechanism the reaction might be undergoing.

439
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:39.030
So that's why we're particularly interested in it now just to go look at some

440
00:28:39.031 --> 00:28:41.100
simple ideas first.
Uh,

441
00:28:41.101 --> 00:28:45.900
the rate is how much per second say or per minute or hour or a day or whatever.

442
00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:49.580
How much per second?
Okay,
so we could have a faucet,

443
00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:52.680
we turn it on and the water comes out a certain rate per second.

444
00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.310
Now what would happen if you had two faucets?

445
00:28:59.560 --> 00:28:59.810
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

446
00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:03.620
<v 0>well if things were simple,
the rate would double.
You know,</v>

447
00:29:03.621 --> 00:29:04.680
if you think carefully about it,

448
00:29:04.681 --> 00:29:08.240
it won't quite be that cause there might be a restriction in how much water can

449
00:29:08.241 --> 00:29:11.420
get to the two faucets.
But in a simple point of view,

450
00:29:11.421 --> 00:29:14.640
you double the number of faucets,
you'd double the rate.
Okay.

451
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:19.100
There's another way of doubling the rate,
which is to use a bigger faucet,

452
00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:24.410
one that's twice as big twice the cross sectional area.
Okay.

453
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:28.100
Now in chemistry we can do the,

454
00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:32.590
we can look at how many moles are molecules we get per second.
Right.

455
00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:38.080
And if we have one a beaker and then have another beaker or a single beaker with

456
00:29:39.081 --> 00:29:42.550
twice the volume,
we doubled the rate.
Okay.

457
00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:45.700
So that will double the rate.
But chemists are clever.

458
00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.280
They can not only change the volume,

459
00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.000
they can also change the concentration in the same volume.

460
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:54.190
And that's the question we have.

461
00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:57.430
Obviously you would expect it to get faster if you have more stuff,

462
00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:00.490
but how much faster.
Okay,
we'll it double.

463
00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:04.810
So this has to do with what are called rate laws.

464
00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:09.430
What that exponent is going to be that says if you check,
if you double the rate,

465
00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:13.210
if you double the concentration of a reagent,
how much will the rate change,

466
00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.840
the number of molecules you get per second.
Okay,

467
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:21.870
so the rate is that the increase in product with time and it's then there's a

468
00:30:23.441 --> 00:30:27.850
rate law that some constant times the concentration of something,

469
00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:32.770
right?
And maybe several concentrations.
But that question mark is the exponent.

470
00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.650
What power do we rate?
Do we raise it to,
that's what we mean.

471
00:30:35.651 --> 00:30:37.990
And talking about the kinetic order,

472
00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:43.350
if it's to the zero power,
it's a zero order,
the first power,
first daughter,

473
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:47.320
second power,
second order and so on.
Okay?
But those,

474
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:51.730
those exponents we'll have to do with what the mechanism of the reaction is.

475
00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.940
And so the only way to discover it is by experiment.

476
00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:00.270
So let's first look at some simple one step reactions and then we're going to

477
00:31:00.271 --> 00:31:05.110
look at complicated reactions.
Okay?
So on a simple one step reaction,

478
00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:09.880
you could have zero order.
This sounds weird,
doesn't it?

479
00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:13.540
That the rate doesn't depend on how much material you have.

480
00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:15.670
You double the amount of material,

481
00:31:15.671 --> 00:31:19.360
double the concentration of material and it doesn't change the rate.

482
00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:24.510
Alright,
now how can that be?
Well,

483
00:31:24.511 --> 00:31:28.650
here's a picture that helps illustrate it for a sheep getting one field to the

484
00:31:28.651 --> 00:31:33.570
other.
Now in this situation,
if he,
if the shepherd had more sheep,

485
00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.000
would the rate increase?

486
00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:41.120
What'd you get cheap from one field to the other?
Faster?
No,

487
00:31:41.121 --> 00:31:44.180
they're going as fast as they can.
No matter how many sheep are lined up.

488
00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:45.933
<v 1>Okay.</v>

489
00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.860
<v 0>Because it's saturated.</v>

490
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:52.700
It can't go any faster because of how wide he's opening the gate.

491
00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:55.323
<v 1>Okay.</v>

492
00:31:55.390 --> 00:32:00.390
<v 0>So there are real cases like this in chemistry where you have a catalyst that's,</v>

493
00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:04.210
that's involved in converting the starting material to the product.

494
00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:09.220
When the catalyst is working as fast as it possibly can,
you increase it.

495
00:32:09.221 --> 00:32:12.070
The starting material isn't going to increase the rate of the reaction that

496
00:32:12.071 --> 00:32:16.060
anymore.
The,
the uh,
the gate can't open any wider.
Right?

497
00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:20.050
And that's often the case with enzymes.
Okay.

498
00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:25.540
So you have the substrate,
uh,
the starting material,
which reacts,

499
00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:28.210
which interacts with the catalyst in order to do,
to product.

500
00:32:28.211 --> 00:32:32.800
But if the catalyst is rate limiting,
if it's saturated,
you can't go any faster.

501
00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:36.340
So the rate then is proportional to how much catalyst do you have.

502
00:32:36.341 --> 00:32:39.370
Of course if you doubled the amount of catalyst under those situations,

503
00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:44.000
you double the rate,
but the substrate is raised to the zero power.

504
00:32:44.001 --> 00:32:47.480
It doesn't make any difference.
Okay.
So,

505
00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:52.610
so the rate is actually just proportional to the catalyst independent of the,

506
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.340
of the substrate.
Right.
But if the catalyst was,

507
00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.410
if the,
if doing the experiment,

508
00:33:00.411 --> 00:33:03.560
you didn't realize that there was a catalyst in there doing it,

509
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:06.320
you just thought it was happening spontaneously,

510
00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:10.430
then you'd say it's zero order.
All right,

511
00:33:10.431 --> 00:33:14.390
so that's a zero order reactions.
Zero order kinetics.
Okay.

512
00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:15.920
Uh,

513
00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:20.630
but that works only when the sheep are really crowded here.

514
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:24.650
If the sheep were all over the fields and some coming through,

515
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:27.740
if the concentration were lower,
then uh,

516
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:30.380
having more sheep would allow them to get through faster.

517
00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:34.090
You're not saturating the catalyst.
So if the,
it's,

518
00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:38.810
but it becomes first order in substrate when you have very low concentration of

519
00:33:38.811 --> 00:33:42.440
substrate.
But at some higher concentration it becomes zero order.

520
00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:47.210
So it's always in principle possible to lower the concentration until it becomes

521
00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:51.650
first order.
But in fact,
under many conditions it would be zero order.

522
00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:55.700
Okay,
so that's an example of zero order.

523
00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:58.940
Uh,
now,

524
00:33:58.941 --> 00:34:02.840
first order says the rate is proportional to the first power of the amount of

525
00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:06.440
reagent you're using.
And that's of course very reasonable.

526
00:34:06.441 --> 00:34:11.270
It's like the water coming through the taps or something like that.
Okay.
Now,

527
00:34:11.271 --> 00:34:13.800
if you have first order kinetics,
the,

528
00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:17.990
the amount of product you get in time looks like this.

529
00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:22.790
It's an exponential approach to the,
to the a hundred percent,
right?

530
00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:26.930
Or this particular one is drawn with a certain rate constant.

531
00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:30.260
If the rate constant,
we're faster,
it would rise more quickly.

532
00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:33.500
If the rate constant were lower,
it would rise more slowly,

533
00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:38.420
but always it would go in this case to 100%.
Okay.
You could,

534
00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:40.190
instead of monitoring the product,

535
00:34:40.191 --> 00:34:42.380
you could look at the disappearance of starting material,

536
00:34:42.381 --> 00:34:45.470
which is that an exponential decay,
just the same thing upside down.

537
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.930
Now,

538
00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:52.930
so exponential decay means you have a constant so-called halflife.

539
00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:56.840
Now I chose 0.69 here for a reason.

540
00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.240
It's because the half life,

541
00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:04.600
the time it takes for half the material to go away is 0.69 divided by whatever K

542
00:35:05.871 --> 00:35:06.530
is.

543
00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:11.150
So if I chose a k two B 0.69 the half life is one.

544
00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:16.190
Okay.
So after one minute,
one second,
pardon me,

545
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:21.430
the half of the half the material remains after another one second quarter than

546
00:35:23.391 --> 00:35:26.960
an eighth than a 16th and so on.
Right?
And that's,

547
00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:28.850
that's the necessary,

548
00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:33.880
you can prove it easily by mathematics with a four for a first order reaction,

549
00:35:34.491 --> 00:35:37.930
there is a repeating halflife.
Okay.

550
00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:42.280
Now suppose you have a more complex situation where the,

551
00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:45.400
it's first order kinetics but it's reversible.

552
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:48.880
So the starting material at a certain rate constant goes to the product.

553
00:35:48.881 --> 00:35:51.610
But the product can also come back to starting material,

554
00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:53.350
suppose at a much lower rate.

555
00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.073
<v 1>Okay.</v>

556
00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:59.210
<v 0>So once you reach equilibrium,
the two rates balance.</v>

557
00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:03.590
So things cease changing,
right?
In fact,
you know,

558
00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:07.400
in the 19th century equilibrium rate,

559
00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:12.440
the equilibrium situations where initially discussed not as equilibria but as

560
00:36:13.431 --> 00:36:14.720
balanced rates,

561
00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:16.333
<v 1>right?</v>

562
00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:20.600
<v 0>Uh,
so at any rate,
they're the same thing.
So,
uh,</v>

563
00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:24.370
whatever k one is times the concentration of starting material will be equal.

564
00:36:24.371 --> 00:36:28.630
Whatever.
What k minus one is kinds of concentration of product.
Okay.

565
00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:34.380
Or we could take the divide through by starting material here in k one over

566
00:36:34.421 --> 00:36:35.830
here.
So,
uh,

567
00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:39.580
so k one over k minus one is the equilibrium constant.

568
00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:42.853
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

569
00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:47.300
<v 0>So now you approach the product doesn't go to 100% nor the starting material to</v>

570
00:36:47.301 --> 00:36:48.560
zero.
Right?

571
00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:53.270
But if you start with all starting material that you get these exponential

572
00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:57.770
behaviors add,
it's still exponential.
That's what's interesting.

573
00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:02.600
Right?
But it doesn't approach zero.
Right?
So here,

574
00:37:02.601 --> 00:37:05.870
after one second where with that rate constant,

575
00:37:05.871 --> 00:37:10.770
you would've fallen behalf you don't fall quite to have,
right?

576
00:37:10.771 --> 00:37:12.360
Because some stuff is coming back.

577
00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:13.903
<v 1>Okay.</v>

578
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:19.700
<v 0>But if you go to,
to the ultimate goal of equilibrium here,</v>

579
00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:21.630
<v 1>yeah.</v>

580
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:25.530
<v 0>Then you find the notice.
The equilibrium constant is three.</v>

581
00:37:25.531 --> 00:37:29.250
I chose that to be a third of that.
So there's uh,
uh,

582
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:34.550
so there's one quarter of the red material and three quarters of the blue

583
00:37:34.831 --> 00:37:39.720
material at equilibrium.
So,
but if we draw this at 25%,

584
00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:44.970
the,
the value that the starting material actually approaches as some topically

585
00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:46.050
exponentially,

586
00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:51.120
we find now there is a repeating halflife,
right?

587
00:37:51.121 --> 00:37:52.920
This is truly an exponential,

588
00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:58.410
but the interesting thing is that it's an exponential decay to the equilibrium

589
00:37:58.411 --> 00:37:59.244
mixture,

590
00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:04.250
but the half life is how is 0.69 divided by the sum of the two rate constants.

591
00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:10.320
Again,
this is easy to demonstrate using calculus,

592
00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:14.880
but it's just sort of cute that you add forward and reverse rate constants

593
00:38:14.881 --> 00:38:18.000
together to get how rapidly it approaches equilibrium.

594
00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:20.730
<v 1>Okay,</v>

595
00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:25.470
<v 0>so there's a for there for starter reactions,
both just one way and reversible.</v>

596
00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:29.850
Now second order reactions proportional to the square of a,

597
00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:34.830
that's obviously true if two A's have to get together in order to,
to,
to uh,

598
00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:37.510
to uh,
reach the transition state.

599
00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:42.040
But it could also be second order if you have an a interacting with a B.

600
00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:47.250
In that case you say it's first order in a and first order and B and second

601
00:38:47.591 --> 00:38:48.520
order overall.

602
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:50.623
<v 1>Okay.</v>

603
00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:55.300
<v 0>But what if B is effectively constant?</v>

604
00:38:56.290 --> 00:39:00.130
So as time goes on,
a is decreasing,

605
00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:04.930
but B is not decreasing.
How could that possibly be the case?

606
00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:08.500
How could you have a reaction where B doesn't decrease?

607
00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:16.480
Well,
AH,
B we're a catalyst that doesn't get consumed.

608
00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:21.040
That's one way.
Another way is that the,

609
00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:24.940
that the bee is in gross excess compared to a,

610
00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.670
so even though a consumes a B,

611
00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:31.870
it doesn't change its concentration appreciably because the concentration is so

612
00:39:31.871 --> 00:39:35.890
large compared to that of a,
so if B is much greater than a,
you get that.

613
00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:40.950
And in that situation you say that you can neglect be by incorporating it into

614
00:39:43.601 --> 00:39:47.200
the K,
right?
Whatever B is,

615
00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:51.100
it's not changing for all.
You know,
when you're doing the experiment,

616
00:39:51.101 --> 00:39:53.140
you might not even know there's a catalyst there,

617
00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:57.220
but it's there and always the same amount.
You always get the same rate constant.

618
00:39:57.221 --> 00:40:01.360
And in a situation like that,
you say it's pseudo first order.

619
00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:03.580
It behaves as if it's first order,

620
00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:06.400
even though it really depends on something else as well.

621
00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:11.800
And so you can have a second order process,
could be a pseudo first order rate,

622
00:40:11.801 --> 00:40:15.460
con,
uh,
constant.
For example,
suppose be where the solvent,

623
00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:21.280
right then it appears that it's a first order reaction even though it turned out

624
00:40:21.281 --> 00:40:25.090
that the solvent had to react with the thing in order to do it.
Okay,

625
00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:27.520
so that's pseudo first order.

626
00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:32.620
Now if you have a second order reaction compared to a first order reaction,

627
00:40:32.621 --> 00:40:36.610
that isn't a regular second order reaction where two molecules of a have to get

628
00:40:36.611 --> 00:40:41.410
together.
What you find is that a first order reaction goes like this,

629
00:40:41.411 --> 00:40:45.100
but second orders starts faster and slower.

630
00:40:45.101 --> 00:40:46.930
So it's no longer exponential.

631
00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:50.650
Obviously it's decreasing but not with a half life.
Not Exponentially.

632
00:40:50.651 --> 00:40:54.340
Not a repeating halflife cause it gets slower as it goes along because it

633
00:40:54.341 --> 00:40:58.300
depends on the square of the concentration.
So it slows faster.

634
00:40:58.301 --> 00:41:00.740
It's not exponential.
There is no constant halflife.

635
00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:03.190
So that's how you would know that something is second order.

636
00:41:03.191 --> 00:41:06.280
You measure how much in the first increment of time,
the second instrument,

637
00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:07.900
and they're not exponential.

638
00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:14.770
And now we'll get on to complex reactions and the idea of the rate limiting

639
00:41:14.771 --> 00:41:15.604
step.

640
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:20.830
So suppose you go to an intermediate and then it goes to product.

641
00:41:20.831 --> 00:41:24.850
But suppose the transition state energies are like this,
right?

642
00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:27.670
So it's very slow to get to the intermediate,

643
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:33.070
but once you're at the intermediate at rapidly goes to product.
Right now,

644
00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:36.680
this reactive,
intermediate never builds up.

645
00:41:36.681 --> 00:41:40.910
You never have an appreciable amount of it because even if it were equilibrium

646
00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:44.630
with this,
there's very little of it with a big energy difference here.

647
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:48.590
So you might not even know that that intermediate is there,
right?

648
00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:53.450
You get there and it immediately goes to product.
In that case,
uh,

649
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:58.910
the,
the who cares really about what the rate this is.
As long as it's fast,

650
00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:02.600
the rate is which you get product is the rate at which you get this.

651
00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:05.090
It never builds up.
Every time you get it,

652
00:42:05.091 --> 00:42:09.070
it goes immediately to product or very quickly.
So this first step then,

653
00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.300
even though it's a two step reaction,

654
00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:14.660
the first step is the one who's rate makes a difference.

655
00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.790
If you double the rate of the first step,

656
00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:20.210
then you'll double the overall rate of the reaction,
right?

657
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:22.790
Because the second step doesn't make any difference.

658
00:42:22.791 --> 00:42:26.840
So that's called the rate limiting step.
Right?
On the other hand,

659
00:42:26.841 --> 00:42:31.700
suppose that that first reaction is fast and the second one is slow,
right?

660
00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:36.590
So you have a rapid pre equilibrium formed between these two.
Again,

661
00:42:36.591 --> 00:42:38.270
not very much of the intermediate,

662
00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:43.340
but they reaches an equilibrium concentration compared to this or almost and

663
00:42:43.341 --> 00:42:45.410
then slowly it goes to product.

664
00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:51.160
Now two things that are in equilibrium with the same thing are in equilibrium

665
00:42:51.771 --> 00:42:52.610
with each other.

666
00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:56.930
So to the extent that that intermediate is in equilibrium with the starting

667
00:42:56.931 --> 00:43:01.931
material and we treat the rate of going over here as an equilibrium between the

668
00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:08.420
intermediate and this transition state,
we could also pretend that the,

669
00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:13.340
that the transition state is in equilibrium with the starting material since

670
00:43:13.341 --> 00:43:16.730
they're both in equilibrium with the intermediate,
right?

671
00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:20.630
So now who cares that there's an intermediate,
that there's a first step,

672
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:24.530
we can calculate the rate just on the basis of getting how much of this

673
00:43:24.531 --> 00:43:28.760
transition state there is by assuming it's in equilibrium with that starting

674
00:43:28.761 --> 00:43:33.200
material.
All right.
Okay,

675
00:43:33.201 --> 00:43:38.201
so now the second step or the second transition state is rate limiting.

676
00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:42.050
All we have to know is how high it is compared to the starting material.

677
00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:46.580
We don't care about the intermediate so you can have one step or the other step

678
00:43:46.581 --> 00:43:49.130
be rate limiting,
right?

679
00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:54.260
Or if they're not drastically different,
both of them could affect the rate,

680
00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:57.980
right.
Many cases,
one or the other is is rate limiting.

681
00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:01.850
But if you want to see how it works out in a,
in a complicated case,

682
00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:05.930
we're having a starting material that can go reversibly to the intermediate and

683
00:44:05.931 --> 00:44:09.740
then the intermediate goes to product all with certain rate constants.
Uh,

684
00:44:09.741 --> 00:44:12.920
there's a,
on the website you can get an excel program,

685
00:44:12.921 --> 00:44:17.090
which is a crummy excel program.
I'm sorry,
it executes very slowly.
Uh,

686
00:44:17.091 --> 00:44:19.790
you can change the parameters to make it go a little faster,

687
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:23.630
but you can put in what energy you want for the starting material,

688
00:44:23.631 --> 00:44:28.040
the intermediate and the product and what energy you want for the transition

689
00:44:28.041 --> 00:44:29.300
state one and two,

690
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:34.750
and see how the overall compares with what you would have calculated if it had

691
00:44:35.041 --> 00:44:39.120
been just the first step that you had to get over or just the second step that

692
00:44:39.121 --> 00:44:42.870
you had to get over in this particular case where each of these is about

693
00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:46.500
something between a kilo,
calorie in a kilo,
calorie and a half.

694
00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:50.840
The difference between those two and the difference between these two,
uh,

695
00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:55.770
you get this.
Okay,
so this is the actual a rate.

696
00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:59.610
Notice.
The amount of starting material immediately falls quickly.

697
00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:02.640
That's when you're establishing equilibrium between these two.

698
00:45:02.641 --> 00:45:07.320
So starting material is going to intermediate and then slowly it goes away as

699
00:45:07.321 --> 00:45:10.080
the starting material.
As the intermediate goes to product,

700
00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:12.360
here's the intermediate,

701
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:17.710
immediately builds up to some concentration and then it changes very slowly.

702
00:45:17.761 --> 00:45:22.140
It stays fairly stable for any short period of time.

703
00:45:23.590 --> 00:45:26.000
<v 1>Okay.
Uh,
now,
uh,</v>

704
00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:31.030
<v 0>if you,
if this,
if you didn't have the first barrier and had only the second one,</v>

705
00:45:31.031 --> 00:45:32.560
it was a one step reaction.

706
00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:37.060
This is what you would have calculated for those same energies.
So not too bad.

707
00:45:37.061 --> 00:45:39.060
So in fact,
the second state,

708
00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:42.010
the second transition state is pretty much rate limiting.

709
00:45:42.011 --> 00:45:46.060
You get pretty much the same result,
right?
On the other hand,
if you didn't,

710
00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:49.780
if transition state too weren't there and you only had to get over transition

711
00:45:49.781 --> 00:45:54.640
state one,
then you'd have that blue one there.
If it were the sole barrier,
right?

712
00:45:54.641 --> 00:45:58.510
So very far from that,
but you don't make us,
even in this situation,

713
00:45:58.511 --> 00:46:03.100
you don't make a very big mistake if you just ignore the intermediate and the

714
00:46:03.101 --> 00:46:07.300
transition step and the first transition state and said it was only transition

715
00:46:07.301 --> 00:46:12.100
state too.
It's rate limiting,
right?
And if you,
if you fiddle with this,

716
00:46:12.101 --> 00:46:16.030
you'll find that that if you start changing these differences very much,

717
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:19.450
then one of them or the other one becomes clearly rate limiting.

718
00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:21.010
You get much better agreement.

719
00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:23.830
<v 1>Okay.
Now</v>

720
00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:27.340
<v 0>I said that this was between the kilocalories,
kilocalories and a half.</v>

721
00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:30.520
Three fourths of that is about one.
So the ratio,

722
00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:34.930
the equilibrium ratio is about 10 or actually I said nine here,

723
00:46:34.931 --> 00:46:37.360
nine times as much starting material is intermediate.

724
00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:43.020
So once the intermediate reaches its steady sort of equilibrium,

725
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:48.510
a relationship with the starting material after this very quick rise here,

726
00:46:48.881 --> 00:46:49.810
once you get there,

727
00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:54.310
then there's nine times as much starting material is there is an intermediate

728
00:46:54.311 --> 00:46:57.850
that's nine times as much as this.
Okay,

729
00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:02.530
and that persists.
Then that ratio,
it's when you get to here,

730
00:47:02.531 --> 00:47:05.110
it's nine times as much of one or the other and so on.

731
00:47:06.350 --> 00:47:07.183
<v 1>Okay?</v>

732
00:47:07.610 --> 00:47:12.110
<v 0>Now this is also a factor of 10 between this.
What?
That's that's,</v>

733
00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:13.910
this has to do with rates.
Remember?

734
00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:19.270
So this is how fast the intermediate goes back to starting material is 10 times

735
00:47:19.461 --> 00:47:24.461
faster than how fast it goes to product because of those differences in the,

736
00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:27.910
in the delta h of activation,

737
00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:29.343
<v 1>right?</v>

738
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:34.720
<v 0>And what that means is that once the intermediate reaches at steady state,</v>

739
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:39.340
it's equilibrium relationship with a starting material,
it reads,

740
00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:43.480
it re yields product one 10th as fast as it is formed.

741
00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:47.980
So it's,
it forms very rapidly.
You can see that here,
right?

742
00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:53.220
But now individual molecules are still being formed just as rapidly or almost as

743
00:47:53.231 --> 00:47:57.610
rapidly,
but they're going away just as rapidly as they are formed,
right?

744
00:47:57.970 --> 00:48:02.970
Every one that's formed at a certain rate goes back to starting material 10

745
00:48:04.511 --> 00:48:09.100
times for every time it goes to product for uh,
nine times,

746
00:48:09.101 --> 00:48:10.870
for every time it goes to product,
right?

747
00:48:11.170 --> 00:48:14.260
So a 10th of the time it goes on to product.

748
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:19.660
So now the rate of going from starting material to product is however fast it

749
00:48:19.661 --> 00:48:24.661
goes over the first one times one 10th cause it's not changing the,

750
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.430
it's reached us so called steady state.
This,

751
00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:33.910
it's changing very slowly.
Individual molecules are growing very rapidly,

752
00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:38.740
but it's so the rate of an individual molecule to go from starting material or

753
00:48:38.741 --> 00:48:42.640
product is how fast it goes to intermediate times the 10th.

754
00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:44.553
Okay.

755
00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:50.130
So that's a sequential reactions to the idea of the rate limiting step now,

756
00:48:50.301 --> 00:48:53.680
and a really interesting concept is fractional order,

757
00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:56.260
but I see that we've reached the time now,

758
00:48:56.261 --> 00:48:58.900
so we'll have to wait for fractional orders in the next lecture.
