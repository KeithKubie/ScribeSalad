Both the HTML, and the CSS are critical resources. So this is 2. We had to get,

00:00:07.437 --> 00:00:14.710
both resources. Yep. 5 kilobytes for the HTML and 4 kilobytes for the CSS.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.770
so that's, a 9, total kilobytes. And

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.107
critical path length. Hm. Let's see, best case

00:00:22.107 --> 00:00:26.570
scenario, I think there are two round trips. One round trip to get the HTML and

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.030
then receive its response. And then another round trip to get the CSS

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.000
and receive its response. So I think the critical path length is 2.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.360
&gt;&gt; Correct. Great stuff.
