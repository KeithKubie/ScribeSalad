00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.410
worked with the head of growth at Google
on this one as well and the thing he

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:55.420
on this one as well and the thing he
 

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.300
on this one as well and the thing he
really gave us as a key takeaway is

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:57.310
really gave us as a key takeaway is
 

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:59.699
really gave us as a key takeaway is
don't include everything from the app

00:08:59.699 --> 00:08:59.709
don't include everything from the app
 

00:08:59.709 --> 00:09:01.500
don't include everything from the app
just the key moments and the key

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:01.510
just the key moments and the key
 

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.170
just the key moments and the key
journeys and the first thing this did

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:04.180
journeys and the first thing this did
 

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.300
journeys and the first thing this did
for us actually was show that we have

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:06.310
for us actually was show that we have
 

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:08.370
for us actually was show that we have
some problems and this at the end that

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:08.380
some problems and this at the end that
 

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.740
some problems and this at the end that
weird mustardy call it bit where it's

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:10.750
weird mustardy call it bit where it's
 

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.870
weird mustardy call it bit where it's
essentially like an exit point the user

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:12.880
essentially like an exit point the user
 

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.910
essentially like an exit point the user
doesn't flirt the user journey doesn't

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:14.920
doesn't flirt the user journey doesn't
 

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.250
doesn't flirt the user journey doesn't
come all the way back around so this was

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:17.260
come all the way back around so this was
 

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.269
come all the way back around so this was
the first useful part of building

00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:20.279
the first useful part of building
 

00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:24.090
the first useful part of building
building this model so the next thing

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:24.100
building this model so the next thing
 

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.370
building this model so the next thing
was about the North Star metric and now

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:26.380
was about the North Star metric and now
 

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.470
was about the North Star metric and now
this is an interesting one because for

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:28.480
this is an interesting one because for
 

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.269
this is an interesting one because for
us it's pretty simple so our mission as

00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:30.279
us it's pretty simple so our mission as
 

00:09:30.279 --> 00:09:32.670
us it's pretty simple so our mission as
a company as you can see is to make

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:32.680
a company as you can see is to make
 

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.889
a company as you can see is to make
being being self-employed easier than

00:09:34.889 --> 00:09:34.899
being being self-employed easier than
 

00:09:34.899 --> 00:09:38.910
being being self-employed easier than
being employed and so if we want to make

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:38.920
being employed and so if we want to make
 

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.259
being employed and so if we want to make
this easier the best thing we can do is

00:09:42.259 --> 00:09:42.269
this easier the best thing we can do is
 

00:09:42.269 --> 00:09:46.590
this easier the best thing we can do is
quite simple there we go

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:46.600
quite simple there we go
 

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.990
quite simple there we go
ace collects transactions the more

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:49.000
ace collects transactions the more
 

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.850
ace collects transactions the more
transactions we collects for a user the

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:50.860
transactions we collects for a user the
 

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.860
transactions we collects for a user the
more we can provide value and it's all

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:52.870
more we can provide value and it's all
 

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.980
more we can provide value and it's all
about providing that value so

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:54.990
about providing that value so
 

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.930
about providing that value so
transactions per user is and is a really

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:57.940
transactions per user is and is a really
 

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.819
transactions per user is and is a really
easy one for us but then we break it

00:09:59.819 --> 00:09:59.829
easy one for us but then we break it
 

00:09:59.829 --> 00:10:01.980
easy one for us but then we break it
down per product so with one tap

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:01.990
down per product so with one tap
 

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:04.980
down per product so with one tap
receipts the obvious thing here is the

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:04.990
receipts the obvious thing here is the
 

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:07.680
receipts the obvious thing here is the
transaction in that is a receipt receipt

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:07.690
transaction in that is a receipt receipt
 

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:10.829
transaction in that is a receipt receipt
per user now the tricky part here and

00:10:10.829 --> 00:10:10.839
per user now the tricky part here and
 

00:10:10.839 --> 00:10:12.680
per user now the tricky part here and
the thing that really throws off was

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:12.690
the thing that really throws off was
 

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:16.440
the thing that really throws off was
what's more important users adding a lot

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:16.450
what's more important users adding a lot
 

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:17.880
what's more important users adding a lot
of receipts or a lot of users just

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:17.890
of receipts or a lot of users just
 

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:20.250
of receipts or a lot of users just
adding a few receipts so again you've

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:20.260
adding a few receipts so again you've
 

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.540
adding a few receipts so again you've
got to think about the value and the

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:21.550
got to think about the value and the
 

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:24.360
got to think about the value and the
value is them you know if they give us

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:24.370
value is them you know if they give us
 

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:26.519
value is them you know if they give us
more data we can then help them with

00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:26.529
more data we can then help them with
 

00:10:26.529 --> 00:10:29.699
more data we can then help them with
their taxes and do everything for them

00:10:29.699 --> 00:10:29.709
their taxes and do everything for them
 

00:10:29.709 --> 00:10:32.730
their taxes and do everything for them
essentially so it is all about receipts

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:32.740
essentially so it is all about receipts
 

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.560
essentially so it is all about receipts
per user and the more receipts the

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:34.570
per user and the more receipts the
 

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:38.579
per user and the more receipts the
better so then we put it into our growth

00:10:38.579 --> 00:10:38.589
better so then we put it into our growth
 

00:10:38.589 --> 00:10:40.199
better so then we put it into our growth
model as you saw is like this really

00:10:40.199 --> 00:10:40.209
model as you saw is like this really
 

00:10:40.209 --> 00:10:42.870
model as you saw is like this really
long document of all things the whole

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:42.880
long document of all things the whole
 

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.199
long document of all things the whole
equation of the growth model so I didn't

00:10:46.199 --> 00:10:46.209
equation of the growth model so I didn't
 

00:10:46.209 --> 00:10:47.970
equation of the growth model so I didn't
put all that in because it's just too

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:47.980
put all that in because it's just too
 

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.759
put all that in because it's just too
much and it's really boring but when we

00:10:50.759 --> 00:10:50.769
much and it's really boring but when we
 

00:10:50.769 --> 00:10:52.590
much and it's really boring but when we
first wrote that out it is about 16

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:52.600
first wrote that out it is about 16
 

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.110
first wrote that out it is about 16
pages of this document and he was crazy

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120
pages of this document and he was crazy
 

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.000
pages of this document and he was crazy
so again

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:57.010
so again
 

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:58.769
so again
we took the idea of just dumbing it down

00:10:58.769 --> 00:10:58.779
we took the idea of just dumbing it down
 

00:10:58.779 --> 00:11:00.629
we took the idea of just dumbing it down
and making it something that anybody can

00:11:00.629 --> 00:11:00.639
and making it something that anybody can
 

00:11:00.639 --> 00:11:03.470
and making it something that anybody can
understand and the headline here was

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:03.480
understand and the headline here was
 

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.210
understand and the headline here was
receipts added per user and it's broken

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:06.220
receipts added per user and it's broken
 

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:10.740
receipts added per user and it's broken
down by the Mau divided by the receipt

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:10.750
down by the Mau divided by the receipt
 

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.930
down by the Mau divided by the receipt
submissions and then it's the receipt

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:12.940
submissions and then it's the receipt
 

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.150
submissions and then it's the receipt
submissions as you can see defined by

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:15.160
submissions as you can see defined by
 

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.400
submissions as you can see defined by
the different entry points and new and

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:17.410
the different entry points and new and
 

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:20.819
the different entry points and new and
returning users so what was interesting

00:11:20.819 --> 00:11:20.829
returning users so what was interesting
 

00:11:20.829 --> 00:11:22.889
returning users so what was interesting
in here as I said we're really proud of

00:11:22.889 --> 00:11:22.899
in here as I said we're really proud of
 

00:11:22.899 --> 00:11:24.420
in here as I said we're really proud of
the analytics and the tracking that we

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:24.430
the analytics and the tracking that we
 

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:27.840
the analytics and the tracking that we
put in with it within the app but while

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:27.850
put in with it within the app but while
 

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:29.610
put in with it within the app but while
we started working on this we suddenly

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:29.620
we started working on this we suddenly
 

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.230
we started working on this we suddenly
realized hang on we're not tracking this

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:31.240
realized hang on we're not tracking this
 

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.460
realized hang on we're not tracking this
this and this and these are all things

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:32.470
this and this and these are all things
 

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.980
this and this and these are all things
that provide value and make it easier

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:34.990
that provide value and make it easier
 

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:38.220
that provide value and make it easier
for us to deliver our Northstar metric

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:38.230
for us to deliver our Northstar metric
 

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:40.079
for us to deliver our Northstar metric
so suddenly it made us realized we've

00:11:40.079 --> 00:11:40.089
so suddenly it made us realized we've
 

00:11:40.089 --> 00:11:42.210
so suddenly it made us realized we've
got to go back and update our analytics

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:42.220
got to go back and update our analytics
 

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.449
got to go back and update our analytics
and things like that and with this

00:11:45.449 --> 00:11:45.459
and things like that and with this
 

00:11:45.459 --> 00:11:47.040
and things like that and with this
growth model one of the most interesting

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:47.050
growth model one of the most interesting
 

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:50.160
growth model one of the most interesting
things it did was that it made it easier

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:50.170
things it did was that it made it easier
 

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:53.910
things it did was that it made it easier
for us to explain to the CEO who I won't

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:53.920
for us to explain to the CEO who I won't
 

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.680
for us to explain to the CEO who I won't
bash in this session today because it's

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:55.690
bash in this session today because it's
 

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:56.340
bash in this session today because it's
that right there

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:56.350
that right there
 

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:58.620
that right there
I Nick its building as well actually

00:11:58.620 --> 00:11:58.630
I Nick its building as well actually
 

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:02.340
I Nick its building as well actually
which is even worse so it made it so he

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:02.350
which is even worse so it made it so he
 

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:04.110
which is even worse so it made it so he
could see why the the mail comes from

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:04.120
could see why the the mail comes from
 

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.329
could see why the the mail comes from
and then the CFO could see worth all the

00:12:06.329 --> 00:12:06.339
and then the CFO could see worth all the
 

00:12:06.339 --> 00:12:08.430
and then the CFO could see worth all the
revenue comes from and products who's

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:08.440
revenue comes from and products who's
 

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.340
revenue comes from and products who's
also sitting there could see what what

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:11.350
also sitting there could see what what
 

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:13.199
also sitting there could see what what
essentially would work next to what

00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:13.209
essentially would work next to what
 

00:12:13.209 --> 00:12:15.360
essentially would work next to what
levers to pull to get the most amount of

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:15.370
levers to pull to get the most amount of
 

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:18.509
levers to pull to get the most amount of
value so then we put it into this

00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:18.519
value so then we put it into this
 

00:12:18.519 --> 00:12:22.850
value so then we put it into this
calculator this growth model spreadsheet

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:22.860
calculator this growth model spreadsheet
 

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:25.439
calculator this growth model spreadsheet
this is just the the first part of it

00:12:25.439 --> 00:12:25.449
this is just the the first part of it
 

00:12:25.449 --> 00:12:27.870
this is just the the first part of it
but again you can see here with the

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880
but again you can see here with the
 

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.120
but again you can see here with the
starting values essentially what happens

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:30.130
starting values essentially what happens
 

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:33.120
starting values essentially what happens
over ten days and this is just the high

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:33.130
over ten days and this is just the high
 

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:35.009
over ten days and this is just the high
level it goes further into detail as you

00:12:35.009 --> 00:12:35.019
level it goes further into detail as you
 

00:12:35.019 --> 00:12:36.780
level it goes further into detail as you
go into it but again was boring to show

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:36.790
go into it but again was boring to show
 

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:39.840
go into it but again was boring to show
you nobody really wants to see that but

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:39.850
you nobody really wants to see that but
 

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:41.069
you nobody really wants to see that but
the best thing is it's all it's a

00:12:41.069 --> 00:12:41.079
the best thing is it's all it's a
 

00:12:41.079 --> 00:12:44.100
the best thing is it's all it's a
predictor and this an in this calculator

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:44.110
predictor and this an in this calculator
 

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.290
predictor and this an in this calculator
the spreadsheet we actually renamed it

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:46.300
the spreadsheet we actually renamed it
 

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.430
the spreadsheet we actually renamed it
as a calculator that's why I keep

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440
as a calculator that's why I keep
 

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.110
as a calculator that's why I keep
calling you that because to be honest

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.120
calling you that because to be honest
 

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.579
calling you that because to be honest
nobody really cares about spreadsheets

00:12:50.579 --> 00:12:50.589
nobody really cares about spreadsheets
 

00:12:50.589 --> 00:12:54.269
nobody really cares about spreadsheets
especially myself calculator because it

00:12:54.269 --> 00:12:54.279
especially myself calculator because it
 

00:12:54.279 --> 00:12:57.230
especially myself calculator because it
helps us predict what we can do so

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:57.240
helps us predict what we can do so
 

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.129
helps us predict what we can do so
absolutely while bringing in the

00:12:59.129 --> 00:12:59.139
absolutely while bringing in the
 

00:12:59.139 --> 00:13:01.079
absolutely while bringing in the
equation from the previous one I'm gonna

00:13:01.079 --> 00:13:01.089
equation from the previous one I'm gonna
 

00:13:01.089 --> 00:13:02.970
equation from the previous one I'm gonna
go back that one so once we had this

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:02.980
go back that one so once we had this
 

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.170
go back that one so once we had this
equation and we put it into the

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:04.180
equation and we put it into the
 

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.630
equation and we put it into the
spreadsheet we suddenly started

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:06.640
spreadsheet we suddenly started
 

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.510
spreadsheet we suddenly started
questioning where the value was as well

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:08.520
questioning where the value was as well
 

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:09.920
questioning where the value was as well
so there was a lot of things we put into

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:09.930
so there was a lot of things we put into
 

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:12.050
so there was a lot of things we put into
the original model that suddenly just

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:12.060
the original model that suddenly just
 

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:15.260
the original model that suddenly just
made no sense so we really it really

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:15.270
made no sense so we really it really
 

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:17.570
made no sense so we really it really
gave us a good lesson on how what we

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:17.580
gave us a good lesson on how what we
 

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.700
gave us a good lesson on how what we
should be tracking and why so it was

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:19.710
should be tracking and why so it was
 

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:23.690
should be tracking and why so it was
really useful all right and then the

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:23.700
really useful all right and then the
 

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:26.030
really useful all right and then the
next part these what the model actually

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.040
next part these what the model actually
 

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.700
next part these what the model actually
gave us so the first thing is it gave us

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:28.710
gave us so the first thing is it gave us
 

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:32.060
gave us so the first thing is it gave us
clarity about what it would cross all

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:32.070
clarity about what it would cross all
 

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:33.350
clarity about what it would cross all
departments about what it is we're doing

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360
departments about what it is we're doing
 

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:37.520
departments about what it is we're doing
so like the CEO Nick no longer had SIL I

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:37.530
so like the CEO Nick no longer had SIL I
 

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.170
so like the CEO Nick no longer had SIL I
asked about why the mal was coming from

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:39.180
asked about why the mal was coming from
 

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.390
asked about why the mal was coming from
and how we could increase it clear as

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:41.400
and how we could increase it clear as
 

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.880
and how we could increase it clear as
day in this model and then products

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:43.890
day in this model and then products
 

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:45.860
day in this model and then products
didn't have to like necessarily ask what

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:45.870
didn't have to like necessarily ask what
 

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:48.170
didn't have to like necessarily ask what
are we gonna do next what's priority is

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:48.180
are we gonna do next what's priority is
 

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.920
are we gonna do next what's priority is
all based on this and the CFO knew that

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:51.930
all based on this and the CFO knew that
 

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:54.200
all based on this and the CFO knew that
by increasing revenue we increase

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:54.210
by increasing revenue we increase
 

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:55.550
by increasing revenue we increase
retention so they could see from the

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:55.560
retention so they could see from the
 

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.620
retention so they could see from the
growth model as well essentially what is

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:57.630
growth model as well essentially what is
 

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:58.630
growth model as well essentially what is
happening next

00:13:58.630 --> 00:13:58.640
happening next
 

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.310
happening next
although the CFO dis just still

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:01.320
although the CFO dis just still
 

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.520

sometimes go very Jerry Maguire and show
 

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:07.370
sometimes go very Jerry Maguire and show
me the money but that's yeah it's not

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:07.380
me the money but that's yeah it's not
 

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:08.780
me the money but that's yeah it's not
too bad

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:08.790
too bad
 

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:10.970
too bad
and then the resource is the big thing

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:10.980
and then the resource is the big thing
 

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.340
and then the resource is the big thing
we realized is that because we're a seat

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:13.350
we realized is that because we're a seat
 

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:15.890
we realized is that because we're a seat
up and we do a lot with finances we

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:15.900
up and we do a lot with finances we
 

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.690
up and we do a lot with finances we
should be putting a lot of priority into

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:17.700
should be putting a lot of priority into
 

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.150
should be putting a lot of priority into
accountants right and that's something

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160
accountants right and that's something
 

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.040
accountants right and that's something
we've not really done too much of in the

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:22.050
we've not really done too much of in the
 

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:23.960
we've not really done too much of in the
past so it's a huge wake up call that is

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:23.970
past so it's a huge wake up call that is
 

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.270
past so it's a huge wake up call that is
a huge lever there that if we put more

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:26.280
a huge lever there that if we put more
 

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.670
a huge lever there that if we put more
effort into that we could essentially

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:28.680
effort into that we could essentially
 

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.980
effort into that we could essentially
get lots more users a lot easier and

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:30.990
get lots more users a lot easier and
 

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:33.530
get lots more users a lot easier and
help them keep retained now that also

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:33.540
help them keep retained now that also
 

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.440
help them keep retained now that also
helped with hires so one of the problems

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:36.450

that we came up with was every single

idea has to be iterable which means that

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:28.090
idea has to be iterable which means that
 

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:32.070

we should start small we should take

every feature as an MVP and then iterate

every feature as an MVP and then iterate
 

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:38.460
every feature as an MVP and then iterate
if it is successful we think that the

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:38.470
if it is successful we think that the

so as soon as we roll out the feature

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:43.270
so as soon as we roll out the feature
