00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.400
"There’s something out there, you know,
something under that sand."

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.340
According to one of the best movies of all
time, it’s probably a mummy.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.249
Hey guys.

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:15.429
Julia here for DNews
Can you believe we’ve never talked about

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:16.780
mummies before on DNews?

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.380
They’re like one of the gateway drugs to
science!

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.850
The practice of preserving the dead probably
arose accidently.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.960
Burying the dead in a pit of sand where it’s
dry, might make a mummy.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.930
It’s easy to imagine how a body preserved
in an almost life like state became spiritually

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.399
significant, I mean many religions consider
the incorrigibility of a body to be a spiritual

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.399
sign.

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.480
Mummies first fascinated the public in the
early 1900s when people would unwrap them

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.760
in public performances.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.550
Dr. Kathleen Sheppard from the Missouri University
of Science and Technology says these events

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.589
were “poised between spectacle and science”.

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.989
It’s kind of a morbid fascination but we
can learn so much from mummies.

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.790
Like spiritual practices of an ancient culture,
or even want people ate thousands of years

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:58.790
ago.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.239
The most famous.. or maybe infamous is the
ancient Egyptian mummification process, which

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.390
dates back to about 3400 BCE.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.470
We all learned about this when we were kids.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.110
This process removes all moisture from the
body, kind of like turning a grape into a

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.110
raisin.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.470
After removing the internal organs, the bodies
were dried out using natron, which is made

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.620
up of soda ash and baking soda.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.720
After being cleaned, the bodies were wrapped
in linen and coated in resin.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.140
This whole process, including building a sarcophagus
and other tomb things, was pretty expensive.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.580
So it was usually reserved for the higher
ups or wealthy.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.030
But ancient Egypt isn’t the only culture
to practice preserving their dead.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.660
The oldest mummies on Earth are from Chinchurro
culture in South America and date back nearly

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.640
2,000 years before the Egyptians.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.190
In preparation for burial, bodies were stripped
of all their soft tissues, then the skin was

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.060
stuffed with vegetable matter, finally the
whole body was covered in clay.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.430
But these mummies are in danger from degradation
from climate change.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.430
The part of Chile where the bodies are kept
is notoriously dry, like hasn’t seen a drop

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.230
of rain in hundreds of years dry.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.480
Yet maybe due to a changed climate, there’s
an uptick of moisture in the air that makes

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.190
the mummies’ skin fertile breeding ground
for hungry bacteria.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.030
Some of these mummies are turning into black
ooze.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.470
So cool right?

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.500
Gross, I mean totally gross.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.130
Other mummies include some found in the Canary
Islands, which were preserved using a method

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.850
similar to the Egyptian process.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.569
But rather than linen, the Guanche people
used animal hides to wrap the body.

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.140
Buddhist Monks in China practice a form of
self-mummification.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.130
The process starts when the monk lives on
a diet of nuts, seeds, and water for 1,000

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.130
days.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.569
Afterwards the monk basically buries himself
alive in small burial chamber and chants.

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.640
He would have a small bell to ring to let
people know he was still alive.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.280
When the bell stopped ringing, the chamber
would be completely sealed.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.920
After three years, the chamber would be opened
to see how preserved the body was.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.490
If well-preserved they body would then be
placed in shrines and worshiped.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.520
Italian Monks in the 16th and 17th mummified
their fellow monks by embalming them and dehydrating

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.950
them on ceramic pipes.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.770
The Capuchin Catacombs of Palermo hold over
8000 bodies, including some wealthy and famous

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.110
people of the time.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.370
Some of which are eerily well preserved.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.650
So basically, we’re surrounded by mummies!

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.930
Does that give you the chills?

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:06.930
Got questions?
