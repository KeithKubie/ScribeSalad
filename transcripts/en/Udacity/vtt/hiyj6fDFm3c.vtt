00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here we are in our Editor

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
and I've got the framework of a basic application.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And this is actually the framework I've been using for

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
the homeworks and stuff that I've been doing.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I've been using this notion of templates,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
which is not something I'm going to explain thoroughly in this class.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But instead of doing string substitutions for big wads of HTML,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
we can keep our HTML in separate files that look like HTML

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and that have just little escapes for variables.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I'll be using that in this example,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and you're free to use them on the homeworks yourself

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
if you're tired of doing string substitutions

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
for generating large chunks of text.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And also--this kind of little framework, we can provide if you'd like to use that.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So all I've done is--

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
You may recognize this as a standard Google App Engine app.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I added a class, called Handler,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
which this inherits from the webapp2 handler,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
which is what you normally use.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And I've just added a couple of convenience functions.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I made a function called "write" which

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
just calls: response.out.right

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
so I don't have to type that all the time.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I made a function called render_str,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
which takes a template name

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and it returns a string of that rendered template.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And then I made another function called render,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
which instead of returning just the string,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
it calls "write" on it.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And I've got a Main Handler down here--MainPage--

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
which is mapped to from 'SLASH'

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and all this does is it writes this string, ("asciichan!"), to the browser.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So let's go ahead and switch to the browser, real quick,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and make sure this is working.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Here we are, in our browser.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We're printing: asciichan! Okay, all is well.
