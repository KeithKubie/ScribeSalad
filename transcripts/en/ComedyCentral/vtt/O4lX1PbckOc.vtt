00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:08.107
You were thinking
about it the whole time

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.842
it was happening before you?

00:00:09.875 --> 00:00:11.944
The guy that was --
had the apartment,

00:00:11.977 --> 00:00:12.945
the one that was yelling.

00:00:12.978 --> 00:00:14.313
"Shut up!"

00:00:14.346 --> 00:00:16.049
Yeah, that was --
Let me tell you something.

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:18.384
If the other guy said

00:00:18.417 --> 00:00:20.219
that the yeller
was one of the big problems

00:00:20.252 --> 00:00:21.821
why he couldn't
live with him,

00:00:21.854 --> 00:00:23.089
I'd believe him.

00:00:23.122 --> 00:00:24.524
I'd go, "Well,
he's proven himself today

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:25.992
to be a crazy person."

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:27.260
But that wasn't
his complaint.

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:29.062
He became the parent
for no reason.

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:30.696
He still owes him the money.
So, guess what?

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:33.433
Even if it was $300 a month,
then guess what?

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:35.301 line:83%
Then he deserves
everything he wants.

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:35.301
[ Lighter clicks ]

00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:37.370
If it's any amount of money,
he should get all the money.

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:38.871
And don't tell me
the place he lived at

00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:40.773
wasn't at least
worth $300 a month.

00:00:40.806 --> 00:00:42.275
So, where's that
[bleep] money?

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:43.876
So, give him all of the money.

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:46.112
The other guy's a [bleep]
rip-off artist, and he knows it.

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:47.480
And he might not
be a yeller,

00:00:47.513 --> 00:00:49.782
but I bet today,
it brings the rage out in him

00:00:49.815 --> 00:00:51.784
and he sees that guy
sitting there [bleep] yelling.

00:00:51.817 --> 00:00:53.019
He has a temper problem,

00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:54.587
but maybe he's [bleep] right,
that other guy.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.721
Who gives a [bleep]

00:00:55.754 --> 00:00:59.325
Guess what, we still pay
the [bleep] rent.

00:00:59.358 --> 00:01:00.894
What do you think?

00:01:03.362 --> 00:01:05.965
We were worried that
your energy would sag...

[ Laughter ]

00:01:05.998 --> 00:01:09.969
...after three --

00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:12.672
three cases,
but you can really handle --

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:16.543
you can handle
a big docket.
