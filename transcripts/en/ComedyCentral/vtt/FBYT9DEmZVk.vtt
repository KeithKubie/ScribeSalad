ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER
RELEASED THE FINDINGS OF HIS

00:00:02.668 --> 00:00:03.970 align:start position:0% line:91%
INVESTIGATION INTO THE ACTIONS
OF POLICE MANY FERGUSON,

00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:04.537 align:start position:0% line:85%
MISSOURI.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:05.705 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'M CURIOUS.

00:00:05.738 --> 00:00:08.408 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHATEVER DID HE FIND?

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:11.978 line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
RELEASED A 105-PAGE REPORT THAT

00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:15.448 size:78% position:39% line:91%
OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED WHAT
PROTESTERS IN FERGUSON,

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:18.518 line:91%
MISSOURI, HAVE BEEN CLAIMING FOR
MONTHS, THAT LONG BEFORE BROWN'S

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:25.992 size:84% position:42% line:91%
KILLING, FERGUSON POLICE
TARGETED AFRICAN-AMERICANS.

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:29.362 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: NO (BLEEP)!

00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:30.396 align:start position:0% line:85%
SERIOUSLY, GUYS.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.869 size:78% position:39% line:91%
THE REPORT CONCLUDES THE
FERGUSON COPS ARE RACIST?

00:00:36.902 --> 00:00:38.237 size:88% position:44% line:91%
I CAME TO THAT CONCLUSION ON
CHAPTER FOUR OF THE REPORT I

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.208 align:start position:0% line:85%
PUBLISHED LAST AUGUST.

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:46.746 align:start position:0% line:91%
LARRY WILMORE'S INVESTIGATION OF
THE FERGUSON POLICE

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:48.982 align:start position:0% line:91%
DEPARTMENT -- LET'S SEE --
(APPLAUSE)

00:00:51.383 --> 00:00:53.052 align:start position:0% line:85%
OH, HERE IT IS.

00:00:53.085 --> 00:00:53.453 align:start position:0% line:85%
CHAPTER 4.

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:54.053 align:start position:0% line:85%
RIGHT HERE.

00:00:54.086 --> 00:00:55.955 align:start position:0% line:85%
I HAD IT.

00:00:55.988 --> 00:00:57.490 align:start position:0% line:85%
CHAPTER 4.

00:00:57.523 --> 00:01:00.593 align:start position:0% line:91%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I'M TELLING YOU.

00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:02.395 line:85%
THAT WAS EXHAUSTIVE RESEARCH.

00:01:02.428 --> 00:01:05.531 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:01:05.564 --> 00:01:07.400 size:84% position:42% line:91%
AND IN OTHER GOOD NEWS, THE
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ALSO

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:09.168 line:91%
ANNOUNCED THAT OFFICER DARREN
WILSON WILL NOT FACE FEDERAL

00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:11.671 align:start position:0% line:91%
CHARGES FOR KILLING MICHAEL
BROWN.

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:13.539 line:91%
WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE IT FREES
WILSON UP TO TRAVEL ACROSS THE

00:01:13.572 --> 00:01:16.909 align:start position:0% line:91%
COUNTRY IN A VAN SOLVING
MYSTERIES WITH GEORGE ZIMMERMAN.

00:01:16.942 --> 00:01:23.649 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
(AUDIENCE REACTS)

00:01:23.682 --> 00:01:25.585 line:91%
BUT FORGET WILSON, ERIC HOLDER'S
GOT SOME TRULY INSANE STATS IN

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:31.290 align:start position:0% line:85%
THIS REPORT.

00:01:31.323 --> 00:01:33.526 line:91%
&gt;&gt; 67% OF FERGUSON'S POPULATION
IS BLACK, BUT BETWEEN 2012 AND

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:37.163 line:91%
2014, THEY ACCOUNTED FOR 85% OF
PEOPLE PULLED OVER BY FERGUSON

00:01:37.196 --> 00:01:42.235 align:start position:0% line:91%
POLICE AND 93% OF PEOPLE
ARRESTED.

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:48.341 line:91%
WHEN POLICE USED FORCE, NEARLY
NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN, THEY USED

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:51.410 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT AGAINST BLACKS.

00:01:51.443 --> 00:01:52.879 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: NINE OUT OF TEN,
THEY USED FORCE AGAINST BLACKS?

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:53.546 size:84% position:42% line:85%
SO WHO'S THE ONE WHITE GUY?

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.681 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHAT DID HE DO?

00:01:55.714 --> 00:01:57.884 align:start position:0% line:91%
TRY TO GET IN THE WAY OF THE
POLICE BEATING UP THE NINE BLACK

00:01:57.917 --> 00:01:59.352 align:start position:0% line:85%
GUYS?

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:04.824 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)

00:02:04.857 --> 00:02:07.226 align:start position:0% line:85%
FIGURES.

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.662 align:start position:0% line:85%
STUPID ONE WHITE GUY.

00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:13.266 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT THE FERGUSON POLICE GO OUT
OF THEIR WAY TO ARREST US.

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.936 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AFRICAN-AMERICANS MADE UP
OVER 90% OF THOSE CHARGED WITH A

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:27.046 size:88% position:44% line:91%
HIGHLY DISCRETIONARY OFFENSE
DESCRIBED AS, AND I QUOTE,

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.448 align:start position:0% line:91%
"MANNER OF WALKING ALONG
ROADWAY."

00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:31.050 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: MANNER OF WALKING
ALONG THE ROADWAY?

00:02:31.083 --> 00:02:32.985 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY'RE ARRESTING BLACK GUYS FOR
WALKING?

00:02:33.018 --> 00:02:34.720 line:91%
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY, IT REMINDS
ME OF THAT OLD STANDUP JOKE --

00:02:34.753 --> 00:02:35.922 size:88% position:44% line:85%
WHITE PEOPLE WALK LIKE THIS.

00:02:35.955 --> 00:02:40.426 align:start position:0% line:91%
"I'M WALKING!"
BLACK PEOPLE WALK LIKE THIS.

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.096 align:start position:0% line:91%
(SIRENS)
WHOA, WHOA!

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:45.097 align:start position:0% line:85%
HEY, HEY!

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.499 align:start position:0% line:85%
HEY, GUYS!

00:02:46.532 --> 00:02:48.100 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'M DOING A BIT!

00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:49.536 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'M DOING A BIT!

00:02:51.170 --> 00:03:02.782 align:start position:0% line:91%
(APPLAUSE)
I'M DOING A BIT!

00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:04.517 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND WORST OF ALL, THEY TURNED
MAN'S BEST FRIEND INTO THE BLACK

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:05.685 align:start position:0% line:85%
MAN'S WORST ENEMY.

00:03:05.718 --> 00:03:07.186 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND USE OF DOGS BY FERGUSON
POLICE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:11.123 align:start position:0% line:91%
EXCLUSIVELY RESERVED FOR
AFRICAN-AMERICANS.

00:03:11.156 --> 00:03:17.863 line:91%
IN EVERY CASE IN WHICH FERGUSON
POLICE RECORDS RECORDED THE RACE

00:03:17.896 --> 00:03:20.132 align:start position:0% line:91%
OF A PERSON BIT BY A POLICE DOG,
THAT PERSON WAS

00:03:20.165 --> 00:03:25.404 align:start position:0% line:85%
AFRICAN-AMERICAN.

00:03:25.437 --> 00:03:27.440 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: SICCING DOGS ON
BLACK PEOPLE?

00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:29.008 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT'S A LITTLE ON THE NOSE,
RACIST POLICE DEPARTMENT.

00:03:29.041 --> 00:03:30.676 size:78% position:39% line:91%
YOU HAVEN'T COME UP WITH
ANYTHING NEW IN 50 YEARS?

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.315 align:start position:0% line:91%
HARPER LEE IS DROPPING FRESH
MATERIAL FASTER THAN YOU.

00:03:36.348 --> 00:03:39.819 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUSTING BLACKS HAS EVEN BECOME A
GAME TO THE WILEY FERGUSON

00:03:39.852 --> 00:03:41.988 align:start position:0% line:85%
COPPERS.

00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:44.023 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SOME OFFICERS EVEN COMPETE TO
SEE WHO CAN ISSUE THE LARGEST

NUMBER OF CITATIONS DURING A
SINGLE STOP.

00:03:48.794 --> 00:03:53.432 size:88% position:44% line:91%
A TOTAL THAT AT LEAST IN ONE

00:03:53.465 --> 00:03:58.404 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: 14 CITATIONS IN ONE
STOP?

00:03:58.437 --> 00:04:03.276 align:start position:0% line:91%
HOW MANY THINGS CAN YOU DO WRONG
WHILE DRIVING WHILE BLACK?

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:06.579 line:91%
LET'S SEE, CHANGING LANES WHILE
BLACK, ALMOST EXPIRED TAGS WHILE

00:04:06.612 --> 00:04:11.751 line:91%

HAVING OTHER BLACK PEOPLE IN THE

00:04:14.386 --> 00:04:15.521 line:85%
MAN, I CAN ONLY THINK OF SIX!

00:04:15.554 --> 00:04:18.791 align:start position:0% line:85%
THESE COMES ARE GOOD!

00:04:18.824 --> 00:04:25.998 align:start position:0% line:85%
-- THESE COPS ARE GOOD!

00:04:26.031 --> 00:04:27.500 line:91%
BUT TO BE FAIR, THE COPS AREN'T
ONLY CITING BLACKS OUT OF SPORT.

00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:29.068 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY'RE ALSO DOING IT AS A
MONEY-MAKING SCHEME.

00:04:29.101 --> 00:04:30.770 line:91%
&gt;&gt; TODAY THE CITY GENERATES A
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF REVENUE

00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:32.438 align:start position:0% line:91%
FROM THE ENFORCEMENT OF CODE
