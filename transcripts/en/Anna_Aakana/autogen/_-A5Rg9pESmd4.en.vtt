00:00:00.271 --> 00:00:01.541
So my dad was an officer

00:00:01.541 --> 00:00:02.837
in the United States Marine Corps

00:00:02.837 --> 00:00:04.176
for like, 23 years.

00:00:04.176 --> 00:00:06.662
You can imagine how disciplined he was

00:00:06.662 --> 00:00:07.860
and how disciplined he wanted

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.360
his kids to be.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.598
And how much we fucking hated it..

00:00:11.598 --> 00:00:12.539
Cause, you know, he would wake you up

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:14.482
at like 6:00AM on a saturday!

00:00:14.482 --> 00:00:15.874
And when you'd ask him,

00:00:15.874 --> 00:00:17.447
"Dad..

00:00:17.447 --> 00:00:19.416
why?"

00:00:19.416 --> 00:00:21.977
He'd give you one of those
adult cop-out answers like,

00:00:21.977 --> 00:00:23.890
"Someday you'll understand."

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:24.894
So you'd get out of bed

00:00:24.894 --> 00:00:26.328
and try to find a place to hide

00:00:26.328 --> 00:00:27.660
to get more sleep

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.298
and of course he'd find you

00:00:29.298 --> 00:00:31.160
and then send you back to your room

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.407
to go make your bed.

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:33.574
And when you'd ask him,

00:00:33.574 --> 00:00:35.176
"Dad..

00:00:35.176 --> 00:00:37.069
why?"

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.766
He's give you like,

00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:38.660
some half-assed rhyme

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.735
that's supposed to make sense

00:00:39.735 --> 00:00:40.783
to an 8-year-old.

00:00:40.783 --> 00:00:42.710
"Messy bed..

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:43.920
messy..

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.738
head."

00:00:44.738 --> 00:00:46.130
And don't forget the list of chores,

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.766
Obligated reading quota,

00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:48.767
and the required

00:00:48.767 --> 00:00:51.539
"One sport, one instrument" activities.

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.783
Needless to say, my dad was right.

00:00:53.783 --> 00:00:55.446
I mean, now that I'm an adult,

00:00:55.446 --> 00:00:58.042
I'm incredibly grateful for this structured life.

00:00:58.042 --> 00:00:59.599
I mean, he essentially trained me to

00:00:59.599 --> 00:01:01.477
value productivity,

00:01:01.477 --> 00:01:02.676
self-improvement,

00:01:02.676 --> 00:01:04.600
and--and being well balanced.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.891
And you know, my dad

00:01:05.891 --> 00:01:07.920
always reminded me of Superman.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.738
You know, like the boy scout, heart of gold,

00:01:09.738 --> 00:01:12.206
(accent) Moral compass points north!

00:01:12.206 --> 00:01:13.416
(Normal) And I mean, don't get me wrong.

00:01:13.416 --> 00:01:14.977
Superman's cool and everything,

00:01:14.977 --> 00:01:15.891
but..

00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:18.574
I'm a Batman kind of girl, you know what I'm saying?

00:01:18.574 --> 00:01:20.008
I mean, I remember--This is a great story,

00:01:20.008 --> 00:01:21.299
but I remember when I was 19

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.722
I would smoke weed in my room

00:01:22.722 --> 00:01:23.676
cause I was a total moron

00:01:23.676 --> 00:01:24.830
and I lived at home.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.236
And of course, my dad could smell it

00:01:26.236 --> 00:01:26.977
because it's weed

00:01:26.977 --> 00:01:27.637
and it reeks

00:01:27.637 --> 00:01:28.798
and it travels!

00:01:28.798 --> 00:01:30.038
So, whenever he did,

00:01:30.038 --> 00:01:32.099
he would come marching up to my room

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:33.859
and you could hear him, because the walls were so thin,

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:35.328
being like, "DUN DUN DUN DUN"

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:36.936
and so I was like, "Oh my god, he's coming!"

00:01:36.936 --> 00:01:38.068
and I would run to my bed,

00:01:38.068 --> 00:01:39.099
and I would grab a book.

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:41.420
and I would make sure it wasn't upside-down,

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.268
and then I would look as concentrated as possible.

00:01:44.268 --> 00:01:45.508
So when he walked in,

00:01:45.508 --> 00:01:47.916
he would just be ready to let me have it,

00:01:47.916 --> 00:01:49.569
but then he'd see me sitting there,

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:50.482
reading a book,

00:01:50.482 --> 00:01:51.482
and he just..

00:01:51.482 --> 00:01:52.478
he just kinda get--looks..

00:01:52.478 --> 00:01:53.798
stops for a second.

00:01:53.798 --> 00:01:55.329
And kind of process that.

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:56.416
And, you know, because you can't

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:57.630
really yell at your daughter

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.630
for getting high and then reading.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.006
Cause my dad is that guy

00:02:01.006 --> 00:02:02.707
who has never tried weed.

00:02:02.707 --> 00:02:04.391
So he doesn't know

00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:06.007
that you can't smoke

00:02:06.007 --> 00:02:06.916
and read a book.

00:02:06.916 --> 00:02:08.102
It's like..(scoffs)

00:02:08.102 --> 00:02:09.042
you'd read the same sentence

00:02:09.042 --> 00:02:11.446
over and over again.

00:02:11.446 --> 00:02:12.329
Hi mom.

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:14.539
I know you watch my videos so, uh..

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:15.422
don't tell dad.

00:02:15.422 --> 00:02:16.329
Please.

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:21.082
Uh, but I'll see you guys next Monday.
Stay awesome, Gotham.

00:02:21.082 --> 00:02:21.582
