Yamanaka for the discovery that adult

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570
Yamanaka for the discovery that adult
 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.030
Yamanaka for the discovery that adult
cells can become very potent yeah that

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040
cells can become very potent yeah that
 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.960
cells can become very potent yeah that
is really a huge discovery I mean it's

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970
is really a huge discovery I mean it's
 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.670
is really a huge discovery I mean it's
scattered a lot of the scientific world

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680
scattered a lot of the scientific world
 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.790
scattered a lot of the scientific world
when you realize that that the skin cell

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800
when you realize that that the skin cell
 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.800
when you realize that that the skin cell
for example could be turned back into

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810
for example could be turned back into
 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.469
for example could be turned back into
his cell that could do almost anything I

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479
his cell that could do almost anything I
 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.480
his cell that could do almost anything I
mean nobody would believe you if to

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490
mean nobody would believe you if to
 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.520
mean nobody would believe you if to
serve this like 50 years ago well

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530
serve this like 50 years ago well
 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.580
serve this like 50 years ago well
certainly that was I imagine surprising

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590
certainly that was I imagine surprising
 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.609
certainly that was I imagine surprising
that the cell has the ability to back up

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619
that the cell has the ability to back up
 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.760
that the cell has the ability to back up
from a mature State to an immature state

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770
from a mature State to an immature state
 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:18.510
from a mature State to an immature state
yeah

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520
yeah
 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.459
yeah
because we've been used to seeing these

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:20.469
because we've been used to seeing these
 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:24.090
because we've been used to seeing these
like a development in a river only runs

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100
like a development in a river only runs
 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.480
like a development in a river only runs
one way or yeah or a tree or whatever

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490
one way or yeah or a tree or whatever
 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.160
one way or yeah or a tree or whatever
you're telling and it can only go in one

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170
you're telling and it can only go in one
 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.919
you're telling and it can only go in one
direction and then these two guys

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929
direction and then these two guys
 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:34.169
direction and then these two guys
discover that this is not true which is

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179
discover that this is not true which is
 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:35.969
discover that this is not true which is
often the case of course in science that

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979
often the case of course in science that
 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.429
often the case of course in science that
you this time that all our truths are

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439
you this time that all our truths are
 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.440
you this time that all our truths are
not truth at all that's the beauty of

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450
not truth at all that's the beauty of
 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.360
not truth at all that's the beauty of
silence

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370
silence
 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.020
silence
but tell me first if you take John be

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030
but tell me first if you take John be

golden he said he done research with a

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120
golden he said he done research with a
 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.980
golden he said he done research with a
rather ugly frog if I should say so it's

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990
rather ugly frog if I should say so it's
 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.530
rather ugly frog if I should say so it's
a frog that lives in the water in Africa

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540
a frog that lives in the water in Africa
 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.260
a frog that lives in the water in Africa
what has he done with his father so what

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270
what has he done with his father so what
 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.520
what has he done with his father so what
he did was he took the cell of a young

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530
he did was he took the cell of a young
 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.090
he did was he took the cell of a young
frog immature cell in embryo cell and he

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100
frog immature cell in embryo cell and he
 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.969
frog immature cell in embryo cell and he
took out the nucleus from that cell and

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979
took out the nucleus from that cell and
 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.880
took out the nucleus from that cell and
he replaced that with the nucleus from a

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890
he replaced that with the nucleus from a
 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.960
he replaced that with the nucleus from a
mature tadpole and what he found was

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970
mature tadpole and what he found was
 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.040
mature tadpole and what he found was
that manipulated cell could develop into

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050
that manipulated cell could develop into
 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.820
that manipulated cell could develop into
a normal tadpole a swimming tadpole so

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830
a normal tadpole a swimming tadpole so
 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.720
a normal tadpole a swimming tadpole so
the DNA retained all the information to

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730
the DNA retained all the information to
 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.199
the DNA retained all the information to
develop the cells of a temple and this

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209
develop the cells of a temple and this
 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.860
develop the cells of a temple and this
is many years ago it's like in the late

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870
is many years ago it's like in the late
 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.660
is many years ago it's like in the late
50s or even $67 he must be very sort of

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670
50s or even $67 he must be very sort of
 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.110
50s or even $67 he must be very sort of
almost well brave and almost mad to do

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120
almost well brave and almost mad to do
 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.150
almost well brave and almost mad to do
this kind of research certainly we could

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160
this kind of research certainly we could
 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.250
this kind of research certainly we could
consider him up higher in a pioneer and

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260
consider him up higher in a pioneer and
 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.280
consider him up higher in a pioneer and
that discovery was published in 1962 so

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290
that discovery was published in 1962 so
 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.729
that discovery was published in 1962 so
it was 50 years ago and then comes our

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739
it was 50 years ago and then comes our
 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.240
it was 50 years ago and then comes our
other lawyer who is doing him even more

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250
other lawyer who is doing him even more
 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.280
other lawyer who is doing him even more
advanced thing he takes a skin cell from

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290
advanced thing he takes a skin cell from
 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.460
advanced thing he takes a skin cell from
a mouse and he treated it with some

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470
a mouse and he treated it with some
 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.220
a mouse and he treated it with some
genes and he found out that he takes

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230
genes and he found out that he takes
 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.340
genes and he found out that he takes
only like four genes to make the skin

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350
only like four genes to make the skin
 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.080
only like four genes to make the skin
cell what we could now called

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090
cell what we could now called
 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.180
cell what we could now called
pluripotent but his which me really

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190
pluripotent but his which me really
 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.650
pluripotent but his which me really
needs that it can do a lot of different

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660
needs that it can do a lot of different
 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.570
needs that it can do a lot of different
things right so he was really interested

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580
things right so he was really interested
 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.920
things right so he was really interested
in genes that confer pluripotency

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930
in genes that confer pluripotency
 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.910
in genes that confer pluripotency
cells and so you're correct he

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920
cells and so you're correct he
 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.220
cells and so you're correct he
identified four genes that he could put

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230
identified four genes that he could put
 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.190
identified four genes that he could put
into these cells and when he did that

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200
into these cells and when he did that
 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.039
into these cells and when he did that
the skin cell from a mouse became an

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049
the skin cell from a mouse became an
 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.370
the skin cell from a mouse became an
immature cell so it became pluripotent

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380
immature cell so it became pluripotent
 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.880
immature cell so it became pluripotent
of course this is not only for to play

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890
of course this is not only for to play
 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.660
of course this is not only for to play
around this is a

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670
around this is a
 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.270
around this is a
a lot of serious and they have a lot of

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280
a lot of serious and they have a lot of
 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.520
a lot of serious and they have a lot of
serious goals with this one of them

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530
serious goals with this one of them
 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.800
serious goals with this one of them
lives of course medical if you can get

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810
lives of course medical if you can get
 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.780
lives of course medical if you can get
cells like this you could use them to

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790
cells like this you could use them to
 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.570
cells like this you could use them to
treat a lot of big diseases big and

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580
treat a lot of big diseases big and
 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.750
treat a lot of big diseases big and
common diseases well I think we could

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760
common diseases well I think we could
 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.699
common diseases well I think we could
say that their discoveries really our

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709
say that their discoveries really our
 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.240
say that their discoveries really our
basic science they haven't translated

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250
basic science they haven't translated
 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.910
basic science they haven't translated
that to the clinic but what we can see

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920
that to the clinic but what we can see
 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.309
that to the clinic but what we can see
is that because of their work who are at

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319
is that because of their work who are at
 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.520
is that because of their work who are at
the forefront of examining these

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530
the forefront of examining these
 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.890
the forefront of examining these
technologies for potential clinical

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900
technologies for potential clinical
 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.140
technologies for potential clinical
application and so you're right that

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150
application and so you're right that
 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.599
application and so you're right that
there is research into how one can

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609
there is research into how one can
 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.690
there is research into how one can
utilize these IPS cells at least

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700
utilize these IPS cells at least
 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.300
utilize these IPS cells at least
inducible pluripotent stem cells to be

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310
inducible pluripotent stem cells to be
 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.350
inducible pluripotent stem cells to be
able to reprogram into different cell

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360
able to reprogram into different cell
 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.510
able to reprogram into different cell
types or new cell types that could be

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520
types or new cell types that could be
 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.879
types or new cell types that could be
used to either study disease mechanisms

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889
used to either study disease mechanisms
 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.520
used to either study disease mechanisms
for example neural cells are very

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530
for example neural cells are very
 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.190
for example neural cells are very
difficult to get from patients with this

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200
difficult to get from patients with this
 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.490
difficult to get from patients with this
technology one can develop neural cells

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500
technology one can develop neural cells
 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.390
technology one can develop neural cells
in a culture dish and study them

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400
in a culture dish and study them
 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.700
in a culture dish and study them
potentially down the line way down the

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710
potentially down the line way down the
 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.260
potentially down the line way down the
line this might be a clinical

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270
line this might be a clinical
 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.020
line this might be a clinical
application but at least today it's too

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030
application but at least today it's too
 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.540

early to say this discovery is used in

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550
early to say this discovery is used in
 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.610
early to say this discovery is used in
the clinic at this day yeah with one

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620
the clinic at this day yeah with one
 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.529
the clinic at this day yeah with one
exception and that is of course the use

00:04:59.529 --> 00:04:59.539
exception and that is of course the use
 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:02.260
exception and that is of course the use
of stem cells in blood that had be used

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270
of stem cells in blood that had be used
 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.630
of stem cells in blood that had be used
for many years to treat special and

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640
for many years to treat special and
 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.180
for many years to treat special and
cancer diseases yeah it's not actually

been done there are research efforts

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:23.300
been done there are research efforts

been done there are research efforts
into that area

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:24.680
into that area
 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.680
into that area
of course it also solves an ethical

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:27.690
of course it also solves an ethical
 

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:29.570
of course it also solves an ethical
problem because when we talked about

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:29.580
problem because when we talked about
 

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.450
problem because when we talked about
stem cells early days it was only stem

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:32.460

cells that you could get from abortions
 

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.240
cells that you could get from abortions
and now you could take yourself for I

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:38.250
and now you could take yourself for I
 

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.490
and now you could take yourself for I
guess almost any man and use from you

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:40.500
guess almost any man and use from you
 

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.380
guess almost any man and use from you
you get away from all this ethical

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:42.390
you get away from all this ethical
 

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:45.740
you get away from all this ethical

one can take cells from skin and

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:48.300
one can take cells from skin and
 

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.740
one can take cells from skin and
actually Rick you know do the same thing

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:50.750
actually Rick you know do the same thing
 

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.970
actually Rick you know do the same thing
you're bringing up an issue of the

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:52.980
you're bringing up an issue of the
 

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.400
you're bringing up an issue of the
ethical debate yeah and I think the idea

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:55.410
ethical debate yeah and I think the idea
 

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.200
ethical debate yeah and I think the idea
that one can use skin cells from an

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:57.210
that one can use skin cells from an
 

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.990
that one can use skin cells from an
adult either an animal or a human would

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000
adult either an animal or a human would
 

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.630
adult either an animal or a human would
would lessen the ethical concerns but

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:02.640
would lessen the ethical concerns but
 

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.980
would lessen the ethical concerns but
one can also imagine there may be

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:03.990
one can also imagine there may be
 

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.650
one can also imagine there may be
ethical issues there as well yeah so all

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:06.660
ethical issues there as well yeah so all
 

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.540
ethical issues there as well yeah so all
scientists need to act responsible with

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:08.550
scientists need to act responsible with
 

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.520
scientists need to act responsible with
their discoveries in application of work

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:10.530
their discoveries in application of work
 

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:14.710
their discoveries in application of work
yeah so finally how do you reach them

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:14.720
yeah so finally how do you reach them
 

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.720
yeah so finally how do you reach them
they are happy of course you're on

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:17.730
they are happy of course you're on
 

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:19.970
