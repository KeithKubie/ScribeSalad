THERE IS A SECRET CONNECTION BETWEEN YOUR
FEELINGS AND YOUR GUT.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.380
Well, there's actually over 100 million secret
connections....but who's counting?

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.250
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews!

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.680
You've probably heard sayings like: you've
got "butterflies in your stomach", "a knot

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.619
in your stomach", that what happened was "gut
wrenching".

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.690
We even use phrases like "my feelings were
hurt" - which is meant to be a metaphor, but

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.270
may have a more literal origin.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.250
We've known for a long time that sometimes
we feel our emotions physically in the body

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.390
- and in fact there are loads of MRI scans
to back it up - but why are so many of the

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.610
negative emotions (like fear, anxiety, and
disgust) felt in your stomach?

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.610
DNEWS INVESTIGATES.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.660
Dr. Anthony Komaroff of Harvard Medical Schools
explains that the answer is pretty simple

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.610
- your brain and your gut are best buds.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.690
They're in constant communication with each
other, sending signals back and forth when

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.469
your brain OR your stomach is distressed.

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.530
Specifically, they're connected through the
Enteric Nervous System, or the ENS, which

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.620
has over 100 million nerves running directly
from your brain...to your stomach.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.930
So emotional distress can cause a distressed
gut AND, strangely enough, a distressed gut

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.590
can *also* cause emotional distress.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.890
It's a two way street.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.470
What you'll notice about a lot of the emotions
that people feel in their stomach - butterflies,

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.340
the gutwrench, the knot -- is that they're
all different ways of experiencing the same

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.490
emotion: stress.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.610
When there's something that stresses you out,
it triggers the fight-or-flight response in

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:19.610
the brain.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.800
This is an instinctive physiological response
experienced by ALL animals in the animal kingdom!

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.510
It's there to protect you in dangerous situations
-- to prepare you to fight in the case of

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.580
an attack or to outrun the predator.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.400
Part of fight-or-flight's physiological response
is inhibiting the secretion of stomach juices

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.690
while diverting blood flow from the stomach
and into your lungs and muscles instead.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.000
Pair this with all the stress hormones that
your body is releasing, like adrenaline, and

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.759
it produces a physical reaction that's experienced
all over your body -- including your heart,

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:47.759
and your gut.

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.220
Because of your brain's connection to the
stomach through the Enteric Nervous System

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.869
and the stomach's involvement in digestion,
stress is also a common irritant of the digestive

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:55.869
system.

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.490
It can cause stomach aches, gas, constipation,
diarrhea, and a whole host of other wonderful

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.490
conditions.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.880
But hey -- it's all there to protect you in
the event that a lion were to attack....OR

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.479
WORSE...you'd be paired up with your crush
in science lab.

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.819
Kind of strange that we have a similar physiological
reaction to both, right?

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.349
Some evolutionary scientists say that the
human mind hasn't yet evolved to handle our

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.189
not-actually-threatening 21st century woes.

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:21.459
That's why a stress reaction meant to protect
you from being eaten alive also happens all

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:22.849
the time in everyday situations.

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.150
The more you know, right?

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.980
Thanks for joining me for DNews everyone!

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.120
What triggers YOUR stress response?

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.589
Tell me about it down below and I'll see you
next time!
