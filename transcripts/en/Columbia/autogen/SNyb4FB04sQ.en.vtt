00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.010
rearing on the other hand we have this
paradox and I think the reason for the

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020
paradox and I think the reason for the
 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.050
paradox and I think the reason for the
paradox is multifold for one thing we

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.940

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.240
know that children cannot vote and
that's really a big handicap because

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250
that's really a big handicap because
 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.950
that's really a big handicap because

to explain this paradox is that children

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560
to explain this paradox is that children
 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.920
to explain this paradox is that children

they took this news event or this social

news story depending on how the issue
had been framed so there are lots of

had been framed so there are lots of
 

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.690
had been framed so there are lots of
other examples of this but the bottom

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:11.700
other examples of this but the bottom
 

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:17.720
other examples of this but the bottom
line is that when we decide to to focus

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:17.730
line is that when we decide to to focus
 

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:21.170
line is that when we decide to to focus
on one aspect of an issue as opposed to

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:21.180
on one aspect of an issue as opposed to
 

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:24.430

often make in just an instant turns out
to be profoundly important in terms of

to be profoundly important in terms of
 

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:40.910
to be profoundly important in terms of
shaping people's opinions so there's

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:40.920
shaping people's opinions so there's
 

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.340
shaping people's opinions so there's
also literature that shows that

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:42.350
also literature that shows that
 

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:44.960
also literature that shows that

different kinds of people react
differently to different issue frames

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:46.770

I'm not going to summarize that

I'm not going to summarize that
literature and I'll actually have more

literature and I'll actually have more
to say about that in the talk and

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:51.020
to say about that in the talk and
 

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.330
to say about that in the talk and
there's a very interesting body of

there's a very interesting body of

connection between issue framing and
 

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:02.720

values as it turns out are more likely
 

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:27.530
values as it turns out are more likely
to change public opinion than others so

to change public opinion than others so

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:55.650
New York University and he's done an
excellent job of showing that liberals

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:55.660
excellent job of showing that liberals
 

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.079
excellent job of showing that liberals
and conservatives have very different

00:13:58.079 --> 00:13:58.089
and conservatives have very different
 

00:13:58.089 --> 00:14:01.379
and conservatives have very different
values and that may not come as a

00:14:01.379 --> 00:14:01.389
values and that may not come as a
 

00:14:01.389 --> 00:14:05.610
values and that may not come as a
revelation to most of you because if if

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:05.620
revelation to most of you because if if
 

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.800
revelation to most of you because if if
you listen to fox news you can easily

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:07.810
you listen to fox news you can easily
 

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:10.280
you listen to fox news you can easily
find what some of those values are if

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:10.290
find what some of those values are if
 

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:13.800
find what some of those values are if
you listen to some other networks you

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:13.810
you listen to some other networks you
 

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:15.569
you listen to some other networks you
could easily find what some alternative

00:14:15.569 --> 00:14:15.579
could easily find what some alternative
 

00:14:15.579 --> 00:14:18.210
could easily find what some alternative
values are let's say MSNBC for example

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:18.220

on the other hand what may come as news

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:21.670
on the other hand what may come as news

on the other hand what may come as news
to you is Heights rather surprising

00:14:24.689 --> 00:14:24.699
to you is Heights rather surprising
 

00:14:24.699 --> 00:14:27.240
to you is Heights rather surprising
finding that in some respects

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:27.250
finding that in some respects
 

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:29.730
finding that in some respects
conservatives have a more

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:29.740
conservatives have a more
 

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:31.829
conservatives have a more
multi-dimensional value system than

00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839
multi-dimensional value system than
 

00:14:31.839 --> 00:14:34.350
multi-dimensional value system than
liberals do when he has probed

liberals do when he has probed
 

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.780
liberals do when he has probed
conservative values and contrasted them

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:36.790
conservative values and contrasted them
 

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:38.610
conservative values and contrasted them
to liberal values in a number of

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:38.620
to liberal values in a number of
 

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.250

consistently reached the conclusion that
 

00:14:43.449 --> 00:14:48.990
consistently reached the conclusion that

whereas liberals tend to value fairness
 

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.439

if your value system roughly coincides
 

00:15:14.709 --> 00:15:18.350
if your value system roughly coincides
with one of those two modal groups and

with one of those two modal groups and
 

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:22.500
with one of those two modal groups and
you want to try to influence people who

other modal groups you probably want to

other modal groups you probably want to
know a little bit more about their value

know a little bit more about their value
 

00:15:29.529 --> 00:15:33.240
know a little bit more about their value
system and sometimes the more you learn

system and sometimes the more you learn
 

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:36.660

about other people's values the more

about other people's values the more
 

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:40.230
about other people's values the more

down the road in the future so what I've

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.440
down the road in the future so what I've
 

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:39.570
down the road in the future so what I've
done here is to develop these arguments

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:39.580
done here is to develop these arguments
 

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:43.830
done here is to develop these arguments
a little bit just to remind you that we

a little bit just to remind you that we

policy arguments in many policy debates
 

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:53.130
policy arguments in many policy debates
sometimes you have fairly full

sometimes you have fairly full

times you have an intermediate version
 

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:01.110
times you have an intermediate version
sometimes you have a truncated version

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.120
sometimes you have a truncated version
 

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.980
sometimes you have a truncated version
that simply fits on a bumper sticker

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:03.990
that simply fits on a bumper sticker

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:14.920
wasn't enough space but more importantly
 

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.460
wasn't enough space but more importantly
because public officials in particular

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:17.470
because public officials in particular
 

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:19.410
because public officials in particular
are unlikely to look directly at those

are unlikely to look directly at those
 

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:22.920
are unlikely to look directly at those
kinds of documents and so the truth of

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:22.930
kinds of documents and so the truth of
 

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:25.350
kinds of documents and so the truth of
the matter is that a lot of these issue

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360
the matter is that a lot of these issue
 

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:30.000
the matter is that a lot of these issue
frames take the form of a truncated

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720
was was different it retained that
 

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.970
was was different it retained that
negative argument as did the others but

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:21.980
negative argument as did the others but
 

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:25.039
negative argument as did the others but
it added a new one a moralistic argument

00:28:25.039 --> 00:28:25.049
it added a new one a moralistic argument
 

00:28:25.049 --> 00:28:26.840
it added a new one a moralistic argument
which as it turns out was the helping

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:26.850
which as it turns out was the helping
 

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:28.970
which as it turns out was the helping
hand argument so I had a state

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:28.980
hand argument so I had a state
 

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:31.220
hand argument so I had a state
legislator make a helping hand argument

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:31.230
legislator make a helping hand argument
 

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:34.100
legislator make a helping hand argument
in an effort to counter the negative

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:34.110
in an effort to counter the negative
 

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:36.200
in an effort to counter the negative
argument which is that the program was

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:36.210
argument which is that the program was
 

00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:39.680
argument which is that the program was
too costly the third version of the

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:39.690
too costly the third version of the
 

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:42.710
too costly the third version of the
article used an economic argument and

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720
article used an economic argument and
 

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:48.350
article used an economic argument and
specifically an investment argument with

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:48.360
specifically an investment argument with
 

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:51.799
specifically an investment argument with
no helping hand argument and the final

00:28:51.799 --> 00:28:51.809
no helping hand argument and the final
 

00:28:51.809 --> 00:28:53.480
no helping hand argument and the final
version of the article used an economic

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:53.490
version of the article used an economic
 

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:56.180
version of the article used an economic
argument with a little evidence so the

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:56.190
argument with a little evidence so the
 

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:59.120
argument with a little evidence so the
state legislature not only said that the

00:28:59.120 --> 00:28:59.130
state legislature not only said that the
 

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:00.950
state legislature not only said that the
nurse Family Partnership Program was a

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960
nurse Family Partnership Program was a
 

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.269
nurse Family Partnership Program was a
good investment

00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:02.279
good investment
 

00:29:02.279 --> 00:29:05.269
good investment
in the future but also said specifically

00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279
in the future but also said specifically
 

00:29:05.279 --> 00:29:09.440
in the future but also said specifically
that the benefit cost ratio was 321 so I

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:09.450
that the benefit cost ratio was 321 so I
 

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:12.919
that the benefit cost ratio was 321 so I
wanted to see which of these newspaper

00:29:12.919 --> 00:29:12.929
wanted to see which of these newspaper
 

00:29:12.929 --> 00:29:17.259
wanted to see which of these newspaper
articles was more persuasive than others

00:29:17.259 --> 00:29:17.269
articles was more persuasive than others
 

00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:22.039
articles was more persuasive than others
and this is just a fuller version of

00:29:22.039 --> 00:29:22.049
and this is just a fuller version of
 

00:29:22.049 --> 00:29:26.560
and this is just a fuller version of
those arguments I asked the students to

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:26.570
those arguments I asked the students to
 

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:29.779
those arguments I asked the students to
indicate using a Likert scale whether

00:29:29.779 --> 00:29:29.789
indicate using a Likert scale whether
 

00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:32.119
indicate using a Likert scale whether
they agreed or disagreed that the

00:29:32.119 --> 00:29:32.129
they agreed or disagreed that the
 

00:29:32.129 --> 00:29:33.560
they agreed or disagreed that the
Pennsylvania State Legislature should

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:33.570
Pennsylvania State Legislature should
 

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:35.269
Pennsylvania State Legislature should
create this nurse Family Partnership

00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279
create this nurse Family Partnership
 

00:29:35.279 --> 00:29:38.899
create this nurse Family Partnership
Program if they strongly agreed they

00:29:38.899 --> 00:29:38.909
Program if they strongly agreed they
 

00:29:38.909 --> 00:29:41.869
Program if they strongly agreed they
assigned this a seven if they strongly

00:29:41.869 --> 00:29:41.879
assigned this a seven if they strongly
 

00:29:41.879 --> 00:29:44.599
assigned this a seven if they strongly
disagreed they assigned it a one and

00:29:44.599 --> 00:29:44.609
disagreed they assigned it a one and
 

00:29:44.609 --> 00:29:48.639
disagreed they assigned it a one and
there were intermediate options too so

00:29:48.639 --> 00:29:48.649
there were intermediate options too so
 

00:29:48.649 --> 00:29:52.039
there were intermediate options too so
this this gives you some sense of what

00:29:52.039 --> 00:29:52.049
this this gives you some sense of what
 

00:29:52.049 --> 00:29:55.430
this this gives you some sense of what
the what the response to the different

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440
the what the response to the different
 

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:58.279
the what the response to the different
newspaper articles was in a nutshell

00:29:58.279 --> 00:29:58.289
newspaper articles was in a nutshell
 

00:29:58.289 --> 00:30:01.430
newspaper articles was in a nutshell
what this shows is that the economic

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440
what this shows is that the economic
 

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:05.469
what this shows is that the economic
arguments were generally more persuasive

00:30:05.469 --> 00:30:05.479
arguments were generally more persuasive
 

00:30:05.479 --> 00:30:09.229
arguments were generally more persuasive
the economic arguments were more

00:30:09.229 --> 00:30:09.239
the economic arguments were more
 

00:30:09.239 --> 00:30:12.339
the economic arguments were more
persuasive to students than the

00:30:12.339 --> 00:30:12.349
persuasive to students than the
 

00:30:12.349 --> 00:30:17.149
persuasive to students than the
moralistic argument and either of those

00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:17.159
moralistic argument and either of those
 

00:30:17.159 --> 00:30:21.139
moralistic argument and either of those
arguments was more persuasive than no

00:30:21.139 --> 00:30:21.149
arguments was more persuasive than no
 

00:30:21.149 --> 00:30:25.129
arguments was more persuasive than no
positive argument at all so the point is

00:30:25.129 --> 00:30:25.139
positive argument at all so the point is
 

00:30:25.139 --> 00:30:28.159
positive argument at all so the point is
is not that the that a moralistic

00:30:28.159 --> 00:30:28.169
is not that the that a moralistic
 

00:30:28.169 --> 00:30:31.700
is not that the that a moralistic
argument is a waste of time or breath

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:31.710
argument is a waste of time or breath
 

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:33.680
argument is a waste of time or breath
but that at least in this particular

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:33.690
but that at least in this particular
 

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:37.070
but that at least in this particular
case the economic argument was more

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:37.080
case the economic argument was more
 

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:41.089
case the economic argument was more
persuasive if you look at gender it's

00:30:41.089 --> 00:30:41.099
persuasive if you look at gender it's
 

00:30:41.099 --> 00:30:44.509
persuasive if you look at gender it's
interesting that the economic argument

00:30:44.509 --> 00:30:44.519
interesting that the economic argument
 

00:30:44.519 --> 00:30:50.149
interesting that the economic argument
was particularly persuasive two males it

00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159
was particularly persuasive two males it
 

00:30:50.159 --> 00:30:53.180
was particularly persuasive two males it
mattered less to females basically the

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:53.190
mattered less to females basically the
 

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:55.310
mattered less to females basically the
the females were inclined to be more

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:55.320
the females were inclined to be more
 

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.070
the females were inclined to be more
supportive in the first place it took an

00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080
supportive in the first place it took an
 

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.440
supportive in the first place it took an
economic argument to get the men on

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:00.450
economic argument to get the men on
 

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:03.769
economic argument to get the men on
board so interesting gender differences

00:31:03.769 --> 00:31:03.779
board so interesting gender differences
 

00:31:03.779 --> 00:31:07.729
board so interesting gender differences
and this to me is a very important slide

00:31:07.729 --> 00:31:07.739
and this to me is a very important slide
 

00:31:07.739 --> 00:31:09.979
and this to me is a very important slide
what this shows is that the economic

00:31:09.979 --> 00:31:09.989
what this shows is that the economic
 

00:31:09.989 --> 00:31:12.489
what this shows is that the economic
arguments were particularly persuasive

00:31:12.489 --> 00:31:12.499
arguments were particularly persuasive
 

00:31:12.499 --> 00:31:15.769
arguments were particularly persuasive
for independence so

00:31:15.769 --> 00:31:15.779
for independence so
 

00:31:15.779 --> 00:31:18.200
for independence so
oh the economic argument really seemed a

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:18.210
oh the economic argument really seemed a
 

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:22.099
oh the economic argument really seemed a
matter for the independence it mattered

00:31:22.099 --> 00:31:22.109
matter for the independence it mattered
 

00:31:22.109 --> 00:31:25.879
matter for the independence it mattered
less for Democrats and mattered less for

00:31:25.879 --> 00:31:25.889
less for Democrats and mattered less for
 

00:31:25.889 --> 00:31:30.830
less for Democrats and mattered less for
Republicans that essentially says the

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:30.840
Republicans that essentially says the
 

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.629
Republicans that essentially says the
same thing except instead of talking

00:31:32.629 --> 00:31:32.639
same thing except instead of talking
 

00:31:32.639 --> 00:31:35.239
same thing except instead of talking
about independence we're talking about

00:31:35.239 --> 00:31:35.249
about independence we're talking about
 

00:31:35.249 --> 00:31:42.789
about independence we're talking about
moderates okay let's turn to another

00:31:42.789 --> 00:31:42.799
moderates okay let's turn to another
 

00:31:42.799 --> 00:31:47.899
moderates okay let's turn to another
experiment one limitation of the first

00:31:47.899 --> 00:31:47.909
experiment one limitation of the first
 

00:31:47.909 --> 00:31:50.570
experiment one limitation of the first
experiment I'm sure has already occurred

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:50.580
experiment I'm sure has already occurred
 

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:54.279
experiment I'm sure has already occurred
to you and that is it was based on

00:31:54.279 --> 00:31:54.289
to you and that is it was based on
 

00:31:54.289 --> 00:31:59.239
to you and that is it was based on
Georgetown University students and let

00:31:59.239 --> 00:31:59.249
Georgetown University students and let
 

00:31:59.249 --> 00:32:00.619
Georgetown University students and let
me be the first to say that Georgetown

00:32:00.619 --> 00:32:00.629
me be the first to say that Georgetown
 

00:32:00.629 --> 00:32:02.779
me be the first to say that Georgetown
University students are exceptional in

00:32:02.779 --> 00:32:02.789
University students are exceptional in
 

00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:06.879
University students are exceptional in
many ways so I don't mean to say that

00:32:06.879 --> 00:32:06.889
many ways so I don't mean to say that
 

00:32:06.889 --> 00:32:09.799
many ways so I don't mean to say that
Georgetown University students represent

00:32:09.799 --> 00:32:09.809
Georgetown University students represent
 

00:32:09.809 --> 00:32:13.969
Georgetown University students represent
a microcosm of the United States but I

00:32:13.969 --> 00:32:13.979
a microcosm of the United States but I
 

00:32:13.979 --> 00:32:16.430
a microcosm of the United States but I
decided it would be interesting to to

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:16.440
decided it would be interesting to to
 

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:18.109
decided it would be interesting to to
see how people would respond to a

00:32:18.109 --> 00:32:18.119
see how people would respond to a
 

00:32:18.119 --> 00:32:23.899
see how people would respond to a
somewhat different newspaper test using

00:32:23.899 --> 00:32:23.909
somewhat different newspaper test using
 

00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:26.869
somewhat different newspaper test using
a representative sample and specifically

00:32:26.869 --> 00:32:26.879
a representative sample and specifically
 

00:32:26.879 --> 00:32:33.519
a representative sample and specifically
a random sample of Americans thanks to a

00:32:33.519 --> 00:32:33.529
a random sample of Americans thanks to a
 

00:32:33.529 --> 00:32:36.200
a random sample of Americans thanks to a
contract with knowledge networks which

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:36.210
contract with knowledge networks which
 

00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:40.459
contract with knowledge networks which
did this research for me and allow

00:32:40.459 --> 00:32:40.469
did this research for me and allow
 

00:32:40.469 --> 00:32:42.799
did this research for me and allow
people to see the newspaper article

00:32:42.799 --> 00:32:42.809
people to see the newspaper article
 

00:32:42.809 --> 00:32:45.139
people to see the newspaper article
online and respond to it so the question

00:32:45.139 --> 00:32:45.149
online and respond to it so the question
 

00:32:45.149 --> 00:32:48.019
online and respond to it so the question
here for this randomized experiment is

00:32:48.019 --> 00:32:48.029
here for this randomized experiment is
 

00:32:48.029 --> 00:32:50.060
here for this randomized experiment is
should Congress expand the head start

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:50.070
should Congress expand the head start
 

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:52.190
should Congress expand the head start
program increasing enrollment by ten

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:52.200
program increasing enrollment by ten
 

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.529
program increasing enrollment by ten
percent and converting some programs

00:32:54.529 --> 00:32:54.539
percent and converting some programs
 

00:32:54.539 --> 00:32:57.829
percent and converting some programs
from half day to full day here I used

00:32:57.829 --> 00:32:57.839
from half day to full day here I used
 

00:32:57.839 --> 00:33:00.409
from half day to full day here I used
six newspaper articles rather than for

00:33:00.409 --> 00:33:00.419
six newspaper articles rather than for
 

00:33:00.419 --> 00:33:02.779
six newspaper articles rather than for
the focus was on head start rather than

00:33:02.779 --> 00:33:02.789
the focus was on head start rather than
 

00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:04.609
the focus was on head start rather than
the nurse Family Partnership Program and

00:33:04.609 --> 00:33:04.619
the nurse Family Partnership Program and
 

00:33:04.619 --> 00:33:08.869
the nurse Family Partnership Program and
this was an internet survey that was

00:33:08.869 --> 00:33:08.879
this was an internet survey that was
 

00:33:08.879 --> 00:33:11.450
this was an internet survey that was
administered by knowledge networks the

00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:11.460
administered by knowledge networks the
 

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:14.239
administered by knowledge networks the
sample size here was a little over a

00:33:14.239 --> 00:33:14.249
sample size here was a little over a
 

00:33:14.249 --> 00:33:16.549
sample size here was a little over a
thousand so we had pretty good sample

00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559
thousand so we had pretty good sample
 

00:33:16.559 --> 00:33:20.509
thousand so we had pretty good sample
size let me just roughly give you a

00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:20.519
size let me just roughly give you a
 

00:33:20.519 --> 00:33:23.839
size let me just roughly give you a
sense of what the arguments look like

00:33:23.839 --> 00:33:23.849
sense of what the arguments look like
 

00:33:23.849 --> 00:33:25.489
sense of what the arguments look like
the baseline argument should look

00:33:25.489 --> 00:33:25.499
the baseline argument should look
 

00:33:25.499 --> 00:33:27.049
the baseline argument should look
familiar to you from the previous

00:33:27.049 --> 00:33:27.059
familiar to you from the previous
 

00:33:27.059 --> 00:33:28.669
familiar to you from the previous
experiment government spending his way

00:33:28.669 --> 00:33:28.679
experiment government spending his way
 

00:33:28.679 --> 00:33:29.480
experiment government spending his way
out of control

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:29.490
out of control
 

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:31.220
out of control
taxpayers are already facing serious

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:31.230
taxpayers are already facing serious
 

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:34.510
taxpayers are already facing serious
burdens as it is we just can't afford it

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:34.520
burdens as it is we just can't afford it
 

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.650
burdens as it is we just can't afford it
this time I've introduced an

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:36.660
this time I've introduced an
 

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:39.980
this time I've introduced an
equal-opportunity argument which is that

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:39.990
equal-opportunity argument which is that
 

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:41.690
equal-opportunity argument which is that
every child should have an equal

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:41.700
every child should have an equal
 

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:44.540
every child should have an equal
opportunity to succeed in our society

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:44.550
opportunity to succeed in our society
 

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:48.740
opportunity to succeed in our society
that was article be so article a simply

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:48.750
that was article be so article a simply
 

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:52.130
that was article be so article a simply
provided the baseline argument which is

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:52.140
provided the baseline argument which is
 

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:55.419
provided the baseline argument which is
the taxpayers can't afford it article be

00:33:55.419 --> 00:33:55.429
the taxpayers can't afford it article be
 

00:33:55.429 --> 00:33:58.130
the taxpayers can't afford it article be
retained the baseline argument and then

00:33:58.130 --> 00:33:58.140
retained the baseline argument and then
 

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:01.000
retained the baseline argument and then
added an equal opportunity argument

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:01.010
added an equal opportunity argument
 

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:04.760
added an equal opportunity argument
articles see retained the baseline

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:04.770
articles see retained the baseline
 

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:07.790
articles see retained the baseline
argument but substituted an investment

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:07.800
argument but substituted an investment
 

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.430
argument but substituted an investment
argument for the Equal Opportunity

00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.440
argument for the Equal Opportunity
 

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.440
argument for the Equal Opportunity
arguments so here you have a chance to

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:12.450
arguments so here you have a chance to
 

00:34:12.450 --> 00:34:15.250
arguments so here you have a chance to
see whether the economic issue frame

00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:15.260
see whether the economic issue frame
 

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:20.770
see whether the economic issue frame
makes a difference article 4 was a

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:20.780
makes a difference article 4 was a
 

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.419
makes a difference article 4 was a
self-indulgent twist on my part I wanted

00:34:23.419 --> 00:34:23.429
self-indulgent twist on my part I wanted
 

00:34:23.429 --> 00:34:27.020
self-indulgent twist on my part I wanted
to see what would happen if if if you

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:27.030
to see what would happen if if if you
 

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:29.450
to see what would happen if if if you
had an economic frame but you had a a

00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:29.460
had an economic frame but you had a a
 

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:36.409
had an economic frame but you had a a
pointy headed wonkish professor using

00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:36.419
pointy headed wonkish professor using
 

00:34:36.419 --> 00:34:39.109
pointy headed wonkish professor using
not just a sound bite but a complex

00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119
not just a sound bite but a complex
 

00:34:39.119 --> 00:34:42.290
not just a sound bite but a complex
nuanced fully accurate version of the

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:42.300
nuanced fully accurate version of the
 

00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:44.330
nuanced fully accurate version of the
same thing I wanted to see if that would

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:44.340
same thing I wanted to see if that would
 

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:47.570
same thing I wanted to see if that would
totally destroy the the persuasiveness

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:47.580
totally destroy the the persuasiveness
 

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:51.169
totally destroy the the persuasiveness
of the argument or not then introduced a

00:34:51.169 --> 00:34:51.179
of the argument or not then introduced a
 

00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:53.330
of the argument or not then introduced a
science argument the notion here was

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:53.340
science argument the notion here was
 

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.190
science argument the notion here was
that science shows that the early years

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200
that science shows that the early years
 

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:56.930
that science shows that the early years
are of critical importance to the

00:34:56.930 --> 00:34:56.940
are of critical importance to the
 

00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:59.150
are of critical importance to the
development of certain skills and that

00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.160
development of certain skills and that
 

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:04.010
development of certain skills and that
therefore we should we should expand the

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:04.020
therefore we should we should expand the
 

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:06.320
therefore we should we should expand the
head start program and finally an

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:06.330
head start program and finally an
 

00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:08.120
head start program and finally an
argument that you're familiar with by

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:08.130
argument that you're familiar with by
 

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:09.880
argument that you're familiar with by
now which is the helping hand argument

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:09.890
now which is the helping hand argument
 

00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:14.450
now which is the helping hand argument
so the question here was fairly simple

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:14.460
so the question here was fairly simple
 

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:16.099
so the question here was fairly simple
should Congress expand the head start

00:35:16.099 --> 00:35:16.109
should Congress expand the head start
 

00:35:16.109 --> 00:35:19.790
should Congress expand the head start
program and once again the respondents

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:19.800
program and once again the respondents
 

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.590
program and once again the respondents
had the option of using a Likert scale

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:21.600
had the option of using a Likert scale
 

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.570
had the option of using a Likert scale
they could strongly agree strongly

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:23.580
they could strongly agree strongly
 

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:27.290
they could strongly agree strongly
disagree or something in between this

00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:27.300
disagree or something in between this
 

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:31.790
disagree or something in between this
gives you the overall results for the

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:31.800
gives you the overall results for the
 

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:35.270
gives you the overall results for the
unweighted and the weighted versions of

00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280
unweighted and the weighted versions of
 

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:37.880
unweighted and the weighted versions of
the sample and if you focus on the

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:37.890
the sample and if you focus on the
 

00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:40.820
the sample and if you focus on the
weighted version what you can see is

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:40.830
weighted version what you can see is
 

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:43.040
weighted version what you can see is
that the

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:43.050
that the
 

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:47.030
that the
most persuasive of these arguments was

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040
most persuasive of these arguments was
 

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:50.270
most persuasive of these arguments was
once again the economic argument for the

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:50.280
once again the economic argument for the
 

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.870
once again the economic argument for the
economic issue frame what you can also

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:53.880
economic issue frame what you can also
 

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:55.940
economic issue frame what you can also
see though in fairness is that the

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:55.950
see though in fairness is that the
 

00:35:55.950 --> 00:36:00.140
see though in fairness is that the
helping hand was doing better with this

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:00.150
helping hand was doing better with this
 

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:03.530
helping hand was doing better with this
national sample than it did with my

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:03.540
national sample than it did with my
 

00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:07.280
national sample than it did with my
Georgetown sample so that was

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:07.290
Georgetown sample so that was
 

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:10.370
Georgetown sample so that was
interesting and to be honest somewhat

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:10.380
interesting and to be honest somewhat
 

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:12.950
interesting and to be honest somewhat
unexpected I thought to be honest that

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960
unexpected I thought to be honest that
 

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.960
unexpected I thought to be honest that
the science string would probably do a

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:14.970
the science string would probably do a
 

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:17.240
the science string would probably do a
little better and that the helping hand

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:17.250
little better and that the helping hand
 

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:19.040
little better and that the helping hand
frame would do a little worse but that's

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:19.050
frame would do a little worse but that's
 

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:21.050
frame would do a little worse but that's
not the way it turned out for the

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:21.060
not the way it turned out for the
 

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:25.880
not the way it turned out for the
population as a whole so with the

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:25.890
population as a whole so with the
 

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:28.670
population as a whole so with the
analysis I was also able to control for

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:28.680
analysis I was also able to control for
 

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:30.830
analysis I was also able to control for
some other background characteristics to

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:30.840
some other background characteristics to
 

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.860
some other background characteristics to
see if these findings held up and if you

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:33.870
see if these findings held up and if you
 

00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:36.320
see if these findings held up and if you
look again at the weighted sample just

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:36.330
look again at the weighted sample just
 

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:40.220
look again at the weighted sample just
for simplicity sake you can see that the

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:40.230
for simplicity sake you can see that the
 

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:45.260
for simplicity sake you can see that the
economic the economic issue frame did

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:45.270
economic the economic issue frame did
 

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:46.670
economic the economic issue frame did
matter that it was statistically

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680
matter that it was statistically
 

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:50.120
matter that it was statistically
significant at an acceptable level but

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:50.130
significant at an acceptable level but
 

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:53.180
significant at an acceptable level but
that it was the only issue frame that

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:53.190
that it was the only issue frame that
 

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:55.010
that it was the only issue frame that
was statistically significant at an

00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:55.020
was statistically significant at an
 

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:56.990
was statistically significant at an
acceptable level when compared to the

00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:57.000
acceptable level when compared to the
 

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.190
acceptable level when compared to the
baseline so again the conclusion I reach

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.200
baseline so again the conclusion I reach
 

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:06.380
baseline so again the conclusion I reach
here is that the economic frame is the

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:06.390
here is that the economic frame is the
 

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:08.990
here is that the economic frame is the
most powerful of these alternative issue

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:09.000
most powerful of these alternative issue
 

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.360
most powerful of these alternative issue
frames although I want to emphasize that

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:11.370
frames although I want to emphasize that
 

00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:14.870
frames although I want to emphasize that
some of these other issue frames are

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880
some of these other issue frames are
 

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.730
some of these other issue frames are
capable of making a difference and

00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:16.740
capable of making a difference and
 

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:18.830
capable of making a difference and
indeed you see that when you shift to

00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:18.840
indeed you see that when you shift to
 

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:21.680
indeed you see that when you shift to
certain subgroups I'm not going to focus

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:21.690
certain subgroups I'm not going to focus
 

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:25.940
certain subgroups I'm not going to focus
that much on the subgroup analysis due

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:25.950
that much on the subgroup analysis due
 

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:28.250
that much on the subgroup analysis due
to time limitations but let me just pick

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:28.260
to time limitations but let me just pick
 

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:32.500
to time limitations but let me just pick
one or two to capture the flavor of it

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:32.510
one or two to capture the flavor of it
 

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:44.990
one or two to capture the flavor of it
let's see if this is a good one to do

00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:45.000
 

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.880
these are both kind of interesting what

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:49.890
these are both kind of interesting what
 

00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:52.490
these are both kind of interesting what
you can see from this table which

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:52.500
you can see from this table which
 

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:57.380
you can see from this table which
focuses on education levels is that the

00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:57.390
focuses on education levels is that the
 

00:37:57.390 --> 00:38:00.380
focuses on education levels is that the
economic issue frame is especially

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:00.390
economic issue frame is especially
 

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:05.810
economic issue frame is especially
powerful and especially persuasive for

00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:05.820
powerful and especially persuasive for
 

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.330
powerful and especially persuasive for
individuals who have a bachelor's degree

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:08.340
individuals who have a bachelor's degree
 

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:12.170
individuals who have a bachelor's degree
and higher as opposed to individuals who

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:12.180
and higher as opposed to individuals who
 

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:16.670
and higher as opposed to individuals who
simply have some college you can also

00:57:29.289 --> 00:57:29.299
distracted by his his water bottle
 

00:57:29.299 --> 00:57:32.829
distracted by his his water bottle
incident that I didn't focus as much as

00:57:32.829 --> 00:57:32.839
incident that I didn't focus as much as
 

00:57:32.839 --> 00:57:34.120
incident that I didn't focus as much as
I should have on the content of his

00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:34.130
I should have on the content of his
 

00:57:34.130 --> 00:57:36.910
I should have on the content of his
speech and I was even reluctant to drink

00:57:36.910 --> 00:57:36.920
speech and I was even reluctant to drink
 

00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:38.650
speech and I was even reluctant to drink
water here today but notice I have it

00:57:38.650 --> 00:57:38.660
water here today but notice I have it
 

00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:40.240
water here today but notice I have it
right here in front of me so there's no

00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:40.250
right here in front of me so there's no
 

00:57:40.250 --> 00:57:42.599
right here in front of me so there's no
question that I have to lunge for it and

00:57:42.599 --> 00:57:42.609
question that I have to lunge for it and
 

00:57:42.609 --> 00:57:46.230
question that I have to lunge for it and
lose eye contact with you as I lunge

00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:46.240
lose eye contact with you as I lunge
 

00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:49.560
lose eye contact with you as I lunge
I did however definitely hear an

00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:49.570
I did however definitely hear an
 

00:57:49.570 --> 00:57:54.320
I did however definitely hear an
equal-opportunity frame and I think

00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:54.330
equal-opportunity frame and I think
 

00:57:54.330 --> 00:57:56.609
equal-opportunity frame and I think
senator Rubio has a very compelling

00:57:56.609 --> 00:57:56.619
senator Rubio has a very compelling
 

00:57:56.619 --> 00:58:00.210
senator Rubio has a very compelling
personal story that really accompanies

00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:00.220
personal story that really accompanies
 

00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:04.290
personal story that really accompanies
that that equal opportunity frame so I

00:58:04.290 --> 00:58:04.300
that that equal opportunity frame so I
 

00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:08.370
that that equal opportunity frame so I
think that an equal opportunity frame it

00:58:08.370 --> 00:58:08.380
think that an equal opportunity frame it
 

00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:10.410
think that an equal opportunity frame it
can be very potent a lot of politicians

00:58:10.410 --> 00:58:10.420
can be very potent a lot of politicians
 

00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:12.720
can be very potent a lot of politicians
believe that it is they act as if it is

00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:12.730
believe that it is they act as if it is
 

00:58:12.730 --> 00:58:15.210
believe that it is they act as if it is
I think an investment frame can be very

00:58:15.210 --> 00:58:15.220
I think an investment frame can be very
 

00:58:15.220 --> 00:58:17.520
I think an investment frame can be very
potent and many politicians though not

00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:17.530
potent and many politicians though not
 

00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:20.400
potent and many politicians though not
all of them also use that frame and we

00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:20.410
all of them also use that frame and we
 

00:58:20.410 --> 00:58:24.090
all of them also use that frame and we
will see if if those frames proved to be

00:58:24.090 --> 00:58:24.100
will see if if those frames proved to be
 

00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:26.760
will see if if those frames proved to be
winning frames for President Obama in

00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:26.770
winning frames for President Obama in
 

00:58:26.770 --> 00:58:34.680
winning frames for President Obama in
the months to come yes I was interested

00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:34.690
the months to come yes I was interested
 

00:58:34.690 --> 00:58:37.109
the months to come yes I was interested
in the differences between reactions of

00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:37.119
in the differences between reactions of
 

00:58:37.119 --> 00:58:39.890
in the differences between reactions of
african-american populations versus

00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:39.900
african-american populations versus
 

00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:42.270
african-american populations versus
Caucasian and others you mentioned

00:58:42.270 --> 00:58:42.280
Caucasian and others you mentioned
 

00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:45.600
Caucasian and others you mentioned
gender you mentioned education levels

00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:45.610
gender you mentioned education levels
 

00:58:45.610 --> 00:58:48.359
gender you mentioned education levels
and you briefly touched on economic

00:58:48.359 --> 00:58:48.369
and you briefly touched on economic
 

00:58:48.369 --> 00:58:50.070
and you briefly touched on economic
levels but I'd be interested in the race

00:58:50.070 --> 00:58:50.080
levels but I'd be interested in the race
 

00:58:50.080 --> 00:59:02.359
levels but I'd be interested in the race
issue okay let's see if i can find that

00:59:02.359 --> 00:59:02.369
 

00:59:02.369 --> 00:59:07.200
yeah what this chart shows based on our

00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:07.210
yeah what this chart shows based on our
 

00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:12.540
yeah what this chart shows based on our
Head Start study is that almost any

00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:12.550
Head Start study is that almost any
 

00:59:12.550 --> 00:59:16.760
Head Start study is that almost any
issue frame would work for

00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:16.770
issue frame would work for
 

00:59:16.770 --> 00:59:18.870
issue frame would work for
african-americans in this particular

00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:18.880
african-americans in this particular
 

00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:23.070
african-americans in this particular
case that is the overwhelming majority

00:59:23.070 --> 00:59:23.080
case that is the overwhelming majority
 

00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:25.829
case that is the overwhelming majority
of African Americans in our sample were

00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:25.839
of African Americans in our sample were
 

00:59:25.839 --> 00:59:28.349
of African Americans in our sample were
already favorably predisposed towards

00:59:28.349 --> 00:59:28.359
already favorably predisposed towards
 

00:59:28.359 --> 00:59:33.270
already favorably predisposed towards
head start and so you do not need a

00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:33.280
head start and so you do not need a
 

00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:36.599
head start and so you do not need a
particularly compelling issue frame to

00:59:36.599 --> 00:59:36.609
particularly compelling issue frame to
 

00:59:36.609 --> 00:59:38.490
particularly compelling issue frame to
convince them to support the head start

00:59:38.490 --> 00:59:38.500
convince them to support the head start
 

00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:41.250
convince them to support the head start
program having said that the economic

00:59:41.250 --> 00:59:41.260
program having said that the economic
 

00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:44.579
program having said that the economic
frame still looks really good with that

00:59:44.579 --> 00:59:44.589
frame still looks really good with that
 

00:59:44.589 --> 00:59:48.060
frame still looks really good with that
subgroup I you didn't ask about

00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:48.070
subgroup I you didn't ask about
 

00:59:48.070 --> 00:59:49.829
subgroup I you didn't ask about
Hispanics but if you look at the

00:59:49.829 --> 00:59:49.839
Hispanics but if you look at the
 

00:59:49.839 --> 00:59:51.990
Hispanics but if you look at the
Hispanic column that's kind of

00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.000
Hispanic column that's kind of
 

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.060
Hispanic column that's kind of
interesting and what's most interesting

00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:54.070
interesting and what's most interesting
 

00:59:54.070 --> 00:59:58.079
interesting and what's most interesting
there to me is the power of the helping

00:59:58.079 --> 00:59:58.089
there to me is the power of the helping
 

00:59:58.089 --> 01:00:01.890
there to me is the power of the helping
hand frame so the helping hand frame

01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:01.900
hand frame so the helping hand frame
 

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:04.440
hand frame so the helping hand frame
seems to resonate with Hispanic voters

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:04.450
seems to resonate with Hispanic voters
 

01:00:04.450 --> 01:00:08.880
seems to resonate with Hispanic voters
in particular and you know that may have

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:08.890
in particular and you know that may have
 

01:00:08.890 --> 01:00:12.030
in particular and you know that may have
something to do it may may be cultural

01:00:12.030 --> 01:00:12.040
something to do it may may be cultural
 

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:15.210
something to do it may may be cultural
it may have religious roots I don't know

01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:15.220
it may have religious roots I don't know
 

01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:17.790
it may have religious roots I don't know
for sure but it's yet another reminder

01:00:17.790 --> 01:00:17.800
for sure but it's yet another reminder
 

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:20.520
for sure but it's yet another reminder
that members of different sub groups

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:20.530
that members of different sub groups
 

01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:24.420
that members of different sub groups
including racial and ethnic subgroups do

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:24.430
including racial and ethnic subgroups do
 

01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:26.579
including racial and ethnic subgroups do
in fact we respond differently to

01:00:26.579 --> 01:00:26.589
in fact we respond differently to
 

01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:29.700
in fact we respond differently to
different issue frames and so if you're

01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:29.710
different issue frames and so if you're
 

01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:31.470
different issue frames and so if you're
trying to win over members of a

01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:31.480
trying to win over members of a
 

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:34.290
trying to win over members of a
particular subgroup it's good to take

01:00:34.290 --> 01:00:34.300
particular subgroup it's good to take
 

01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:37.260
particular subgroup it's good to take
that into account so thanks for your

01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:37.270
that into account so thanks for your
 

01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:44.250
that into account so thanks for your
question yes wanted to go back to your

01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:44.260
question yes wanted to go back to your
 

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:46.020
question yes wanted to go back to your
paradox at the beginning where you

01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:46.030
paradox at the beginning where you
 

01:00:46.030 --> 01:00:48.570
paradox at the beginning where you
saying that there's this kind of gap

01:00:48.570 --> 01:00:48.580
saying that there's this kind of gap
 

01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:50.700
saying that there's this kind of gap
between the sort of amount that we love

01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:50.710
between the sort of amount that we love
 

01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:52.859
between the sort of amount that we love
children and there's of policies that

01:00:52.859 --> 01:00:52.869
children and there's of policies that
 

01:00:52.869 --> 01:00:55.250
children and there's of policies that
support that and I just wonder whether

01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:55.260
support that and I just wonder whether
 

01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:58.470
support that and I just wonder whether
it is actually true that this kind of

01:00:58.470 --> 01:00:58.480
it is actually true that this kind of
 

01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:00.030
it is actually true that this kind of
beloved of children what that would mean

01:01:00.030 --> 01:01:00.040
beloved of children what that would mean
 

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:02.910
beloved of children what that would mean
in terms of policy mean and like

01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:02.920
in terms of policy mean and like
 

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:04.320
in terms of policy mean and like

01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:22.000
needs so just wondering if you had any
 

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.520
needs so just wondering if you had any
comments on that but whether that was

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:23.530
comments on that but whether that was
 

01:01:23.530 --> 01:01:25.700
comments on that but whether that was
something that was particularly

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:25.710
something that was particularly
 

01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:27.630
something that was particularly
something that you could investigate

01:01:27.630 --> 01:01:27.640
something that you could investigate
 

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:31.470
something that you could investigate
more about whether actually it is as we

01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:31.480
more about whether actually it is as we
 

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.030
more about whether actually it is as we
do have this broader love for children

01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:33.040
do have this broader love for children
 

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:36.450
do have this broader love for children
beyond those an iron family yeah it's a

01:01:36.450 --> 01:01:36.460
beyond those an iron family yeah it's a
 

01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:41.250
beyond those an iron family yeah it's a
great question I'm simply relying on

01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:41.260
great question I'm simply relying on
 

01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:45.120
great question I'm simply relying on
public opinion surveys where where

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:45.130
public opinion surveys where where
 

01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:47.609
public opinion surveys where where
people pretty consistently do indicate

01:01:47.609 --> 01:01:47.619
people pretty consistently do indicate
 

01:01:47.619 --> 01:01:50.609
people pretty consistently do indicate
that children are positively constructed

01:01:50.609 --> 01:01:50.619
that children are positively constructed
 

01:01:50.619 --> 01:01:52.500
that children are positively constructed
that is they have warm feelings towards

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:52.510
that is they have warm feelings towards
 

01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:54.780
that is they have warm feelings towards
children or they say they have warm

if I can find it a chart here

if I can find it a chart here
 

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:36.520
if I can find it a chart here
um this is interesting I don't want to

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:36.530
um this is interesting I don't want to
 

01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:38.710
um this is interesting I don't want to
make too much out of this chart but I

01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:38.720
make too much out of this chart but I
 

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:45.870
make too much out of this chart but I
guess what I would say is that there are

01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:45.880
guess what I would say is that there are
 

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:50.530
guess what I would say is that there are
some Americans who support children's

01:03:50.530 --> 01:03:50.540
some Americans who support children's
 

01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:52.440
some Americans who support children's
programs even if they don't have

children or even if they don't have a

01:03:55.030 --> 01:03:55.040
children or even if they don't have a
 

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:57.430
children or even if they don't have a
young child in their home so the

01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:57.440
young child in their home so the
 

01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:00.190
young child in their home so the
situation may not be it may not be

01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:00.200
situation may not be it may not be
 

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:01.570

entirely bleak now what you'd really
want to see is if you could do it is

01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:04.640
want to see is if you could do it is
 

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:07.840
want to see is if you could do it is

very interesting to look at so I don't
 

01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:20.050
very interesting to look at so I don't
know I think that that there may well be

I'm interested in your thoughts in the

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:05.210
I'm interested in your thoughts in the
 

01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:07.240
I'm interested in your thoughts in the
utility of a human rights framework it's

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:07.250
utility of a human rights framework it's
 

01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:08.830
utility of a human rights framework it's
very closely related to your equal

01:05:08.830 --> 01:05:08.840
very closely related to your equal
 

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:10.330
very closely related to your equal
opportunity frame i was wondering if you

01:05:10.330 --> 01:05:10.340
opportunity frame i was wondering if you
 

01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:11.980
opportunity frame i was wondering if you
looked at that specifically and i'm

01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:11.990
looked at that specifically and i'm
 

01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:13.630
looked at that specifically and i'm
particularly interested because the u.s.

01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:13.640
particularly interested because the u.s.
 

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:15.820

is kind of uncharacteristically and

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:15.830
is kind of uncharacteristically and

yeah i don't know for sure i think a
 

01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:30.880
yeah i don't know for sure i think a

better outside the united states than
 

01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:35.800
better outside the united states than
inside the united states I do think

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:35.810
inside the united states I do think
 

01:05:35.810 --> 01:05:38.170
inside the united states I do think

01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:00.470
chart but one interesting discovery I
 

01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:02.200
chart but one interesting discovery I
made along the way while writing this

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:02.210
made along the way while writing this
 

01:06:02.210 --> 01:06:08.910
made along the way while writing this
book was that that children's advocates

01:06:08.910 --> 01:06:08.920
book was that that children's advocates
 

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:13.030
book was that that children's advocates
often use economic frames when

01:06:13.030 --> 01:06:13.040
often use economic frames when
 

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:16.150
often use economic frames when
discussing education and they often use

01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:16.160
discussing education and they often use
 

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:18.360
discussing education and they often use
economic issue frames when discussing

01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:18.370
economic issue frames when discussing
 

01:06:18.370 --> 01:06:21.520
economic issue frames when discussing
child health but they are far less

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:21.530
child health but they are far less
 

01:06:21.530 --> 01:06:24.550
child health but they are far less
likely to use economic frames when

01:06:24.550 --> 01:06:24.560
likely to use economic frames when
 

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:27.820
likely to use economic frames when
discussing child welfare when discussing

01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:27.830
discussing child welfare when discussing
 

01:06:27.830 --> 01:06:29.620
discussing child welfare when discussing
child welfare they are more likely to

01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:29.630
child welfare they are more likely to
 

01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:33.000
child welfare they are more likely to
make rights-based arguments or

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:33.010
make rights-based arguments or
 

01:06:33.010 --> 01:06:36.850
make rights-based arguments or
moralistic arguments and I think that

01:06:36.850 --> 01:06:36.860
moralistic arguments and I think that
 

01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:40.920
moralistic arguments and I think that
that those arguments have generally been

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:40.930
that those arguments have generally been
 

01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:44.440
that those arguments have generally been
efficacious on the other hand many of

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:44.450
efficacious on the other hand many of
 

01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:47.200
efficacious on the other hand many of
those programs are underfunded and and

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:47.210
those programs are underfunded and and
 

01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:50.410
those programs are underfunded and and
are not very salient so you could argue

01:06:50.410 --> 01:06:50.420
are not very salient so you could argue
 

01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:53.620
are not very salient so you could argue
maybe if we had better economic evidence

01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:53.630
maybe if we had better economic evidence
 

01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:58.090
maybe if we had better economic evidence
on the economic consequences of some of

on the economic consequences of some of

on the economic consequences of some of
those interventions we would probably

01:07:00.370 --> 01:07:00.380
those interventions we would probably
 

01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:02.770
those interventions we would probably
have stronger support from the citizenry

01:07:02.770 --> 01:07:02.780
have stronger support from the citizenry
 

01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:07.120
have stronger support from the citizenry

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:18.500
you've made a persuasive case that in

01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:18.510
you've made a persuasive case that in

you've made a persuasive case that in
general economic arguments are most

01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:20.750
general economic arguments are most
 

01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:23.450
general economic arguments are most
compelling but that for some subgroups

01:07:23.450 --> 01:07:23.460
compelling but that for some subgroups
 

01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:26.300
compelling but that for some subgroups
it helps to talk about equal opportunity

01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:26.310
it helps to talk about equal opportunity
 

01:07:26.310 --> 01:07:28.610
it helps to talk about equal opportunity
and even for some subgroups it talks to

01:07:28.610 --> 01:07:28.620
and even for some subgroups it talks to
 

01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:30.440
and even for some subgroups it talks to
talk about a helping hand and sometimes

01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:30.450
talk about a helping hand and sometimes
 

01:07:30.450 --> 01:07:33.580

bringing science in right is helpful so

01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:33.590

have you started yet to look at the

01:07:36.590 --> 01:07:36.600
have you started yet to look at the

have you started yet to look at the
effects of compounding these arguments

effects of compounding these arguments
 

01:07:38.430 --> 01:07:39.590
effects of compounding these arguments
so you know you had that wonderful

01:07:39.590 --> 01:07:39.600
so you know you had that wonderful
 

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:41.330
so you know you had that wonderful
experiment of I'm going to give you the

01:07:41.330 --> 01:07:41.340
experiment of I'm going to give you the
 

01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:43.010
experiment of I'm going to give you the
economic argument and then I'm going to

01:07:43.010 --> 01:07:43.020
economic argument and then I'm going to
 

01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:45.440
economic argument and then I'm going to

01:07:48.290 --> 01:07:48.300
helpful information but they actually
 

01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:50.950
helpful information but they actually
just completely undermine the message

01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:50.960
just completely undermine the message
 

01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:53.300
just completely undermine the message
what if you take an economic argument

01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:53.310
what if you take an economic argument
 

01:07:53.310 --> 01:07:55.580
what if you take an economic argument
and you add science to it uh-huh so we

01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:55.590
and you add science to it uh-huh so we
 

01:07:55.590 --> 01:07:57.380
and you add science to it uh-huh so we

argument at a time and then you try
 

01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:40.220
argument at a time and then you try
complementary arguments and then you try

complementary arguments and then you try
 

01:08:40.230 --> 01:08:42.020
complementary arguments and then you try
arguments that are not so complementary

01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:42.030
arguments that are not so complementary
 

01:08:42.030 --> 01:08:44.390
arguments that are not so complementary
and you'd see how they work so I have

you have to stick with their choice with

you have to stick with their choice with
your choice because if for example you

your choice because if for example you

your choice because if for example you
use in your conversations with a

you're making the choice other questions

you're making the choice other questions
yes um could you come back to the gender

01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760
yes um could you come back to the gender

you know actually female have some I

01:11:13.399 --> 01:11:13.409
you know actually female have some I

don't know what's your understanding for
 

01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:17.990
don't know what's your understanding for
this result yeah i guess i would say

01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000
this result yeah i guess i would say
 

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:23.120
this result yeah i guess i would say
that i did not find the same phenomenon

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:23.130
that i did not find the same phenomenon
 

01:11:23.130 --> 01:11:27.260

for gender when i did the national study
that I found at Georgetown mm-hmm so in

01:11:31.399 --> 01:11:31.409
that I found at Georgetown mm-hmm so in
 

01:11:31.409 --> 01:11:34.040
that I found at Georgetown mm-hmm so in
this particular case it is quite clear

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:34.050
this particular case it is quite clear
 

01:11:34.050 --> 01:11:39.250
this particular case it is quite clear
that that the females are already Jenner

01:11:39.250 --> 01:11:39.260
that that the females are already Jenner
 

01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:41.379

I can find the corresponding chart for
the National Head Start question oh

01:12:04.839 --> 01:12:04.849
the National Head Start question oh
 

01:12:04.849 --> 01:12:07.680
the National Head Start question oh
that's probably I think I passed it by

that's probably I think I passed it by
 

01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:13.240
that's probably I think I passed it by
um you know here I don't know I guess in

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:13.250
um you know here I don't know I guess in
 

01:12:13.250 --> 01:12:17.109
um you know here I don't know I guess in
some sense in some sense you reach the

01:12:17.109 --> 01:12:17.119
some sense in some sense you reach the
 

01:12:17.119 --> 01:12:19.540
some sense in some sense you reach the
same conclusion that is the issue frames

01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:19.550
same conclusion that is the issue frames
 

01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:21.899
same conclusion that is the issue frames
don't seem to be mattering quite as much

01:12:21.899 --> 01:12:21.909
don't seem to be mattering quite as much
 

01:12:21.909 --> 01:12:25.330
don't seem to be mattering quite as much
for women in this national sample the

for women in this national sample the
 

01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:28.390
for women in this national sample the
issue frames matter a little more for

01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:28.400
issue frames matter a little more for

particular issue frame should matter

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:40.130
particular issue frame should matter
 

01:12:40.130 --> 01:12:46.029
particular issue frame should matter
more for a manner for women just as kind

01:12:46.029 --> 01:12:46.039
more for a manner for women just as kind

well be gender differences on some
 

01:13:08.239 --> 01:13:11.740
well be gender differences on some
specific issues so remember I've just

01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:11.750
specific issues so remember I've just
 

01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:15.220
specific issues so remember I've just
looked at two very specific case studies

01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:15.230
looked at two very specific case studies
 

01:13:15.230 --> 01:13:17.950
looked at two very specific case studies
in the empirical research here if you

01:13:17.950 --> 01:13:17.960
in the empirical research here if you
 

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.600
in the empirical research here if you
were to look at a number of other

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:19.610
were to look at a number of other
 

01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:20.859
were to look at a number of other
children's issues you might reach

01:13:20.859 --> 01:13:20.869
children's issues you might reach
 

01:13:20.869 --> 01:13:24.220
children's issues you might reach
somewhat different conclusions yeah hi

01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:24.230
somewhat different conclusions yeah hi
 

01:13:24.230 --> 01:13:26.500
somewhat different conclusions yeah hi
thanks for your talk really appreciate

thanks for your talk really appreciate
it there's some research that I'm quite

01:13:28.990 --> 01:13:29.000
it there's some research that I'm quite
 

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.910
it there's some research that I'm quite
unfamiliar with about the messenger

01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:30.920
unfamiliar with about the messenger

unfamiliar with about the messenger
Matic mattering and I there was a nice

01:13:34.419 --> 01:13:34.429
Matic mattering and I there was a nice
 

01:13:34.429 --> 01:13:35.979
Matic mattering and I there was a nice
piece I think it was an op ad in The

01:13:35.979 --> 01:13:35.989
piece I think it was an op ad in The
 

01:13:35.989 --> 01:13:37.419
piece I think it was an op ad in The
Times New York Times the last few months

01:13:37.419 --> 01:13:37.429
Times New York Times the last few months
 

01:13:37.429 --> 01:13:38.919
Times New York Times the last few months
but i'm not sure if it was there the

01:13:38.919 --> 01:13:38.929
but i'm not sure if it was there the
 

01:13:38.929 --> 01:13:40.779
but i'm not sure if it was there the
post or somewhere else anyways the

01:13:40.779 --> 01:13:40.789
post or somewhere else anyways the
 

01:13:40.789 --> 01:13:42.910
post or somewhere else anyways the
question I had was is there any research

01:13:42.910 --> 01:13:42.920
question I had was is there any research
 

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:45.339
question I had was is there any research
that you're aware of on the relative

01:13:45.339 --> 01:13:45.349
that you're aware of on the relative
 

01:13:45.349 --> 01:13:48.759
that you're aware of on the relative
merits in terms of moving people of the

01:13:48.759 --> 01:13:48.769
merits in terms of moving people of the
 

01:13:48.769 --> 01:13:52.200
merits in terms of moving people of the
messenger versus the message it

01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:52.210
messenger versus the message it
 

01:13:52.210 --> 01:13:54.810
messenger versus the message it
I think there is some literature on that

01:13:54.810 --> 01:13:54.820
I think there is some literature on that
 

01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:57.959
I think there is some literature on that
and I'm not too familiar with it but I

01:13:57.959 --> 01:13:57.969
and I'm not too familiar with it but I
 

01:13:57.969 --> 01:13:59.760
and I'm not too familiar with it but I
think the premise of your question is

01:13:59.760 --> 01:13:59.770
think the premise of your question is
 

01:13:59.770 --> 01:14:03.600
think the premise of your question is
absolutely correct I'm inclined to

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:03.610
absolutely correct I'm inclined to
 

01:14:03.610 --> 01:14:08.040
absolutely correct I'm inclined to
believe that the messenger matters not

01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:08.050
believe that the messenger matters not
 

01:14:08.050 --> 01:14:09.810
believe that the messenger matters not
just in the obvious sense that some

01:14:09.810 --> 01:14:09.820
just in the obvious sense that some
 

01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:13.020
just in the obvious sense that some
people are more appealing in delivering

01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:13.030
people are more appealing in delivering
 

01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:16.110
people are more appealing in delivering
a message but also in in the broader

01:14:16.110 --> 01:14:16.120
a message but also in in the broader
 

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:20.490
a message but also in in the broader
sense that some organizations have more

01:14:20.490 --> 01:14:20.500
sense that some organizations have more
 

01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:24.270
sense that some organizations have more
credibility with with some groups of

01:14:24.270 --> 01:14:24.280
credibility with with some groups of
 

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:27.959
credibility with with some groups of
voters than others so to emphasize that

01:14:27.959 --> 01:14:27.969
voters than others so to emphasize that
 

01:14:27.969 --> 01:14:29.700
voters than others so to emphasize that
point there's some very interesting

01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:29.710
point there's some very interesting
 

01:14:29.710 --> 01:14:32.190
point there's some very interesting
research that's been that was just

01:14:32.190 --> 01:14:32.200
research that's been that was just
 

01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:33.209
research that's been that was just
published in the american sociological

01:14:33.209 --> 01:14:33.219
published in the american sociological
 

01:14:33.219 --> 01:14:38.430
published in the american sociological
review that shows that conservatives are

01:14:38.430 --> 01:14:38.440
review that shows that conservatives are
 

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:41.640
review that shows that conservatives are
much more skeptical of science than

01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:41.650
much more skeptical of science than
 

01:14:41.650 --> 01:14:44.790
much more skeptical of science than
liberals so what are the implications of

01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:44.800
liberals so what are the implications of
 

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:48.050
liberals so what are the implications of
that one implication might be that a

01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:48.060
that one implication might be that a
 

01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:51.050
that one implication might be that a
study funded by the National Science

01:14:51.050 --> 01:14:51.060
study funded by the National Science
 

01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:54.240
study funded by the National Science
Foundation or a study commissioned by

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:54.250
Foundation or a study commissioned by
 

01:14:54.250 --> 01:14:59.190
Foundation or a study commissioned by
the National Academy of Sciences will be

01:14:59.190 --> 01:14:59.200
the National Academy of Sciences will be
 

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:01.830
the National Academy of Sciences will be
more favorably received by Democrats

01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:01.840
more favorably received by Democrats
 

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:06.170
more favorably received by Democrats
than by Republicans that the scientific

01:15:06.170 --> 01:15:06.180
than by Republicans that the scientific
 

01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:08.880
than by Republicans that the scientific
imprimatur has more cachet with the

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:08.890
imprimatur has more cachet with the
 

01:15:08.890 --> 01:15:10.110
imprimatur has more cachet with the
Democrats than it does with the

01:15:10.110 --> 01:15:10.120
Democrats than it does with the
 

01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:13.020
Democrats than it does with the
Republicans so that might be one one

01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:13.030
Republicans so that might be one one
 

01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:19.620
Republicans so that might be one one
possibility the so the messenger can

01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:19.630
possibility the so the messenger can
 

01:15:19.630 --> 01:15:24.570
possibility the so the messenger can
matter obviously Democrats and

01:15:24.570 --> 01:15:24.580
matter obviously Democrats and
 

01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:25.709
matter obviously Democrats and
Republicans liberals and conservatives

01:15:25.709 --> 01:15:25.719
Republicans liberals and conservatives
 

01:15:25.719 --> 01:15:28.380
Republicans liberals and conservatives
also have their preferred organizations

01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:28.390
also have their preferred organizations
 

01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:30.240
also have their preferred organizations
there go to organizations that they turn

01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:30.250
there go to organizations that they turn
 

01:15:30.250 --> 01:15:32.070
there go to organizations that they turn
to when they're looking for evidence

01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:32.080
to when they're looking for evidence
 

01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:34.830
to when they're looking for evidence
when they're looking for guidance and so

01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:34.840
when they're looking for guidance and so
 

01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:36.600
when they're looking for guidance and so
in that sense the messenger may also

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:36.610
in that sense the messenger may also
 

01:15:36.610 --> 01:15:42.990
in that sense the messenger may also
matter

01:15:42.990 --> 01:15:43.000
 

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:49.900
okay okay thank you thanks for watching
