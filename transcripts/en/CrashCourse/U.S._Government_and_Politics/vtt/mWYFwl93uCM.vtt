Hi. I'm Craig, and this is Crash Course Government
and Politics, and today we're going to talk

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.250
about the most important case the Supreme
Court ever decided ever. No, Stan, not Youngstown

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.530
Sheet and Tube Company vs. Sawyer. Although,
that is one of my favorites. Loves me some

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.439
sheet and tube. And no, it's not Ex parte
Quirin. Although I do love me some inept Nazi

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.449
spies and submarines. And no, it is not Miller
v. California. Get your mind out of the gutter

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.689
Stan. We could play this game all day, but
this episode is about judicial review: the

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.269
most important power of the Supreme Court
and where it came from. Don't look so disappointed.

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:32.029
This is cool!

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:40.849
[Theme Music]

00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:44.579
When you think of the Supreme Court, the first
thing you think about, other than those comfy

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.999
robes, is the power to declare laws unconstitutional.
The term for this awesome power, the main

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:52.999
check that the court has on both the legislative
and executive branches, is judicial review.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.799
Technically, judicial review is the power
of the judiciary to examine and invalidate

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:01.339
actions undertaken by the legislative and executive
branches of both the federal and state governments.

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:04.960
It's not the power to review lower court decisions.
That's appellate jurisdiction. Most people

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.280
think of judicial review as declaring laws
unconstitutional, and that definition is okay.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.120
The legal purist will quibble with you since
judicial review applies to more than just laws.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.180
Appellate courts, both state and federal,
engage in some form of judicial review, but

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.939
we're concerned here with the federal courts
especially the U.S. Supreme Court. The Court

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.649
has the power to review the following:
One, Congressional laws a.k.a. statutes! Statutes.

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.770
Since judicial review is a form of appellate
activity, it involves upholding or affirming

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.850
the validity of laws, or denying it, invalidating
the law in question. You might think that

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.499
the Supreme Court does this a lot, but it
doesn't and historically it almost never happened

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:41.079
before the twentieth century. If the court
were always striking down congressional statutes,

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:44.210
it would be hard for people to know which
laws to follow, and you'll remember that one

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.189
of the main things that courts do is create
expectations and predictability. For instance,

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.249
you could predict that I would eventually
be punching this eagle!

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:55.240
Another reason why they don't invalidate laws
often is that if the Court frequently overruled

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.960
Congress, the Court would seem too political
and people would stop trusting its judgment.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.889
If the Court has any power at all, it largely
stems from its prestige and reputation for

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:07.860
being impartial and above politics. No one has
any problems with the Supreme Court decisions, at all.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.480
Two, the Court can also overturn state actions
which include the laws passed by state legislatures

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.870
and the activities of state executive bureaus,
usually the police.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.900
The power to review and overturn states comes
from the Supremacy Clause in the Constitution.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.269
Most of the time that the Supreme Court extends
civil rights, it comes out of a state action.

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.690
A good example is Brown vs. Board of Education
where the Court struck down the idea of separate

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.750
accommodations being equal in the context
of state public schools.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.230
Three, the Court can review the actions of
federal bureaucratic agencies. Although, we

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.989
usually defer to the bureaucrat's expertise
if the action is consistent with the intent

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.379
of the legislature which the Court usually
finds it is. The Court almost never strikes

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.959
down Congressional delegation of power to the
executive. Although, you might think that it should.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.860
The fourth area where the Court exercises
judicial review is over Presidential actions.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.340
The Court tends to defer to the President,
especially in the area of national security.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.379
The classic example of the Court overturning
executive action happened in U.S. vs. Nixon

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.939
where the Justices denied the President's
claim of executive privilege and forced him

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:03.739
to turn over his recordings relating to the Watergate
scandal. More recently, the Court placed

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.580
limits on the President's authority to deny habeas
corpus to suspected terrorists in Rasul vs. Bush.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.610
So, the Supremacy Clause gives the Court the
authority to rule on state laws, but where

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.530
exactly in the Constitution does the power
of judicial review come from? Trick question!

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.349
It's not there, go look ahead, look. I'll
wait. See, not there. Wow, you went through

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.659
that whole thing really quickly. Fast reader.

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:26.199
The crazy thing is that the power of
judicial review comes from the Court itself.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.040
How?
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.629
The Supreme Court granted itself the power
of judicial review in the case of Marbury

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:35.239
vs. Madison. You really should read the decision
because it's a brilliant piece of politics.

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.700
The upshot of the case was that Chief Justice
John Marshall ruled that the Court had the

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.010
power to review, uphold, and strike down executive
actions pursuant to the Judiciary Act of 1789,

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.680
and in doing this, to strike down part of that
federal law. How he got there was pretty cool.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.579
So, Marbury was an official that President
John Adams, at the very end of his term, appointed

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.040
to the position of Justice of the Peace. When
Marbury went to get his official commission

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.200
certifying that he could start his job, James
Madison, who was Secretary of State, refused

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.519
to give it to him. So, Marbury did what any
self-respecting petitioner would do, he went

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.680
to the Supreme Court for a writ of mandamus
that would force Madison to give Marbury his job.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.340
This is what he was supposed to do according
to the Judiciary Act of 1789.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.939
What Marshall did was brilliant! He ruled
that yes, Marbury had a right to the commission

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:17.070
but that the Supreme Court could not grant
his writ because the law directing them to

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.630
do so was unconstitutional. This is brilliant
for two reasons. First, by the time the time

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.380
the case came before the Court, Thomas Jefferson
was President. Those of you who remember Crash

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.260
Course U.S. History will recall that that
less handsome man told you that Jefferson

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.300
was a Democratic Republican while Adams,
Marbury, and even Marshall were all Federalists.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.040
By ruling against his own party, Marshall made
a decision that was favorable to Jefferson

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.680
and thus, likely to be supported.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.640
The second move was even cooler. Marshall's
ruling took the power of writs of mandamus

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.850
away from the Court, making it look weaker,
while at the same time giving the Court the

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.100
power to declare the law that had granted it the
mandamus power in the first place unconstitutional.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.980
So by weakening the Court in this instance,
like Daredevil going blind as a kid, Marshall

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.620
made it much stronger for the future, like
Daredevil getting stronger in the future.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.540
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.160
So that's where judicial review comes from,
but that still leaves many questions. A big

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.320
question is, why has this ruling stuck around
and hasn't been overturned by other laws or

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.840
later court decisions? Another question is, is
judicial review a violation of separation of powers?

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.920
Some say that it's judges making laws and thus an
anti-democratic usurpation of the legislature's power.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.710
Let's talk about this rulings longevity first.
Remember when I said last time that the Supreme

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.260
Court rulings are binding in lower courts?
You don't remember do ya? You were sleepin'. Wake up!

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.080
Well, in general, Supreme Court precedents
are binding on future Supreme Courts too because

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.260
of the principle of stare decisis, which is
Latin for "let the decision stand." This doesn't

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.960
mean that future Supreme Court's can never
overturn the decisions of prior Courts, it's

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.870
just that they try very hard to not do it.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.750
This idea of precedent is one way that judges
can be said to make laws. Appellate decisions

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.310
are like common law in that they are binding
on future courts and constrain their decisions

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.220
and because they don't have to be grounded
in a specific statute.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.460
Other courts have to follow the higher court's
interpretation of the law, and this interpretation

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.660
has the effect of redefining the law without
actually rewriting the statute.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.310
On the other hand, appellate decisions are
technically not common law in that they are

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.850
only binding on courts, not executive agencies
or legislatures. They are, however, signals

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.790
to courts and legislatures about how courts
will rule in the future. Maybe an example

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.060
will help. If you watch cop shows, or you
get arrested a lot, you probably know something

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.840
about Miranda vs. Arizona which gave us the
Miranda Warning. You have the right to remain

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.400
silent and all that stuff. Hopefully, you've
never heard that in person, though. But hey,

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:22.220
we're not here to judge. That's what the courts
are for! Bahahahaha. Okay.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.300
In that case, the Supreme Court threw out
Miranda's conviction because he hadn't been

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.900
told he had the right to remain silent. Without
knowing that he didn't have to talk, he made

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.000
a confession that got him convicted. The court
didn't rewrite Arizona's law but it sent a

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.810
signal to Arizona's law enforcement agencies,
and those in all the other states, that in

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.050
the future courts would throw out the convictions
of defendants who hadn't been informed of

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.330
their rights. As a result, police procedures
changed in every state, and now the police

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.370
are supposed to read the Miranda Rights to
anyone they arrest.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:48.240
So those are the very basics of judicial review.
We've probably raised as many questions as

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.000
we've answered, but that's why we're making a
bunch of these videos! So we can teach it all! All of it!

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.320
Anyway, the big concern for many is that cases
like Marbury vs. Madison, which give courts

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.550
the power to strike down pieces of legislation,
overturn the judgment of the elected representatives

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.460
that made the laws and violate the idea of
separation of powers.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.020
Well, that is a thorny issue, but it's one
that we don't have time to de-thorn today.

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:12.020
For now, understand that judicial review is
how the courts work in practice and not necessarily

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.870
a defined power granted by the Constitution.
Just remember, the executive and legislative

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.900
branches also operate with a lot of implied
powers that aren't explicitly granted to them

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.590
in the Constitution. That's because the governance
of the United States has evolved and changed

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.470
over time to hopefully, suit the needs of
the country as they change over time.
