00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.070
This is Sergio Canavero, an Italian neurosurgeon
who has announced plans to transplant an entire

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:12.330
human head onto a different human body at
the end of 2017…yep.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.910
Whole head transplant?

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.310
How possible is this?

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:16.600
Why hasn't this been done before?

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.010
And maybe most importantly, why are people
calling him crazy?

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.029
Unlike other organs, your brain and spinal
cord are extremely sensitive to damage and

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.210
resistant to repair.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.589
This is why injury to the neck or spine often
results in permanent injury and complete reattachment

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:35.719
of heads severed from their bodies has remained
the stuff of science fiction and fantasy.

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.989
That’s not to say that scientists aren’t
working diligently to develop techniques to

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.870
aid in spinal cord repair.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.809
Current approaches include stem-cell therapies
that encourage growth of new neurons and biological

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.010
“glues” that work like electrical tape
to patch severed fibers back together.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.410
But these approaches are far from helping
patients fully recover after trauma.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.339
If we could do that, it would be a sensational
step forward in the field of medical science.

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.860
Which brings us back to Sergio Canavero and
his plans to transplant an entire human head.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.640
The procedure proposed by Canavero and his
team requires cooling of both the donor head

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.310
and recipient body to increase the amount
of time both can survive without blood circulation.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.630
Next, the major blood vessels in the neck
would be dissected and reconnected.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.130
Once the head is moved over, the neuronal
fibers of the spinal cords would be fused

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.750
and the blood vesicles and muscles would be
sewn together.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.719
They would be kept in a coma for several weeks
for recovery and electrodes would be used

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:36.910
to electrically stimulate the nerve fibers
to encourage connection.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.200
But who would he be when he woke up?

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.200
He would be an entirely new patient.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.649
As a neuroscientist, I am incredibly excited
about what head transplants could teach us

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.960
about consciousness, identity, and the brain’s
conception of the “self”, not to mention

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.969
the millions of patients whose live will be
changed by improving techniques for spinal

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:57.789
cord repair but I have some questions: mainly
why do we think we can do this?

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.299
And: should we?

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.990
Canavero and his Chinese Collaborator Xiao-ping
Ren have been reporting progress on development

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.800
of head transplantation techniques to journalists
and the media for several years.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.250
They have claimed progress in transplant and/or
spinal cord repair in rodents, dogs, and primates.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.420
But only their work on rodents has been accepted
and published by scientifically credible sources.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.980
The scientific community in general likes
careful, validated, incremental progress,

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.340
and every time Canavero and his team announce
a result via Press Release instead of peer-reviewed

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.060
journal, the claim is met with skepticism
and disbelief.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.819
This is in part due to 1) poor scientific
technique in their experimental design (small

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.569
sample size, poor controls, and limited data
on “patient” outcomes), 2) their approach

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.550
of bypassing peer review and the options of
experts in favor of media coverage, and 3)

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.450
the fact that no other surgical team has yet
reproduced their results.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.690
If scientific understanding is to move forward,
we cannot refuse to try new things on the

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.110
basis that we have never done it before.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.300
And it is my belief that the scientific community
would be thrilled to accept a more conservative

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.250
approach driven by multiple successes in animal
models and less dramatic spinal cord repair

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.319
in humans before attempting whole head transplant.

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.959
But that leaves the question of whether we
should be transplanting heads at all.

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.930
In 2015 when Canavero first announced his
plan for whole head transplant of a human

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.379
patient, an article in Newsweek quoted then
president elect of the American Association

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.620
for Neurological Surgeons, as saying "I would
not wish this on anyone.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.420
I would not allow anyone to do it to me as
there are a lot of things worse than death."

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.269

Ok, so head transplants may be a little ways
away, but organ transplants are not!

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.159
Doctors do them all the time, but what happens
to your body after you donate your organs?

Find out in this video here.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.390
Would you sign up for a head transplant without
knowing how it could affect humans?
