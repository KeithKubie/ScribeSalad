00:00:00.654 --> 00:00:02.465
- [Voiceover] Ocean
sunfishes are well-known

00:00:02.465 --> 00:00:04.485
for rapidly gaining a lot of weight

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:06.772
on a diet based on jellyfish.

00:00:06.772 --> 00:00:09.826
The relationship between the
elapsed time, t, in days,

00:00:09.826 --> 00:00:14.678
since an ocean sunfish
is born, and its mass,

00:00:14.678 --> 00:00:18.858
M of t, in milligrams, is modeled
by the following function.

00:00:18.858 --> 00:00:19.903
All right.

00:00:19.903 --> 00:00:21.133
Complete the following sentence

00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:23.223
about the daily percent change

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.150
in the mass of the sunfish.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.658
Every day, there is a blank percent

00:00:27.658 --> 00:00:31.419
addition or removal from
the mass of the sunfish.

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.809
So one thing that we know
almost from the get-go,

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.594
we know that the sunfish gains weight,

00:00:38.594 --> 00:00:42.541
and we also see that
as t grows, as t grows,

00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:44.654
the exponent here is going to grow.

00:00:44.654 --> 00:00:46.136
And if you grow an exponent on something

00:00:46.136 --> 00:00:49.317
that is larger than one,
M of t is going to grow.

00:00:49.317 --> 00:00:52.010
So I already know it's going
to be about addition to

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.705
the mass of the sunfish.

00:00:53.705 --> 00:00:56.654
But let's think about how
much is added every day.

00:00:56.654 --> 00:00:58.233
Well, let's think about it.

00:00:58.233 --> 00:00:59.928
Well let's see if we can rewrite this.

00:00:59.928 --> 00:01:02.161
I'm going to just focus
on the right-hand side

00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:03.531
of this expression.

00:01:03.531 --> 00:01:06.758
So 1.35

00:01:06.758 --> 00:01:09.963
to the t/6 plus five.

00:01:09.963 --> 00:01:11.425
That's the same thing as

00:01:11.425 --> 00:01:15.972
1.35 to the fifth power,

00:01:15.972 --> 00:01:20.082
times 1.35

00:01:20.082 --> 00:01:23.077
to the t/6 power.

00:01:23.077 --> 00:01:25.492
And that's going to be equal to

00:01:25.492 --> 00:01:29.722
1.35 to the fifth power,

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:34.683
times 1.35,

00:01:34.683 --> 00:01:37.961
and I can separate this
t/6 as 1/6 times t.

00:01:37.961 --> 00:01:40.817
So 1.35 to the 1/6 power,

00:01:40.817 --> 00:01:45.530
and then that being
raised to the t-th power.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.343
So let's think about it.

00:01:46.343 --> 00:01:49.681
Every day, as t increases by one,

00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:52.050
now we can say that we're gonna take

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.579
the previous day's mass, and multiply it

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:57.088
by this common ratio.

00:01:57.088 --> 00:01:59.201
The common ratio here isn't
the way I've written it.

00:01:59.201 --> 00:02:00.594
Isn't 1.35.

00:02:00.594 --> 00:02:04.263
It's 1.35 to the 1/6 power.

00:02:04.263 --> 00:02:05.749
Let me draw a little table here

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:08.339
to make that really, really clear.

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:10.823
And all of that algebraic
manipulation I just did

00:02:10.823 --> 00:02:12.286
is just so I could simplify this,

00:02:12.286 --> 00:02:15.954
so I have some common
ratio to the t-th power.

00:02:15.954 --> 00:02:18.712
So t and M of t.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.183
So based on how I've just written it,

00:02:21.183 --> 00:02:23.017
when t is zero,

00:02:23.017 --> 00:02:24.759
well if t is zero, this is one,

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:29.008
so then we just have our initial mass,

00:02:29.008 --> 00:02:31.125
it's going to be 1.35

00:02:31.125 --> 00:02:33.540
to the fifth power.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.466
And then when t is equal to one,

00:02:36.466 --> 00:02:38.904
it's going to be our initial mass,

00:02:38.904 --> 00:02:43.037
1.35 to the fifth power

00:02:43.037 --> 00:02:44.662
times our common ratio,

00:02:44.662 --> 00:02:48.103
times 1.35

00:02:48.103 --> 00:02:50.147
to the 1/6 power.

00:02:50.147 --> 00:02:52.494
When t equals two, we're
just gonna multiply

00:02:52.494 --> 00:02:53.956
what we had at t equals one,

00:02:53.956 --> 00:02:55.252
and we're just gonna multiply that

00:02:55.252 --> 00:02:58.211
times 1.35 to the 1/6 again.

00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:02.549
And so, every day, we are growing

00:03:04.054 --> 00:03:08.466
by our common ratio,
1.35 to the 1/6 power.

00:03:08.466 --> 00:03:09.975
Actually, let me get a calculator out.

00:03:09.975 --> 00:03:12.808
We're allowed to use
calculators in this exercise.

00:03:12.808 --> 00:03:15.849
So 1.35

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.866
to the, open parentheses,

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:23.837
one divided by six,

00:03:23.837 --> 00:03:25.578
close parentheses, power,

00:03:25.578 --> 00:03:27.224
is equal to,

00:03:32.068 --> 00:03:35.553
I'll say 1.051, approximately.

00:03:35.553 --> 00:03:38.339
So this

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:41.938
is approximately 1.051.

00:03:41.938 --> 00:03:43.935
So we can say this is approximately

00:03:43.935 --> 00:03:47.186
1.35 times

00:03:47.186 --> 00:03:52.062
1.051 to the t-th power.

00:03:52.062 --> 00:03:56.311
So every day, we are growing
by a factor of 1.051.

00:03:56.311 --> 00:03:59.144
Well growing by a factor of 1.051

00:03:59.144 --> 00:04:02.580
means that you are adding
a little bit more than 5%.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.526
You're adding 0.51 every day of your mass,

00:04:07.526 --> 00:04:10.358
so you're adding 5.1%.

00:04:10.358 --> 00:04:12.718
And if you're rounding
to the nearest percent,

00:04:12.718 --> 00:04:15.592
we would say there's a 5% addition

00:04:15.592 --> 00:04:18.446
to the mass of the sunfish every day.
