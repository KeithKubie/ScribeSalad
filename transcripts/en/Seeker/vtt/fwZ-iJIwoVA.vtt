00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.800
This Dnews episode is brought to you by Domain
Dot Com!

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.880
Science is awesome.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.850
It’s literally the coolest thing in the
universe.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.919
And I literally mean literally.

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:17.520
Hey there cool cats, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.170
Winter is coming, and the North remembers
that familiar chill as the temperature drops

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.840
and everyone bundles up and wishes that hot,
sticky, uncomfortable summer would come back.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.020
But you know where it’s been really cold
for the last 15 days?

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.020
Italy.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:37.390
Scientists at the Cryogenic Underground Observatory
for Rare Events, or CUORE, have cooled a 400

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.930
kilogram copper cubic meter to .006 degrees
above absolute zero.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.780
that’s negative 273.144 Celsius or what
Canadians would call “chilly.”

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.179
They plan on using the block to detect rare
radioactivity, including the as-yet theoretical

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:57.230
neutrinoless double-beta decay.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.620
And how will they detect this radiation?

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.920
When it heats tellurium dioxide crystals of
course.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.490
Do you ever get the feeling scientists got
into the field just so they could give things

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.750
bitchin’ names?

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.259
But while this is the closest something this
big and voluminous has gotten to zero kelvin,

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:15.200
it’s not the coldest ever ever, not even
close.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.700
Researchers at Yale have used lasers on molecules
suspended in a magnetic field to slow simple

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.969
strontium monofluoride molecules to .0025
Kelvin.

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:27.600
It’s the coldest a molecule has ever gotten.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.560
That’s almost as chill as a bro named Chad
wearing an upside down visor.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.439
But nothing compares to what the YKI group
in Sweden produced in 2010.

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:44.390
They also used magneto-optical trapping to
cool rhodium to 100 piko kelvin, or .000 000

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.579
000 1 degrees.

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.380
It’s the current world record and for all
we know, it’s the current universe record

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.380
as well.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.090
They aren’t just doing this because it’s
mind blowing and awesome, though that’s

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.749
all the reason I really need.

00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:01.109
Matter at such low temperatures behaves in
new and exciting ways.

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:06.149
Remember, temperature is literally how fast
atoms are moving, with 0K meaning they stop

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.149
completely.

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.030
That’s theoretically impossible, but when
they get close, instead of bouncing around

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.310
at random, some elements move all together
as though they’re one giant atom.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.620
It’s called a Bose-Einstein Condensate,
and it’s a whole different state of matter

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.170
from gas, liquid, solid, or plasma.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.459
BEC’s are useful because since they act
as a giant atom they make it easier to observe

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.510
quantum effects, which helps test assumptions
we make about quantum mechanics.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.560
BECs also have been used to slow light itself
down to a crawl.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.470
A Harvard team has used a BEC of sodium to
slow light, which travels at over a billion

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.099
kilometers an hour, to just 25 kilometers
per hour.

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:49.430
So if anyone ever tells you science isn’t
cool, they couldn’t possibly be more wrong.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.659
Wanna hear some more mind blowing numbers?

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.040
How about a million.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.489
As in DNews has a million subscribers!

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.860
As a special treat you can find out what Trace
and Tara are like behind the scenes here.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.780
What do you think is the coolest thing about
science?

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.370
Figuratively obviously.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.650
Let us know in the comments and I’ll see
you next time on DNews.
