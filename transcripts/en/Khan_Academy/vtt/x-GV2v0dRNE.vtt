00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.910
Let's see if taking the
transpose of a matrix does

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:05.510
anything to its determinant.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.365
So a good place to start is just
with the 2-by-2 scenario.

00:00:09.365 --> 00:00:12.380
So let's do the 2-by-2
scenario.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.570
So if I start with
some matrix here.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.219
Let me just take its
determinant.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.280
So a, b, c, d.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.610
And then let me take
its determinant.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.930
So this is going to be
equal to ad minus bc.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.370
Let me take the transpose of
this and then take its

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.980
determinant.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.810
So that would be the determinant
of ac, the columns

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.870
turn into the rows, and
then bd, the rows

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.150
turn into the columns.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.570
What is this going
to be equal to?

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.620
This is going to be equal
to ad minus bc again.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.820
The only thing that happened is
these two guys got swapped

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.610
and they multiply times
each other anyway.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.700
So these two things
are equivalent.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:01.090
So at least for the 2-by-2 case,
the determinant of some

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:07.440
matrix is equal to the
determinant of the transpose

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.100
of that matrix.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.380
Now, that's just the
2-by-2 case.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.210
Now, I'm going to make an
inductive argument, or I could

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:21.170
just say an argument by
induction, to show that this

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.090
works for all n by
n, for all cases.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.760
And the way you construct an
argument by induction is you

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.990
assume that it's true
for the n-by-n case.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.373
So let's assume that for
n by n, and let's

00:01:48.373 --> 00:01:49.623
say I have some matrix.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.920
Let me call it matrix B, and
let's say it's an n-by-n

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.270
matrix, we assume that the
determinant of any matrix B

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.740
that's n by n is equal to the
determinant of B's transpose.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.289
That's where we started off with
our inductive argument.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:20.580
And then we see if given this,
if given that, is it true of n

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.610
plus 1 by n plus 1 matrix?

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.910
Because if we can, if we can
say, look, given that it's

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.470
true for the n-by-n case, it's
going to be true for the n

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.240
plus 1 by n plus 1 case, then
we're done because we know

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.220
it's true for the base case,
the 2-by-2 case, which you

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.130
could say, well, that's
your first n by n.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.460
So if it's true for the 2 by 2
case, then it'll be true for

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.170
the 3-by-3 case, because that's
just one increment.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.530
But then if it's true for the
3-by-3 case, then it'll be

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.170
true for the 4-by-4 case.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.210
And if it's true for the 4-by-4
case, it'll be true for

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.190
the 5-by-5 case, and you just
keep going up like that.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.730
So when you do a proof by
induction, you prove a base

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.050
case, and then you prove that if
it's true for n, or in this

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.010
case an n-by-n determinant, if
you can prove that given it's

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.690
true for an n-by-n determinant,
it's going to be

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.560
true for an n plus 1 by n plus
1 determinant or an n plus 1

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.850
by n plus 1 matrix, then you
have completed your proof.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.145
So let's see if this
is the case.

00:03:18.145 --> 00:03:24.742
So let me construct an n plus
1 by n plus 1 matrix.

00:03:24.742 --> 00:03:30.140
So let's say I have my matrix
A, my favorite letter to use

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.330
for matrices, I think the
entirely linear algebra's

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.180
favorite letter to
use for matrices.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.290
And let's say it's an n plus
1 by n plus 1 matrix.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.430
And just to simplify my notation
let's just say that m

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.740
is equal to n plus 1.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.160
So we could call it
an m-by-m matrix.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.840
And what is it going
to look like?

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.070
Let's draw its entries
right here.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.270
I'm going to draw more than the
normal amount of entries.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:03.970
a11, this is its first row,
a12, all the way to a1m.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.000
We have m columns, which is the
same thing as m plus 1.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
That's not m times 1 columns.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.830
This is m plus 1 as well.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.800
And then we do our second
row right here.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:22.700
a21, a22, a23, all
the way to a2m.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:31.120
Then you have your third row
right here: a31, a32, a33, all

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.540
the way to a3m.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.050
And then you go all
the way down here.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.015
At the end you have your mth
row, which you could also say

00:04:41.015 --> 00:04:44.150
is your m plus 1 row.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.600
So it's your mth row, first
column, and then you have a

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:56.820
sub m2, and then a sub m3,
all the way to a sub mm.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.280
Fair enough.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.340
Now, let me draw the
transpose of A.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:09.120
So a transpose is also going to
be an n plus 1 by n plus 1

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.270
matrix, which you could also
write as an m-by-m matrix.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.960
I'm just going to have to take
the transpose of this.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.670
So the transpose of that, this
row becomes a column, so it

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.690
becomes a11, and this entry
right here is a12.

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.440
It's this entry right there.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:35.450
Then you can go all the
way down to a1m.

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:42.480
Then this pink row becomes a
pink column here, a21-- I

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.600
wanted to do it in pink.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:54.190
You have a21, a22, you have an
a23, and it goes all the way

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.680
down to a2m.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.065
You have your green row right
here, it's your third one, so

00:05:59.065 --> 00:06:07.390
it's a31, a32, a33, all
the way down to a3m.

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.820
And then we can just skip a
bunch of rows in this case,

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.270
but it's columns in this case.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:18.910
So you just draw some dots
and you have am1, am2.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.290
I'm just going down this guy,
but this row is now going to

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:22.875
become-- which was
the last row.

00:06:22.875 --> 00:06:24.970
It's now going to become
the last column.

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:29.990
am3, all the way down to amm.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.320
And I have my transpose.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.100
Now, let's take the
determinant of A.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.270
Let me do it in purple.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:47.260
So the determinant of my matrix
A, we could just go

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.120
down this first row up here.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:56.450
It's going to be equal to a11
times the determinant of its

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.410
submatrix, so it's the
determinant of this submatrix

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:01.660
right here.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:10.180
We could call that the
submatrix a sub 11.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.740
We've seen this notation
before.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:19.170
So it's the determinant of a sub
11, and then it is minus

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:24.560
a12 times the determinant of
its submatrix, so you cross

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.710
out that row and that column.

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:30.230
So that is going to be a sub 12,
and you're going to go all

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.140
the way to-- and I don't what
the sign on that is, so we

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:37.650
could call it negative 1 to the
1 plus m-- that'll give us

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.260
the right sign for the
checkerboard pattern-- times

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.220
the determinant of the submatrix
for this guy.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:47.960
So we call it a1m, where you
cross out that guy's row, that

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.540
guy's column, and you're
just left with all of

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.250
this stuff over here.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:52.310
Fair enough.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.790
Now, let's look at the
determinant of a transpose.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.200
We learned earlier, you don't
have to go down the first row

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.400
or you don't even
go down a row.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.840
You could go down a column.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.970
Let me be clear.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:09.080
So for our determinant of A, we
went down this row, and our

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.140
submatrices, this was
my first submatrix.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.820
My second submatrix, you know
what it looks like.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.460
You would cross out the second
column and that row, and

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.040
whatever's left over would be
the second submatrix and so on

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.010
and so forth.

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:22.420
But for our determinant of A
transpose, let's just go down

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:27.520
this first column and get the
submatrices like that.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.790
So this is going to be equal
to-- let's get our first term

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:31.070
right here.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:36.320
a sub 11 times the determinant
of its submatrix.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.039
So what's the determinant
of its submatrix?

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:41.740
It's going to be-- its
submatrix, you cross out its

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:46.000
row and its column, and you're
going to be left with this

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
thing right here.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.120
Now, an interesting question
is how does this thing that

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.760
I've just squared off, this
guy's submatrix, relate to

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.450
this guy's submatrix?

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:59.610
Well, if you look at it
carefully, this row from a22

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:04.320
to a2m has now become a column
from a22 to a2m.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.820
This row, which is the next one,
from a32 to a3m has now

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.540
become a column from
a32 to a3m.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:13.120
If you keep going down this last
row, it has now become

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.570
this column.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:18.690
So this guy's submatrix or the
thing we're going to have to

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:21.610
take the determinant of right
here is equal to the transpose

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:22.710
of this guy.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:34.190
So this is equal to a
sub 11 transpose.

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:40.350
And if you go through it, we go
minus this guy, minus a12

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:42.590
times the determinant
of his submatrix.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:48.110
And if we cross out this guy's
row and that guy's column,

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:49.400
what is that going
to look like?

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.840
His submatrix is going
to look like this.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.030
It's going to have that there
and it's going to have that

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:56.120
right there.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.060
How does that compare to a12?

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.670
So a12 is if you crossed out
this and this, you're left

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.260
with all of this right here.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.920
So once again, you see that this
row is the same thing as

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:12.610
this column, that this row is
the same thing as this column,

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:14.880
that that row is the same
thing as that column.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.980
So once again, the submatrix
we have to take the

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.070
determinant of is equal
to the transpose of

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.580
this thing over here.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:25.500
So it's equal to
a12 transpose.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:29.270
This thing-- I could draw it
shaded in-- is equal to the

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:34.290
transpose of this thing, is
equal to the transpose of that

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:35.000
thing right there.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.330
So, in general, each of these
submatrices when we go down

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.860
this row is equal to the
transpose of each of these.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.950
So you keep going, so then
you're going to go all the way

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:46.440
to plus minus 1.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.570
We're going to go all the way
down to the minus 1, 1 plus m

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:55.150
times the determinant of--
it's going to be this guy

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:55.530
transposed.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:56.680
You can even do it.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:00.560
If you go all the way to-- if
you cross that guy out and

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.190
that guy out, you're left with
everything else on this

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:07.800
matrix, and that's equal to the
transpose of if you cross

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.030
this guy out and that guy out.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:12.770
This row turns into that column,
that row turns into

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:13.660
that column.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.030
I think you see the point.

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.290
I don't want to beat
a dead horse.

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:21.230
So that's going to be equal
to a sub 1m transpose.

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:25.440
Now, remember, going into this
inductive proof, or proof by

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.120
induction, I assume that for--
remember, this is an n plus 1

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.630
by n plus 1 matrix.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:34.200
But going into it, I assumed
that for an n-by-n matrix, the

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.330
determinant of B
is equal to the

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:39.180
determinant of B transpose.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:43.430
Well, these guys right
here, these are

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:45.490
n-by-n matrices, right?

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:50.330
This guy right here is an
n plus 1 by n plus 1.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.230
Same thing for this
guy right here.

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:54.560
But these guys right
here are n by n.

00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:02.060
So if we assume for the n-by-n
case that the determinant of a

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:05.390
matrix is equal to the
determinant of a transpose--

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:07.170
this is the determinant of
the matrix, this is the

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:09.360
determinant of its transpose--
these two

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.300
things have to be equal.

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:15.500
So we can then say that the
determinant of A transpose is

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:21.110
equal to this term A sub 11
times this, but this is equal

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:23.040
to this for the n-by-n case.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.540
Remember, we're doing the n
plus 1 by n plus 1 case.

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:29.450
But these submatrices
are one dimension

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:30.960
smaller in each direction.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.700
It has one less row and
one less column.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:33.955
So these two things are equal.

00:12:33.955 --> 00:12:36.430
So instead of writing this, I
can just write this, so times

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:39.820
the determinant of a sub 11.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:40.720
Then you keep going.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.920
Minus a sub 12 times
the determinant.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.730
Instead of writing this, I
could write that because

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:46.840
they're equal.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:52.240
Determinant a sub 12, all the
way to plus minus 1 to the 1

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.570
plus m times the determinant
of this.

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:56.750
These two things are equal.

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:58.730
That is equal to that.

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:00.620
That was our assumption
in this inductive

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:04.230
proof, a sub 1m.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:06.790
And then you see that, of
course, this line, this blue

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:09.450
line here, is equivalent to
this blue line there.

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:16.100
So we get that the determinant
of A, which is an n plus 1 by

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:22.240
n plus 1, so this is the n
plus 1 by n plus 1 case.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.260
We get the determinant
of A is equal to the

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.380
determinant of A transpose.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:36.310
And we got this assuming that it
is true-- let me write it--

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:43.950
assuming that it's true
for n-by-n case.

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:44.610
And then we're done.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:47.230
We've now proved that this is
true in general, because we've

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:48.350
proven the base case.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:52.300
We've proven it for the 2-by-2
case, and then we showed that

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.230
if it's true for the n
case, it's true for

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:55.940
the n plus 1 case.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.980
So if it's true for the 2 case,
it's going to be true

00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:59.570
for the 3-by-3 case.

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:02.110
If it's true for the 3-by-3
case, it's true for the 4-by-4

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:03.810
case, so on and so forth.

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:05.460
But the takeaway
is pretty neat.

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.020
You can take the transpose, the

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.160
determinant doesn't change.
