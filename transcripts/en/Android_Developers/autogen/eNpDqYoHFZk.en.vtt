00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.035
 Erdem Enan: Peak Games was founded in 2010. 

00:00:08.035 --> 00:00:11.320
 Our goal is to design global technological products 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.170
 And access to millions of users. 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.370
 We operate from our headquarters in Istanbul, so we started targeting Turkey. 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.430
 But soon we expanded to cover other countries. 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.050
 We look for classic gaming experience and try to move it 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.910
 For use on mobile, by creating a game with 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.360
 Social activity and interaction from the audience so that users can 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.360
 Social networking, enjoyment, harassment and chat in 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.130
 Digital environment. 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.390
 In addition, we design simplified games 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.310
 -Type game levels by clicking and scrolling 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.840
 And plugging. 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.860
 Our goal is to upgrade all our games especially 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.530
 In target markets, 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.700
 And gaining world-class reputation. 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.520
 Android is our top priority. 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.480
 We were able to attract 65,000 times a day 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.040
 From Android. 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.300
 For example, for Spades Plus, more than 70% 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.820
 Of your mobile earnings are coming from Android. 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.580
 Most of our games depend on settings. 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.980
 So offer a luxury when used in chat 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.600
 And perseverance. 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.400
 Attract more users on Android 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.210
 Much easier than any other operating system on mobile. 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.970
 Thanks to its dynamic and flexible structure, ease and speed 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.020
 Optimized by repeating it, which gave us speed in providing 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.380
 Solutions when there is a problem. 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.210
 This gave us great flexibility, 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.370
 Since most of the games are classic 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.615
 Much depends on the user experience. 

00:01:29.615 --> 00:01:31.240
 ELKEN ALAS BAKANI: We took advantage of the possibility 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.950
 Google Play staged phishing solution before downloading 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.540
 Millions of users of the game. 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.080
 After adding new features to the games, 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.700
 We start rolling out the update at 5% of users. 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.355
 Then we study the opinions of users. 

00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:48.420
 If we see that everything is going well, we start 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.662
 Increase the ratio and show the game to all users. 

00:01:52.662 --> 00:01:54.370
 Erdem Enan: We saw that Google App Store 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.950
 The conversion rate of an application can vary by 20-30%. 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.940
 We also saw that the short and long descriptions leave an impression 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.970
 On the conversion rate. 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.639
 The increase in the conversion rate even if it does not exceed 5% 

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:08.514
 Have a significant impact on cost versus installation, 

00:02:08.514 --> 00:02:10.949
 And then affect the return on investment in marketing, which benefits 

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.145
 On the size of the game. 

00:02:13.145 --> 00:02:14.853
 We've made great use of Android 

00:02:14.853 --> 00:02:16.680
 To achieve a proliferation of international markets. 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.120
 We realized that user acquisition was easier 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.880
 And reaches a huge proportion. 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.270
 So you can cooperate with many companies 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.300
 In terms of user acquisition 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.760
 Android CPA is between 30 and 40% 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.250
 Lower when compared to systems 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.130
 Play another mobile. 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.905
 Ads are the best source of acquisition. 

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:38.410
 By connecting to all other Google products. 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.760
 Allowing us greater opportunity to review 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.140
 For the success of our performance. 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.690
 All this helps to create an employment opportunity for Edom 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.630
 For Peak Games. 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.250
 Over the past three years we have been interested 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.540
 Focuses on the West European and North American market, 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.250
 But we are seeking to spread our games in the international markets, 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.120
 Where the international market is the promising future of our business. 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.570
