00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.667
Let's say we have the vector &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;
and we know its &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; components.

00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:06.629
I'll write it first as a column vector.

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.599
It's &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; component is -10
and its &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; component is +7.

00:00:11.607 --> 00:00:14.344
And with the many ways we've seen
to represent a vector

00:00:14.344 --> 00:00:18.701
we could also represent it
in unit vector form,

00:00:18.701 --> 00:00:20.735
so we could write it as -10

00:00:20.735 --> 00:00:23.641
times the unit vector
in the horizontal direction

00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:27.565
plus 7 times the unit vector
in the vertical direction.

00:00:27.565 --> 00:00:29.474
But either way
we could draw this thing,

00:00:29.474 --> 00:00:31.771
we could pick a place,
an initial point.

00:00:31.771 --> 00:00:33.956
If we say the initial point is the origin,

00:00:33.956 --> 00:00:35.731
we might as well
pick the origin,

00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:37.352
what would this vector look like?

00:00:37.352 --> 00:00:40.382
Well, the &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; component is -10,
so we'd go to -10,

00:00:40.382 --> 00:00:41.933
and then the &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; component is 7.

00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:44.913
So we do 10 to the left and 7 up.

00:00:44.913 --> 00:00:50.110
7 up would get us to right over there,
and the vector would look like this.

00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:56.571
So it would start at the origin
and would end,

00:00:56.586 --> 00:01:01.736
its initial point would be the origin
and its terminal point

00:01:01.753 --> 00:01:06.151
would be at &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;= -10 and &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;= 7.

00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:08.759
So this is one way to represent
the vector &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;.

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:10.930
But let's say we wanted to
move it around,

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.195
we wanted to have
a different terminal point.

00:01:13.195 --> 00:01:14.501
Let's say we were told

00:01:14.501 --> 00:01:18.211
instead of having
the terminal point -10, 7

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:22.988
let's say instead
it had the terminal point 3,5.

00:01:26.476 --> 00:01:29.016
Let's make this a negative 3.

00:01:29.023 --> 00:01:31.620
-3, 5, let's say it had &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;
as its terminal point.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.498
So we could imagine
what the vector would look like.

00:01:34.498 --> 00:01:39.998
We would just translate this vector over
so it would look something like this.

00:01:42.072 --> 00:01:44.013
So it would terminate right over there,

00:01:44.013 --> 00:01:47.113
and it would start somewhere
in this area here.

00:01:47.113 --> 00:01:51.161
I don't know precisely,
if I could just copy/paste this

00:01:51.161 --> 00:01:54.292
and translate it over,
I could figure it out on the graph.

00:01:54.292 --> 00:01:59.882
But instead of doing it like that
let's do it mathematically.

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.809
What would be the initial point
of this vector, of vector &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:09.969
if the terminal point is -3, 5?

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.950
Let's say the initial point &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
is equal to &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; Initial, &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; Initial.

00:02:21.176 --> 00:02:25.466
So &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; sub &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;, y sub &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.

00:02:25.466 --> 00:02:26.661
So let's say that's it.

00:02:26.661 --> 00:02:30.341
How do we go from having
an initial point and a terminal point

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.069
to getting the components of the vector?

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.274
The &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; component of the vector
is going to be the change in &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:36.274 --> 00:02:38.750
going from the initial
to the terminal point

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.160
and your &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; component
is going to be your change in &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.092
going from your initial point
to your terminal point.

00:02:48.502 --> 00:02:53.072
So -10, your &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; component
is going to be your change in &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:55.261
going from your initial
to your terminal.

00:02:55.261 --> 00:03:00.384
That's going to be your terminal &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;, -3,

00:03:00.384 --> 00:03:05.156
minus your initial &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; sub &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.

00:03:05.156 --> 00:03:08.351
Then we can do the same thing
for the &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; component.

00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:11.323
The &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; component is going to be equal to
your change in &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;.

00:03:11.323 --> 00:03:16.164
It's going to be your terminal &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;,
it's going to be 5,

00:03:16.164 --> 00:03:19.839
minus your initial &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;.

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:23.353
And from this we can solve for 
&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; sub &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;, your initial &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;,

00:03:23.353 --> 00:03:24.848
and your initial &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;.

00:03:24.848 --> 00:03:26.528
So let's see how we can do this.

00:03:26.528 --> 00:03:29.282
If we multiplied both sides of this
times -1,

00:03:29.282 --> 00:03:34.882
we're going to get 10 is equal to
&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; +3

00:03:46.412 --> 00:03:48.273
and if we subtract 3 from both sides,

00:03:48.273 --> 00:03:54.033
we're going to get &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; sub &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
is equal to 7.

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.909
&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; sub &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; is equal to 7.

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:01.976
Now let's do the same thing over here.

00:04:01.976 --> 00:04:05.669
If we multiplied both sides of this
times -1,

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:10.839
we're going to have -7
is equal to &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; sub &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.

00:04:10.855 --> 00:04:15.525
Our Initial &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; minus 5.

00:04:16.911 --> 00:04:23.291
Add 5 to both sides,
our Initial &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; is equal to -2.

00:04:24.407 --> 00:04:28.086
So our initial point for our vector,
if our terminal point is going to be -3,5

00:04:28.086 --> 00:04:33.656
based on the components of the vector,
our initial point is going to be

00:04:38.221 --> 00:04:40.289
at point 7, -2.

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:43.714
Let's see if that makes visual sense.

00:04:43.714 --> 00:04:45.947
This is &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;= 7,-2.

00:04:45.947 --> 00:04:50.945
So we're saying that is our initial point,

00:04:50.945 --> 00:04:56.065
so our vector is going to look like this,

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.436
which makes a lot of sense.

00:05:00.436 --> 00:05:01.963
It's just the original vector we had

00:05:01.963 --> 00:05:03.848
when we had
the original point of the origin,

00:05:03.848 --> 00:05:06.308
but we've shifted it over,

00:05:06.308 --> 00:05:12.779
and shifted it to the right,
1,2,3,4,5,6,7.

00:05:12.782 --> 00:05:15.127
And you see that right over here.

00:05:15.127 --> 00:05:17.115
Hopefully now we're pretty well-equipped.

00:05:17.115 --> 00:05:19.519
If we know the initial
and terminal point of a vector

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:21.717
we can figure out its &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; components.

00:05:21.717 --> 00:05:24.584
Or if we know the terminal points
and the &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; components,

00:05:24.584 --> 00:05:26.374
we can figure out the initial point.

00:05:26.374 --> 00:05:28.754
Or if we know the initial point
and we know the &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; components

00:05:28.754 --> 00:05:30.811
we can figure out the terminal point.

00:05:30.811 --> 00:05:32.631
So if we know two out of these three,

00:05:32.631 --> 00:05:35.502
we can figure out
the third piece of information.
