is partly because the bandwidth and

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780
is partly because the bandwidth and
 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.600
is partly because the bandwidth and
infrastructure is there they have

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610
infrastructure is there they have
 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.160

they've had bandwidth an infrastructure

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170
they've had bandwidth an infrastructure
 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.740
they've had bandwidth an infrastructure
that has been miles ahead of where we've

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750
that has been miles ahead of where we've
 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.420
that has been miles ahead of where we've
been so they've had more time to kind of

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430
been so they've had more time to kind of
 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.120
been so they've had more time to kind of
work on it they have there's greater

opportunity for an audience and then on
 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.530
opportunity for an audience and then on
top of that you have situations with

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:24.540
top of that you have situations with
 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.910
top of that you have situations with
copyright over there that are

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920

problematic the retail game model the
 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.590
problematic the retail game model the
traditional retail game model is selling

multiplayer game is not destroyed by

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690
multiplayer game is not destroyed by
 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.080
multiplayer game is not destroyed by
piracy in fact it is enhanced by piracy

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090
piracy in fact it is enhanced by piracy
 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.240

because the Pirates become a network to

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250
because the Pirates become a network to
 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.970

distribute the software and the players

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980
distribute the software and the players
 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.350
distribute the software and the players
they you know they have to connect

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360
they you know they have to connect
 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.210
they you know they have to connect
online and there's no stealing the game

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220
online and there's no stealing the game
 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.110
online and there's no stealing the game
because you pay as you play and so I

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120
because you pay as you play and so I
 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.290
because you pay as you play and so I
think that that combination plus also

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300
think that that combination plus also
 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.120
think that that combination plus also
then you also consider the lower

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130
then you also consider the lower
 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.100
then you also consider the lower
penetration of down of consoles in Asia

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110
penetration of down of consoles in Asia
 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.669

is something that kind of has push

00:01:07.669 --> 00:01:07.679
is something that kind of has push
 

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:09.529
is something that kind of has push
people more to the PC and that's the

00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:09.539
people more to the PC and that's the
 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:11.840
people more to the PC and that's the
multiplayer games work well on the pc

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850
multiplayer games work well on the pc
 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.550
multiplayer games work well on the pc
and then further you can kind of take it

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560
and then further you can kind of take it
 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.949
and then further you can kind of take it
to kind of a total is kind of a social

00:01:15.949 --> 00:01:15.959
to kind of a total is kind of a social
 

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:21.160
to kind of a total is kind of a social
angle some people would suggest that is

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170
angle some people would suggest that is
 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.590
angle some people would suggest that is
it that that people in Asia are more

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600
it that that people in Asia are more
 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.230
it that that people in Asia are more
likely to work together on teams they're

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240
likely to work together on teams they're
 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.269
likely to work together on teams they're
more comfortable working that way and

00:01:32.269 --> 00:01:32.279
more comfortable working that way and
 

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:33.709
more comfortable working that way and
that's what you're going to succeed in

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:33.719
that's what you're going to succeed in
 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:35.480
that's what you're going to succeed in
these games it's about forming large

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490
these games it's about forming large
 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.719
these games it's about forming large
teams and working together and

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729
teams and working together and
 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.219
teams and working together and
succeeding so it's a combination of

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229
succeeding so it's a combination of
 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.629
succeeding so it's a combination of
things but one thing we're definitely

00:01:41.629 --> 00:01:41.639
things but one thing we're definitely
 

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:44.959
things but one thing we're definitely
seeing is almost everything that goes

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:44.969
seeing is almost everything that goes
 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:47.510
seeing is almost everything that goes
big and succeeds in Asia starts to come

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520
big and succeeds in Asia starts to come
 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.699
big and succeeds in Asia starts to come
over here we started to see it happening

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:49.709
over here we started to see it happening
 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:51.199
over here we started to see it happening
we saw it initially with

00:01:51.199 --> 00:01:51.209
we saw it initially with
 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:53.199
we saw it initially with
subscription-based games then we saw

00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:53.209
subscription-based games then we saw
 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:55.099
subscription-based games then we saw
microtransactions taking off there and

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:55.109
microtransactions taking off there and
 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:58.219
microtransactions taking off there and
now they're taking off in in America and

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229
now they're taking off in in America and
 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.810
now they're taking off in in America and
in Europe as well

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820
 
 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.610
 
I think for massively multiplayer games

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620
I think for massively multiplayer games
 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.090
I think for massively multiplayer games
it's a combination of things one of the

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100
it's a combination of things one of the
 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.320
it's a combination of things one of the
reasons people like to go to games at

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330
reasons people like to go to games at
 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.470
reasons people like to go to games at
all is games give you concrete

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480
all is games give you concrete
 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.130

achievement in life we seldom get very
 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.740
achievement in life we seldom get very
clear concrete achievements anything you

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750
clear concrete achievements anything you
 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.660
clear concrete achievements anything you
achieve it's always like well it could

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670
achieve it's always like well it could
 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.220
achieve it's always like well it could
have been a little better but when

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230
have been a little better but when
 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.980
have been a little better but when
you've made level nine is level nine I

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990
you've made level nine is level nine I
 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.870
you've made level nine is level nine I
mean there's no you have made it or you

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880
mean there's no you have made it or you
 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.310
mean there's no you have made it or you
sorta made it or someone made level nine

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320
sorta made it or someone made level nine
 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.380

better than you you made it being gold
star there it is and people like that

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070
star there it is and people like that
 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.080
star there it is and people like that
concreteness so you take that factor of

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090
concreteness so you take that factor of
 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.030
concreteness so you take that factor of
the concreteness and then you combine it

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040
the concreteness and then you combine it
 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.210
the concreteness and then you combine it
with a persistence a lot you know video

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220
with a persistence a lot you know video
 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.770
with a persistence a lot you know video
games you play them you win them it's

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780
games you play them you win them it's
 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.270
games you play them you win them it's
kind of over you turn it off and it's

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280
kind of over you turn it off and it's
 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.310
kind of over you turn it off and it's
gone these these massively multiplayer

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320
gone these these massively multiplayer
 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.229
gone these these massively multiplayer
games are persistent you know you you

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239
games are persistent you know you you
 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.120
games are persistent you know you you
become level 9 you turn it off for three

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130
become level 9 you turn it off for three
 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.620
become level 9 you turn it off for three
months you come back you're still level

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630
months you come back you're still level
 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.750
months you come back you're still level
nine you can go to level 10 these can

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760
nine you can go to level 10 these can
 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.550
nine you can go to level 10 these can
become something that you do for 10

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560
become something that you do for 10
 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.430
become something that you do for 10
years 20 years 50 years if you want to

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440
years 20 years 50 years if you want to
 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.850
years 20 years 50 years if you want to
and so people people like that it makes

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860
and so people people like that it makes
 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.350
and so people people like that it makes
it more solid it makes it more real

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360
it more solid it makes it more real
 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.090
it more solid it makes it more real
makes it more meaningful then you

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100
makes it more meaningful then you
 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.979
makes it more meaningful then you
combine that with the social interaction

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989
combine that with the social interaction
 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.880
combine that with the social interaction
where you have lightweight connection to

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890
where you have lightweight connection to
 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.310
where you have lightweight connection to
people in other words like you're you

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320
people in other words like you're you
 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.210
people in other words like you're you
don't have to go through all the

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220
don't have to go through all the
 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.850
don't have to go through all the
headache of forming social commitments

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860
headache of forming social commitments
 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.069
headache of forming social commitments
but you still get to do something

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079
but you still get to do something
 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.780
but you still get to do something
meaningful where you work together as a

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790
meaningful where you work together as a
 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.670
meaningful where you work together as a
team and did something that you all can

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680
team and did something that you all can
 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.310
team and did something that you all can
be proud of so there's a lot of factors

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320
be proud of so there's a lot of factors
 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.190
be proud of so there's a lot of factors
in there that that you know there's

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200
in there that that you know there's
 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.400
in there that that you know there's
there's really a lot to like
