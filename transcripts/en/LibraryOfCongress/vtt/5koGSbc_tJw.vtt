00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.340
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation:
Welcome everybody

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.640
to another Thursday at three.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.940
I'm, glad to see so
many people here.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.190
We have a real treat
instore for us today.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.380
I was familiar with Casey Gardner's
work before I actually met her

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.270
at Kodak's, but meeting her at
Kodak's just sealed the deal.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.750
She's -- not only does she do
smart, creative, accessible books,

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.870
artists books or press
books, she has a sense

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.100
of humor, a political viewpoint.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.460
A design esthetic that's
sometimes Jetson,

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.930
sometimes mid-century,
sometimes modern.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.380
All of that happens in five minutes
of the conversation with her.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.210
And we're going to get even
more of that with her today.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.600
So, I'm really thrilled to have
Casey come all the way from Berkley

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.810
to share some of her
insights about her books

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.370
and what she's doing with them.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.310
We have some of her materials
as we usually do on the table.,

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.900
and afterwards we'll be
happy to show them to you

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.150
and you can feel free to ask Casey
whatever questions you would like.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.100
Casey asked me to have you remind
her that if she turns to you

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.570
and freezes, someone just
needs to yell, "Breath."

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.500
And with that of a way of
introducing, Casey Gardner.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.500
[ Applause ]

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:42.710 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Casey Gardner: Thank you so much.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.010
All right.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:50.640
So, I have a talk written,
and I will try not to read it,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.090 position:56%
but chances are I will be reading
it, but it's written from the heart.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.790
So, all right.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.600
So, this is a model of the
beginning of our universe

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.160
that was 13.8 billion years ago.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.980
To me, this image is
pure visual poetry.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.770
According to this model, everything
that exists in our universe,

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.070
every star and planet that composes
us in our lives, all matter,

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.530 position:56%
was within an infinitely single,
tiny point, a so-called singularity.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.830 position:56%
Then, all that energy suddenly
expanded into the void and inflated,

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.650
opening up space, and
eventually coalescing

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.060
into galaxies, everything.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.490
I'm moved by all these forces
conspiring to time and a space

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.720
where our lives are possible.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.820
Science and art have intersections.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.630
Both are trying to understand
how and why we are here.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.820
Nothing, even The Big
Bang is conclusive.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.270
So, I have a story for you,
and I'm telling you this story,

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.010
because it happened here in D.C.
And because it marks the beginning

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.270
of my long, slow journey
to becoming an artist.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.870
And because it also
explains part of my psyche.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.290
So, one day, I was walking down
Pennsylvania Avenue with thousands

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.070
of other enthusiastic ardent
vociferously enraged people.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.440
The streets were barricaded, it
was 1992, and Planned Parenthood

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.550
versus Casey was before
The Supreme Court.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.640
The provisions of Rogue v
Wade were being challenged.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.410 position:56%
We marchers were voicing our support
for women's' reproductive rights.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.660
I was there with my
family and friends,

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.160
and zillion of my mother's
activist friends.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.950
We made our way down
Pennsylvania Avenue, and I listened

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.370
to my mother regale those
around her with a story

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.710
of her own pro Roe
V Wade desperation.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.100
It was the early 60s, she'd
had her first baby at 18,

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.910
and the next one came 11
months later, now at 20,

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.680
the third was on its way.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.120
Things were not good at home,

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.300
and this one-time high school
student librarian was feeling lost

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.670
in despair, wretchedly stupid, and
finding herself pregnant again.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.330
She desperately did
not want another child.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.520
Telling this tale years
later on Pennsylvania Avenue,

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.720
my mother has many years as
political activist and feminist

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.580
under her belt, and she warms

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.830
to her count illustrating
the plight of all women.

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.130
She dramatically and graphically
discloses the various acts she was

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.940
forced to resort to in attempts
to abort her unwanted fetus.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.100
When she finally scraped
together the means to pay

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.920
for a back-alley abortion, a very
risky procedure in those days,

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.780
she was too far along for the
pregnancy to be terminated.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.100
We marchers all listened spell
bounded righteous outrage,

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.470
as we walked on the pavement
lifting our pro-choice signs.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:49.850
In that moment, I did a bit of
calculation, I was her third child,

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.720
and it dawned on me that I
was the one in her belly.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.560
That moment on Pennsylvania
Avenue was a crisis for me,

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.790
or just in the political
and personal sense,

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.660
but of my very existence.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.090
I marched along trying to reconcile
my supportive freedom and choice,

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.950
knowing it meant I would not exist.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.970
Eventually, I came into the world

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.220
at Georgetown University
Hospital as Casey Sullivan.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:21.090
And so, yes, I'm very happy to be
here today, alive in this world

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.080
with all of its precariousness,

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.040
and where something can
be created from nothing.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.740
So, after I was born here we -- my
family moved to Columbia, Maryland.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.420
And when I was ten, we
moved to Aspen, Colorado.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.240
And there, in the public school
system, I was in a program

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.680
that took us into the wilderness.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.700 position:56%
So, I didn't spend that much time in
the classroom, but I learned a lot

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.250
of mountaineering skills
and I spent a lot

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.770
of time sleeping under the stars.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.830
So, the mountains really
came to define me there.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:58.300
And after that, I lived in Colorado
until I was 35, and then I moved

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.110
to California, and
now I live in Berkley

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.000
about 50 yards from
a major fault line.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.980 position:56%
In preparing this talk, I identified
six words that guide me in my work,

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:18.620 position:56%
they are feeling, beauty, matter,
motion, wonder, and my favorite word

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.020
in the human language, why?

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.720
These words motivate all
my work, but for this talk,

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.670
I'll highlight them one at a
time with examples of my books.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.560
For my -- my first two
words come from this quote

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.510
from the photographer Dorothea
Lange, she found beauty and dignity

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.500
in the faces of people
in the Depression.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.250
This sits on the windowsill
of my studio.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.470
My books usually take a year or
two to make, so before I embark

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:50.830
on a project, I have to make
sure I feel deeply about it.

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.700
What drives my interests
is certainly intellectual,

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:59.350 position:56%
but the emotional undercurrents and
their mystery really propel my work.

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.470
And so, my first word is feeling.

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.730
Feeling plays a role
throughout making the work.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.490
I'm working along on my
trajectory and it comes --

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.250
out of nowhere a feeling comes.

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:11.550
I try to ignore it.

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.340
It's vague, uncertain, outlandish,

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.620
but it whispers, "What
if you tried this?

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.810
What if this actually means that?

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:22.120
And I think, but that's a
whole new door to go through,

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.600
I have no intention going there.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.890
I didn't even know such a door
was possible or even existed,

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:30.040
and I try to continue on my course.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:36.100
Feeling is totally irrational, it's
not interested in being efficient

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.790
or being the direct course.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.990
I think feeling comes from
this space where the body

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:45.790
and the mind meet, maybe we
call it instinct or intuition.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:50.140
So, eventually, I listen
to it and I open the door.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.780
This is my most recent book,
I finished it in February,

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.920
it's called the Gravity Series.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.350
These three books -- all of my
books are letter pressed printed,

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:00.050
so I'll try -- I don't
need to repeat that.

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:03.580 position:56%
These three books are clothed bound,
and they're hung -- suspended in --

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.210
by magnets in the carrying case.

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:09.910
In many ways, this is my most
personal book, in that I opened

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:14.910
up my own experiences to
investigate my topic, gravity.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:19.970
This series of books reckons with
gravity as a universal, and yet,

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.310
very personal phenomenon,
holding everything

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.920
in perpetual motion
and relationship.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.130
Each of these books uses gravity
as a metaphor for love in terms

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:33.550
of falling, climbing and orbiting.

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:35.290
So finally tuned is gravity,

00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:38.960
that if its quantity had been
even infinitesimally altered,

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.280
our universe as we know
it could not have emerged,

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.210
and life would not exist.

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:47.010
This fine tuning can actually
be calculated, physicists --

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:52.540 position:56%
cosmologists and phs -- physicists
calculate it to 10 to the minus 122.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.660
I'm thinking that's
122 zeros, right?

00:08:55.660 --> 00:09:00.420
That's just an in -- it's
incredible what that --

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:05.870
how finally tuned the
workings of our universe are.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:08.770
Though gravity is the weakest
of the four universal forces,

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:12.110
it's strong enough to hold galaxies
together, and precise enough

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:16.300
to give each one of us weight
and be held here on earth.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:20.340 position:56%
Each book explores how we live with
influences we cannot always control,

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:24.290
but rely upon forces
we cannot see but feel.

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:28.030
What is this unseen power that
like love, is vital to life?

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:31.140
I'll take you through
each of the three books.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.630
I'm starting with this
one, All there is,

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:35.790
because it's how the
whole series started.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:39.000
I was trying to think one day
about what I could believe

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.500
in unequivocally, what
really, truly existed?

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:47.180
And I came to gravity and I
thought, that's all there is,

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:50.070
that's all there is,
that's all there is.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.580
And I just thought, I loved how
it could be, that's all there is,

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.620
and that's all there is, gravity.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.690
So, that was the beginning
of this project.

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:03.100
This book in particular is about
climbing, it's also about trust

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.970
and finding your own
center of gravity

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:08.470
as you move your weight
upward on rock.

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:10.650
Meanwhile, you're putting
your life in the hands

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:12.730
of your partner who's belaying you,

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:15.050
[inaudible] that person
with your weight.

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:19.490
So, this spread is
about a crux of a climb.

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:21.460
And I wanted to say, so climbing --

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:22.890
I don't know if there's
any climbers here?

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:24.620
There's a spelunker here.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:25.920
&gt;&gt; A caver.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.220
&gt;&gt; Casey Gardner: A caver.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:28.520
Oh, that's a difference.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:29.820
&gt;&gt; A caver is as risky
as spelunkers.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.120
[ Laughter ]

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.660
&gt;&gt; Casey Gardner: So --

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:33.960
&gt;&gt; Sorry.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.440
&gt;&gt; Casey Gardner: I could never
be a caver, but I tried it.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.850
So, anyway, when you're
climbing a crux

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:40.860
of a climb is the most
difficult part of a climb,

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:42.700
and there's slab climbing.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:48.270
And when you're on a slab,
you are relying on friction

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:49.930
to sort of get you to move.

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:53.670 position:56%
And the best way to move is to sort
of, instead of clinging to the rock,

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:57.190
to pull away from the rock,
and that gives your --

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:59.440
puts the anchor into your feet.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.110
So, you're sort of finding
your way through gravity,

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:04.250
and it's a little bit
counterintuitive.

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:07.300
And I think in all these
different ways, like right now,

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.750
we're having this relationship
with the center of the earth.

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:11.460
We have our own relationship
with the earth

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.540
in gravity, through gravity.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:18.530
And in these sports, whether it's
skiing, or climbing, or surfing.

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:23.860
Surfing I have less of a good
relationship with gravity.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.850
We're finding out where
our own centers are,

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:28.990 position:56%
and that's happening all the time,
and I just think that's fascinating.

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:31.820
it's about being in the
center of the earth, and so,

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.340
all the time we're in gravity.

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.610
And this relationship with --

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:39.210
supposedly, everything in the
universe has a relationship

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:45.540
with everything else that
has mass through gravity.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:49.400
I just love this stuff.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.160
So -- so, these figures,
just a little bit on process,

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.760
I drew with a brush and ink,

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.670
and then I scanned
them into my computer.

00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:00.930
And anything I can draw, I
can scan into my computer

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:04.210
and create into a plate to print.

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:09.420
At the end of the book is a map
of a climb I did with a partner.

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:13.270
We grappled with risk and
trust, and here I printed some

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:16.570
of the words marking our root
as we were tethered together.

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:19.930
The next book is How to Fall.

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:22.350
It's about falling in love.

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:24.140
No, no -- can you guys read that?

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.440
&gt;&gt; Crowd: Mm-hmm.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.740
&gt;&gt; Casey Gardner: Okay.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:30.460
One day I was living my
perfectly lovely life,

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.520
and working in a book
store when someone walked

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.040
through the door, and
I fell for him.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:38.170
And I eventually fell out
of line, fell to my knees,

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:40.840
and my lovely life
fell to the wayside.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.920
When I was 18, I married a
professional ski racer, now at 28,

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.610
I didn't think I was looking
to fall for anyone, but, well,

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:51.380
I fell head over heels,
I fell from grace.

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:54.520
Things fell a part, but
mostly I fell in love.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:58.380
Eventually, my life fell back
together, that's a different book.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:02.700
How do we live with these unseen
forces that influence our lives?

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:06.830
Sometimes the line between
flying and falling isn't clear.

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:10.930
A star close enough
is about orbiting.

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:14.030 position:56%
This book includes a volvelle, which
spins through the various points

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:18.270
and paths of two bodies orbiting
each other in relationship.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:22.270
You guys know what a
volvelle is, right?

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:24.670
This is a sophisticated audience.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:29.210
The opening page of the book,
the verso, left page reads,

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:34.160
"Speaking of space as lovers
do", then on the recto it reads,

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.960
"He says nothing's sacred anymore,

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:39.550
she says everything is,
he says same thing."

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:45.220 position:56%
In orbits, two mutually attracted
bodies revolve around a joint center

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.750
of mass located in the
space between them.

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:52.600
In relationships, two bodies move
closer together and further apart

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.520
as they mediate their distance
creating their own orbit.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.370
Meanwhile, our earth is
gravitationally bound

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:03.590
in the most propitious
orbit around our son,

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:08.160
making it just the right distance
to receive its life giving energy.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.490
Often, I feel super unsophisticated
because of my sense of wonder.

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:15.660 position:56%
So, here I'm writing this
grandiloquent poem speaking to a guy

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:19.080
about how fantastic
everything is, how amazing it is

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.040 position:56%
that the world even exists, and that
the sun is so perfectly situated

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:28.550
for us to make peach pie,
and he is exasperated.

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:32.700
Now I'll move on to
my next word, beauty.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:38.140
So, Lange's phrase is, "Beauty
appears when one feels deeply."

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:41.170
I come to book art
through my love of books,

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:42.970
they have made me who I am.

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:48.140
Without books, without
libraries, I would have been lost.

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:52.180 position:56%
Growing up, I vas an avid reader,
in books I learned to see the world.

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:55.220
From this book Harriet the Spy,
I discovered a way of looking

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.810 position:56%
and relating to the world around me.

00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:59.580
From this book I learned
to keep a journal,

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:02.380
which was the beginning
of my writing life.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:05.550
I learned about imagination
and possibility from books,

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:09.190
how whole worlds could
be created in pages.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:11.550
I also learned about
beauty from books.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:15.100
I remember spending a lot of time
gazing at the covers of books.

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:18.540
I would imagine entering into
the realms they illustrated.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:21.360
I still have a few of my
childhood books, you can tell,

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.660
look at the price on that.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:25.800
This is one of my very favorites,

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.880
and the cover remains
in my imagination.

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.080
Much of my sense of beauty comes

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.860
from those magical
moments gazing into books.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:38.870
I made this book Cartographical
Incantations in 2015.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:42.150
Its pages are letter pressed and
digitally printed and it's bound

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.450
into an accordion structure.

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:48.960
Structure, that's a toughie
for me, structure, okay.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.630
I also find beauty in
maps, globes , and atlases.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:56.290
In the public library in Amsterdam,
up several flights of stairs,

00:15:56.290 --> 00:16:01.150
I found a treasure trove of
atlases, I was in heaven.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:03.290
One book held 17th century maps

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.860
from the seafaring Dutch
explorers and merchants.

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.300 position:56%
I snapped some photos from my phone,

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:11.390
and later I used these
images in these books.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:16.980
I only had fragments of the maps,
I put them into Adobe Illustrator.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.660
And because I was thinking
about hinges at the time,

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:24.400
I reflected them, and I found that
I could make shapes with them.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.750
Each spread has on the verso a
history of cartography starting

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:32.120
with the map from the 7th
Century B.C. Babylonians.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.560
This spread shows a
Medieval T.O. map,

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.270
then on right is a poem
an incantation I wrote

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:41.090
about taking journeys or
finding your way in the world.

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:45.720
As I played with the maps,
beauty again appeared.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:49.260
I found I could create patterns.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.800
My books always had
various narrative roots

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.540
or patterns offering
the reader opportunities

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.260
to chart their own
course through the pages.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:01.190
Here on the left, verso, is the
instruction in using a compass

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:05.930
in the wilderness, on the right
is an incantation, I'll read it.

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:09.240
Wayfair's Incantation
for finding your space.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.470
"Here you are, still you are here?

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:16.620
Here you are still,
are you still here?

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:20.770
You are still here, do
not abandon yourself."

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:25.230
The other side of the
folios is this narrative,

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:27.020
another narrative pathway.

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:30.680
It's a traveler's tale of chance
and choice, those words chance

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.600
and choice come up
a lot in my books.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:39.540
Chance. This reads, "Perhaps you
are given a map, perhaps not."

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:42.920
This line reads, "Perhaps that is
you disappearing down the stairway

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:46.570 position:56%
and into the dark, your feet
echoing off of the glistening road."

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:50.620
A few years earlier, in Matter,
Anti-Matter and So Forth,

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:54.180
I'd written this line,
just that one sentence,

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:56.300
and I always wondered
where that came from.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:01.040
So, here in this book I
wrote a story about it.

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.850
This map forms the shape
of our entrance into world.

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:07.470
It reads, "Just to See
What Might Happen."

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.320
My next word is matter.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:15.150
I'm thinking about
this word all the time.

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:17.130
Not just in terms of
what is significant,

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:20.620
meaning what matters,
but what has meaning.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:25.000
Also, in the cosmological aspect
of matter transforming into energy,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.920 position:56%
and energy transforming into matter.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:33.270
It was making this book, Matter,
Anti-Matter and So Forth in 2013

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:36.470
that I learned that matter and
energy were interchangeable.

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:38.250
I remember walking down
the street one day,

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:41.720
and I realized I was looking
at the world and existence

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.680
in a radically different way.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.880
Before making this
book, my foundations

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.910
of reality were mostly
philosophical.

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:54.810
Studying Quantum Physics,
what I could understand of it

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:57.370
and Asper Physics, my sense of life

00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:01.150
on earth became more
objectively elemental.

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:04.410
The title of this book refers
to a time after the Big Bang

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:09.120 position:56%
when a small preponderance of matter
over anti-matter was produced.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:12.730
None of the physicists understands
where this asymmetry comes from,

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:14.710
I found that out from my neighbor.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:18.010
So, a year of ago, a particle
physicists moved in next door.

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:20.000
[ Laughter ]

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.340
I couldn't believe it.

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:23.640
I couldn't believe it.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.180
She does tons of research,
she researches gluons.

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:32.340 position:56%
And so, we over resorting -- sorting
our recycling we might be talking

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:37.900
about gluons and how
they'll -- let's see.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.400
The gluons, they're actually
using the strong nuclear force

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.530
to hold the atom together.

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:49.340
So, yeah, I learned
that from her, gluons.

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.610
Okay. Yeah, Berkley.

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:55.170
Without this asymmetry, matter and
anti-matter would have continued

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:58.650
to annihilate each other, and
nothing could have emerged.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.770
This book is a series
of seven folios wrapped

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:04.270
in a map of the universe.

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:07.330
The folios follow the story
of two travelers in space.

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.420
One traveler from earth
is on a quest

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:11.540
for what truly matters
in the universe.

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:14.430
Along the way, she meets a
character from outer space.

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:15.830
He is looking for a new dimension

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:19.290
that can only be revealed
to him by an earthling.

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:21.850
We follow their journey as they
move through various realms

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:26.570
of cosmic discovery, each folio
has a focus of investigation.

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:30.990
This slide shows the slides of
science, constellations, and light.

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:34.290
The layered transparencies
are intergalactic artifacts

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:36.160
from the transparent universe.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.280
This represents a time
after the Big Bang

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:41.950
when the universe was transparent,
and light could move freely.

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:43.870
And for these images, I took --

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:46.350
they were photos from
the Monterey Aquarium,

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:48.250
they looked sort of cosmic.

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:52.460
So, yeah, those are like
jelly fish in there.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:57.030
I love aquariums too, I was in the
Natural History Museum yesterday.

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:59.160
Here, the time folio is on the left

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.610
and the gravity folio
is on the right.

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:04.400
There's a moment in the time folio

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.950
where the two characters
find themselves at the end --

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:10.570
in the Interstitial
Interstellar cafe.

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:13.480
Here, they share coffee from
luminaries plucked from divergent,

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.010
historical, and literary eras.

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:21.400
So, Galileo chats with Van Gogh,
and Machiavelli meets Rosa Parks.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.260
On the back of each photo
is a mission dispatch.

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:27.260
This gives me -- this gave me
space to write what I was learning

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:31.600
of the natural forces and
phenomenon of the cosmos.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.920
There's a story in the Infinity
folio where one of the --

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.850
where the character says she
sees sculpture, and she asks --

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:38.980
it's an Infinity sculpture.

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:42.500
She asks her mother what it is,
and her mother replies, "Love."

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:45.110
This actually is a memory
that I had from being outside

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:47.370
of the Air and Space Museum.

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:50.170
So, when I was growing up,
there was an Infinity sculpture,

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:53.470
and it was silver, and
it spun around slowly.

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:54.770
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation:
It's still there.

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:56.070
&gt;&gt; Casey Gardner: It's still there?

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:57.370
Because I was there
yesterday, and I thought,

00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:58.670
did Infinity become obsolete?

00:21:58.670 --> 00:21:59.970
It wasn't there.

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:03.660
No, I mean, so I remember
-- so, I said, --

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:05.600
we were, the three of
us kids were there,

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.470
and we asked my mom
what infinity was.

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:10.810
So, parents must have
these amazing moments.

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:13.200
And so, my mom goes,
"Something that lasts forever."

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.080
And we're like, what lasts forever?

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:19.210 position:56%
And she said love, so I thought
that was -- and that stayed with me,

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:21.670
but I did look for that
sculpture yesterday,

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:23.310
and maybe I just didn't
go in the right entrance.

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:29.850
And then I stood in front of
the Gemini and Mercury capsules.

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:32.010
Oh my gosh, that was -- I wept.

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:33.940
For some reason they
were very moving to me,

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.640
thinking of humans in those.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.940
So, meanwhile -- hmm.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:42.670
So, when I heard I was going to
do this talk, I asked my mother

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:46.410
to send me pictures
of us kids in D.C.

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:49.940
when we were young,
and she sent this gem.

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:55.810
So, I'm pretty sure that this
is the Infinity sculpture,

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:57.940
that's the plinth in any case.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:02.330
So, that's -- we loved
going to the Smithsonian

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:04.710
when I was growing up,
my mother took us often.

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:07.580
So, we always called it the
Smithsonian, but it's like now,

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:11.850
it's this whole constellations of
museums, and for me it was the Air

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:14.430
and Space Museum, and the
Natural History Museum,

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:15.730
that's where we went.

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:18.760
So, that's my brother John in the
Chucks, my sister in the red dress,

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:22.850
and that's me not liking my
shoes in the white tights.

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:25.460
I'm pretty sure that's why
I had that look on my face.

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:30.770
Because I loved, it was just total
joy going to the Smithsonian.

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:34.350
So, this might be a good time
I can show you a little bit

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:36.460
about how I make books.

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.090
This is my printing studio.

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:42.880
It's a 10 by 12 foot shed
that's in our backyard.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.650
So, I live like, close
to the Berkley campus,

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:48.970
my husband's a Professor
of Economics at Berkley.

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:51.910
Just, I keep saying we, and so,

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:54.850
I thought I'd give you
the other part of the we.

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:59.680
So, this -- you can see my
Vandercook , it's a Vandercook 4.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:03.340
Vandercooks were printing presses
that newspapers used for proofing.

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:07.710
This one is from the 1950s, and in
the back, there's a type cabinet

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:10.070
with wood and metal type.

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:13.010
There's a furniture cabinet,
and here is a book press,

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:17.530
because I also do binding
in there, not just printing.

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:25.770
This is a picture of casing in All
There Is, and I make tons of notes

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:28.960
when I'm doing production,
because I don't seem

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.450
to think when I'm in production.

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:34.290
And so, this one, you can
see I have north, north.

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:38.070
All this north stuff, it's because
there's 18 magnets in that book,

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:42.480
and I had to keep the polarities of
north, south straight all the time.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.070
And then, like, I'm
just constantly --

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:46.880
like, I just go into a
different mode in production.

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.880
And so, I just have notes of,
don't do that, be careful!

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:55.560
And so -- and a lot of the --
what I do is in my body memory.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:59.190
I don't seem to be rational
when I'm binding books,

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:01.000
even though it's super -- I --

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.020
for all the different bindings it
takes a lot of MAC heads to figure

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:08.190
out how the materials interact.

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:11.710
This is a gratifying moment.

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:15.650
So, this is part of my
addition of the Gravity series.

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:20.840
Usually, my additions are
30 to 50, and this probably,

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.550
maybe like, 20 or something.

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:26.030
So, I just -- ahh, that --
when I took that picture,

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:27.910
it was a really nice feeling.

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:30.660
So -- but I like production,
I usually --

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:33.470
some people they don't do
all their books when they --

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:36.210
they don't produce all their books
after they get finished with them,

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:39.330
but I do, because of
the body memory.

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:42.920 position:56%
I couldn't -- like Julie Chen keeps
notes of everything, and then she --

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.500
when she needs a book she makes it.

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:51.390
I don't think I could do that
really, so -- but she's Julie Chen.

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:54.250
This is my -- the other
place where I do my work,

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:55.840
this is inside of our house.

00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:00.120
This is where I write, draw, work
on the computer, make MAC heads,

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:06.480
carve linoleum, cut paper, do
everything, print digitally.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.820
Does everyone know how plate
making -- how plates are made?

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:12.980
Anything that you can put
into the computers, whether --

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:16.200
if you draw something, you can
scan it, put it into the computer.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.380
And then, it gets --
you can make a file

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.060
that gets created into a negative.

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:24.160
And then, the negative
gets placed on polymer,

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.720
and where the light shines
through, the polymer rises up so

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:30.610
that you can create a relief plate.

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:34.750
So, anything that I can draw,
or create, like, creating

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:38.600 position:56%
and design can be made into a plate.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:39.900
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: So,

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.350
that includes the figures
of the climbers?

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:42.650
&gt;&gt; Casey Gardner: Yes.

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:43.950
Yes, exactly.

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:47.520
So, I -- those were
done in brush, in ink.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.380
Fifty-thousand of them until I
found the ones I liked, and then,

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:54.650
I scanned them in and turned
them into a vector file,

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:56.800
so that it's a true black.

00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:00.750
And then, that gets turned
into a negative, and then,

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:04.500
where the negative -- where the
white light can get through,

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:05.800
photo polymer.

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.740
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: Because
they look like linocuts.

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.690
&gt;&gt; Casey Gardner: Oh,
yeah, I do linocuts too.

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:11.490
A lot of the printing in How

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:15.610
to Follow is linocut,
all of it, basically.

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:18.390
Yeah, in fact, when
you say back there,

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:21.120
that's a piece of linoleum
on my press.

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:25.920
That's a -- yeah, you can see
that, I really like linoleum.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:27.670
That was -- that's
kind of a new thing

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:30.390
in the past couple years for me.

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:32.320
&gt;&gt;[inaudible] American
History Museum.

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:33.750
&gt;&gt; Casey Gardner: Thank you.

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:36.090
I like that, real -- the
American History Museum?

00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:37.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:38.690
&gt;&gt; Didn't it say, Art
and Technology, or -- &gt;

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:40.630
&gt;&gt; It's [inaudible] 1968.

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:41.930
&gt;&gt; Casey Gardner: Right.

00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:44.030
&gt;&gt; And it's basically [inaudible].

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:46.150
&gt;&gt; Casey Gardner: Is that true?

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:49.490
Right on. But I must
have gone to -- okay.

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:51.740
Thank god, your here.

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:56.040
Very similitude to
everything, to me.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.690
I don't want to lead
you guys a stray.

00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:03.460
So, one more thing I wanted
to say about this room,

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:06.110
in the middle of the slide
next to the Periodic Table

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:10.160
of Elements is the
model for my book,

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.800
Body of Inquiry, the
Anatomical Model.

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:17.000
So, I -- I'll talk
about that book later.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.940
This is an example of
how I begin my work,

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:23.320
such a perfect example of my brain.

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:27.060
So, actually it would be more --
if it were my brain, it'd be --

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:30.560
it wouldn't be written like that,
in fact, I have stuff like that.

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:34.540 position:56%
So, what happens is, I'll be reading
books and I'll just take notes,

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:38.750
and that way I can sort of pay
attention to what interests me,

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:41.110
and then, see relationships.

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:43.580
And all throughout the
process that I'm working,

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:47.820 position:56%
I'm constantly doing this, because I
might be just trying to write like,

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:51.290
two lines, and then I
start reading about it.

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:54.330
And then, it ends up being,
you know, like this big --

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:57.140
and I usually take really
big pieces of paper,

00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:01.350
and -- yeah, to find words.

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:08.200
Words. This is an example of a
sketch, this is a project that --

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:12.080
for a print I did called the
Multiverse Beta-gerse[phonetic].

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:17.820
And at this point when I'm
sketching it's pretty fun,

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:21.330
because I don't have
to make much sense.

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:23.230
It's a weird thing,
because it's a fun moment,

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:24.550
because it's really free.

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:26.670
But at the same time, I don't
really know where I'm going.

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:28.950
So, there's this little
bit of like, whoa, whoa,

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:32.300
like speaking of not really
knowing where you are in gravity.

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:35.900
So, that's what that looks like.

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:38.120
My next word is motion.

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:41.870 position:56%
One of the things that I love about
print making is the constant motion.

00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:45.510
Sometimes the rhythm of working
on the press feels like a dance.

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:47.610
Also, because books
are physical objects,

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:50.150
I like to consider the
reader being in motion

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:52.450
as they move thorough my books.

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:57.810
I'm drawn to images
of women as trees.

00:29:57.810 --> 00:30:01.850
When I saw Bernini's 17th
century marble sculpture of Daphne

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:06.860
and Apollo in the Borghese
Gallery in Rome, I stood staring

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:08.730
at it for a very long time.

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:13.130
Just trying to see and feel how he
made marble into flesh, and then,

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:16.080
see the precise moment
when the flesh became bark.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.120
I was wondering at
such beauty baroque

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:21.210
and elegant for such a tragic fate.

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:26.160
For decades I've been collecting
images of women as trees.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:28.880
For a person who love freedom
and motion as much as I do,

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.870
I'm confounded by interests
in something rooted.

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:36.560
I made this book, Threshold
in 2012, it's about moving

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:39.940
through transformation
and creating change.

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:42.790
The cover of the book is
a poem about thresholds.

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:45.650
"Marking passage, the
framework of conception,

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:48.510
on the verge of where the
end becomes the beginning.

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:51.670
The shape like a doorway to open."

00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:54.510
The form and content of this
book are closely related,

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:56.390
relying on each other for meaning.

00:30:56.390 --> 00:31:00.520
I used a Turkish map fold, so when
the book opens, Daphne's hand opens

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:04.620
in the midst of leafing
and reaching for the sky.

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:08.390
In Ovid's Metamorphoses, we read
the nymph Daphne's passion was

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:10.940
to run free in the forest and hunt.

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:12.980
Then she becomes hunted herself.

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:15.860
she flees to escape
being ravaged by Apollo.

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:19.290
She runs to the river's edge
and cries out, "Change me",

00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:24.210 position:56%
and the god of the river turns her
into a tree rooted forever in place.

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:27.370
I read many translations
of this tale,

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:29.870
but I couldn't figure
out why a tree?

00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:33.190
I do love trees, but it didn't
seem an apt metamorphoses

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:35.340
for someone like Daphne.

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:39.820
So, for this book, I wrote
my own version of this story.

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:42.700
Her determination to
remain free is inspiring,

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:45.920
yet her call for change
has an unexpected outcome,

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:49.280
as do many thresholds we cross.

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:51.580
The reader is asked to
put the book in motion,

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:54.160
turning it in order to read it.

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:57.520
Turning the book and looking at the
alcose, the reader moves in time

00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:03.430
from day with the sun, and into
night with moon -- with the moon.

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:06.790
Turning to read each of the four
corners, which I considered, north,

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:11.310
south, east, and west, you find
the four Meta-muses of Flux,

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:13.530
I made up Greek names for them.

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:14.940
You started that.

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:17.650
This is my fourth and
fifth grade teacher

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:20.650
from Columbia Maryland,
John Sullivan.

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:24.960
And the -- he's the one
to whom the book Body

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.800
of Inquiries is dedicated to,
because I think I learned a lot

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.860
about curiosity from him.

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:32.460
But I remember you were the
one who introduced to us

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:35.290
about Greek roots, thank you.

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:37.790
So, each one of these
has a Greek name.

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:44.800
And Uthelia[Phonetic], in the
corner on the left is about vision

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:47.230
and ideas, she's in flight.

00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:49.850
I ask -- I like the last line --

00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:55.280
where it says she is bold
and her bones are light.

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:57.870
The next muse on the right
is Upraxia[Phonetic].

00:32:57.870 --> 00:32:59.680
She's about planning
and calculating,

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:04.670
and realizing where ideas intersect
with reality in the material world.

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:07.700
Then the next muse on the
left is Utropia[Phonetic],

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:10.150
trop meaning change.

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:13.800
She is about the meandering path of
experimenting, and how responding

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:17.390
to the twists and turns
can form a surprising path.

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:19.460
Finally, the muse on the
right is Uthemia[Phonetic],

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:22.850
where everything comes together,
and the whole begins anew,

00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:24.860
so the book keeps turning.

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:26.480
The border around the
book is printed

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:29.140
with a phrase, "There
is no fixed self.

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:32.750
We are all perpetually in motion
in our daily lives on our planet,

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:36.320
through the cosmos, at the
atomic and subatomic level.

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.640
We are essentially
motion, change is constant,

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:41.290
and there is no fixed self."

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:44.060
The next word is wonder.

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:48.630
The word wonder can go in
a few different directions.

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:52.770
It can be about curiosity, it
can be a happy awe of gratitude,

00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:55.700
and it can be about
dumfounded incredulity.

00:33:55.700 --> 00:34:00.030
In current events, I find
myself often in this last state.

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:03.000
I made this book Here say,
in 2012 with my friend

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.820
and former teacher Nance O'Banion.

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:08.340
I'd like to take a quick look
at this book, because I made --

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:11.350
though I made it five years ago,
it's come alive to me in a new way

00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:14.080
with our current political
environment.

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:18.130 position:56%
This book is about locating where we
are in a landscape of truth and lie.

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:21.260
It's about communication
and how we orient ourselves

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:25.410 position:56%
in variable and interacting context.

00:34:25.410 --> 00:34:27.550
The book opens to a map
with a spectrum to truth,

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:31.490
to half-truth, down the side.

00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:35.220
And a spectrum of half-truth to
lie printed along the bottom.

00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:38.730
The object is to see what happens
at the intersecting points.

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:41.750
The magnetized ear shape
structure holds volvelles spinning

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:45.630
with the variables of how one
hears and listens depending

00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:51.220
on the shifting factors of who,
what, when, where, how, and why?

00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:53.950 position:56%
Turning the four different volvelles
creates different readings,

00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:59.120
and offers many interpretations
of what we consider true.

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.480
This is an early volvelle,
I just liked it,

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.350
I saw it at the MSU Library, and
I thought I'd show it to you.

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:07.960
I really like volvelles,
they offer a dynamic way

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:10.570
of creating choice
and chance in a book.

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:13.210
He has slid his image
in at the last minute.

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:16.740
It's a piece that I am hoping
to finish in the next few weeks.

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:20.070
It's a project for my
multiverse beta curse[phonetic].

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:23.320
The yellow and green print on the
right is a map of the Big Bang,

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:26.170
I'm still working on that print.

00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:30.180 position:56%
But it has a caption that's
complete, it fits with this truth --

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:32.440
this theme of truth and wonder.

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:35.310
It reads, "What else might
be true", which works for me

00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:38.040
in a cosmological sense, and also,

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:44.210
in this time of befuddling
political discourse.

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:47.440
My last word is why?

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:48.740
Moving on.

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:50.040
3

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.000
[ Laughter ]

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:58.210
This will be -- my final book
brings me to why, my favorite word.

00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:01.460
I've come to believe this
is the most important word

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:06.340
that defines humans, and
make us uniquely creative.

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:09.590
Books are a place not only where
we can go to answer questions,

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:15.380
but for me, I found in books
a way to ask questions.

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:19.810
I made Why Go in 2010, it's the
last book I made as an art student

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:23.400
at the California School
College of the Arts.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:27.190
it's about when I went into the
world alone, in the chronology

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:30.710
of my life it follows how to fall.

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:33.880
It took me a year of working two
jobs to save up for this trip.

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:36.670
I left my little town and
flew into the Pacific.

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:40.910
First, I rode my bike around
the islands of New Zealand.

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:43.790
Then I lived in a commune
there for a few months learning

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:46.130
about farming and permaculture.

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:49.260
Then into Indonesia and South-East
Asia where I found a monastery

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:51.590 position:56%
in Thailand to learn about Buddhism.

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:53.900
Then I traveled for
several months in Vietnam,

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:56.650
Egypt, Israel, then home.

00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:59.310
When I got home, I picked
up my life where I left it.

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:01.210
It wasn't until years
later that I had time

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:03.230
to ask myself what
it was I was looking

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:07.270
for in the world --
out there in the world?

00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:10.390
Still figuring that out,
but what I can tell you is

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:13.900
that I found my voice in
making this book, in that,

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:15.350
my books could be questions.

00:37:15.350 --> 00:37:20.130
So, this is the book that Betsy
Davids was my thesis advisor on?

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:23.630
Yeah. So, do you guys
know Betsy Davids?

00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:28.810
She was a wonderful
of book art for me.

00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:31.050
I made Body if Inquiry in 2011,

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:33.530
it's the first book I
made on hard school.

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:37.640
The subject of this book is the
anatomical model that she saw.

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:41.770
She inspired me to explore the
science and mystery of life.

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:46.470
I began first by reading about
her organs and how the body works.

00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:50.590
Biology soon learned to -- led
to physics, and to physics,

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:53.190
it's a short leap into the cosmos.

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:56.310
I ordered her from an
Edmund Scientific catalog,

00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:59.560
mail ordered her, so that tells
you how long I've had her.

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:03.820
So, for over 20 years she sat on
various bookshelves of my life.

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:07.600
Sometimes she's intact, the
carapace of her skin on,

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:12.250
but mostly she's open, her organs
in various places around my studio.

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:15.690
She maintains a particular
sung fwah[phonetic].

00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:20.060
Looking in the distance,
never ruffled,

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:24.230
always a small simile
and every hair in place.

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:26.410
So, my husband's French,
and I had --

00:38:26.410 --> 00:38:31.420
I said the word wrong for
a lot of -- saying Freud.

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:35.500
Because I've always said it the
way I would think to say it,

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:38.710
sometimes he corrects me.

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:41.330
She told me -- she holds
something transcendent

00:38:41.330 --> 00:38:45.430
and secret despite her
openness and accessibility.

00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:49.950 position:56%
Over the years, I've referred to her
as Our Lady of Serene Evisceration.

00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:54.920
There is something remote and
sacred, and yet incredibly exposed

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:56.830
and vulnerable about her.

00:38:56.830 --> 00:39:01.560
I'd begun this book, but I
hadn't settled on a structure.

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:05.390 position:56%
I wasn't sure what kind of space to
put her in, but then I was in Paris,

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:10.360
and I saw this image of Mary at the
Cluny not the image, the actual --

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.580
didn't see the image,
it was actually that.

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:15.450
That's the great thing
about museums.

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:20.740
So, this is what -- this
inspired the tryptic structure.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:25.520
I didn't know like, what
kind of space to put her in.

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:30.070 position:56%
And so, I realized that that was
just a moment of understanding that.

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:32.380
Like, I was thinking, does
she want to be in the forest,

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:33.710
like where is she going to live?

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:37.050
So, that was nice seeing that.

00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:39.490
This is the other side of
the book, the instruments

00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:41.310
on the outer panels are from 19th

00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:44.340
and early 20th century
scientific catalogs that I found

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.670
in the Doe Library at UC Berkley.

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:50.680
These early laboratory instruments
represent our endeavors to measure

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:53.620
and quantify, and our
quest to understand things

00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:57.510
that cannot be readily
apprehended by the senses.

00:39:57.510 --> 00:40:01.520
The large panels explore atoms,
cells, and genetic structure.

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:04.920
The interior codex tells the
story of my anatomical model,

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:08.210
and investigates the permeable,
borderline between material

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:12.530
and immaterial in our
bodies and in our life.

00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:15.490
These parts of the body
are all cut by hand.

00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:20.030
The more resolve something is,
the longer the trail of failures

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:21.960
and experiments behind it.

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:24.660
I wanted the organs to be
accurate, and also happy

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:25.960
to be moved through and read.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.890
I didn't want the reader to think

00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:32.010
that it was too delicate
for their hands to open.

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:33.970
I enjoyed pairing the
actual functioning

00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:36.130
of the organs with metaphor.

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:39.770
Here, the heart opens,
it is the body after all

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:41.400
that keeps us here on earth.

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:45.560
The perfect distance from our star
on a remote edge of the milky way,

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:49.620
one of 200 billion
galaxies in our universe.

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:50.920
Thank you.

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:52.720
Thank you, Mark.

[ Applause ]

00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:03.600
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: It is time
for Casey to take a few questions.

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:09.500
&gt;&gt; Casey Gardner: I answered
everything in my -- paper.

[ Chuckling ]

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:14.940
&gt;&gt; Casey Gardner: Yeah?

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:17.090 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Do you have one of those machines
where you do the polymer plates,

00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:19.470
or do you send them out,
or how does that -- ?

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:20.770
&gt;&gt; Casey Gardner: Some I
-- there's different like,

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:23.550
sometimes school have them
and I can access them.

00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:26.400
Or the, now the San Francisco
Center of the Book has one,

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:29.020
but usually I'm really --

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:32.020
like, getting over to San
Francisco is hell now.

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:35.670
So, now I just sent
them out to Boxcar.

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:38.370
But, I'm going to having a
fellowship at Kala[phonetic]

00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:40.070
and they have a plate maker.

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:44.980
So, it'll be kind of fun to be able
to have that instant gratification,

00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:47.470
instead of a, you know,
I get the plate back.

00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:48.880
So, yeah.

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:53.520
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: And do
you leave that to images only,

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:56.070
or is some of your
[inaudible] typography also made

00:41:56.070 --> 00:41:57.370
on the polymer plates?

00:41:57.370 --> 00:41:59.520
&gt;&gt; Casey Gardner: Yeah,
that's all polymer, yeah.

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:03.910
And so, like, in that -- like, some
of that's my handwriting in there.

00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:05.770
That was -- all my
books have something

00:42:05.770 --> 00:42:08.700
where I don't know I can
do something, and so,

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:10.480
I want to experiment
with it in the book.

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:13.120
And that was like, for
some reason handwriting --

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:17.590
mixing handwriting and typography,
because I really love typography,

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:19.210
that's a big interest of mine.

00:42:19.210 --> 00:42:22.580
So, I wanted to see how I could
mix my handwriting with typography.

00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:24.730
And so, that was one
of the trajectories

00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:30.100
of my -- of that book, yeah.

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:32.620
&gt;&gt; Just for chuckles sake,
there used to be a time

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:36.480
when if you wanted, you
could have type-high --

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.730
your signature type
high carved out of wood.

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:42.070
&gt;&gt; Casey Gardner: Oh, yeah, I
could imagine that happening.

00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:46.600
Yeah, that'd be -- and I can print
on wood I can make it type high.

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:50.580
Yeah -- a wood plate,
because -- linoleum or wood.

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:56.940 position:56%
Anything that I can make into relief
and make it .918, I can print on.

00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:59.610
Yeah.

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:01.050
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation:
Is that your artwork?

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:02.350
&gt;&gt; Casey Gardner: It is.

00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:06.660
So, the San Francisco for The
Book asked me to do a linoleum

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:09.080
for their steamroller printing.

00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:13.010
So, that's three by -- that's
a three foot by three foot.

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:17.300 position:56%
This is the carving of the linoleum.

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:18.600
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:19.900
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:21.200
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.500
&gt;&gt; Casey Gardner: And
so, they lay the linoleum

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:24.800
on the street outside the San
Francisco Center of the Book,

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.450
and a big steam roller
comes along --

00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:30.500
they put a piece of beautiful
Rives BFK down on it,

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:32.130
and the steam roller
comes along and prints it.

00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:33.440
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:34.740
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation:
They dampen the paper?

00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:37.450
&gt;&gt; Casey Gardner: Yeah, they dampen
the paper, and then they have,

00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:40.510
you know, like, all these people
with big ink rollers, you know,

00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:42.550
kneeling down in the street.

00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:44.340
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: So, that
wasn't -- it wasn't on wood,

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:45.970
it was just on the linoleum.

00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:47.270
&gt;&gt; Casey Gardner: Right, mm-hmm.

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:48.790
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: So, it'll
add a little flexibility.

00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:50.090
&gt;&gt; Casey Gardner: Good point.

00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:51.880
Yeah, good point, and
they came out really well.

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.670
I wish I had one of those prints.

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:57.860
They -- it was a fundraiser, so
I didn't have -- get any, but --

00:43:57.860 --> 00:43:59.830
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: That
was a lot of carving.

00:43:59.830 --> 00:44:02.790
&gt;&gt; Casey Gardner: It
was a lot of carving,

00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:05.430
but my friend Macy
Chadwick came over,

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:08.460
and helped me do some
of the carving, yeah.

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:11.280
So, that was what really
got me into doing linoleum.

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:15.720
Like, I know how to do linoleum,
but I'd never really done that much

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:19.390
of it, and so, after that I
started using linoleum more.

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:23.320
That was a couple years
ago, so, yeah.

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:26.280
So, then this is -- let me see.

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:28.360
So, that's it just like,
after they printed it.

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:33.350
They hung it up on the -- outside
of the thing to let it dry.

00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:34.650
So, that -- you can see it's

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:37.100
like they have these nice
little hang-up things.

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:41.100
So, yeah, that was it, that's
when I saw it for the first time.

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:42.400
I was like, o h, it worked out.

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:43.700
[ Laughter ]

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:46.710 position:56%

I mean, you can see what I'm doing

00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:49.600
with the women of the trees,
I'm trying to get her in motion

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:50.900
and also have her rooted.

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:54.010
And down in here in the
root sit says, "Oh, yes."

00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:55.310
So --

00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:58.380
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: Kind of a
joke, no warning spots either.

00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:00.360
&gt;&gt; No, they, I mean, they
know what they're doing.

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:03.110
They're not messing around, they're
-- they have some good printers

00:45:03.110 --> 00:45:05.100
and the San Francisco
Center of the Book.

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:07.930
The guy's name is Chad,
and he's like --

00:45:07.930 --> 00:45:10.970
he's just totally into
it that day, yeah.

00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:13.500
So, they're -- it's actually going
on I think the one for this year

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:18.530
in the next week, yeah,
the big steam roller.

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:22.410
&gt;&gt; John Sullivan: When did
you start learning to write?

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:25.320
Do you want to tell the class
[inaudible] here how you used

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:26.620
to sign your name?

00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:27.920
&gt;&gt; Casey Gardner: Oh, I did!

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:29.910
I was thinking about that.

00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:32.150
So, when I was in fourth
and fifth grade I used to --

00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:34.180
&gt;&gt; John Sullivan: And the
other teachers wanted me

00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:36.020
to beat her daily.

00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:40.390
And I just saw something, I said,
I'm just going to let her go.

00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:42.540
&gt;&gt; Casey Gardner: So,
I signed my name Casey,

00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:46.230
and there was an exclamation
point, a smiley face, and a star.

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:50.230
And I never signed my name
without that like for years.

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:53.060
It didn't rally translate
when I moved to Colorado,

00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:55.470
I tried it for a while, but it
didn't have the same resonance,

00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:57.650
because I didn't have
a teacher like you.

00:45:57.650 --> 00:46:02.970
No, but, yeah -- so, Casey --
but I should try that again.

00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:07.040
Me and -- and then, Lori Martin,
I tried to get her to do it too.

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:08.750
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation:
On your business card.

00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:12.320
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Casey, exclamation
point, smiley face, star.

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:13.620
&gt;&gt;Mark Dimunation: Yeah.

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:14.920
I think we'd take you
really seriously.

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:16.220
&gt;&gt; Casey Gardner: Yeah.

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:18.870
Well, luckily, I don't have to --
now I can just say, I'm an artist,

00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:21.130 position:56%
you don't have to take me seriously.

00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:25.570
I can get -- I have such
impunity with that, so, yeah.

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:29.060

would everyone join me
