1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,580
Hey, what's going on is bill burn
is time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:05,581 --> 00:00:07,860
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,610
just checking in on you.
Just checking in on you.

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,920
Whatever the fuck I used to do it.
Uh, my warrior, I'm in Winnipeg,

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,640
Canada.
I didn't bring all my recording equipment,

6
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:27,060
so I'm going to figure the level here
that I can talk close to the thing without

7
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:30,840
fucking up yours. I'm in Winnipeg,
Canada. And guess what? It's still cold.

8
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:36,390
It's May 18th and it's like 42
degrees out, which it's annoying.

9
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,740
Why does it keep making that noise?
I'm not getting any closer to, oh,

10
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:45,630
it's the wind. I see. Keep it
steady. If I just rested on my chest,

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,070
will that work? How's
that? Okay, good. Anyways,

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,550
it's like 43 fucking degrees out,
you know,

13
00:00:53,551 --> 00:00:57,690
which isn't cold for the wintertime,
but for May it's fucking annoying.

14
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,510
You know? And I didn't dress properly. I
came up here with the wind fucking break

15
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,610
and uh, you know, just walking around even
a zip up, my God damn coach and knowing,

16
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,400
Oh bill, fuck you. Everything
in noise. You, well, maybe
you're right. Maybe it does.

17
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,950
Maybe it does.
Um,

18
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,560
I don't know whether I'm just going
to hold this fucking recorder. Um,

19
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,270
I'll tell you, you know what's fucking
overrated by the way? Breakfast, potatoes,

20
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:30,350
breakfast potatoes, Cole
slaw, beans and rice.

21
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,373
All right.

22
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,840
All of them just taken up a fucking
chair on the bench that someone else who

23
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:44,390
wants to get in the fucking game
could be, you know, you just dump all,

24
00:01:44,391 --> 00:01:48,650
like the like just rebuild,
start over again.

25
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:53,000
Like the fucking capitals,
you know, play fillers,

26
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,540
that's all it is. Fuck.
Breakfast potatoes,

27
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,640
they never tastes good and they just
make you fat and you feel like you got to

28
00:02:01,641 --> 00:02:03,860
eat them because your mother was
always like, well, if you know,

29
00:02:03,861 --> 00:02:06,260
fucking finish that you're going
to sit there until the morning.

30
00:02:06,261 --> 00:02:10,560
And he just sat there, right?
Watching the ketchup dry, um,

31
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,460
turned in that it actually starts,
you know, coagulating Cetera.

32
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,830
Is that the right word? Um, anyways,

33
00:02:18,831 --> 00:02:21,740
I don't understand why this fucking
record is going to have to be like this,

34
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,930
making all this racket. So I'm
trying to be a grump here. Um,

35
00:02:26,931 --> 00:02:31,610
so I'm in Winnipeg tonight
for two, two shows. Um,

36
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,860
and then I go up to Saskatoon,
Saskatchewan wall,

37
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,450
scas, Saskatchewan, right. Um,

38
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,240
also known as the Paris of the prairies,

39
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:49,270
which to me is the greatest fucking
nickname of a city than I can.

40
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,850
What do you, what do you, what
again, the big apple that stinks.

41
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,640
Beantown horrific. The Berg. Terrible.

42
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,460
Does la even have a nickname?

43
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,620
Trying to think of the elements.

44
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,080
Okay.

45
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,270
The land. CLEVELAND, Ugh.

46
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,960
That whole fucking thing where all of
a sudden every goddamn city needed,

47
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:16,920
I know I always talk about this, but
I'll never get over that. The awful low,

48
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,150
is that what they call buffalo?

49
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,590
The Paris of the prairies?
How great is that?

50
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,700
You know what I mean? See you going
out there. Just the prayer is,

51
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,560
it's going to be a little
mom and pop type of shit,

52
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:33,390
but it's going to be beautiful.
Um,

53
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,660
go in there and then we go down to a
Regina afterwards, which I believe,

54
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,530
yeah. What's that nickname? A
twat city. Is that what it is?

55
00:03:43,531 --> 00:03:46,980
Something like that or was that the
Golden State Warriors? I don't know.

56
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,820
Speaking of which I s the only way you
can root for the Golden State Warriors is

57
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:55,890
if you bet on them or if you're
from the Golden State, Oakland,

58
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,360
you know area in, you're
already a fan. Jesus Christ.

59
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:05,450
It was already bad enough to rent piled
on there and killed the OKC golden state

60
00:04:05,641 --> 00:04:08,310
rivalry, which is what we
will be watching right now.

61
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:09,700
Yeah.

62
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,790
Instead you're literally listening to
announcements like last night when the

63
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:16,060
Celtics were playing Reggie Miller's
like going cause they're trying to sell

64
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,090
this series going Lego,
you know the only was booked then.

65
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,290
I mean some of it was good,
but just telling points it,
Reggie Miller goes, goes,

66
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,720
look,
we both know there's two meteors,

67
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,540
head that at one another and we're
just going to watch him collide.

68
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,640
So I'm trying to do the last time I
watched the eastern and Western conference

69
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,940
finals and they felt like the
first round of the playoffs.

70
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,940
I'm fucking warriors. Oh my
God, they're filthy. Filthy.

71
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,630
I love Popovich.
Going off on that fucking goof.

72
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,890
How many slides steps did he fucking take

73
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,100
to make sure his foot was going to be in
the vicinity of where Leonard was going

74
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,870
to land? And for somebody out there
who doesn't think that that's filthy?

75
00:04:58,871 --> 00:05:03,790
Give me a fucking break. Give me a
break. He's taken a shot. You know,

76
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:08,800
why did he have to take that last
little slide step, skip, skip, skip,

77
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:10,600
and then just have his
fucking foot right there.

78
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,950
It'd be one thing if they couldn't do
like an entire highlight reel of him not

79
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:16,360
only being a dirty bastard,

80
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:20,020
but actually trying to
fucking whatever pop,

81
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:22,510
what's his face is Leonard shoulder out
or whatever the hell he was doing at

82
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,240
that time when he dragged him down
to the ground. It's a piece of shit.

83
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,110
The only thing worse than that fucking
move that he made was that awful little

84
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:29,381
debt.

85
00:05:29,381 --> 00:05:33,850
Three skip and a hop thing that he did
afterwards as he was holding onto his

86
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:38,740
head. Like he couldn't fucking
believe it. Um, listen,

87
00:05:38,741 --> 00:05:39,970
what the fuck do I know about who?

88
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:42,850
But I know Popovich knows a lot about
hoop and I know he's gone through a lot of

89
00:05:42,851 --> 00:05:45,030
shit and he's gone through
a lot of playoff series.

90
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,630
I never seen him go off like that,

91
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:51,310
so I'm going to go with what he said as
opposed to when I was watching ESPN and

92
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:55,480
the fucking sports anchor goes to Steven
[inaudible]. Hey Steven. You know,

93
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:00,020
we've both played the game.
What do you think it is?

94
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,990
Fucking anchor sitting there,
you know,

95
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,890
he's going to question
Popovich and Steven A.

96
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,260
Smith who I love was just like,
he basically said,

97
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,660
what I'm saying with Popovich
says, it's true then. Yeah,

98
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,720
you kinda gotta go with that. But, um,

99
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,830
the biggest fucking story and hoop had
already came and went because the fucking

100
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,670
Cavaliers series with the Celtics already
started and they fucking kicked our

101
00:06:22,671 --> 00:06:25,190
ass. Um, was,

102
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,840
I owe a certain member of the
Boston Celtics, a big apology

103
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,150
all of this time doubting camp,
you know,

104
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,580
making fun of his choice of sneakers,

105
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:39,680
making fun of the way he
looked in those sneakers,

106
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,880
talking about how many times he was
on the wrong side of the poster.

107
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,090
Kelly all fucking Linux.

108
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,633
What happened?

109
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,930
The man simply took over the game
in a fourth quarter of a game.

110
00:06:56,871 --> 00:07:01,220
Seven for the Boston Celtics
were in the green and white

111
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:06,410
shades of,
of Cedric Maxwell.

112
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,263
Okay.

113
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,140
But one game we say, just get on my back
cause I'm fucking taken this thing home.

114
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:16,670
And that's exactly what he did.
Okay. Scored 14 points in the, uh,

115
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,320
the fourth quarter,

116
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,160
he took Isaiah Thomas' watch off and
put it on his own fucking risks and I'll

117
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:28,220
put down the court. He went,
he was back in, guys down,

118
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,460
he was fucking dunk.
Eddie was layups.

119
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:35,360
He was hitting threes
on fucking believable.

120
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,630
Now having said that,
he did it once.

121
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,960
So game one of the Cavaliers series,

122
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:48,110
he was right back to the Kelly
Olynyk that we know. You know,

123
00:07:48,111 --> 00:07:50,240
I think that was a very special episode.

124
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:55,220
You know how they used to do that
with sitcoms? A very special episode.

125
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:59,150
They would always take on
like pregnancy, abortion, uh,

126
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,800
racism or something like that.

127
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:03,830
And then they would go right back to
being in an all white show. You know,

128
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,680
that's how white people cared in the 80s.
That's how we did it.

129
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:11,990
We didn't have to do any more than that.
That's all that there was.

130
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,070
Um,
so whenever I Kelly Olynyk Jesus Christ,

131
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:19,730
so I guess he's not going to do shit in
this series until then unless we get it

132
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:22,100
to game seven.
Um,

133
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,170
Celtics got the number one pick.
I mean,

134
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,640
it's just all that's all we got.

135
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:32,840
All we got to do now is just
wait until the Bron gets old.

136
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,160
And uh,

137
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:39,160
I actually hate the fucking warriors so
much that I don't care if they see if,

138
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,800
if the fucking Cavaliers sweep the Celtics
because I want them nice and rested

139
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,280
when they play those
fucking dirt bags out there.

140
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:53,330
Who's that other guy that got on the
tee where he j e you go to garden and he

141
00:08:53,331 --> 00:08:56,700
jumps up to take a jump shot
and he kicked you in the balls.

142
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,130
He's kicked like half
the league and the balls.

143
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,740
I'm going to buy a half the league.
I mean like three or four different guys.

144
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,630
After a while it's like,
dude, that's you move.

145
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:05,770
Yeah.

146
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:06,910
I love all of ESPN.

147
00:09:06,911 --> 00:09:11,911
Went to him to ask them if they thought
that fucking dead fucking Nazi Guard

148
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,120
House fucking guy that got there.

149
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,573
Yeah.

150
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,750
You know,
asked him if he thought he was dirty.

151
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,450
The Guy who accidentally
kicks people in the balls.

152
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,743
Yeah.

153
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,320
Do you think his teammates dirty?
I One?

154
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:28,510
Would you rather have you just have a
twisted ankles or rev your fucking balls

155
00:09:28,511 --> 00:09:30,130
separated for the next nine years?

156
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,693
MMM.

157
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:36,890
Anyways, I don't know why. I don't know
why Chris Paul couldn't go to the Lakers,

158
00:09:36,891 --> 00:09:39,230
but Kevin Duran could go to the,
to the fucking

159
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,030
the warriors and now that,
now that the worries are filthy as shit,

160
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,260
they took Leonard out of the
series. It's just, it's a joke.

161
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:50,610
Yeah.

162
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:55,290
I would rather watch the real housewives
in the western conference finals in the

163
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:59,760
NBA. Um, so anyways,
enough about that shit.

164
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:01,973
MMM.

165
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,440
Type in my password here, dude. What the
fuck's going on with the auto centers?

166
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,830
When are they going to start
behaving like the Ottawa senators?

167
00:10:09,831 --> 00:10:12,230
I don't get what's going on here.
You know,

168
00:10:12,231 --> 00:10:15,170
I still think the penguins are
going to beat him every time.

169
00:10:15,171 --> 00:10:17,840
Like the penguins get the fucking shit
kicked out of him. Then what happens?

170
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:23,330
They come back, they give you
the old right there, Fred.
And they fucking, when the,

171
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,050
uh, they win the series, um,

172
00:10:27,051 --> 00:10:29,900
I still think that they're going
to take the whole thing. Um,

173
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:34,940
yeah.

174
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,370
Now here's something I wanted to
talk to you guys about. Like the,

175
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:42,610
I just flew up here to fucking Winnipeg
and I don't know what happened,

176
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:49,150
but the fucking level of animal that
was on my flight to this guy next to me,

177
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,030
you know,
I told you I've right up front.

178
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:54,490
Yeah,

179
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:57,070
I haven't call it first class.
It's just human class.

180
00:10:57,071 --> 00:10:59,900
They treat you like a human being.
That's all that happens upfront.

181
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:04,180
If you ever wanted, they don't smash you
all on the back and all that shit. Right.

182
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:09,610
So I'm waiting to get on. Right. So
they had people with wheelchairs,

183
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,770
they get on first and you know,

184
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,690
fucking people with kids. If
you're in the military, you know,

185
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:20,830
if you're wearing a red shirt, they
got like a bunch of things, right?

186
00:11:20,831 --> 00:11:24,240
So people were sitting in first
class to getting all huffy going,

187
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,170
when's first class going to board,
right?

188
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,320
Yeah.

189
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,170
You know that white guy with the loafers
and no socks like that fucking energy.

190
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:35,004
Right?

191
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:40,110
So we're going to get on
in this fucking fat fuck,

192
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,610
you know, and his 20s just
completely blown out. Body,

193
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,100
big giant fat boys. I'm a polywood
producer. Fucking glasses,

194
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:53,980
stupid hat wearing sweatpants
and some big comfy fucking shirt.

195
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:57,400
You know, just giving into
the fact that's why he's fat.

196
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,710
All these fat people that
wear comfortable clothes,

197
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:02,500
you're going to be fat forever cause you,
cause you never,

198
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:03,640
you're not uncomfortable.

199
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,140
You got to keep the clothes that
you had when you were that weight.

200
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:11,950
You don't go to the fucking dry cleaner
or go to the Goddamn Nike store and buy

201
00:12:11,951 --> 00:12:15,880
yourself a giant fucking sleeping
bag would draw strings on it.

202
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:19,720
Cause you're never gonna really feel how
fat you are until you don't go to get

203
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:22,270
on a fucking airplane.
Right?

204
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,480
Yeah.

205
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,050
So I'm, so this guy is trying to
cut the fucking line, right. And uh,

206
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:33,540
you know, I sort of box him out and uh,

207
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:38,541
they scanned my thing and I get to go to
get on the flight and just fucking fat.

208
00:12:39,271 --> 00:12:43,170
Fuck comes down the thing and he
literally, he gets on the plane, he goes,

209
00:12:43,171 --> 00:12:44,490
where am I sitting up front.

210
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:45,670
Okay.

211
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,770
Like really like,
like weird.

212
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,070
Like you can't just look gates and
lady like looks at the ticket and he's

213
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,360
fucking sitting right next to me.

214
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,770
So I'm putting my shit in the overhead
compartment. It's goes shoes way.

215
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,020
They fucking goes to brush
right by me. I said, hey buddy,

216
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:01,600
I go watch out from my bag.
And he's like, oh sorry.

217
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:05,100
He kind of backed back out again. You
know, he wasn't gonna hit my bank.

218
00:13:05,101 --> 00:13:09,100
I just don't like how he fucking brushed
right by me. Right. So he sits down,

219
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:13,090
right. Giant fucking snowman
looking Douche bag. Right.

220
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:17,080
Sits down and he's so fat.
I'm in first class,

221
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,400
he's still spilling into my seat fucking
elbow in me and all that stuff. Yeah.

222
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:25,390
Shit. It's just like, this is not
what I'm spending my sky miles on,

223
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:31,620
you know. So, um, the lady,

224
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:35,610
the stewardess comes over, she goes, you
know, can get you guys something to drink,

225
00:13:35,611 --> 00:13:40,470
right? I order a drink and the guy goes
of kind of a blanket. They go, she goes,

226
00:13:40,471 --> 00:13:42,900
yes. So when she comes up with a
blanket and she holds it out to him,

227
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,100
he just fucking rips it out of
her hand and like open it up.

228
00:13:47,101 --> 00:13:51,540
And just the way he was so choppy and like
aggressive yet couldn't find his seat.

229
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:56,350
I was like, this guy, I don't know what
this is. I don't know what the fuck this,

230
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,360
this, this guy on drugs. Is
He autistic? Is it Asperger?

231
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,180
I don't fucking know cause I don't really
know what the symptoms of any of that

232
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:06,780
shit is. You know, I saw the
rain man and uh, you know,

233
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,980
I dunno what else I fucking went on
podcasts on one time with somebody.

234
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,230
That aspect I can't fucking tell. I just
don't know that they act a little off.

235
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,350
All right. And I'm not going
to be yet another douche bag.

236
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,300
Who doesn't have a psychology degree,

237
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:22,620
let alone practicing that profession
to start analyzing somebody's mental

238
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,070
situations. So then he
fucking sits there. Okay.

239
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,350
A rips the blanket open cause somehow
this tub of shit is going to get fucking

240
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:37,110
cold and uh, he starts doing the, uh,

241
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,980
what's that thing when you restless legs
syndrome except his leg weighs as much

242
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:45,000
as my entire body.

243
00:14:45,001 --> 00:14:49,840
So it's like actually shaking the plane
and I fortunately was a red eye on my

244
00:14:49,841 --> 00:14:53,780
God, you know, let this
fucking guy just go to sleep.

245
00:14:53,781 --> 00:14:58,040
But then is he going to have sleep apnea?
I don't know what, long story short,

246
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:02,630
we finally ended up, I
connected in Minneapolis. Okay.

247
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:03,920
And I,

248
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,710
when I got up I deliberately stood in
the way where he couldn't get out of his

249
00:15:06,711 --> 00:15:10,640
seat cause I knew he was going to brush
by me once again and be fucking rude,

250
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,320
whatever.
Fuck his deal is.

251
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:19,190
So I passive aggressively stand there.
So I get off the plan, my grade,

252
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,920
I don't have to fucking deal
with this guy anymore. Right.

253
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:24,340
So I get off the plane and as I'm standing
there trying to figure out where my

254
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:27,250
connecting flight
gate is,

255
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:32,200
this fucking jerk off comes walking
off the plane and he still wearing the

256
00:15:32,201 --> 00:15:35,200
blanket. He's got that wrapped
around them. Oh, by the
way, it was also of course,

257
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:38,650
wearing sandals, you know,
like all animals do. They just,

258
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:43,630
they have to have their feet
out. You know, like animals,
animals are all barefoot.

259
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,280
They don't have shoes,
right?

260
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,540
So these guys have sandals cause
they're half an animal, like,

261
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,120
you know what I mean?

262
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,410
If you're in a hot climate or you
fucking at the beach or whatever,

263
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,640
going down to the pool, the spa
that load that sandals. Anyways,

264
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:03,760
so he comes walking off the plane
and then just walks up to the,

265
00:16:03,761 --> 00:16:04,151
you know,
those,

266
00:16:04,151 --> 00:16:08,560
those little fucking cars that they
drive fat people around and old people,

267
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:13,390
blind people and stuff, you know. And uh,

268
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,840
he walks up to one of those guys
that goes, excuse me, sir. He goes,

269
00:16:16,841 --> 00:16:19,540
what do I do for the next five hours?
Why away from my flight?

270
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,020
And that's what I was like, all right,
this guy's, this guy's fucked up.

271
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,770
The guy's like, ah, as a food court.

272
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,520
So then he walks up to the ticket lady.

273
00:16:33,521 --> 00:16:36,460
Now I'm just standing there watching him
cause I got enough time cause now it's

274
00:16:36,461 --> 00:16:37,294
entertaining.

275
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,360
Watching him meet people and watching
them doing the math on their face,

276
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,120
you know, is this, you see it on their
face like what the fuck am I dealing with?

277
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,700
So he talks to the ticket agent,
freaks her out,

278
00:16:48,701 --> 00:16:53,500
then comes walking back and he walks up
to the car and he just goes, he goes,

279
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:54,730
sir,
where you taking me

280
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,810
and you pop psychologist. The guy finally
just goes, there's a food court down.

281
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:04,180
Then they just wandered off,
still wearing the blanket.

282
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,870
Now my buddy that I'm
working with this week,

283
00:17:07,871 --> 00:17:11,320
he was trying to say that he
thought the guy was on pills.

284
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:15,300
I have no idea what the fuck it was.
But uh, it was hilarious. But anyways,

285
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:19,060
the level of fucking animal,
so that guy was there.

286
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,590
There was another guy in my flight,

287
00:17:20,591 --> 00:17:25,330
he was wearing Pajama Pot Pajama bottoms
and he had a neck pillow, neck, pillow.

288
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,753
I mean,

289
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,310
I didn't even know where to go from there.

290
00:17:30,311 --> 00:17:33,730
There was another guy who had the worst
hat I've ever seen and he was carrying a

291
00:17:33,731 --> 00:17:36,940
hard shell case for the hat.

292
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,340
You know what I mean?
Well maybe that was his good hat.

293
00:17:40,341 --> 00:17:43,820
He was wearing his bad hat on the
flight. I Dunno. It's like, wait,

294
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:48,821
what are you running for president in
1905 and some shit like you ride on a

295
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,080
goddamned who has a fucking hat box?
Kind of a man is a hatbox.

296
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,990
It was a solid plastic one, like, like a
snare drum case. But as for a fucking hat.

297
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,023
Um,

298
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,050
so for whatever reason I get here to the
hotel and I'm reading about this plane

299
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:09,051
Crash Air Canada flight six 24
they say the timeline of the crash,

300
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:11,490
right?
10 Oh five,

301
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:15,540
the plane leaves 10 56 Air
Canada that tells flight crew,

302
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:17,490
uh,

303
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:21,690
than an Air Canada flight had landed
on how effects runway oh five.

304
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,310
After a missed approach due to
insufficient visibility because of weather

305
00:18:26,311 --> 00:18:27,450
conditions,

306
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:33,360
controller tells the crew to hold at 9,000
feet, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

307
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:38,340
blah. Right? The fucking crew asked
to confirm to the Iran setting.

308
00:18:38,341 --> 00:18:42,750
Five controller says that run four,
they'll eventually be on five.

309
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:45,060
They remain on for long story short,

310
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:50,070
this fucking guy flying this thing,
he ends up hitting like a snowbank.

311
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,310
Some lights,
he's fucking hit and shit off the plane.

312
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,340
They go slide down the runway
and they come to a stop.

313
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:01,410
Says aircraft comes to arrest about
1900 feet beyond the threshold.

314
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:07,300
Okay. This is like how scary this was. Um,

315
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,500
captain disconnects the autopilot
and plane makes automated calls.

316
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,980
There are hundreds and then 50 feet above
the land cope copilot says to pull up,

317
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:19,220
uh,

318
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:23,270
the AC, the Air Canada's six 24
Sevres in electric power line.

319
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:28,900
Cutting power to the airport terminal
captain advances thrust levers to the

320
00:19:30,111 --> 00:19:33,260
takeoff goal around and pulls side.

321
00:19:33,261 --> 00:19:35,630
Stick to the full nose up position.

322
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:41,330
A left main tire hits an approach like
861 feet from the runway threshold,

323
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:46,750
the main landing gear after lower fuselage
and left engine cowlings strike the

324
00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:52,700
snow covered ground on an embankment
sloping towards the runway.

325
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:57,570
The plane strikes the localizer antenna,
um,

326
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:02,480
and continues airborne before striking
the ground twice more and sliding along

327
00:20:02,481 --> 00:20:04,220
the runway.
This is what people are dealing with.

328
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:07,940
You guys ever see at Louis CK episode
where they were coming in for landing.

329
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,320
Everyone's screaming bloody murder.

330
00:20:09,321 --> 00:20:13,760
That's what I picture and I picture Louis
on this flight for whatever reason. Um,

331
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:19,160
aircraft comes to arrest 1900 feet
beyond the threshold is completely lost.

332
00:20:19,161 --> 00:20:24,161
Power Tower control acts activates
crash alarm as passengers.

333
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,470
Complete evacuation firefighters
arrived at the accident site.

334
00:20:27,471 --> 00:20:30,050
Now listen to this.
Listen to this.

335
00:20:30,051 --> 00:20:34,160
This is at 1236 when the
firefighters show up.

336
00:20:34,161 --> 00:20:37,190
This is what they see when the
passengers are out on the runway.

337
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:43,120
Now this was a fucking snow storm
that they flew into passengers.

338
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,270
Many wearing open toed shoes,

339
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:52,320
shorts and tee shirts and carrying
baggage is baggage are grouped about 200

340
00:20:53,351 --> 00:20:56,440
meters behind the aircraft
and frigid temperatures.

341
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:01,690
Occupants with most severe injuries
sit in the emergency vehicles. I mean,

342
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:05,770
kind of a fucking asshole gets on a god.

343
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,180
They have flight in the middle of a snow
storm wearing open toed fucking shoes,

344
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:14,510
sandals, shorts. You know,

345
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,170
next time I get on a flight and I see
those people getting on, I'll, I'll,

346
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,230
I'm going to be thinking as we
go down in the fucking Himalayas,

347
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,860
he's going to be the first
people to get eaten, you know?

348
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,040
Or are they going to be the first
people that you're going to have to kill

349
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,390
because they're going to be fighting
you for your fucking shoes. Um,

350
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,390
okay.

351
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,160
I don't even know what the
point of all of that was. All.

352
00:21:34,161 --> 00:21:38,780
I'm just saying it's just the level of
animal that is at the fucking airport.

353
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:42,200
And you know what's funny too,
like it's just a way,

354
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:46,010
when you're walking through an
airport you can't really see,

355
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:50,900
you don't really see it. You know,
like the demographic that you're in,

356
00:21:50,901 --> 00:21:54,620
you don't see it until
you get to your gate. Like

357
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:01,860
I didn't get the level of animal that
was going to fucking Winnipeg until I got

358
00:22:01,901 --> 00:22:05,770
to the gate that was flying to Winnipeg
because it's like, you know what I mean?

359
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,190
It's like, it's like a,
it's like a mixed drink.

360
00:22:09,191 --> 00:22:12,280
He can't taste the fucking alcohol.
Right. But then when you get to the gate,

361
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,620
when you get to your gate,
wherever the fuck you going,

362
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,170
barring a few tourists
who just going to visit,

363
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,190
that is a straight shot of what the fuck
you're, you're about ready to walk into

364
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,970
Pajama bottoms with a neck pillow.

365
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:27,663
MMM.

366
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,800
It's like, whenever I'm in New
York and I, I'm going to La,

367
00:22:30,801 --> 00:22:32,560
it's like you look at
the Er at the airports,

368
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,960
like these people all look
like New Yorkers and then
all of a sudden you get to

369
00:22:35,961 --> 00:22:40,580
the gate that's going to La and you
see the chick with the botox. You know,

370
00:22:40,581 --> 00:22:42,350
you see the guy with the fake Tan,

371
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,410
you start seeing the god of your way
of dressing. It's like, all right,

372
00:22:45,411 --> 00:22:49,520
these a la people, you know, and then
all of a sudden when you get off in la,

373
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,590
they totally blend in with people
at the fucking airport. I Dunno,

374
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:58,940
I always found that interesting. Well,
good built because we didn't, I'm sorry.

375
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,250
I'm sorry. Hang on a second. Let me,

376
00:23:01,251 --> 00:23:06,100
let me read some advertising
here for this week and uh Oh,

377
00:23:06,101 --> 00:23:07,210
by the way,
then I,

378
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,490
yeah,

379
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:09,701
I don't know.

380
00:23:09,701 --> 00:23:11,980
Am I going to talk about this first
before I go into the advertising?

381
00:23:11,981 --> 00:23:15,310
What's better? I'll come out of it and
talk about it. All right. Lift everybody.

382
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:18,070

Do you feel, I dunno, they,

413
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:15,180
they reinvented the watch business by
selling direct to you with over one on 1

414
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,060
million watches sold today.
I just can't fucking read today.

415
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:22,680
While they did it again,
except this time was sunglasses.

416
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:26,160
They're going to start selling
amber vision. Oh my God,

417
00:25:26,161 --> 00:25:29,640
everything is so much crisper and clearer.
Uh,

418
00:25:29,641 --> 00:25:31,590
they were tired of having
to pay for cheaply,

419
00:25:31,591 --> 00:25:36,450
made throwaway shades or
overpriced designer sunglasses.
So they said, fuck it.

420
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,970
We'll make our own starting
at just 70 bucks. Uh,

421
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:44,070
talk about your personal experience
with the new pair of sunglasses,

422
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:47,640
which pair you have,
how they look slash feel,

423
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,750
what you enjoy most about it,
how people ask you about it.

424
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:56,160
What do you want to know, where you
purchased and how much does it cost?

425
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,710
All right. None of that
happened. I even know you are.

426
00:25:58,711 --> 00:26:01,350
This is the first I'm hearing you guys
make sunglasses. So none of that happened.

427
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,370
But it does seem to get a lot of attention
out there on the streets if you start

428
00:26:05,371 --> 00:26:09,210
wearing them. Um, so be careful. If
you're not looking for attention,

429
00:26:09,211 --> 00:26:11,430
I wouldn't get these fucking sunglasses.
That's incredible. We're going,

430
00:26:11,431 --> 00:26:15,810
everything that had happened would
have happened if I got him. You know,

431
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:19,350
people would want to know about it.

MMM.

458
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:07,890
What am I up to here? All right,
let's talk about it. Everybody. Um,

459
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,980
rest in peace. Chris Cornell. Holy Shit.

460
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,040
Unbelievable man.

461
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:20,540
It's one of the best fucking
singers in rock history.

462
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:26,320
And, um, I hope with this saying, I mean,

463
00:28:26,321 --> 00:28:28,390
I guess if you die you die.
But I just, I don't know.

464
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:32,860
I hope they're not going to do
all a whole bunch of, you know,

465
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:36,580
you know, they do that. They got
to kill you again after you die.

466
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:39,323
MMM.

467
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,310
Jesus Christ. What a fucking band.
What a, what an artist. What,

468
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,880
uh, just the music just

469
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,430
holds up.
You know what I mean?

470
00:28:51,431 --> 00:28:54,360
There's a lot of music that I listened
to when I went back. You know,

471
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,480
the shit that I used to listen to
as a kid. I was like, oh my God,

472
00:28:58,481 --> 00:28:59,201
this is horrible.

473
00:28:59,201 --> 00:29:02,220
This is the second Barisone I still
listen to it because of the, you know,

474
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,810
reminds me of a time in my life.
But when I come up to the red light,

475
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:08,110
I got to turn it down. Nothing.
Chris Cornell over did.

476
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,050
Did you have to turn down?
You could,

477
00:29:11,051 --> 00:29:14,950
you could fucking have it
cranked and never be embarrassed.

478
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:18,820
I'm such a huge, huge
fucking loss. And once again,

479
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,950
someone I should have gone to see,

480
00:29:20,951 --> 00:29:23,830
never did too busy doing
this comedy fucking thing.

481
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:27,550
I was going to go see temple of the dog
and I had some other show I couldn't go.

482
00:29:27,551 --> 00:29:30,790
I think Dean del Ray had tickets
to that. He was like, dude,

483
00:29:30,791 --> 00:29:34,000
it was fucking unbelievable.
And um,

484
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:40,270
and it's just fucking awful. Just awful.
I was a huge fan of that band. And, uh,

485
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:43,960
so now what happens?
I know they're in the middle of a tour,

486
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,753
you know,

487
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,300
you don't, what they do now is
they just find some fucking guy on,

488
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:54,440
on the Internet that does
like an impression of them
and then all of a sudden

489
00:29:54,441 --> 00:29:58,000
the guy has to fucking go up there
and be like a rock star. Like I, I,

490
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:02,480
I've never seen a band like that.
I've never gone to see a band like that,

491
00:30:02,481 --> 00:30:06,410
although I heard the guy from Alison
chains fucking murders it. So who knows?

492
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:10,970
Um,
I dunno,

493
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:13,340
how do you get out of this?
See,

494
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,800
that's why I fucking hate
talking about sad shit like that.

495
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,523
MMM.

496
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:20,361
Somewhere in all of that,

497
00:30:20,361 --> 00:30:24,080
I saw a fucking way out of this and
now I don't know what the fuck it is.

498
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:28,520
So anyways, uh, plowing ahead,

499
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,930
fucking plowing ahead. He, oh, I
know what to say. You know what?

500
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:37,990
I went back and I downloaded
skid row's slave to the grind

501
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:45,050
and that album, that album marked
the end of my musical youth,

502
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:50,750
that album came out in like the summer
of [inaudible] 91 and then in September

503
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,060
fucking,
you know,

504
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:57,320
all of a sudden Nirvana's album
came out and then that was just, it.

505
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:02,150
All of my band's got
wiped the fuck off at MTV,

506
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,360
you know? And, um,

507
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:12,610
so I went back and I downloaded a slave
to the grind monkey business and all

508
00:31:12,611 --> 00:31:16,630
that, which then maybe go watch, uh,

509
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:22,610
you know, a bunch of skid row fucking
videos and there's a video, man, I,

510
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:27,100
you gotta see this shit.
It's from 1991,

511
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,080
I believe.
91 or 92.

512
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:34,340
It's skid row on SNL and
Sebastian Bach in the whole band,

513
00:31:34,841 --> 00:31:37,630
just fucking murdering

514
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:43,600
monkey business. And I don't know,

515
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:47,500
to me that was like the, for me,
I just feel like I'm doing it now.

516
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,170
I've said it so much that
I actually say for me now,

517
00:31:50,171 --> 00:31:53,020
I say for me and to me
because I keep doing it.

518
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:56,890
It's like when I met Mandy, I used to
make fun of this guy who said, yeah,

519
00:31:56,891 --> 00:31:59,510
you liked did that, you liked
it, did that. And I still,

520
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:02,230
I kept and we just kept
doing it to each other.

521
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:07,000
And I was in a meeting one time pitching
his show and I was talking about a

522
00:32:07,001 --> 00:32:11,490
comic that I liked and I said, yeah, I saw
the special. Yeah, I liked it. Did that.

523
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:15,200
I went, oh my God. And it was actually
liked it and we started going like,

524
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:18,600
did it to make it even more ridiculous.
And I literally said like,

525
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,720
they did it and the, I saw the person's
face, like, look at me like, like,

526
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,740
does he have a stutter? I can't
put this guy on fucking camera. Um,

527
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:33,180
anyways,
so I'm watching this fucking video and,

528
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:38,130
and it was the end of like aggressive,

529
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:44,160
fun fucking bands.
Like they would just fucking kill it.

530
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,510
It just,
it,

531
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:52,490
they were like rock stars and they were
enjoying it before the grunge came in

532
00:32:52,491 --> 00:32:55,790
and everyone saying, God,
I wish I was like, you

533
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,490
easily amused. I always hated that fucking
line. And you don't fucking know me.

534
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,140
You condescending cunt.

535
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:08,090
I'm not easily amused and I don't find
what the fuck you trying to suggest about

536
00:33:08,091 --> 00:33:09,410
me even remotely amusing.

537
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:15,500
Can somebody please make a video of that
Kurt Cobain singing that line and then

538
00:33:15,501 --> 00:33:19,340
you cut the joke. Peshy so what? I'm
like a clown. I like I amuse you.

539
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:21,993
MMM.

540
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:27,980
Anyways, yeah. And then all the sad
guys came in, Kurt Cobain fucking,

541
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,510
uh, uh, was the Pearl
Jam guy. Eddie vetter.

542
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:33,910
Okay.

543
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:37,240
That fucking interview that Kurt Loder
does with them and he's literally like,

544
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,480
he looks like superman sitting
next to fucking Kryptonite.

545
00:33:40,481 --> 00:33:42,850
Like that's how much he's
like folded over himself.

546
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,490
Like he didn't want to
answer any of the questions.

547
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:48,790
Like it was literally having a
physical reaction to somebody,

548
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,320
ask him questions like,
Hey man,

549
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:53,050
you're selling a bunch of albums that's
gotta feel good. Right. And he was like,

550
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,320
Hey, it is, I don't even know how
to fucking, you know what I mean?

551
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:01,120
All of a sudden he had like the
fucking posture, Fiona Apple.

552
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:08,530
There were a bunch of fragile people,
but in the middle of all of that,

553
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:14,800
in the middle of all of that was fucking
Chris Cornell still belted out like a

554
00:34:15,021 --> 00:34:15,854
fucking,

555
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:17,230
yeah.

556
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,900
I Dunno.
My version of what a rock star is,

557
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:25,060
didn't go out there wearing a granny
sweater trying to act like he was somebody

558
00:34:25,061 --> 00:34:29,380
in the crowd. It's like, no, you're
better than me. Be better than me.

559
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:34,090
I don't want to see me up there.
Be a fucking God.

560
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,833
MMM.

561
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:37,530
I don't know.

562
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:41,400
And I just thought Chris Cornell had
the goods when it came to that and uh,

563
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,860
it made me go,
I don't know,

564
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:48,600
I just didn't listen to a lot of
music right around that, that era.

565
00:34:48,601 --> 00:34:52,170
And I've always known it. I
make fun of Nevada. I know
there a great bandage. Shit.

566
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:55,140
I know they are. I just, it's just fun.

567
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:58,500
They're fun to make fun of
because everyone's always like,

568
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,780
and did that album came out,

569
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,530
I knew that music as I
knew it had now changed,

570
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,760
which is complete horseshit. There was
a few people that knew most of us did,

571
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:11,760
like, who's this new band? And then all
of a sudden it was this other new band.

572
00:35:11,761 --> 00:35:16,050
And that was just like all of a sudden
MTV decided that they were going to just

573
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,490
like,
this was the new shit.

574
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:21,090
And they just started spooning it into
our mouths and we fucking hate it. I mean,

575
00:35:21,091 --> 00:35:26,030
that's basically what happened.
I was more than willing

576
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:27,530
yeah.

577
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:30,200
To watch all those same bands
I had been listening to keep,

578
00:35:30,201 --> 00:35:32,660
continue to put out albums.
I didn't have a fucking problem.

579
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:36,800
You know what it was MTV was done with me.
And uh,

580
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,420
that was the first time I really felt old.

581
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,220
I was 23 years old and I was just
like, yeah, that stayed. They don't,

582
00:35:41,221 --> 00:35:43,740
I'm done as far in their head.

583
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:47,310
I'm already married with two fucking
kids and they can't squeeze a dime out of

584
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:50,250
my pockets, so fuck this guy. Right.

585
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,200
And then it was smashing Pumpkins,
you know,

586
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,220
I dunno.

587
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:00,120
But Soundgarden was always one where I
didn't have to make the leap of like,

588
00:36:00,121 --> 00:36:03,360
okay, this is this new shit. I just
kind of sounds a little different.

589
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:09,270
Like I absolutely fucking love that
band and love all the odd time stuff.

590
00:36:09,271 --> 00:36:14,040
I love all of this shit and it's just
a fucking shame. It's a fucking shame.

591
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,560
But you know something,
if you want to watch something uplifting,

592
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:20,520
I'm going to post. Um, skid
row was Sebastian Bach,

593
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:25,530
absolutely fucking murdering
monkey business. And uh,

594
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,530
I love to, in the end when he, he,

595
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:32,620
after you've just fucking destroys one
of the greatest live voices underrated of

596
00:36:34,451 --> 00:36:35,400
all fucking time.

597
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:40,670
Then he was like funny in the end after
like doing those high fucking heavy

598
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:46,260
metals screams all the way
down to the growl and then
the end, he's just like, oh,

599
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:48,780
thank you very much.
He just feels like this weird voice.

600
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:57,700
Ah, it was awesome. So anyways, rest
in peace, Chris Cornell. And, um,

601
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:02,420
I dunno, I dunno what else to say. I'm
so fucking sick of having to say that,

602
00:37:02,421 --> 00:37:05,450
but I guess that's a part of getting old.
Um,

603
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,690
which is something I had to actually
talk to you about that talk to you guys

604
00:37:08,691 --> 00:37:09,381
about that.
You know,

605
00:37:09,381 --> 00:37:11,480
like that thing where you just want
to be on to live to be a hundred.

606
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:15,320
It's like part of living to be 100 is
you're going to bury all your friends,

607
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:16,940
you know,

608
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:20,600
and if you're really start looking at
your friends and if you're remotely taken

609
00:37:20,601 --> 00:37:23,930
care of yourself,
you know which ones are going to go,

610
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:25,881
I hate to say it,

611
00:37:25,881 --> 00:37:30,260
but you do that fucking guy eating the
burgers and the fries and the fucking

612
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,710
just putting on another 10 every year.

613
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:37,340
Every year the Christmas sweater
gets a little bit bigger, right?

614
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,110
Yeah.

615
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:42,450
Till the next day you wandered around
ordering people around wearing the fucking

616
00:37:42,451 --> 00:37:46,710
airplane blanket through the fucking
terminal area. Yeah. Like that guy,

617
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,600
that guy I saw that guy's
not gonna be around long.

618
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:52,470
It's not gonna be around long.
You know what I mean?

619
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,310
I think that restless leg
syndrome that he had going on,

620
00:37:56,311 --> 00:37:59,880
that was his heart screaming for help.
You know,

621
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:02,670
I've given them enough chest pains.
He is not listening to me.

622
00:38:02,671 --> 00:38:07,671
Can Somebody for the love of God slap
the fuck twinkie out of this guy's mouth

623
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:10,350
out. Jesus felt, why do you gotta
be me? All right. So anyways,

624
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:14,370
I got Winnipeg tonight than Saskatoon,

625
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:19,050
the Paris of the prairies.
And then I got fucking uh,

626
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:22,080
Regina and I would not do one vagina joke.

627
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,490
I did one of the podcast just cause
you know, you gotta do one taught city,

628
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,110
you have rip city,

629
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:32,310
you got the twin city and you
got to watch city and that's it.

630
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:36,370
So now it not that this is
going to be some nerdy shit.

631
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:40,480
This isn't even the podcast right
now. Here we go. Hang on one second.

632
00:38:40,481 --> 00:38:45,100

Did I ever get the Edmonton fans and
shout out to sing the national anthem.

635
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,800
Oh, come on. Why does it
always go to Wikipedia? Now.

636
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,760
I don't need to know
what a map of Kennedy is.

637
00:38:59,761 --> 00:39:04,020
I need to fucking see one map of Canada,

make the fucking map bigger.

642
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:25,060
I want to see a map of Canada.

643
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:32,750
This is it. All right. Yeah, I have
been to with this fucking trip.

644
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:38,240
As far as the southern portion,

I Bet I went to the maritimes.
I came in with a fuck.

651
00:39:59,451 --> 00:40:03,830
I went something to Nova Scotia, New
Brunswick. I know I went to New Brunswick,

652
00:40:03,831 --> 00:40:04,880
maybe not Nova Scotia.

653
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,650
Um,
I dunno.

654
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:14,140
I've been to fucking hammered
town. I've been to London, Ontario.

655
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,770
I mean, I think yellow knife is
next. That's where I got to go next.

656
00:40:19,771 --> 00:40:21,600
I should all start in Alaska.

657
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,920
I'll do something in the
Yukon territory with the FEC.

661
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,900
this was the last province that I
needed to go on the southern southern

662
00:40:41,901 --> 00:40:44,480
hemisphere. What the fuck is

663
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:47,150
Had Saskatoon in my head. All
right. That was complete filler.

664
00:40:47,151 --> 00:40:48,140
I don't know why I just did that.

665
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:51,710
That was your breakfast potatoes

00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:43,610
And this is the third attempt at trying
to be even remotely and musing on the

678
00:45:43,611 --> 00:45:48,260
thing. It's like the thick time. I've
tried to start doing this podcast.

What's going on? It's Belper

00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:38,300

welcome. Welcome. If you're new to it.
I do one of these every single Monday.

692
00:46:42,921 --> 00:46:44,950
I answered questions.
People email me.

693
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:49,700
[inaudible] is that [inaudible] people
send me in there a underrated overrated

694
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:53,450
list. Things that they feel
are underrated, things that
they feel are overrated.

695
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:58,100
Hey, what's going on? This
is so far, and this is, uh,

696
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,890
this is the Monday morning podcast.
This is the official one.

697
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:14,320
You see? You see, that's what
I was trying to do last week.

698
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,570
That's what I was trying to do.

699
00:47:16,571 --> 00:47:20,680
I was trying to slip in the
MP three of the week there.

700
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:25,240
That's what I was trying to do there. Did
you enjoy it? Was it a little bit long?

701
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:28,960
Did my edits sock?
I'm sure it did and I'm,

702
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:34,180
I'll get emails from people because
that's what the web is really all about.

703
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:37,990
It's not about connecting
with other people.

704
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:43,170
It's about having the ability to tell
somebody that they fucking suck when

705
00:47:44,741 --> 00:47:49,210
they're just sitting there
in their underwear eating a
bowl of fucking we checks,

706
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:52,360
you know, that's how my day
starts. Every fucking day.

707
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:56,380
Every day I get up and a while.

708
00:47:56,381 --> 00:48:00,790
I take my dog for a walk now, which
is fucking awesome. I do that.

709
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:05,080
But then, uh, wait a minute, don't I?
I probably do go on my space first.

710
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,110
That's how pathetic I am.
That's how pathetic I am.

711
00:48:08,111 --> 00:48:12,420
I will literally get on my space and a,

712
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,080
I checked out a couple emails,

713
00:48:14,081 --> 00:48:17,890
a couple of comments on whatever
shows I've done something.

714
00:48:17,891 --> 00:48:20,470
You saw me on some fucking
picture I put up in.

715
00:48:20,471 --> 00:48:23,910
There's always somebody breaking
my balls over there. And uh,

716
00:48:23,911 --> 00:48:26,620
that's what the Internet is.
That's what the Internet is.

717
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:32,100
It's a bunch of punk spirit able to
heckle people without being able to get

718
00:48:32,801 --> 00:48:36,610
trashed back. You know,
but I'm guilty of it too.

719
00:48:36,611 --> 00:48:39,130
So what the fuck am I going to
do? All right. It's bill bird,

720
00:48:39,131 --> 00:48:42,360
some Monday morning podcast if you
didn't know that from the beginning. Uh,

721
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:43,121
the opening there,

722
00:48:43,121 --> 00:48:47,170
that's a new thing I'm going to
try to be doing is a MP3 the week.

723
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,540
I don't know if I'm going to do it
every week cause I really, you know,

724
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,820
I already deal with all the
questions you guys send me,

725
00:48:51,821 --> 00:48:56,290
which really krump clogs
up my email folders and uh,

726
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:59,200
but you know, every once in
a while, sorry, you know,
if you've got a cool idea,

727
00:48:59,201 --> 00:49:03,070
send it in. If it's something I can use
on the podcast, I'll definitely do it.

728
00:49:03,071 --> 00:49:07,540
But I gotta admit I'm kind of nervous
about getting a fucking, uh, a virus,

729
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:12,040
you know, listening to all that audio, you
know, you're not supposed to open shit,

730
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:16,710
so I don't want to, I don't
want to do that, you know,
so I don't even know where,

731
00:49:16,711 --> 00:49:19,810
I just fucking told you there and I'm
sure there's people out there right now.

732
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:23,640
Oh, you're worried about
getting a virus open it all,

733
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:25,430
you OpenNotes somebody g mail.

734
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:28,440
Are you that fucking stupid?

735
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:32,310
That's another thing I like about the
Internet is when you've just asked people

736
00:49:32,311 --> 00:49:37,050
for fucking help that nobody can, you
know, some people can help you out,

737
00:49:37,051 --> 00:49:38,670
but so many people on the internet,

738
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:43,860
their way of helping you out is to give
you information while calling you a

739
00:49:43,861 --> 00:49:44,940
fucking moron,

740
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:49,950
which is why this week on the
Monday morning part podcast,

741
00:49:49,951 --> 00:49:53,070
if you are fans of this, you know
that I have douche bag of the week,

742
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:58,300
but there were so many douche bags
this week. I almost have to, I, I,

743
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:03,150
I almost was like con to the week.
I almost had to bump it up,

744
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:04,013
you know what I mean?

745
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:08,610
But I stopped short of that out of respect
for some of the female listeners out

746
00:50:08,611 --> 00:50:13,260
there. So I'm going with Douche bags
of the week. That's plural. All right,

747
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:17,190
this is it. It's the last
week, if you, if you listened.

748
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,810
I did get a dog and a,

749
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:25,410
I've never had a dog before and I was
having issues because, uh, whatever,

750
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:28,070
listen to last week's podcast,
I don't have to fucking get into it,

751
00:50:28,071 --> 00:50:32,870
but we had a specialist come over here
to find out what the dog's problem was.

752
00:50:32,871 --> 00:50:37,370
And evidently it has
separation anxiety because, um,

753
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:39,260
it's a perfect fucking dog.

754
00:50:39,261 --> 00:50:42,350
It doesn't launch after our other
dogs doesn't go at lunch after people.

755
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:46,130
It's fucking mellow. It just chills
out. But if you leave it alone,

756
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:51,860
it like freaks, you know, or if it
anticipates that you're leaving it alone,

757
00:50:51,861 --> 00:50:55,610
it starts like shaking uncontrollably
and it starts drooling,

758
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:58,940
which are all signs, I guess,
of this separation anxiety.

759
00:50:58,941 --> 00:51:03,941
So evidently it's this four week fucking
process that I have to go through.

760
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:06,920
But I totally love the dog now,
so I don't give a fuck.

761
00:51:06,921 --> 00:51:11,600
I literally canceled gigs to make
sure this dog is cool. And, um,

762
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:14,090
it's,
it's a long story.

763
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:18,320
If you want to know what you gotta
do is basically what I've learned is,

764
00:51:18,321 --> 00:51:23,321
is there's certain triggers that the dog
has that sets it off to freaking out.

765
00:51:24,051 --> 00:51:26,720
Like you're grabbing your keys
and here's the sound of your keys.

766
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,850
Or maybe you turn the shower on,

767
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:33,020
or your girlfriend starts blow
drying her hair or whatever.

768
00:51:33,021 --> 00:51:36,530
Just things like that starts at,
you know, starts looking at you,

769
00:51:36,531 --> 00:51:38,900
and then you put your shoes on,
you put your coat on and all,

770
00:51:38,901 --> 00:51:42,500
and all it associates that shit with is,
Oh fuck,

771
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:47,360
I'm being abandoned again. And
you know, I don't fucking know.

772
00:51:47,361 --> 00:51:48,590
I don't write the books.

773
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:52,100
I don't have the ability to actually
know what a dog is thinking.

774
00:51:52,101 --> 00:51:53,150
But I'm imagining,

775
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:57,590
considering that this dog was
just left by the La River,

776
00:51:57,591 --> 00:52:00,050
can you believe that someone didn't
even bring it to the shelter?

777
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:04,610
They just opened their car
door or whatever and just
left it out there. You know,

778
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,330
like, I don't know what the fuck at
eight kills me, kills me every time.

779
00:52:08,331 --> 00:52:11,180
I think that someone
would do that. But, um,

780
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:16,100
so I guess that that's where this
dog's mind goes mentally. So, uh,

781
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,860
we have to fucking deconditioned.
You've got to figure out what it's an,

782
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,940
the very first trigger is,

783
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:26,960
and then you work your way through all
of them and you just do one trigger,

784
00:52:26,961 --> 00:52:31,040
like pick up your keys, sort of walk
around with them as you're given it.

785
00:52:31,041 --> 00:52:33,860
This food. I don't even, I just
read the fucking book. It's,

786
00:52:33,861 --> 00:52:38,060
it's a long goddamn process,
but I'm going to work through it.

787
00:52:38,061 --> 00:52:41,110
So that's basically what you're supposed
to do in a nutshell. I'm really,

788
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:41,750
and you know what I mean?

789
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:44,450
Do you ever just read something on the
Internet and then you try to fucking talk

790
00:52:44,451 --> 00:52:46,070
about it? Like, you know
what you're talking about?

791
00:52:46,071 --> 00:52:50,660
That's what that last couple
of minutes was, but it's,
it's, you know, I'm fucking,

792
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:53,090
I'm, I'm learning about this
stuff and I'm gonna, you know,

793
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,470
I'm going to do what I gotta do,

794
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:57,350
but basically I have been
held captive with this dog.

795
00:52:57,351 --> 00:53:00,110
I've been with this fucking
dog for the last, uh,

796
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:04,370
five days in a row other than when I go
out to do sets. But then my girls here,

797
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:05,870
when we just make sure
we don't leave it alone,

798
00:53:05,871 --> 00:53:10,310
so it doesn't freak out as we
learn how to diffuse. It's problem.

799
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:11,743
Okay.

800
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:15,800
So last week I was asking people if they
have any ideas cause I went to put the

801
00:53:15,801 --> 00:53:19,100
thing in a cage, which was a stupid
fucking thing to do. I just didn't,

802
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:22,580
I was ignorant. I didn't know. I
didn't know what the dog's problem was.

803
00:53:22,581 --> 00:53:26,490
I didn't know how to introduce a cage to
a dog who's gone through the stuff that

804
00:53:26,491 --> 00:53:29,370
my dog's gone through. So, you
know, I made a rookie mistake,

805
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,000
so I was reaching out to
my podcast listeners and a,

806
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:35,940
these are some of the
emails. I got a bill. Uh,

807
00:53:35,941 --> 00:53:40,380
I've always been in a household with
dogs since I was born and I've never had

808
00:53:40,381 --> 00:53:44,670
any of those fucking small female
dogs like a Chihuahua. I mean,

809
00:53:44,671 --> 00:53:49,500
I had big male dogs, German shepherds,
Husky labs, that type of stuff.

810
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:54,930
And uh, one of my dogs has broken
out of his cage before. However,

811
00:53:55,110 --> 00:54:00,110
you must not know how to
train a dog because mine
never fucked up the house even

812
00:54:00,331 --> 00:54:01,230
when he was young.

813
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:06,450
Dogs are so rowdy and hard to
handle when they are young,

814
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:09,960
they are hyper and they need
lots of attention. By the way,

815
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:15,110
you really shouldn't have a dog if
someone can't be home with it most of the

816
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:19,380
day. Now, I don't know about you
guys. I'm stopping halfway through,

817
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:23,970
but that was just packed with
information that I didn't know. Really.

818
00:54:23,971 --> 00:54:27,570
I shouldn't have a dog if someone
can't be home with it most of the day.

819
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:31,500
I had no idea. You know, I
thought I could just get a dog,

820
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:36,060
stick them on the roof of my fucking
apartment and leave for seven days.

821
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:40,980
I figured maybe it'll rain,
you know, and they don't,

822
00:54:40,981 --> 00:54:44,190
don't they store water in their
bodies like fucking camels.

823
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:47,960
I have no idea what a fucking douchebag.

824
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,110
He's already a Douche bag.
And then he has the balls,

825
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:57,710
the fucking ego wrapped around his balls
to write another paragraph of obvious

826
00:54:58,831 --> 00:55:03,480
shit. Here we go. Everybody. Here we go.
I've you got a three year olds out there.

827
00:55:03,481 --> 00:55:06,240
Maybe they want to listen to the rest of
this for this fucking information here.

828
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:08,610
Here's what this fucking Einstein says.
The residence,

829
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:12,450
you have to give it affection.
It's like a baby.

830
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:17,550
She except you don't have to send it to
college. Now. He didn't say that part.

831
00:55:17,551 --> 00:55:19,860
All right. Uh, she just wants attention.

832
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:25,050
She needs to be walked
and petted and played with
everyday. That's right. Petted.

833
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,190
This is the guy that thinks
I'm a fucking morning. Um,

834
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:31,800
how often do you walk her and
pet her and pet her daily?

835
00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:35,910
Were you drunk when you take this? You
already said pet aid in the other thing.

836
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:41,040
Anyways, he says, guess what? You do
have to fucking build up the trust of,

837
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:43,800
or the dog isn't going to obey you

838
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:47,430
as that.

839
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:51,420
That right there in a nutshell is how
people give advice on the Internet.

840
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:56,040
Guess what?
Hey fuck head like that whole vibe.

841
00:55:57,030 --> 00:56:00,600
It just blows my mind why someone
can't be like, oh, hey, I got a dog.

842
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,510
This is the stuff I went through
and this is kind of what I tried.

843
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:07,530
Hope it works every he's got,
everybody's got, not everybody,

844
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:12,390
but so many people came at me like I
couldn't believe it. So anyways, he says,

845
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:13,583
guess worth.

846
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,750
You do have to fucking build up trust
or the dog isn't going to obey you.

847
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:23,130
Really, really? I had no idea.

848
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:27,130
I thought I was like fucking Tarzan.

849
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:31,660
I could just start communicating on a
fucking doctor Doolittle. What an asshole.

850
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:35,800
Your asshole Douche bag and con to the
week and I haven't even finished your

851
00:56:35,801 --> 00:56:40,450
fucking email. All right,
I'm continuing. Um,

852
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,900
all right. What the fuck? Why
can't we get through this sentence?

853
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:45,280
Guess what your blah, blah, blah.

854
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:50,110
And she's going to find every way she can
to break loose when she's confined and

855
00:56:50,111 --> 00:56:52,870
you're not home.
My lab is 13 years old,

856
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:56,740
but he still needs to
play and be petted it.

857
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:02,020
Is it petted? It needs
to be pet you dumb. Fuck.

858
00:57:02,021 --> 00:57:05,530
That's not even a word. Hey
fuck head. Now I'm doing it.

859
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,410
I'm just pissed because you
coming at me like this. You can't.

860
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:11,860
I just asked you for advice,
you know,

861
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,820
thank God you don't teach kids anyways.
Uh,

862
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:18,310
if yours is whimpering at night,

863
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:23,080
it's most likely she didn't get
much interaction. Feels lonely.

864
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:28,120
Three e's and fields. By the way, I
don't think you should have a dog bill.

865
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:32,710
Really? I don't think you should have a
computer. What do you think about that?

866
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:35,050
How about that? Fuck head. I don't
think you should have a queue.

867
00:57:35,051 --> 00:57:37,810
You shove a fucking computer screen,
but not a keyboard.

868
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:43,210
Maybe a secretary. I learned
nothing in that. All right.

869
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:45,580
First of all,
Douche bag of the week.

870
00:57:45,581 --> 00:57:50,581
Why would you think that you could even
begin to analyze what is wrong with this

871
00:57:51,251 --> 00:57:52,570
dog without ever meeting it?

872
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:57,550
You're basically super imposing the
dogs you had in your life over this dog.

873
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:02,470
Did any of the dogs you have get left by
a fucking river for God knows how many

874
00:58:02,471 --> 00:58:06,710
fucking days now you know it was just
going to make it up. Well, yes judge.

875
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,310
My Labrador was loved by a phone.

876
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,890
Ah. Do dogs need attention?
Do you understand? I mean,

877
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:16,900
I guess because I didn't explain it.
You've got to understand,

878
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,900
I've been giving this dog
so much attention. It's,

879
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:23,020
it's affecting my relationship
with my girlfriend,

880
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:29,260
okay? She has all she can do
to get me to cuddle with her,

881
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:30,440
but I have literally been late.

882
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:35,170
I can't walk to the fridge without laying
down on the floor with that fucking

883
00:58:35,171 --> 00:58:39,370
dog and telling them how awesome it
is for like 20 minutes every time.

884
00:58:39,371 --> 00:58:42,580
I'm not getting anything done a right?
You fucking moron. I've had dogs.

885
00:58:42,581 --> 00:58:47,530
I also grew up with dogs. I was
just asking for help. All right?

886
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:52,260
You can't stop acting like everyone in my
family, Jesus Christ. You know what? I,

887
00:58:52,261 --> 00:58:55,480
I feel so much better about my family.
Some of these fucking emails.

888
00:58:56,410 --> 00:58:59,110
I didn't want it. I don't want
to be angry. Look at this.
What this is doing to me.

889
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:04,060
All right, here's the second douche
bag of the week. He'll ever contests.

890
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:07,180
Which one of these two people do you
think is a bigger douche bag this week or

891
00:59:07,181 --> 00:59:10,930
are they both? Cons. All right, here we
go. There's a second email. First off,

892
00:59:10,931 --> 00:59:14,670
I really enjoy your comedy and your
Monday morning podcast when you don't tart

893
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:19,330
out and post it on time.
That part doesn't even make sense.

894
00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:21,140
So you enjoy it.

895
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:26,510
When I don't tart out and post
it on time, I don't get the, Oh,

896
00:59:26,511 --> 00:59:29,990
when I don't tart out, when I'm not a
moron, and I posted it on time. Okay,

897
00:59:29,991 --> 00:59:33,380
maybe that's me. All right, second.
So he starts off nice or she,

898
00:59:33,381 --> 00:59:38,030
I don't even know the fuck wrote this
second, try not using a fucking cage

899
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:40,533
addenda.

900
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:48,310
I swear to God and adult wrote their
second try not using a fucking cage,

901
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:52,130
a Duh.
Now,

902
00:59:52,131 --> 00:59:55,580
why would you think the reader at
this point would remotely give off?

903
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:58,940
You could be telling me how to
win $1 million in this paragraph.

904
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:01,850
The second you come at me,
this condescendingly I'm not,

905
01:00:01,851 --> 01:00:05,540
I don't give a fuck what you have to say,
but for the sake of my listeners,

906
01:00:05,541 --> 01:00:09,200
I'm going to read the rest of
this. All right? You fucking,

907
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,660
I need a new cord for Conti.
There's so many cons this week.

908
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:19,190
All right, let's start over
again with that sentence. Second,

909
01:00:19,191 --> 01:00:21,650
try not using a fucking cage.
A De,

910
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:26,150
as long as you keep small objects in
and your trash away from the dogs reach,

911
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:30,650
you can get the dog to pass out. Most
of the time you're away. Once again,

912
01:00:30,651 --> 01:00:32,810
here's a guy,
has no idea what I'm dealing with,

913
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:37,190
and he completely writes off cages.
You know,

914
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:40,250
all these people you see at the airport
where the dogs in one of those fucking

915
01:00:40,251 --> 01:00:43,700
cages and they don't have a problem with
it because they introduced the cage in

916
01:00:43,701 --> 01:00:47,690
a proper way rather than the stupid way
that I did it at the pet store where I

917
01:00:47,691 --> 01:00:52,520
tried to figure out if the dog could fit
into it by pushing it by headfirst as

918
01:00:52,521 --> 01:00:56,900
I'm pushing its ass as it's using all
its pit bull muscle on the linoleum to be

919
01:00:56,901 --> 01:01:01,460
like, Eh, don't feel like going
in there. You know, whatever.

920
01:01:01,461 --> 01:01:04,320
I'm not good with spatial relations.
I did what I had to do. Um,

921
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:11,280
okay, let's continue. Um, as we,

922
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:14,690
the first week of trying to
figure out the new section,

923
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:17,150
who's a bigger Douche bag? All right.
Let me read the rest of this year.

924
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:22,280
I'm finding a proper dog toy is necessary
but avoid anything that can be eaten

925
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:25,500
and salivated on
Dash Rawhides.

926
01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:30,440
Now there's almost some information so I
know I don't need raw hides and I don't

927
01:01:30,441 --> 01:01:33,950
know why he's a, he hasn't really told
me why, but I guess I just avoid those.

928
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:39,410
Um, this is like getting sex
education in like the forties,

929
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,480
you know when no one could fucking talk
about it. This is brutal. All right.

930
01:01:44,481 --> 01:01:49,481
Instead of all that time you wasted
teaching the dog to be comfortable in an

931
01:01:49,671 --> 01:01:53,180
incompatible place, an uncomfortable
place. He's talking about the cage.

932
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:56,750
You could have been teaching
it to behave in the household.

933
01:01:57,170 --> 01:02:00,890
Really? Oh, I had no idea.

934
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:05,780
It's not like I walked in into the fucking
apartment and just shoved it into a

935
01:02:05,781 --> 01:02:10,580
cage. You fucking idiot. I had it on the
leash. I walked at all around the house.

936
01:02:10,581 --> 01:02:14,360
Everything was going great, everything
was going great, and then it had some bad,

937
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:16,070
had bad experiences with the cages,

938
01:02:16,071 --> 01:02:20,250
and then it won't go in the room where
the cage was because it had a bad

939
01:02:20,251 --> 01:02:24,270
experience in there. Jesus, fuck, I
don't, I'm sick of these dog whisperer.

940
01:02:24,271 --> 01:02:26,750
People Watch fucking 10 episodes
and then they think they can,

941
01:02:26,751 --> 01:02:30,420
they can like fucking put their
hand on top of your dog and cure it.

942
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:32,390
I don't know,
not that you care,

943
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:36,430
but my friend of 10 years has had
two pit bulls in a house area,

944
01:02:36,431 --> 01:02:40,170
smaller than my one bedroom apartment
and it doesn't destroy anything that you

945
01:02:40,171 --> 01:02:45,171
don't allow it to destroy for every
failed attempt of taking a dog in a dog,

946
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:50,490
there is a flunky of an owner. Evidently
that's me. You don't even have kids.

947
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:53,850
You can definitely do this bill.
See that's positive.

948
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:59,520
Have patients and understanding and that
dog will give you unconditional love

949
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:02,250
for many years. All right.
You know this guy is like,

950
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:07,110
this is like a battered wife fucking
email. He starts off nice. Sucks me in.

951
01:03:07,111 --> 01:03:10,380
First off, I really enjoy your comedy
Monday morning podcast. I'm like, yeah,

952
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:14,010
you have really, as I'm sticking my chin
out, then he gives me a fucking uppercut.

953
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:19,020
Try not use in a fucking cage. Uh
Duh. Right. And then he trashes me,

954
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:23,550
basically eludes to the fact that I'm a
flunky, maybe a flunky owner. I Dunno.

955
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:26,760
And then they start stroking my head
when I, and I'm like, you know what?

956
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:29,880
I'm out of this relationship.
I'm going back home to my father.

957
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:32,040
I don't need this anymore.
And then he says,

958
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:35,190
now they'll have patients and
understanding the dark, you know,

959
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,890
you're beautiful and
you're little Dickie shorts

960
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:44,910
anyways. You know something, you animal
lovers, you're out of your fucking minds.

961
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:45,691
That's all I can say.

962
01:03:45,691 --> 01:03:49,620
You got more goddamn passion for animals
than you do for losing your fucking

963
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,880
conveniences in this country.
You know what I mean?

964
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:58,140
They'll fucking stand there and continue
to pay $15 for their first fucking bag.

965
01:03:58,260 --> 01:03:59,970
Even though the price
of gas has come down.

966
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:03,510
You can never get them to sign a
fucking petition. But Jesus Christ,

967
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:07,590
if somebody throws an errant frisbee and
it hits a fucking shower in the side of

968
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:11,680
his fucking leg, though, we hate,
there'll be fucking making soccer.

969
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:13,060
We have people with signs.
If I have,

970
01:04:13,061 --> 01:04:18,061
if somebody from the goddamn animal
shelter ever heard my last podcast,

971
01:04:18,091 --> 01:04:23,040
I probably have protestors outside
my next funnybone Gig. So anyways,

972
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:23,350
uh,

973
01:04:23,350 --> 01:04:28,350
I want to thank everyone who actually
sent me advice trying to help me out.

974
01:04:28,470 --> 01:04:31,770
Okay. I'm not a bad dog owner. Okay.

975
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:36,240
I just didn't understand what the dog was
going through. Okay. And it's, you know,

976
01:04:36,241 --> 01:04:37,380
it's had to,

977
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:42,120
it had three really traumatic events
since I've had it just out of my own

978
01:04:42,121 --> 01:04:43,290
ignorance.
Okay.

979
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:47,880
I put it in two different cages because
I didn't understand why it was clogging

980
01:04:47,881 --> 01:04:52,230
up my apartment. I just thought it
was doing what dogs do, you know.

981
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,930
And once again,
I didn't fucking decide to get a dog.

982
01:04:54,931 --> 01:04:58,530
My girlfriend just brought this thing
home. So we add our lives to lead.

983
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:02,100
So that was a horrific experience.
And one day when we left,

984
01:05:02,101 --> 01:05:06,420
we love to do it or our balcony open.
And this kills me to say this.

985
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:09,630
It walked out on the balcony and the wind
blew the doors shut and was stuck out

986
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:11,700
there for like 40 minutes.
And when we got there,

987
01:05:11,701 --> 01:05:15,690
it was standing there trembling and
drew, it was fucking, it was horrific.

988
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:20,440
And uh, I, I, you know, I felt
like I didn't deserve a dog.

989
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:23,710
Uh, so since then, no,

990
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:28,740
I take it for hikes every day just
to make you fucking dog lovers relax.

991
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:33,880
Okay. I swear to God. All right.
I just watched, I was, you know,

992
01:05:33,881 --> 01:05:35,830
I'm actually doing this,
this podcast by the way,

993
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:39,760
on a Sunday evening here
because I want to make sure I,

994
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:42,460
I was able to edit that thing on
the front and do everything right.

995
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:45,070
So people in the east coast wouldn't
have to wait till the end of the fucking

996
01:05:45,071 --> 01:05:48,460
day to listen to this
thing. But, um, you know,

997
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:52,900
I want to go play drums. I wanted to
play drums for three fucking days,

998
01:05:52,901 --> 01:05:55,240
but I refuse to leave this dog alone.

999
01:05:55,570 --> 01:06:00,570
I refused for this dog to have another
bad experience due to me on my watch.

1000
01:06:00,881 --> 01:06:04,660
So all you guys can relax and
if you want to give me advice,

1001
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:08,710
give me advice. But I don't need
advice that begins with hey shit,

1002
01:06:08,711 --> 01:06:13,390
Dick or whatever that you know, cause
that really is, you can tell it.

1003
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:18,100
All it does is fucking annoying me, you
know, and I combined that I can, you know,

1004
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:22,090
I thought I had a great week. You
know, I gave you guys a podcast.

1005
01:06:22,091 --> 01:06:26,500
I put a new video up on my myspace
page and on my youtube page,

1006
01:06:26,501 --> 01:06:30,550
by the way,
which I don't have the fucking name for,

1007
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,550
I forget the name of it,
but a, I put it up there.

1008
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:38,470
I put up like fucking 30 new photos.
What else did I do?

1009
01:06:38,471 --> 01:06:41,020
So that was a video.
I gave you a podcast,

1010
01:06:41,590 --> 01:06:46,390
I gave you new pictures and I've been
pulled. I blogged all week for the NHL.

1011
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:50,650
You know, by the way, congratulations
to the Carolina hurricanes.

1012
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:54,340
He has sons of bitches a
best for checking. I've,

1013
01:06:54,341 --> 01:06:57,970
I've seen on a hockey team and a
long fucking time. You guys were,

1014
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:58,990
you were phenomenal.

1015
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:02,710
You deserve to wear that and a
good lucks against the penguins.

1016
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:07,510
You sons of bitches and anybody
who took my blog seriously,

1017
01:07:08,410 --> 01:07:12,070
uh, you can go fuck yourself because, uh,

1018
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:16,830
it says in the thing that I'm a comedian.
So if you take my joke seriously, I,

1019
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:19,780
I can't, I can't help you. You know,

1020
01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:23,880
you know what I mean?
I,

1021
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:28,060
I'm trying to fucking come up
with an analogy here. You know,

1022
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:31,630
I don't expect the Weatherman to be funny,
you know,

1023
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:34,330
and I don't expect the comedian
to be seriously serious.

1024
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:37,660
So if they write something fucked
up that obviously the joking,

1025
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:43,150
so all those references I made
you guys not having shoes and

1026
01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:51,790
in play and washboards and tubs in
the stands and fucking, you know,

1027
01:07:51,791 --> 01:07:54,550
not being real hockey fans
cause you're from down south.

1028
01:07:54,551 --> 01:07:56,410
If you took any of that seriously,

1029
01:07:56,950 --> 01:08:01,210
then you really are the moron that I
was jokingly saying that you were. Okay.

1030
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:04,870
You know why I was referring to you
as the Hartford whalers. All right.

1031
01:08:04,871 --> 01:08:08,710
I was having fun. I was
just talking shit. You know,

1032
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:12,820
unless I say it about Montreal Canadien
fans, that's the only time I mean it,

1033
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:15,230
you know,
but even then I'll give up.

1034
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:19,970
They get a beautiful city with gorgeous
women. Um, all right, so there you go.

1035
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:22,740
So onto the podcast here and I'm,

1036
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:25,550
I'm basically going to be reading a
bunch of shit that I read last week but

1037
01:08:25,551 --> 01:08:28,220
wasn't able to, uh, to update and

1038
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:30,113
uh,

1039
01:08:30,990 --> 01:08:34,650
where the fuck am I? Uh, what are we
going to do here? What am I get to? Uh,

1040
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:38,220
some of the things that I asked am
I my podcast a couple of weeks ago,

1041
01:08:38,221 --> 01:08:40,520
I had mentioned a couple
of weeks ago that I was a,

1042
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:45,560
I was flying from New York to a back out
here to la at the height of the swine

1043
01:08:48,301 --> 01:08:49,620
flu epidemic.

1044
01:08:50,110 --> 01:08:52,330
No, but that one, you know,

1045
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:56,900
the devastation, bring out your dead,
you know, nothing fucking happened.

1046
01:08:56,901 --> 01:09:00,290
But anyways, I get on the plane or
I'm waiting to get on the plane.

1047
01:09:00,291 --> 01:09:02,570
I sit in the terminal and I noticed that,
you know,

1048
01:09:02,690 --> 01:09:06,080
there's a couple of hundred people
there waiting to get on the plane and 15

1049
01:09:06,081 --> 01:09:11,081
people are wearing those surgical masks
and all 15 were Asian and there was no,

1050
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:16,100
nobody else have any race was wearing
the mask. So I was like, what the fuck?

1051
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:21,040
Why are they the only ones wearing mass?
And somebody actually sent me a,

1052
01:09:21,041 --> 01:09:25,490
an interesting observation, I don't know
if this is true or not, but they said,

1053
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:29,060
hey bill, you asked about the agents
wearing the mass. I may have an answer.

1054
01:09:29,870 --> 01:09:30,710
As person says,

1055
01:09:30,711 --> 01:09:34,490
I was over in Japan last year and notice
that I would see people wearing those

1056
01:09:34,491 --> 01:09:35,840
masks everywhere I went.

1057
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:40,010
So I asked somebody in mind who lives
there and he said that because everyone is

1058
01:09:40,011 --> 01:09:44,660
so jam packed up to their eyeballs
and people basically they're in close

1059
01:09:44,661 --> 01:09:49,340
proximity. Uh, they were there,
they were mess because uh,

1060
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:53,120
they wear them. Um, what does
it say? I just lost my place.

1061
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:55,820
They wear them even when
they just have a cold.

1062
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,820
I'm assuming it's just a way
of life to where the mass,

1063
01:09:59,030 --> 01:10:00,890
when you're sick or something,
hope this helps.

1064
01:10:00,891 --> 01:10:05,300
So I guess over there everybody is
so jam packed and I imagine a Co uh,

1065
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:07,760
the common cold would
spread like wildfire.

1066
01:10:07,761 --> 01:10:12,060
So they put those things on. I, I,

1067
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:14,420
I guess that kind of makes sense.
What does that mean?

1068
01:10:14,421 --> 01:10:18,680
All 15 of them has had the common
cold or they all had the bird flu,

1069
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:21,590
you know,
I don't fucking know.

1070
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:23,490
Or maybe they're more educated.

1071
01:10:23,491 --> 01:10:27,030
Evidently their is better over this
somehow what happened to America,

1072
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:32,310
you know what I mean? We were
the shit, we still are the shit.

1073
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:36,480
We're just a bunch of fucking people now
sitting around in cubicles, you know.

1074
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:39,480
Do you guys see some of the pictures of
the great American cars that I put up

1075
01:10:39,481 --> 01:10:43,860
there? Just, you know, I only put up like
three. I want to put up a bunch more. But,

1076
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:47,460
uh, that period, man, I'm
telling you from the 1940s,

1077
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,040
right through the 60s,
you know,

1078
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:54,960
where it was just the heyday of American
cars and the steel industry and all

1079
01:10:54,961 --> 01:10:59,130
that type of shit. We had a
fuck what happened. You know,

1080
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:03,420
what happened at where we can't, we
don't make the best cell phone. We would,

1081
01:11:03,421 --> 01:11:07,750
that should really bother
us, shouldn't it? Whatever.

1082
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:11,170
This fucking, I don't know. It's
really bug. It's really bothering me.

1083
01:11:11,171 --> 01:11:14,520
So I don't know. I really don't
have anything to say about it.

1084
01:11:14,521 --> 01:11:16,170
But if you listen to these last fucking,

1085
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:19,440
if you listened to that pathetic
attempt at social commentary,

1086
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:23,190
maybe you understand why we can't make
a good cell phone or the best one out

1087
01:11:23,191 --> 01:11:25,800
there. And speaking of that, um,

1088
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:30,480
let's talk about computer stuff.
You know, this is the new segment.

1089
01:11:30,481 --> 01:11:33,240
I wish I had a little bit of
theme music out there. You know,

1090
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:35,520
if somebody could write me some,
uh, you're going to learn something,

1091
01:11:35,521 --> 01:11:37,410
theme music and send it as an MP three.

1092
01:11:37,411 --> 01:11:41,010
I'll play it for this part because
this is a new segment here where, um,

1093
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:46,170
you guys are basically teaching me
how not to be a moron with my, uh,

1094
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:50,280
with my computer. And
um, this is something,

1095
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:54,810
last weekend I was bitching about how
people always send me these emails and the

1096
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:57,180
font is really small and hour.

1097
01:11:57,230 --> 01:12:00,390
I already suck at reading out
loud if you haven't noticed yet.

1098
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:04,350
So I was wishing that people would
send it bigger. So someone goes,

1099
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:07,890
well actually this is what you can do
if somebody sends us an email and you

1100
01:12:07,891 --> 01:12:10,200
can't really read it
because the fonts too small,

1101
01:12:10,530 --> 01:12:15,450
all you have to do is hit the
apple command button and the uh,

1102
01:12:15,451 --> 01:12:19,340
the plus side, like you know, two
plus two and you can make the,

1103
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:24,380
you can make the font get bigger or the
apple and the minus sign and you can

1104
01:12:24,601 --> 01:12:27,840
make it get smaller and it even
works on the Internet, you know,

1105
01:12:27,841 --> 01:12:32,760
for like old people you know, that are
trying to find tube eight, you know,

1106
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:36,330
trying to find a two
girls one cup and Kurt,

1107
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:39,960
you want to show [inaudible]
so they hit apple fucking plus.

1108
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:45,300
Wow. How big old people's
keyboards you ever seen that?

1109
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:48,360
Like you ever see like old people's
phones, you ever seen that?

1110
01:12:48,361 --> 01:12:49,500
And like the fucking,

1111
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:54,270
it's like literally the number pad is
as big as like a toddler's hopscotch.

1112
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:58,650
Fucking bored. You know, you
have a see some shit like that.

1113
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:00,750
It just really scares you.
You know,

1114
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:04,050
dying doesn't really scare me
because I really have this belief.

1115
01:13:04,740 --> 01:13:09,150
Like I really believe in that whole thing
that like death is a release and uh,

1116
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:12,780
I'm looking forward to becoming
a fossil fuel. You know, like, I,

1117
01:13:12,781 --> 01:13:17,610
I don't really need to continue this,

1118
01:13:18,330 --> 01:13:22,950
you know, I just, you
know, I think, you know,

1119
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:26,520
live in light live. If you
live a full life, that's
enough. That should be enough.

1120
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:31,380
And then I, then I should
just become a, yeah. Fuel.

1121
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:36,090
Can't think of anything. I don't know.
Moon, dust, whatever the fuck do you know,

1122
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:39,360
just become part of some shit
that other things that are alive.

1123
01:13:39,361 --> 01:13:43,810
Look at what do I got to keep living.
Do you realize the fucking how? Uh,

1124
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,550
Ego maniacal that is,

1125
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:49,010
yeah.

1126
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:53,960
To feel that you're like God like that
you just continue living in this other

1127
01:13:53,961 --> 01:13:56,890
state. I don't understand that.
It's really hard to see that,

1128
01:13:56,891 --> 01:13:59,300
that or you just can't wrap
your head around. Not existing,

1129
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:01,250
which I definitely can't fucking do.

1130
01:14:01,610 --> 01:14:04,790
But the beauty of not
existing as you don't exist,

1131
01:14:04,791 --> 01:14:08,810
so you can't sit there thinking like,
fuck, I don't exist to him anymore.

1132
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:13,330
You just don't exist.
That's it. You know, God,

1133
01:14:13,331 --> 01:14:15,010
I wish I was deep.
That was pathetic.

1134
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:17,110
Just skimming the surface
of a bunch of cool shit.

1135
01:14:17,111 --> 01:14:21,490
And I just have nothing to say
because I don't read. Um, anyways,

1136
01:14:21,491 --> 01:14:23,950
but you ever see that shit?
You ever see some shit where uh,

1137
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:27,160
it just reminds you of like,
you know,

1138
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:30,400
I guess maybe to enjoy living.

1139
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:34,240
I was in a hardware store and no,
I wasn't.

1140
01:14:34,241 --> 01:14:39,241
I was in cvs and I saw a
booster seat for the toilet

1141
01:14:41,650 --> 01:14:46,480
and I was just like, wow. You
know, like that, that is an option.

1142
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:51,840
Like that could possibly happen to me
where I could get so fucking old that I

1143
01:14:54,161 --> 01:14:59,161
have the ability to lower myself
down onto a regulation height,

1144
01:14:59,381 --> 01:15:00,220
toilet seat.

1145
01:15:00,221 --> 01:15:05,221
But I lacked the quad strength to get
my in my legs to get myself back up.

1146
01:15:07,450 --> 01:15:11,260
You know? Gee, I mean, didn't,
well, how do you figure that?

1147
01:15:11,261 --> 01:15:14,290
Does that just happen one day you sit
down and then you just can't fucking get

1148
01:15:14,291 --> 01:15:18,970
up again and then you just have
to fucking, what do you do?

1149
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,690
You got to fucking just sort of lean
over to one side and fall off the toilet.

1150
01:15:23,170 --> 01:15:27,190
Hope there's not a vanity there and
then you just laying there on the tiles.

1151
01:15:27,191 --> 01:15:29,020
You balls are still in the toilet water.

1152
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:34,470
Yeah.

1153
01:15:34,470 --> 01:15:37,020
See what I'm saying? People,
this is my inspirational speech.

1154
01:15:37,110 --> 01:15:41,580
You've got to live life. You gotta live
life. Get a fucking dog. I'm telling you,

1155
01:15:41,581 --> 01:15:44,430
you're such shutdown emotional psychopath.

1156
01:15:44,580 --> 01:15:48,330
I cannot tell you how much
having a dog has helped me.

1157
01:15:48,570 --> 01:15:50,670
And in fucking two weeks
I have in this thing.

1158
01:15:50,910 --> 01:15:55,050
I absolutely unconditionally
fucking love this dog.

1159
01:15:56,010 --> 01:16:00,190
I absolutely fucking love this dog.
And uh,

1160
01:16:00,870 --> 01:16:01,440
I uh,

1161
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:05,040
to the point and take it and you don't
in the exact thing that I was running

1162
01:16:05,041 --> 01:16:06,810
from the reason why I never got a dog,

1163
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:11,820
like the responsibility of having one
and having a walk the fucking thing and

1164
01:16:11,821 --> 01:16:16,500
give it water. And if it takes a shit,
I got to pick it up in a fritos bag.

1165
01:16:16,501 --> 01:16:21,390
You know, and act like I'm walking to my
trash barrel when I'm really going to my

1166
01:16:21,391 --> 01:16:24,930
neighbors, you know, going
through all that bullshit.

1167
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:27,270
That's the thing I think I love the most.

1168
01:16:27,690 --> 01:16:32,690
I actually like that I have a reason
to walk away from having fucking four

1169
01:16:33,511 --> 01:16:38,280
Scotches, you know? Now I
only have three, you know,

1170
01:16:38,281 --> 01:16:41,910
and then I come home half in the bag and
I start screaming at the dog about my

1171
01:16:41,911 --> 01:16:46,150
childhood. You know, it's
a great thing. I don't see,

1172
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:51,330
I don't scream at him like it's his fault.
I just yell at it about my childhood,

1173
01:16:52,620 --> 01:16:54,570
you know? No, I don't do that shit.

1174
01:16:54,571 --> 01:16:58,770
I just like get you animal lovers up in
a fucking, get your panties in a bunch.

1175
01:16:59,630 --> 01:17:04,460
Do you really do that? Why would you too?
It's just a jog. It doesn't understand.

1176
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:09,270
Oh no, but it's, it's, it's been a,

1177
01:17:09,410 --> 01:17:11,210
it's been a great thing to the point.
I'm literally,

1178
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:14,570
I took it to the beach today and uh,

1179
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:16,611
it's fucking hilarious.

1180
01:17:16,611 --> 01:17:21,020
Took it down to the water and this
thing is so goddamn like muscular.

1181
01:17:21,021 --> 01:17:22,130
It's ridiculous.

1182
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:25,220
Like you remember those that you
don't really ever see pumping iron.

1183
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:28,130
Did you ever see that when those
guys that you know that, that,

1184
01:17:28,131 --> 01:17:32,740
that fucking the how Kogan flex where
they, I don't know how to do it.

1185
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:37,430
How the fuck to you without
visually all right, you bring it up,

1186
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:40,040
right? Like in the wrestler,
bring it up. Remember that,

1187
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:42,560
show up the Wii and then
you bring it back down.

1188
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:47,360
You got your two fists meet and right
above your fucking pubes that shot.

1189
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:49,580
Right. You know, fucking
all the muscles papa.

1190
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:51,860
That's what this fucking dog
looks like when it's running.

1191
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:56,360
And it was absolutely terrified of
the water in the ocean. You know,

1192
01:17:57,870 --> 01:18:00,920
like I was trying to get it
to go out where it was just
above its neck, you know,

1193
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:03,770
you know where it's paws
weren't touching the ground.

1194
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:06,230
The tide was really strong and shit.
So it was kind of,

1195
01:18:06,231 --> 01:18:09,230
but we kind of offsetting each other
like counterbalance and each other with

1196
01:18:09,231 --> 01:18:12,200
like the weight of the dog and
me. You know, a couple of times,

1197
01:18:12,201 --> 01:18:16,340
like the waves are like washing over
and he's doing like somersaults and shit

1198
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:20,300
and uh, the thing got so fucking
scared. I'm looking at it like, dude,

1199
01:18:20,301 --> 01:18:24,290
you're a bull. This is pathetic. We're
on Venice beach. People are watching,

1200
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:25,603
you know,

1201
01:18:27,010 --> 01:18:30,130
you know what's funny is people who
are really into animals actually just

1202
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:31,540
believe that fucking story.

1203
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:36,790
They actually believe that I went out
into the ocean with the fucking dog.

1204
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:40,870
I've, I'm terrified of the fucking
ocean. Don't you guys listen to my act?

1205
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:43,690
Haven't you seen any of my past specials?

1206
01:18:44,230 --> 01:18:48,370
I am absolutely fucking terrified
of the ocean. I will not go in it.

1207
01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:52,450
The only way I'll go in and
is if my boat sinks. Okay.

1208
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:57,550
Or if I'm on fire. And even
then, even then, even then,
then what the fuck is that?

1209
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:01,570
Even then I'll just stay in the shadow.
Shallow water can't fucking talk.

1210
01:19:01,571 --> 01:19:05,740
All of a sudden I used to
do a bit in my act, right?

1211
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:09,700
Uh, I love how I just throw these jokes
out cause I'm never going to put them on

1212
01:19:09,701 --> 01:19:10,900
albums or anything like that.

1213
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,900
I used to do this bit in my act where I
was talking about being terrified of the

1214
01:19:13,901 --> 01:19:17,110
ocean. You know, cause I'm
scared of sharks stare.

1215
01:19:17,111 --> 01:19:20,350
I'm scared of getting eaten alive and
drowning at the same time, you know,

1216
01:19:20,351 --> 01:19:24,100
combining, you know, like
splitting aces in a bad way,

1217
01:19:24,370 --> 01:19:28,990
like horrific deaths, you know. So this
guy one time, this is the joke, right?

1218
01:19:28,991 --> 01:19:32,740
He used to eat. This guy
says to me, trying to make me
more relaxed. Wait a minute,

1219
01:19:32,741 --> 01:19:36,830
is my phone ringing? Somebody breaking
my balls at the Celtics lost. Oh,

1220
01:19:37,130 --> 01:19:40,480
says Joe to Rosa. He doesn't give a shit.
He doesn't. You guys want to hear? Oh,

1221
01:19:40,481 --> 01:19:43,600
I got my first phone and call Joe de Rosa.
Hang on a second.

1222
01:19:43,601 --> 01:19:47,380
I'll put them on speaker.
Joe De Rosa. Joe.

1223
01:19:49,510 --> 01:19:53,530
Hey Dude. Hey. Hey. Shut up.
I'm doing my podcast right now.

1224
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:56,673
No,

1225
01:19:57,020 --> 01:19:59,330
I got you on speaker.
So don't say anything fucked up.

1226
01:19:59,331 --> 01:20:02,690
You're going to be on my podcast. Joe De
Rosa from the uninformed show. Everybody

1227
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:11,100
quite some time now with my good friend
Scott here. Okay. And, uh, I kept,

1228
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:15,530
I kept talking about that drum clip where
the guy played like the 64th notes was

1229
01:20:15,860 --> 01:20:17,550
flight. What is that guy's
name? I gotta show it to them.

1230
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:18,730
Oh, Joe. Joe Mayor.

1231
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:24,220
Joe. Joe Man. Yeah. Like
John Mayer. Chip Jojo.

1232
01:20:26,670 --> 01:20:30,680
Uh, no, I, yeah, I don't mind. I Dunno.
I Dunno. Joe and I listen to John Mayer.

1233
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:37,880
Joe, Joe Mayor. Like, like
Brittany Spears now. Um,

1234
01:20:37,910 --> 01:20:41,210
I think it's either within, yeah,
just, just look it up. You'll find it.

1235
01:20:41,211 --> 01:20:45,800
Just write Jo Jo Mayor Bass Drum and
uh, just, just watch what he does.

1236
01:20:46,830 --> 01:20:47,663
All right.

1237
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:50,670
No, I'm going to, I'm going to watch
what he does and all your fans.

1238
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:54,380
I love all of you.
And keep listening to the bill podcasts.

1239
01:20:54,530 --> 01:20:57,140
Hey Joel, why don't you hire
your next Gig? Get fucking drunk.

1240
01:20:59,710 --> 01:21:04,630
I'll be in Indianapolis this
weekend at crackers. Crackers. Yes.

1241
01:21:04,631 --> 01:21:06,250
If you come see me and I appreciate it.

1242
01:21:06,390 --> 01:21:09,540
Okay. All right. Joseph, will you
have a good night of drinking?

1243
01:21:09,630 --> 01:21:10,463
I'll talk to you later.

1244
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:12,653
Thank you,
Bill.

1245
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:16,160
Alright, that's uninformed.
Shorter rose everybody.

1246
01:21:17,270 --> 01:21:19,820
And I completely forgot what the
fuck I was talking about. Oh,

1247
01:21:19,821 --> 01:21:23,610
I was talking to him. I was going
to do that first joke. See that?

1248
01:21:23,660 --> 01:21:26,280
You see what he's doing?
He's just drinking. He's out
drinking on a Sunday night.

1249
01:21:26,281 --> 01:21:30,870
Why are you guys all don't
become comedians? Oh fuck.

1250
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:34,920
Earthquake. Earthquake,
earthquake. Fuck. Hang on.

1251
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:37,643
Hang on.

1252
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:39,273
Hang on.

1253
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:43,200
Well, that was a little one and I was
a little one. Okay. How about that?

1254
01:21:43,201 --> 01:21:47,970
A phone in a fucking earthquake
in a fucking MP3 at the
beginning of this is the

1255
01:21:47,971 --> 01:21:51,720
best Goddamn podcast ever.
Jesus Christ. Is that scary?

1256
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:53,913
Huh?

1257
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:56,100
It's so funny. You know what you're
doing when the earthquake, you just,

1258
01:21:56,101 --> 01:21:59,100
you just sort of stand there and you put
your fucking hands out like, like you,

1259
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:03,450
you could somehow stop the energy.
Yeah. Like all of a sudden you're a,

1260
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:08,190
I dunno, some superhero. They knows how to
stop the fuck. That's what I did. I said,

1261
01:22:08,191 --> 01:22:11,520
okay. Okay. Normally I would
actually run into the door jamb.

1262
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:16,950
Wait a fucking minute. Wait
a minute. I've got a dog.

1263
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:19,353
Hey Cleo,

1264
01:22:21,090 --> 01:22:24,380
aren't you supposed to give
me a warning about that shit?

1265
01:22:24,381 --> 01:22:29,190
I thought you fucking dogs knew stuff
about that. Well, we just disproved them.

1266
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:33,180
Fucking meth right there.
Hang on a second. I gotta
make sure my dogs are right.

1267
01:22:33,181 --> 01:22:34,260
Hold on, hold on. Hold on,

1268
01:22:35,950 --> 01:22:39,770
Cleo. Okay, baby.

1269
01:22:41,090 --> 01:22:42,380
It's showing right. Get
chilling out, right.

1270
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:46,830
The dog's chilling dog show is probably
just a truck driving by. I'm such a fan.

1271
01:22:47,620 --> 01:22:50,340
All right. Anyways, let's get back
to it's, wow. This really, okay.

1272
01:22:50,370 --> 01:22:52,980
You know what's funny?
Look on me working on my memory.

1273
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:56,400
Thank you everybody for all your tips
out there that I can't remember what the

1274
01:22:56,401 --> 01:22:59,190
fuck they were and I haven't even used
them. Homeline but I'm going to use them.

1275
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:01,920
I'm going to use them.
What does it Pictionary?

1276
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:04,230
What the fuck am I supposed
to use? Um, I'm actually,

1277
01:23:04,231 --> 01:23:05,560
I should remember what I was about.

1278
01:23:07,370 --> 01:23:08,203
MMM.

1279
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:11,100
To fuck I doing. Oh yeah, that's right.
I was still doing one. Uh, one of my,

1280
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:13,200
one of my jokes I used to do,
but seven, eight years ago,

1281
01:23:13,201 --> 01:23:14,490
if you saw me down the comedy cellar,

1282
01:23:14,670 --> 01:23:18,520
you might recognize this one goes
a little something like this. Uh,

1283
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:21,960
what was I talking?
Oh yeah,

1284
01:23:21,961 --> 01:23:25,050
this is how this guy was trying to get
me to not be freaked out about going into

1285
01:23:25,051 --> 01:23:29,880
the ocean and sharks. And
he goes, uh, he goes, well,

1286
01:23:29,881 --> 01:23:32,100
you know, so I'm bill. A lot
of people don't realize this,

1287
01:23:32,101 --> 01:23:37,101
but 90% of shark attacks actually
happened in the shallow water.

1288
01:23:38,190 --> 01:23:41,460
And My punchline was like, yeah,
that's where the people are.

1289
01:23:42,030 --> 01:23:45,720
It's called the beach. Stupid.
Right? Stupid little attitude.

1290
01:23:45,790 --> 01:23:48,270
Or wear a leather jacket.
I was dangerous back then.

1291
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,450
What the fuck was the tat tagged to that?

1292
01:23:53,290 --> 01:23:55,660
I literally have to go back to
the beginning to remember. Yeah.

1293
01:23:55,661 --> 01:23:58,590
It's where the people are. It's
called the beach. Stupid. You know,

1294
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:03,070
it's like to some guidance. Yeah. Let's,
you know, I used to mind swimming.

1295
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:06,970
Let's go out. Let's go to Europe. You're
fucking pussies. That was a joke. Oh,

1296
01:24:07,090 --> 01:24:09,940
and the people, they would
laugh, they would laugh,

1297
01:24:09,941 --> 01:24:11,860
and I would get myself a free falafel.

1298
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:15,610
That's what I would do when I worked at
the comedy cellar. You still food spots,

1299
01:24:16,870 --> 01:24:20,560
food spots back in the day, which meant
you literally were working for food.

1300
01:24:20,650 --> 01:24:22,480
That's how much fun my fucking job is.

1301
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:27,600
I used to drive from Boston all the way
down to New York City and I used to sign

1302
01:24:29,201 --> 01:24:33,180
up for late night at the comedy cellar.
Uh,

1303
01:24:33,210 --> 01:24:35,430
and late night was in at uh,

1304
01:24:35,710 --> 01:24:40,090
between one and two in the morning or
two 30 in the morning and back then you

1305
01:24:40,091 --> 01:24:41,450
would simply sign up nine.
All,

1306
01:24:41,590 --> 01:24:44,350
there's a lot of young comics
right now I think in that,

1307
01:24:44,351 --> 01:24:47,650
that was really easy and they're
actually right because now they make them

1308
01:24:47,651 --> 01:24:48,484
fucking,

1309
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:52,600
they got to do pre shows and they got
to bring 20 fucking people and blow

1310
01:24:52,601 --> 01:24:56,290
somebody. It's, it's got a bark outside.

1311
01:24:56,350 --> 01:24:58,210
Standing with flyers is brutal.
Back.

1312
01:24:58,211 --> 01:25:00,220
Back in the day you'd just
go down and you'd sign up.

1313
01:25:00,221 --> 01:25:02,290
But I would drive three
and a half hours down,

1314
01:25:02,620 --> 01:25:06,800
sign up three and a half hours back.
I knew I had to do that one time.

1315
01:25:06,910 --> 01:25:10,480
That was how fucking dumb I was. This is
my big way that I was going to get in,

1316
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:14,590
in like at night in New York or whatever.
Just my whole way,

1317
01:25:14,591 --> 01:25:16,990
like I had to take baby steps when
I went to New York because I was so

1318
01:25:16,991 --> 01:25:19,480
intimidated when I went down to New York,

1319
01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:24,370
because all I had performed two was a
bunch of angry white dudes in Boston and I

1320
01:25:24,690 --> 01:25:27,730
wasn't angry white dude. I fucking grew
up around angry white dude. So it was, no,

1321
01:25:28,430 --> 01:25:31,980
it wasn't a problem. Then when I went
down in New York, everybody's there.

1322
01:25:32,070 --> 01:25:36,670
There was, you know, Puerto
Ricans, black people, fucking
Puerto Rican, I don't know.

1323
01:25:37,210 --> 01:25:39,430
Right. Blanked out. Whatever. There's
a bunch of other people there, right?

1324
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:42,820
I wait a second, I saw a do rag. I'd get
like, I'd feel myself. I'd literally just,

1325
01:25:42,821 --> 01:25:47,710
I get back on my heels and then
there's nothing worse. Bobbing sucks.

1326
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:51,220
But when you bombed because you,
you were a fucking pussy.

1327
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:54,530
That's the worst kind of bombing.
If you stand there, right? Hey,

1328
01:25:54,690 --> 01:25:58,330
you're fucking given it right back to
them and they're just giving you shit and

1329
01:25:58,460 --> 01:26:02,350
you lose. But at least you told him to
go fuck themselves. Is this something,

1330
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:05,990
it's still sucks. I'm not gonna lie. It's
still like a nice fucking liver shot,

1331
01:26:05,991 --> 01:26:10,320
but I'm telling you, it's, it's,
it hurts so much more when you're,

1332
01:26:11,810 --> 01:26:16,760
when you act like ned Beatty. All
right. Anyways, um, what am I doing?

1333
01:26:17,090 --> 01:26:20,410
What am I doing here? Whether that's
how far into this podcast out we can,

1334
01:26:20,540 --> 01:26:25,310
we had phone calls. We've
had fucking earthquakes. I
talked to my dog. All right.

1335
01:26:25,311 --> 01:26:29,660
With 39 minutes in, um, oh, coming up
this weekend. Let's, let's for once,

1336
01:26:29,661 --> 01:26:33,590
let me hype. Uh, let me hyper.
What the fuck I got going on?

1337
01:26:33,591 --> 01:26:37,040
I'm going to be at the Improv out
here in Hollywood, California.

1338
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:39,890
I know a lot of people out, uh,
out West are always asking me,

1339
01:26:39,891 --> 01:26:43,640
when are you going to be forming in la?
Well, there you go. You sons of bitches.

1340
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:44,821
I'm going to be at the,
uh,

1341
01:26:44,821 --> 01:26:49,380
the Improv on Melrose and uh,

1342
01:26:49,940 --> 01:26:53,070
um, May 22nd and May 23rd,
that's a Friday and a Saturday.

1343
01:26:53,370 --> 01:26:58,370
Fridays at eight o'clock and Saturday
two shows seven 30 and nine 30 and be

1344
01:26:59,910 --> 01:27:02,520
breaking down a bunch of new material.
And we talking about my dog.

1345
01:27:02,521 --> 01:27:05,550
I want a fucking more on am I
don't know what I'm going to say,

1346
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:09,870
but I'm imagining it's going to be
hilarious. Least I'm hoping it is.

1347
01:27:10,510 --> 01:27:14,110
And uh,
maybe that's what I'll do.

1348
01:27:14,111 --> 01:27:19,050
Maybe I'll just become that guy
who fucking, Nah, that's what I,

1349
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:20,310
you know,
that's going to be a next career move.

1350
01:27:20,311 --> 01:27:24,270
I'm just gonna just talk about dogs
and be that guy. You know the dog guy,

1351
01:27:24,330 --> 01:27:25,590
he just talks about dogs.

1352
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:28,070
Oh yes.
I saw that guy.

1353
01:27:29,110 --> 01:27:33,310
That's the best, the quickest
way to blow up. You know,

1354
01:27:33,311 --> 01:27:37,030
I saw the other day that there was
a, uh, you know, and I, I don't,

1355
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:41,770
I don't begrudge anybody who sells
tickets here. Let me preface it with that.

1356
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:45,940
But I saw that there was a
ventriloquist who was booked to play

1357
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:50,620
in like this basketball arena,
like a professional basketball.

1358
01:27:50,621 --> 01:27:54,520
I me like where the fucking Atlanta
hawks players some shit. All right?

1359
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:58,750
And God bless that guy.
He deserves every fucking dime he gets.

1360
01:27:58,751 --> 01:28:01,090
But this is the question I have for you.

1361
01:28:01,091 --> 01:28:06,091
What kind of a fucking moron sit in the
upper deck of a Goddamn arena to watch

1362
01:28:08,921 --> 01:28:13,530
your fucking ventriloquist. You understand
what I'm saying? I mean, what? What?

1363
01:28:13,531 --> 01:28:14,860
What do you say on the car ride home?

1364
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:19,180
You can't do I can you see I could.
You see his lips move?

1365
01:28:20,230 --> 01:28:23,020
Yeah. Even when he was talking,
you couldn't see it. You dumb cunt.

1366
01:28:23,050 --> 01:28:27,380
You fucking one erodes away.
It was [inaudible].

1367
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:30,460
It was amazing the way
he could throw his voice.

1368
01:28:30,490 --> 01:28:35,490
It was almost like they invented some
sort of apparatus that amplified what he

1369
01:28:35,591 --> 01:28:40,591
was saying because it was so loud and it
was so far away and yet I couldn't see

1370
01:28:40,601 --> 01:28:44,680
his lips moving. Can you imagine being
that dumb? How much fun you have?

1371
01:28:44,681 --> 01:28:47,470
Like how good does ice cream taste
when you're that fucking stupid?

1372
01:28:49,030 --> 01:28:51,970
You could ever know.
Ice Cream and enjoying a bowl of that.

1373
01:28:52,570 --> 01:28:56,260
Just having the time of your
life too dumb to stop eating it.

1374
01:28:56,261 --> 01:28:59,530
Just wondering why you keep
getting headaches. Oh, great.

1375
01:28:59,590 --> 01:29:01,320
Another untimely headache.

1376
01:29:01,350 --> 01:29:03,810
Just when I was going to enjoy
the rest of this ice cream.

1377
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:09,020
Why do these untimely headaches always
have to come when I'm enjoying what I

1378
01:29:09,151 --> 01:29:12,540
love to do. Most eating a
whole bowl of vanilla ice cream

1379
01:29:14,420 --> 01:29:17,700
dot. That would be great. Just to be
that fucking stupid, you know? You know,

1380
01:29:17,870 --> 01:29:20,730
that's stupid. I've talked about this
before. You know, that stupid way.

1381
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:23,880
Your fucking mouth is open. Even when
you're not talking. You know those people,

1382
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:28,980
they just sit there and for some
reason their tongue never dries out.

1383
01:29:29,370 --> 01:29:30,270
Even a bulldog,

1384
01:29:30,271 --> 01:29:34,240
that tip of his tongue will dry out after
Wagga morons that I don't know what is

1385
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:36,420
that tongue never,
never dries out.

1386
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:40,080
So you've got to just sit there and
look at it. You know, it's annoying.

1387
01:29:40,081 --> 01:29:42,750
If it was dried out, it at least make
you feel good that there was suffering.

1388
01:29:44,210 --> 01:29:47,280
All right, that was a tangent. Um,
let's get back to the podcast here.

1389
01:29:49,530 --> 01:29:51,800
Um, all right. There was actually
some great questions here.

1390
01:29:51,801 --> 01:29:55,460
This is why I actually saved
these. Um, this is a great,

1391
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:57,950
if you guys want to have a,
uh,

1392
01:29:58,010 --> 01:30:02,030
if you want to have a blueprint for a
great question. I am actually, you know,

1393
01:30:02,031 --> 01:30:04,520
I gotta tell you, you guys have
really stepped up in general.

1394
01:30:04,870 --> 01:30:07,040
I'm going to give you all a pat
on the back. You guys are really,

1395
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:10,370
you're writing really funny shit in there.
They're great questions.

1396
01:30:10,580 --> 01:30:13,880
Like this one here. Listen
to this question. Bill.

1397
01:30:14,150 --> 01:30:15,740
If you were a serial killer,

1398
01:30:16,070 --> 01:30:20,540
how would you kill your victims and what
would be your serial killer name? Uh,

1399
01:30:20,541 --> 01:30:23,540
for my job,
I have a lot of time to think about stuff.

1400
01:30:23,570 --> 01:30:28,370
And I was listening to your story about
the Green River killer and it got me to

1401
01:30:28,371 --> 01:30:31,010
thinking if I was a serial killer,
how would I do it?

1402
01:30:31,390 --> 01:30:33,320
He's alluding to my podcast
a couple of weeks ago.

1403
01:30:33,321 --> 01:30:36,140
I was talking about how they always
give like Syrah killers, nicknames,

1404
01:30:36,590 --> 01:30:41,390
like they're playing in the fucking
Rose Bowl, you know? Uh, so anyway, so,

1405
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:45,500
so he's actually actually, I know
what, that's what I did last week.

1406
01:30:45,530 --> 01:30:49,580
That's what the fuck I did. I looked
up a bunch of serial killer nicknames,

1407
01:30:50,300 --> 01:30:50,571
you know,

1408
01:30:50,571 --> 01:30:55,571
I noticed a lot of guys
had a great nicknames,

1409
01:30:55,641 --> 01:30:58,940
but there was actually a surprising
amount of female serial killers,

1410
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:04,070
but not enough of them got cool nicknames
except for this one lady who was known

1411
01:31:04,071 --> 01:31:07,920
as the giggling grandmother.
And uh, I can't recall,

1412
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:11,320
there was a couple of weeks ago, but
she literally killed like four husbands,

1413
01:31:11,860 --> 01:31:16,420
both her sisters as second cousin or
whatever. And they finally, you know,

1414
01:31:16,421 --> 01:31:18,340
figured out what the fuck was going on.

1415
01:31:18,341 --> 01:31:21,160
Do you mind a shit you could get
away with back in the day? You know,

1416
01:31:21,161 --> 01:31:25,030
nowadays you got to kill like 22 complete
strangers back in the day before they

1417
01:31:25,031 --> 01:31:28,570
knew how to dust for fingerprints and
they didn't have all this fucking DNA

1418
01:31:28,571 --> 01:31:33,040
investigation. You could literally
kill everybody at work. You know,

1419
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:35,800
you work with 40 people
in 40 weekends in a row.

1420
01:31:35,890 --> 01:31:39,160
Somebody could be disappearing and you
could literally just keep shrugging your

1421
01:31:39,161 --> 01:31:43,530
shoulders going, ah, I dunno. Here.
I mean, yet. What are the odds? Yes.

1422
01:31:45,070 --> 01:31:47,350
Um,
so anyways,

1423
01:31:47,351 --> 01:31:52,240
when they finally picked up this
old lady and they interrogated her,

1424
01:31:52,241 --> 01:31:56,140
I guess she would just laugh when
they would, did you kill him?

1425
01:31:56,141 --> 01:31:58,720
And she would just sort of
laugh and say, yeah, I did.

1426
01:31:58,721 --> 01:32:03,340
And they tell if she was just trying
to mask her embarrassment or if she was

1427
01:32:03,341 --> 01:32:05,890
just that shutdown or whatever.
But she got the nickname,

1428
01:32:05,891 --> 01:32:09,580
the giggling grandmother. That's
a great one. That's a great one.

1429
01:32:10,270 --> 01:32:12,700
The giggling grammar.
Literations grandmothers,

1430
01:32:12,750 --> 01:32:15,130
she supposed to be making cookies
and she's out killing people.

1431
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:18,400
Gives you a chill. It's fucking beautiful.
So anyways, let's get back to this.

1432
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:22,990
So this guy says he feet sat around
thinking about it at work and a, okay,

1433
01:32:22,991 --> 01:32:26,380
here's this deal. He said, not to sound
too crazy, but I did give it to some give,

1434
01:32:26,710 --> 01:32:29,440
did give it some thought as how
I would kill somebody. He said,

1435
01:32:29,470 --> 01:32:34,470
I figured I would use a stick I
found in the forest and sharpen it,

1436
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:40,140
use it, and then burn the evidence. I
would be the caveman killer. And Dude,

1437
01:32:40,150 --> 01:32:42,940
I gotta tell you, that's
just fucking great. That's
just really well thought out.

1438
01:32:42,941 --> 01:32:46,720
How fucking awesome is that all these
guys for years in the mob, you know,

1439
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:50,800
they tape up the gun with duck tape and
then they shoot the dude and then they

1440
01:32:50,801 --> 01:32:54,400
throw it in the fucking river and then
some fucking nerd who never gets any

1441
01:32:54,401 --> 01:32:57,850
pussy. Who's got time to use a metal
detector at the bottom of the river,

1442
01:32:57,970 --> 01:33:00,370
finds the fucking thing.
And next thing you know,

1443
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:04,000
you get busted at your 30 year
fucking high school graduation, right?

1444
01:33:04,050 --> 01:33:08,440
Happens all the time. This is perfect.
This is perfect. If you kill somebody,

1445
01:33:08,441 --> 01:33:11,050
you don't even know what the sharpened
stick, you burn the fucking stick.

1446
01:33:11,470 --> 01:33:14,770
This is so good. I don't even want to
fucking, I don't even want to like, like,

1447
01:33:14,771 --> 01:33:18,100
like talk about it. I'm afraid
I'm giving somebody a great idea.

1448
01:33:18,101 --> 01:33:22,870
So let's get to me. How would I do it and
what my serial killer name would be? Um,

1449
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:27,700
well if you know me, um,
I'm a big fan of yesteryear.

1450
01:33:28,390 --> 01:33:32,380
I'm not looking forward to the future.
So I would go old school, you know,

1451
01:33:32,381 --> 01:33:35,920
I would go old school. I try to
bring back the cycle, you know,

1452
01:33:36,370 --> 01:33:39,580
I would use a sickle and uh,

1453
01:33:40,090 --> 01:33:44,350
and I would definitely get into
the placement of the body. Okay.

1454
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:49,330
We'll just be me because I learned from
a cop that the more people you involve

1455
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:50,200
in a crime,

1456
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:53,470
the higher chance you have of getting
caught because somebody is going to be

1457
01:33:53,471 --> 01:33:57,190
that fucking more on like that kid.
I mean that fucking kid in a,

1458
01:33:57,670 --> 01:34:01,740
was it Saturday night fever when he
doesn't jump in on the fight? Well,

1459
01:34:01,870 --> 01:34:05,380
will you guys, oh, I was looking for
you. There's always one of those guys,

1460
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:09,010
you know, and that, you
know, they just start crying.

1461
01:34:10,540 --> 01:34:11,400
I was with this guy,

1462
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:16,780
he's fucking work in the
fucking Improv next weekend. Um,

1463
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:21,190
so I would definitely do it alone and I
would bring back the second I would wear

1464
01:34:21,191 --> 01:34:23,530
the hood and I would do all that
type and I wouldn't wear the hood.

1465
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:26,560
Just make me all sweaty. I'm going to
kill him. Who cares what they see my face.

1466
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:31,920
And basically what I would do is I would
just fucking chop their heads off and I

1467
01:34:33,371 --> 01:34:38,371
would leave the head in their bed and
I'd leave their body in the bathtub and I

1468
01:34:39,611 --> 01:34:43,480
would be known as the, uh,
bed bath and be header.

1469
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:50,140
Can I,
can I just apologize for that?

1470
01:34:50,170 --> 01:34:55,120
I really knew that that was going to stink
as though as I was starting to say it

1471
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:58,970
, I knew that that was going to
be awful, but I dunno, I was just,

1472
01:34:58,971 --> 01:35:00,110
I was trying to fucking,

1473
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:04,340
I hate corporations and if there was just
a way that you could go around killing

1474
01:35:04,341 --> 01:35:09,341
people and to have it kind of sound like
best buy or bed bath and beyond just so

1475
01:35:09,651 --> 01:35:14,651
some fucking douchebag
would have to actually stand
behind a podium and actually

1476
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:19,370
read some letter of detraction going,
we don't down,

1477
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:21,110
we here at bed,
bath and beyond.

1478
01:35:21,111 --> 01:35:25,910
Do not condone let the bed bath and
be header does. Uh, we don't condone,

1479
01:35:26,830 --> 01:35:31,640
um, even just assaulting people. Once
again, we are bed bath and beyond. We,

1480
01:35:31,850 --> 01:35:35,870
there's no be heading that
happens here. And, um,

1481
01:35:35,871 --> 01:35:37,280
I know he's still on the loose,

1482
01:35:37,281 --> 01:35:42,281
but I think it's safe to say that he does
not work for us and we are cooperating

1483
01:35:42,381 --> 01:35:44,090
with the local authorities,

1484
01:35:44,091 --> 01:35:48,200
have answered all their questions and
that's all we have to say on the matter.

1485
01:35:48,201 --> 01:35:51,840
And we would just like to get back
to selling pillow cases, you know,

1486
01:35:51,890 --> 01:35:54,930
just to make them fucking do
that. All right, there you go.

1487
01:35:55,110 --> 01:35:57,230
There's a podcast for the week.
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

1488
01:35:57,890 --> 01:36:01,100
A lot of thrills, lot of spills. Have
little earthquake. Little, a little,

1489
01:36:01,150 --> 01:36:02,030
a little bit of everything.

1490
01:36:02,031 --> 01:36:05,510
I hope I was able to edit that MP three
in the front of this because I recorded

1491
01:36:05,511 --> 01:36:06,620
this fucking thing first,

1492
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:11,220
you know, so, uh, that's it. Please
come out and see me at the, uh,

1493
01:36:11,221 --> 01:36:14,930
the Improv this week and I'm trying
to put together none but another,

1494
01:36:14,931 --> 01:36:19,110
a Monday show up at the
punchline in San Francisco. Uh,

1495
01:36:19,130 --> 01:36:23,220
I had so much fun last March doing that
and that's what I got going on. And, uh,

1496
01:36:23,250 --> 01:36:26,820
congratulations to the people
down there in Orlando. Uh,

1497
01:36:26,940 --> 01:36:29,100
you've got a great basketball team.
You'd beat my Celtics.

1498
01:36:29,130 --> 01:36:30,540
Congratulations to you guys.

1499
01:36:30,541 --> 01:36:33,720
You know you've got something better
to do than fucking put steel balls

1500
01:36:33,990 --> 01:36:37,800
underneath your fucking pickup truck and
drive over to Epcot center, you know,

1501
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:42,690
or have a wild weekend down
there in Tampa. Huh? You know,

1502
01:36:42,691 --> 01:36:45,960
or just sit around watching your
mullets grow. You know, you got,

1503
01:36:45,961 --> 01:36:49,710
you go into the fucking eastern
conference finals. Who Do you guys like?

1504
01:36:49,711 --> 01:36:51,450
Who Do you like?
I got to tell you,

1505
01:36:51,451 --> 01:36:56,451
I'm rooting for the fucking nuggets
and I'm living out here in la.

1506
01:36:56,730 --> 01:36:59,880
I really, I really,
you know, I don't hate,

1507
01:36:59,881 --> 01:37:02,070
I don't hate Laker fans cause
it's like they live here,

1508
01:37:02,071 --> 01:37:03,900
so obviously they're
fucking in the Lakers.

1509
01:37:03,901 --> 01:37:06,930
But what I do hate is how they're acting
like they're anywhere near the amount

1510
01:37:06,931 --> 01:37:10,230
of championships at the Celtics
have. It's like, dude, you have nine.

1511
01:37:10,590 --> 01:37:15,330
The Los Angeles Lakers have nine
championships. Okay. Stop with this.

1512
01:37:15,331 --> 01:37:20,100
14 the Minneapolis Lakers
one five. Okay. Your, your,

1513
01:37:20,430 --> 01:37:23,880
your, your franchise has
one 14 I'll give you that.

1514
01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:28,650
If you take two cities and you
glue them together, they have won.

1515
01:37:28,980 --> 01:37:33,930
You've won three less championships
than the one city of Boston has one.

1516
01:37:33,931 --> 01:37:36,280
Don't ever fucking forget that.
All right?

1517
01:37:36,660 --> 01:37:41,280
Cause if the Lakers ever moved to fucking
Los Vegas and they won a championship,

1518
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:44,340
how would you think of some Douche
bag? And Vegas was like, yeah,

1519
01:37:44,341 --> 01:37:49,100
we got 15 bitches. It's
like, no you don't. No,

1520
01:37:49,130 --> 01:37:51,750
you got one. You got one.
All right, so you fuckers,

1521
01:37:51,990 --> 01:37:54,240
you're still in single digits and you're
going to lose some of the nuggets.

1522
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:57,480
At least I hope you do. I hope
you don't show up. Hope you know,

1523
01:37:57,481 --> 01:38:00,810
I don't know why the Lakers aren't
showing up. This is easy for them.

1524
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:05,610
Kevin Gara nets out. Bam. It's
wide open. You're good to go.

1525
01:38:05,730 --> 01:38:09,690
The Cavaliers do not have enough
guys on their team to beat you guys.

1526
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:12,360
The nuggets don't have enough guys.
But you know what?

1527
01:38:12,361 --> 01:38:15,420
The nuggets and the Cavaliers have that
the Lakers don't have. They have heart.

1528
01:38:15,930 --> 01:38:18,840
They got fucking heart. I'm telling
you the lady who the fuck takes,

1529
01:38:18,870 --> 01:38:22,710
who takes games off in the playoffs?
Who does that? Who does that?

1530
01:38:22,740 --> 01:38:26,970
The fucking Los Angeles Lakers. It's
almost like this. So fucking good.

1531
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:32,090
They just stay, uh, let's fuck
around. I Dunno. I don't fuck it.

1532
01:38:32,180 --> 01:38:35,540
No, I'm just, you know, I
don't know. I bombed. My team
lost, but you know something.

1533
01:38:37,710 --> 01:38:40,640
The can somebody in the NBA just
called traveling? I don't give a fuck.

1534
01:38:40,670 --> 01:38:44,030
Even if it's on my own.
I saw, I saw fucking, oh,

1535
01:38:44,510 --> 01:38:49,000
what's his face there tonight?
The fuck am I trying to think.

1536
01:38:49,001 --> 01:38:50,920
I'm already thinking. I, I,
they just suck with names.

1537
01:38:53,590 --> 01:38:56,680
Just pause, Bill. Think that Ray Lewis,

1538
01:38:56,681 --> 01:39:01,450
he plays for the fucking Ray Allen.
Jesus Christ. I'm getting old here.

1539
01:39:01,451 --> 01:39:05,920
I've seen out ray Allen literally
catches a ball. He runs three steps,

1540
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:09,640
clearly runs three steps and takes
the three pointer and hits it.

1541
01:39:09,700 --> 01:39:11,830
The amount of times I
just sit there and scream.

1542
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:16,630
Traveling as I watch an NBA game is,
it's ridiculous.

1543
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:19,450
He wants ridiculous as I continue
this podcast, even though it was over.

1544
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:24,070
It's over. All right. You guys get on
with your lives, your lives, your lives.

1545
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:29,250
What a fucking moron. All right. You
guys have a good week. God bless.
