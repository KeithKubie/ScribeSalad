00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.428
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.904 --> 00:00:07.390
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.256
- For 30 years, Anthony Ray
Hinton was a dead man walking.

00:00:11.256 --> 00:00:13.696
[CRYING]

00:00:13.696 --> 00:00:15.160
- Thank you, Jesus.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.610
Thank you, Lord.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.620
- Prosecution seemed deemed
to take my life from me.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.590
- 58 years old, Hinton lived
more than half his life

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.690
inside a cage,
Holman Correctional

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.620
Facility in southern Alabama.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.380
Today, he's seeing
and experiencing

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.350
things for the first
time in decades.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.222
- Oh, my goodness.

00:00:36.222 --> 00:00:38.580
So let's just have--

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.200
- He is welcomed home,
a party in his honor

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.840
hosted by the Equal
Justice Initiative,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.180
led by attorney Bryan
Stevenson and his team

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.730
of attorneys who fought
for decades to win

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.110
Hinton's freedom.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.230
- Thank you for giving
me my life back.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.550
Just being here
as a team, you can

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.610
say that you got an
innocent man off death row.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.490
- His nightmare began in 1985.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.050
Ronald Reagan was president.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.600
"Back to the Future"
was a box office hit.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.630
And under the cover of darkness,
two Birmingham restaurant

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.180
managers were shot
dead at closing time

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.740
just months apart--

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.680
a third victim, another man
who survived the shooting,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.130
and helped identify
29-year-old Anthony Ray Hinton

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.570
as the killer.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.740
You're a free man now.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.980
What does that mean to you?

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:25.960
- It means everything.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.145
I mean, you never think
about your freedom

00:01:31.145 --> 00:01:33.130
until it's taken away from.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.920
You couldn't put
a price tag on it.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.880
Got my $12 back already.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.990
- So much about the
world has changed.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.950
But the greatest still is
a world without his mother.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.500
She died while he
was locked away.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.470
- It couldn't get
no lower for me.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.780
I'm not ashamed of it.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:50.490
I'm proud of it.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.410
That was the love of my life.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.820
- He goes back to the home they
shared together, now abandoned.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.710
- Kind of hate to
see it in this shape.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.230
- It's his first time
there since the night it

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.580
was all taken away.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.490
This is the room where Hinton's
mother kept her 38 caliber

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.390
revolver.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.160
Police said it was
the murder weapon.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.100
Hinton's court appointed public
defender hired a supposed

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.320
ballistics expert to
dispute the prosecution's

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.450
claim about the murder weapon.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.090
A persuasive expert he was not.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.355
So his ballistics
expert was blind.

00:02:21.355 --> 00:02:23.120
- In one eye, yes,
that's correct.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.840
- He had to ask how to
turn on the machine.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.070
He couldn't see.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.160
He had to ask somebody,
please help me.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.740
So when we put him on
the stand as my witness,

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.900
they crucified him.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.850
I said, they're going
to find me guilty.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.830
- Hinton was sentenced to death.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.020
He was ordered to spend
the remainder of his life

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.260
in prison living
inside a 5 by 7 cell.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.710
- You pretty much sleep
in a fetal position

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.970
because your feet
hang over the bed.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.370
You only have a
bed that is mounted

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.990
to the wall and a toilet.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.380
And that's what I
lived in for 30 years.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:07.190
They took my 30s, my 40, my
50, but what they couldn't take

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.020
was my joy.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.320
I couldn't do a thing
about the years.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.730
But I could control my joy.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.420
- 53 inmates were
executed at Holman

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.100
while Hinton was on death row.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.130
- My darkest memory would
be seeing so many people

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.320
that I got to know be executed.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.200
- He languished in
prison for years

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.270
before his case
reached appeals court.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.180
- I had never been so convinced
of someone's innocence

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.860
than I had in Mr. Hinton's case.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:42.760
No one asked them.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.310
- Judge Sue Bell Cobb was
one of those appellate court

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.470
judges who believed his story.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.970
There was no
incriminating evidence.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.800
He didn't have anything
from the robbery.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.070
There were no fingerprints.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.680
- This is extremely unusual.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.380
- His appeal was denied,
but his team kept fighting.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.590
- We'd exhausted every
state court appeal,

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.090
and it was the
United States Supreme

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.440
Court that finally intervened.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.510
- The result was a
new trial, the break

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.040
Hinton had been waiting for.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.530
But just a few weeks
ago, the state of Alabama

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.290
dropped the case after a
new look at the evidence

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.410
could not match the
bullets to the gun.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.790
And Hinton was released.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.094
- Since I've been locked up 30
years and finances is tight,

00:04:23.094 --> 00:04:25.590
$5 a slice.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.430
- I don't sense any bitterness.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.650
Why is that?

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.705
- Bitterness kills the soul.

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:39.200
I can not hate because my
bible teaches me not to hate.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.240
I've seen hate at its worst.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.020
What would it profit me to hate?

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.764
I want you to know
there is a god.

00:04:48.764 --> 00:04:49.430
- Yes, there is.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.490
- He sits high,
but he looks low.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.906
- Yes.

00:04:50.906 --> 00:04:51.740
- Thank you, Lord.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.830
- He will destroy, but
yet, he will defend.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.240
And he defended me.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.674
[END PLAYBACK]

00:04:56.674 --> 00:04:59.542
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:01.454 --> 00:05:02.888
ANTHONY RAY HINTON: Thank you.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:16.140
Let me start off by saying how
fitting it is to be in Seattle.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.710
You didn't disappoint
me in the rain.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:32.310
But 29 years ago, I tried
out for the Seattle Mariners

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.930
and was told to come back.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:43.120
For I am, or was, a
great baseball player.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.320
All through high school,
my batting average

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.362
was .618 a season.

00:05:49.362 --> 00:05:55.130
I made All-Star
every year, and I

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.840
had hoped to make
it to the pros,

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.010
but then hell opened its doors.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:18.990
30 years of pure hell I lived in
because eight racist white men

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:27.590
had the power, the means, and
the motive to put me in a 5

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.880
by 7.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.830
Those eight white men
had every intention

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:39.210
of executing me for a crime
they knew that I didn't commit.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.460
I truly wish that I
could look you in the eye

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:48.380
and tell you that the state of
Alabama made an honest mistake.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.820
I wish I could
look you in the eye

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.500
and tell you race had
nothing to do with it.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.460
But the state of Alabama
didn't make an honest mistake,

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.460
and race had everything
to do with it.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.220
I have to ask myself
what type justice

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:11.250
system we have in this
country that we can put

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:18.900
a man in a hole
for 30 years simply

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:25.470
because of the color of his
skin and because the only thing

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:29.180
that the state of Alabama
said linked me to the murder

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.600
was a gun, ballistics.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.090
US citizens should
ask yourself, how

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:39.270
is it that it would take
30 years to determine

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:44.490
whether something match
or don't match, 30 years?

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.310
You wake up one morning in July.

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.630
And I don't know
if any of you ever

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:58.059
had the pleasure of
being in Alabama in July,

00:07:58.059 --> 00:07:59.600
but I'm fixing to
tell you something.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.460
This is true.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.460
You don't want to come
to Alabama in July.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:04.740
It's too hot.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:08.645
And so this hot day, I woke
up like any other morning,

00:08:08.645 --> 00:08:13.480
and about 12, 1 o'clock in
the afternoon, my mother

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.460
was in the kitchen.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:19.510
And I went in to get a
glass of her lemonade.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:23.710
And as I was pouring this
lemonade, my mother asked me,

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:25.660
was I going to
revival that night?

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.330
And I said, yes, ma'am,
for in the South,

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.520
no matter how old you
get, you say, yes, ma'am,

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.490
and no, ma'am, yes, sir, and
no, sir, out of pure respect

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:35.270
for your elders.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:36.940
And so I said, yes,
ma'am, I'm going,

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.240
and I got this glass of
lemonade and went outside.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.510
About 15 minutes later, I
brought the glass back inside,

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:48.500
and there my mother was
again in the kitchen.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.970
She said, what time
revival start tonight?

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:54.480
And I said 7 o'clock, Mama.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.480
And she looked at her
watch, and she said, well,

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.254
you got time to go out
there and cut that grass.

00:09:00.254 --> 00:09:03.630
I gave my mother this baby
look, and it usually worked,

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.212
but it didn't work this day.

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:08.670
And I looked at my mother, and
I said, Mama, I promise you.

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:12.360
Tomorrow I will cut that grass.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.080
My mother looked at
me, and she said,

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.560
I'm trying my best
to see how did

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:23.170
you get you'll cut the grass
tomorrow out of me telling

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:25.860
you to go cut the grass.

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:28.320
And she gave me that look
that only she could give me,

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.180
and she finally said, boy,
you better get out there

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:32.180
and cut grass.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.190
And I goes outside, and
I fire up the lawn mower.

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:38.120
And 25 minutes into
cutting the grass,

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.400
I just happened to look up.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.000
And there stood
two white gentlemen

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.450
that I had never seen before.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:48.140
I cut the lawn mower off,
and I said, can I help you?

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:49.760
One of the gentleman
said, yes, we

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.910
are detectives from
Birmingham Police Department.

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:55.370
We're looking for
Anthony Ray Hinton.

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:56.420
I said that would be me.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.270
Again, how can I help you?

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.450
He said, we have a
warrant for your arrest.

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:04.460
And I said, for what?

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.390
He said, we will explain
that to you later,

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:09.080
but right now, we want
you to put your hands

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.000
behind your back.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:11.720
I complied.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.280
I put my hands behind my back.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.530
They put the handcuffs
on me, proceeded

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.990
to put me in the police car.

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:20.640
And I said, hold up.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.250
At least allow me
the chance to go in

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:28.014
and tell my mother that I'm
being arrested for something.

00:10:28.014 --> 00:10:30.430
The detective said, we can't
let you go back in the house,

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.780
and we argued for
about two minutes.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:36.010
And finally, the other detective
said, let him go and tell

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.200
his mother he's being arrested.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.090
And I go in, and I just show
my mother the handcuffs.

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:46.330
And like any good mother, she
began to scream and holler.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.380
What are those handcuffs
doing on my baby?

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.330
One of the detectives
said, take him outside

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:54.700
while I stay in here
and talk to his mother.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.800
A few minutes later,
he comes outside,

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.120
and we proceeded to
go to the county jail.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.780
He turned around, and he said,
Anthony, do you own a firearm?

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:06.340
I said no.

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.070
He said, do your
mother own a firearm?

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:12.370
I said yes and
told him what kind.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:17.290
Every day, any one that meets
me that are aware of this case,

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:20.490
they ask me one question.

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:24.330
Why did you tell the
police about a gun

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.100
they had no knowledge of?

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:31.930
And I tell them that all my
life, my mother have always

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:34.970
told me, if you
haven't done anything,

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:37.810
you have no reason to lie.

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:42.240
If you haven't done anything,
you have no business running.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:46.290
That day, I told the truth.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:48.120
They dropped me off
at a substation.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.940
They turned around and go
back to my mother's house

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:55.110
and talk to her, and
she gives them the gun.

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:56.050
They kept the gun.

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:57.670
They come pick me
up, and we proceeded

00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:00.600
to go to the county jail again.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.630
I asked these detectives
at least 50 times,

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:05.250
why am I being arrested?

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.380
And they never would respond.

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:09.890
And after going
[INAUDIBLE],, the detective,

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:14.220
why are y'all arresting me,
this seemed to set the detective

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:14.720
off.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.450
He turned around.

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:18.330
He looked at me, and
he said, you really

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:19.990
want to know why
we arresting you?

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:21.900
I said yes.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.730
He said, we charging
you with first degree

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:26.460
robbery, first
degree kidnapping,

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:29.010
first degree attempted murder.

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:31.340
I said, oh, you
got the wrong guy.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:32.980
He said, let me
tell you something

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.550
and let me tell it
to you right now.

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:38.670
I don't care whether
you did or didn't do it,

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:41.780
but I'm going to make sure
you are found guilty of it.

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:44.880
I said, for a crime
that I didn't commit?

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.550
He said, you must have
a hearing problem,

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:49.860
because I just told you
I don't care whether you

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.450
did it or didn't do it.

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:55.950
He said, but you remember this
if you remember nothing else.

00:12:55.950 --> 00:13:01.575
I am going to make sure that
you're found guilty of it.

00:13:01.575 --> 00:13:04.120
We drove a little father,
and he turned around.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.690
And he said, and
by the way, there's

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:10.110
five things that are
going to convict you.

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:11.930
Would you like to
know what they are?

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:13.740
And I said yes.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.350
He said, number
one, you're black.

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:19.260
Number two, a white man is
going to say you shot him.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:24.310
Whether you shot him
or not, I don't care.

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:26.425
He said, number
three, you're going

00:13:26.425 --> 00:13:28.520
to have a white prosecutor.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:33.830
Number four, you're going have
a white judge, and number five,

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:36.700
you're going to have
an all-white jury.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:40.110
He said, do you know
what that spell?

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:43.640
And he looked at me, and he
said, conviction, conviction,

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:48.150
conviction,
conviction, conviction.

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:50.980
And as we got to
the police station,

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:54.340
they put me in this holding
cell for about 2 and 1/2 hours,

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.130
and finally, the
detective came in.

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:59.520
And I said, Detective,
can you please

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:05.070
tell me the date and the time
that these crimes took place?

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:07.020
He goes through his
notes, and he tells me

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:08.370
the date and the time.

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:12.801
And I reply, Detective, if
you're telling me the truth,

00:14:12.801 --> 00:14:14.650
it couldn't have
been me, for I was

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:17.730
at work at that particular
date and that particular time.

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:20.380
And I said, thank God.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:23.090
I said, thank you, Jesus.

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:26.220
My supervisor
happened to be white.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.260
Here's his phone number.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.210
Here's the address
where I work at.

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:30.480
You can go out and check.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.810
And he left.

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:34.670
About 4 and 1/2 hours
later, he came back in.

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:38.910
And he said, I have
good news and bad news.

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:41.120
The good news is we're no
longer going to charge you

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.520
with first degree robbery,
first degree kidnapping,

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.140
first degree attempted murder.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:48.720
Your alibi checks out.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:53.250
He said, but now, the bad news.

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:57.250
We have decided that
we're going to charge you

00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:02.690
with two counts of first
degree capital murder.

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:07.950
I said, but Detective,
I haven't killed anyone.

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:10.530
He said, didn't you remember
what I told you on the way

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:12.030
here?

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:15.180
I don't care whether you
did it or didn't do it.

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:18.690
He said, that
still is in effect.

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:22.780
He looked at me, and he
said, and by the way,

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.030
I truly believe
you didn't do it.

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:30.360
He said, but since y'all is
always taking up from one

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:34.215
another, take this
rep for your homeboy.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.836
With tears down my eyes
and running down my cheeks,

00:15:40.836 --> 00:15:41.960
I looked at this detective.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:48.100
And I said, Detective, I don't
have a homeboy in this world

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:52.105
that I would take this rap for.

00:15:52.105 --> 00:15:55.360
I goes before a judge.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.120
A judge read me my
rights and tell me

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.250
what I'm being charged with.

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:08.600
He tells me and asks me,
do you have an attorney?

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.550
And I said no.

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:11.480
He said, can you
afford an attorney?

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.380
And I said no.

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:15.830
He looked back in his courtroom,
and he called this attorney

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:18.470
up front and told
this attorney that he

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:22.520
wanted him to represent me on
two counts of capital murder.

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:26.780
Without even asking me my name,
the attorney looked at me,

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:35.330
and he said, I did not go to
law school to do pro bono work.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:38.090
I looked at this
attorney, and I said,

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:41.090
would it make a
difference to you

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:44.940
if I told you that
I was innocent?

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:48.030
The attorney looked
at me, and he said,

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:54.540
the problem with that statement
is that all y'all, y'all always

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:58.800
doing something and then
saying you didn't do it.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.430
This is the attorney that
I had to go and believe

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:08.099
that was going to represent me
to the best of his knowledge.

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:12.119
I sit in jail a year and a
half before I go to trial.

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:16.790
In that year and a half, I've
seen this attorney maybe twice.

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:22.220
I go to trial, and my trial
lasted for about three weeks.

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:25.829
The jury come back
with a guilty verdict.

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:27.750
The judge proudly
stand up and say,

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:32.130
Anthony Ray Hinton, you
have been found guilty

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:35.670
on two counts of
capital murder, and it

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:41.840
is the order of this court
that I sentence you to death.

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:46.870
And that judge had the
audacity to say, "may God

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:49.360
have mercy on your soul."

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.100
The prosecution
went out that day

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:55.030
and told the media that
today the state of Alabama

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:59.620
got the worst killer that
ever walked the streets

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.010
off the streets that day.

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:04.340
Only it wasn't true.

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:12.280
And on December 17, 1986, I
was transported to death row

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.680
in Atmore, Alabama.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.230
Once arriving at
Atmore, Alabama,

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:20.690
for the next three
years, I did not

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:26.420
say a word to another human
being for three years.

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.120
I went into this dark
place, this place

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:33.220
where I didn't even think
that I could go myself.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:37.590
I went into this place where
I didn't want to see anyone.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:40.010
I didn't want to
hear about anyone,

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:44.570
and that was my refuge,
this dark place.

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:50.050
For three years, every time the
guard would ask me a question,

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:53.830
I would take a pen or pencil
and write my response.

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:54.850
But never would I speak.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:01.250
Going into the
fourth year, I woke

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:05.480
up at approximately 1:00 AM
to the sound of a grown man

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:09.470
crying, a man that I had
lived by for three years

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:15.110
and never asked him his
name or where he was from.

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:16.820
I wasn't there to
get to know anyone.

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:25.560
I wasn't there to
befriend anyone.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.310
All I knew I was there
for something I didn't do.

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:33.060
But at an early age, my
mother taught me compassion.

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:36.510
My mother told me no matter
what one does in life,

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:39.660
he or she still
deserves compassion.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:42.870
And it was that compassion that
I hollered through this brick

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:46.715
wall, and I asked this
gentleman, was he OK?

00:19:46.715 --> 00:19:51.410
It took this man awhile to
respond, but finally he said,

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:54.720
I just got word
my mother passed.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:57.150
I told him I was
sorry to hear that,

00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:00.600
and I said, if anyone's
going to argue your case,

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:04.260
your mother will argue
your case before God.

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.380
I told him a corny joke,
and we both kind of

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:08.280
laughed a little bit.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.370
And I laid back down.

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:13.200
And at 6:00 AM, I woke up.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:19.110
And I realized that my voice
and my sense of humor was back.

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:21.450
I tell people
everyday that I was

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:24.420
born with two things if
nothing else in this world.

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:29.580
I was born to a mother who
loved me unconditionally,

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.980
and I was born with
a sense of humor.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.490
I'm just a big old country boy
that no matter how beautiful

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:39.010
you are, no matter how
young you are, old you are,

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:41.430
if you walk in there, I just
happened to see you stumble

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:45.810
and fall, I will be the first
one to run and help you up.

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:48.840
I will be the first one
to ask you, are you OK?

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.890
But the moment you
tell me you're OK,

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:53.580
I'm going to laugh
at you for falling.

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:58.470
I just believe that laughter
is good for the soul.

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:03.730
And that morning, I woke up
and realized my sense of humor

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:05.360
was back.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:09.490
The state of Alabama was in the
process of executing four men,

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:12.830
and they had already
executed two.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:16.640
And I called this guard up to
my cell, and I said, Officer,

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.280
is there anything
you can give me

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:24.750
so I won't have to smell
that flesh burning?

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:28.020
The officer looked at me,
and he said, no, there's

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.140
nothing I can give you.

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:32.790
But if it's a
consolation to you,

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:38.060
one day, you'll get used to it.

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:42.260
And he looked at me, and he
said, and by the way, one day,

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:45.860
somebody will smell
your flesh burning.

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:48.780
And it was at that moment that
I sit back down on this bunk

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:53.480
bed that was too small,
and I told my body

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.250
that the mind had to leave.

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:04.550
In 30 years, I witnessed
54 men walk by my cell

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:07.720
only to be executed.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:11.200
Five men had decided that
they no longer could take it.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.240
They hung themself.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:16.630
And three other men decided that
they would slash their wrists

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:17.335
and bleed out.

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:25.810
And I kept saying, how long
can I survive this madness?

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:31.060
How long will it be before
they come and get me?

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.955
But in the meantime
until that time come,

00:22:33.955 --> 00:22:40.070
all I knew that I had to
somehow, up here, escape.

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:42.610
And as I sit on that bunk
bed, and I looked at my body,

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:46.900
and I said, body, the
mind have to leave.

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:50.030
And it was as though my body
was talking back to me and said,

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:51.370
do you promise to come back?

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.890
And I said yes.

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:59.870
And as soon as my body gave me
permission to leave, I left.

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:01.590
Of all of the
places in the world

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:03.950
to go, for whatever
reason, I wanted

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:06.620
to go see Queen Elizabeth.

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:11.660
Please don't ask me why a
29-year-old black male wanted

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:12.980
to go see Queen Elizabeth.

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:14.450
I don't know.

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:16.280
But that's who I wanted to see.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.970
And in my mind, I visualized.

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:20.480
And showing up at the
palace, I told the guard

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.480
that I was there
to see the queen.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:24.180
They goes in.

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:26.000
They tell the queen.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.980
She invites me in,
and we sit down.

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:30.830
And we talked about Prince
Charles, Prince William,

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:36.460
Prince Harry, and of course, the
tragedy of Lady Princess Diana.

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.560
About 30 minutes into
this conversation,

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.750
the queen realized
that she hadn't

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:42.420
offered me anything to drink.

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:44.440
And she finally
looked at me, and she

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.192
said, (ENGLISH
ACCENT) Mr. Hinton,

00:23:47.192 --> 00:23:50.140
would you like some tea?

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:51.942
And I told her I
would love some tea.

00:23:51.942 --> 00:23:53.650
And she said, (ENGLISH
ACCENT) what would

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:55.490
you like in your tea?

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:57.490
And I told her some lemon.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:59.740
She tell the guard to go
out and bring me some lemon,

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:03.130
and I put the lemon in my
tea, and we continued to talk.

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:07.560
And I finally stand up and tell
the queen, I must be leaving.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:12.290
Now that I can go wherever
I want in my mind,

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:13.380
I didn't stop there.

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.490
I decided that I
would do something

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:17.990
that I said I would never do.

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:19.760
I decided that I
would get married.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:23.270
And as a young boy, I said
I would never get married.

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:26.720
But I decided that I would
marry the talented and beautiful

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.900
actress, Halle Berry.

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:33.350
Halle Berry and I
stayed married up here

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:37.040
for 15 long, beautiful years.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.410
And if there's such a
thing as a perfect wife,

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:42.260
Halle Berry was
the perfect wife.

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:45.530
She always said, yes,
dear, and it's OK, dear.

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:50.270
And what I loved most about
her, she didn't spend any money.

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:53.680
And then the guard was there
calling me, and he said,

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:57.537
Anthony, I've been calling
you for 10 minutes.

00:24:57.537 --> 00:24:58.120
Where you was?

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:00.840
I said, I was gone.

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.160
He said, Anthony, you
have a legal visit.

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:06.050
I said, I don't have an attorney
because the state of Alabama

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:09.050
don't appoint you an attorney
during post-conviction.

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:11.000
He said, Anthony, well,
somebody is out there

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.530
pretending to be a lawyer.

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:16.454
Why don't you get dressed
and go see who it is?

00:25:16.454 --> 00:25:17.870
I get dressed, and
I go out there,

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:20.810
and there's this
lawyer from Boston.

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:22.920
I asked his lawyer who sent him.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:26.330
He tell me a man by the name
of Bryan Stevenson of Equal

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:27.890
Justice Initiative.

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:30.260
I asked this lawyer,
who was Bryan Stevenson,

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:32.180
and who was Equal
Justice Initiative?

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:34.270
And he began to tell me.

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:37.964
He tell me how great this
Mr. Bryan Stevenson is.

00:25:37.964 --> 00:25:39.380
And I looked at
this lawyer, and I

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:41.600
said, you keep
telling me how good

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.310
and how great
Bryan Stevenson is.

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:46.580
But he can't be
that good, I said,

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:50.910
for because he have already
made one fundamental mistake.

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:53.010
And he said, what would that be?

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:54.990
I said, did you not
say you from Boston?

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:56.550
He said yes.

00:25:56.550 --> 00:26:00.570
I said, well, had this great
Mr. Bryan Stevenson contact me

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:05.320
first, he would have known
that I am a beloved Yankee fan.

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:08.230
And there's no way a
Yankee fan and a Boston fan

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:10.390
could ever work together.

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:12.960
I said, but for your
sake, I'm willing to put

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:17.380
my personal feelings aside
and let you work on my case.

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:21.210
And for the next three years,
this lawyer worked on my case.

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:23.820
Came back every year to
tell me what he was doing,

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:26.460
what he was trying
to do, and then going

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:29.790
into the fourth year, he
said, Anthony, I really

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:35.210
believe I can get you
a life without parole.

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:38.600
And I said, get who a
life without parole?

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.440
And he said I can get you.

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.770
I said, life without parole
is for guilty people,

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:45.610
not innocent people.

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:48.660
I said, I told you
that I am innocent.

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.500
I said, you want me
to stand up and say

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:52.750
that I did something
when I didn't

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:55.420
in order to save my life.

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:58.900
I said, I could never
stand up and tell that lie.

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:01.960
I said, if the
state of Alabama is

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.870
hell bent on executing
me for a crime

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:08.410
we know that I didn't
commit, so be it.

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:12.526
I said, at some point, at
some time, all of us must die.

00:27:12.526 --> 00:27:15.460
I said, but I don't want
to die, and I definitely

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:18.514
don't want to die for
something that I didn't do.

00:27:18.514 --> 00:27:22.300
I said, but I would never stand
up and say I did something

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:25.010
when I didn't do it.

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:26.750
I said, I'm fixing
to tell you something

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:31.554
that my mother told me
when I was 12 years old.

00:27:31.554 --> 00:27:32.970
My mother called
me, and she said,

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:38.330
if you are man enough to
bend down and pick up a rock,

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:41.390
and if you're man enough
to throw that rock,

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:45.580
you should be man enough to
say you throwed that rock.

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:49.970
I said, this is one
rock I didn't throw.

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:53.200
Therefore, I could never stand
up and say I throwed this rock

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.840
when I didn't.

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.660
I said, and since you
don't believe in me,

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:59.874
I have no choice
but to fire you.

00:27:59.874 --> 00:28:01.540
He looked, and he
said, are you serious?

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:03.200
I said yes.

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.180
I said, I need a lawyer
that believes in me,

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:07.260
but more important,
I need a lawyer

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:10.890
that is willing to go to
jail for me if necessary.

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:14.100
I said, but I really truly
thank you for what you've done

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:16.420
and what you were trying to do.

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:20.550
I said, and after today,
you no longer represent me.

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:22.230
And as he was going
out the front door,

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:24.270
and they were taking
me back toward my cell,

00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:25.890
something in my
mind said, you've

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:28.830
got to be the dumbest
person in the world.

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.760
You fired the only
lawyer that you had.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:34.530
And just as that thought entered
my mind, another thought said,

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:36.360
you did the right thing.

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.370
Always stand up for
what you believe in.

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:40.530
Always stand up for principle.

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:44.070
And as I got closer to my cell,
the guard was watching TV.

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:46.890
And I asked this guard
what was he watching.

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:49.760
He said, I'm watching
Bryan Stevenson.

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.300
And I said, oh, that's the man.

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.240
I said, you mind if I stand
here and listen at him a moment?

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:55.560
He says, sure.

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.920
Bryan Stevenson was talking
about why we don't need a death

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:01.380
penalty in this country,
and for whatever reason,

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:03.930
I knew at that moment
this is the man

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:06.300
that I needed to represent me.

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.030
Later that night, I
wrote Mr. Stevenson

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:12.420
my letter thanking him
for sending the lawyer,

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:15.150
and I told Mr. Stevenson
that I would like

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:17.800
for him to become my lawyer.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:21.240
I said, but before you
say yes or no, all I ask

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.910
is that you read my transcript.

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:26.910
I said, once you read my
transcript, if you find

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:31.150
one thing in my transcript
that points to my guilt,

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:33.210
do not worry about
becoming my lawyer.

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:35.610
Do not worry about
sending me a lawyer.

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:38.880
I am perfectly willing
to die for something

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.720
that I know I didn't do
and the state of Alabama

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.530
know I didn't do.

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:45.390
About three months
later, I get a reply

00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:49.680
from Mr. Stevenson saying
he would read my transcript.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:52.380
Five months later,
I get a letter

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:55.960
saying that he had
made arrangements

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.810
to come to death row to see me.

00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:02.600
I cannot explain, but the
moment I shook this man's hand,

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:05.950
I knew that God had
sent me his best lawyer.

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:10.040
And as we sit there, we
talked about our childhoods.

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:11.680
And finally, we
got into the case.

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:16.450
I said, Mr. Stevenson,
if no two guns is alike,

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:19.930
the state of Alabama is lying,
and I know they're lying.

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:26.030
If no two guns is alike,
those bullets couldn't match.

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:29.202
And I said, Mr. Stevenson,
I need you to do me a favor.

00:30:29.202 --> 00:30:31.660
He looked me at me, and he
said, what is the favor? i said,

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:37.660
I need you to hire a
qualified ballistic expert.

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:46.880
I said, Mr. Stevenson, all
my life I lived in the South.

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:53.540
I don't want you to hire
just any qualified expert,

00:30:53.540 --> 00:31:00.990
but I need this qualified
expert to be a white Southerner,

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:04.110
and he must be a male.

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:09.440
I said, Mr. Stevenson, you
can go out and find the best

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:12.170
white female in the country.

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:14.300
Her word is no good
on the witness stand

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:17.810
in the state of Alabama.

00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:24.540
I said, and it definitely
cannot be a person of color.

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:31.660
I said, Mr. Stevenson, it has
to be a white Southern male.

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:37.620
The state of Alabama only
recognize one of their own.

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:41.930
And I said, Mr. Stevenson,
I need this white man

00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:46.880
to be the best of the best.

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:50.150
I need him to believe
in the death penalty.

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:55.990
But above all of that, I need
him to just tell the truth.

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:58.060
Mr. Stevenson left
that day and told me

00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:04.990
that he would try and find
this particular expert.

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:06.940
About six months
later, I get a call

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:08.930
that said call your attorney.

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:14.190
He tells me that he found three
of the world-renowned experts.

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:18.850
Two of them live in Texas, and
one of them live in Virginia.

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:23.680
He said, they are
the best of the best.

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.300
He said, but I
need to inform you

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:31.750
that these three men only
testify for the prosecution.

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:35.810
They have never testified
for the defense.

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:38.035
He said, in other words,
what I'm trying to tell you,

00:32:38.035 --> 00:32:41.440
these men put men on death row.

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:46.350
They have never
testified to get one off.

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:49.780
I said Mr. Stevenson, did
you remember to ask them

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:52.880
would they just tell the truth?

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.510
And he said, they
said they would tell

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:58.320
exactly what the evidence say.

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:02.110
I said, if you can afford
it, hire those three men.

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:05.530
I can't tell you the date
that they came to Alabama,

00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:09.490
but they came on three
separate occasions.

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:13.200
Every one of them did
their own testing,

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.210
and then they came
to the conclusion

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:18.630
that the bullets that the state
of Alabama said match indeed

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:20.250
did not match.

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:22.530
They even did
something that I didn't

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:23.920
know they were trying to do.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:25.770
They even tried to
make the gun match,

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:28.260
and they still
couldn't make it match.

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:31.230
We get this new evidence, and
we go to the attorney general,

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:34.260
a man by the name
of Bill Pryor, ask

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:36.900
him to re-examine the bullets.

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:39.600
And he was quoted as
saying, "it would be

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:42.000
a waste of the taxpayer money.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.230
It would be a waste of my time
to take one hour to reexamine

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:48.870
those bullets."

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:52.990
And for not doing his
job, George W. Bush

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:59.570
appointed him to a federal
lifetime appointment.

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:03.130
Once he leave office, another
attorney general take over,

00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:09.580
and he too refused to take one
hour to reexamine the bullets.

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:12.230
He lose in the next
election, and a man

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:15.980
by the name of Luther Strange--

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:20.239
we go to him, and he too
refused to take one hour

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:24.310
to reexamine the bullets.

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:30.530
I sit on Alabama death
row an extra 16 years,

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:35.850
and while i was
sitting there, I lost

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:37.360
the love of my life, my mother.

00:34:40.199 --> 00:34:42.750
And I told them Mr
Stevenson, once I found out

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:47.730
that my mother had passed,
I told Mr. Stevenson

00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:51.550
I didn't give a damn
about that case.

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:54.261
If the state of Alabama
wanted to hang me,

00:34:54.261 --> 00:34:55.219
they could do it today.

00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:57.750
If the state of Alabama
wanted to execute me,

00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:59.070
they can do it today.

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:01.170
I don't care no more.

00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:07.430
I didn't see me being in
the world without my mother.

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:09.450
And I hung up.

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:10.630
I didn't say goodbye.

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:12.270
I didn't say thank you.

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:14.040
And as I tried to
lay down that night,

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:18.630
it was as though my mother came
in my cell and stayed in my ear

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:21.870
all night telling me that
she didn't bring me up

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:23.850
to be a quitter.

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:25.920
I could hear my
mother telling me,

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.670
I've always taught you to fight.

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:36.630
My mother had been my biggest
cheerleader all my life.

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:39.170
When I did good, she was
there to cheer me on,

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:41.330
and when I did bad,
she was there to say,

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:44.220
you'll get them next time.

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:48.020
And early that morning, I called
Mr. Stevenson to apologize,

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:53.130
and I told him that I wanted
him to give the state of Alabama

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:55.290
as much hell as
he possibly could.

00:35:57.810 --> 00:36:00.170
We went before 14
judges in Alabama,

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:02.690
and they all refused
to do the right thing.

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:04.790
And finally, Mr.
Stevenson said, I

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:07.330
need to take your case to the
United States Supreme Court.

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:11.730
He said, but I
need to inform you

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:14.470
that if the United States
Supreme Court ruled

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:18.210
against you, in two years,
the state of Alabama

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:21.880
will execute you.

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:23.630
I looked at Mr.
Stevenson, and I said,

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:28.670
take my case to the United
States Supreme Court.

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:31.760
Two years after filing my case
to the United States Supreme

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:35.810
Court, they did something
that they have never done

00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:38.120
in the history of the courts.

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:43.070
All nine judges
ruled in my favor.

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:44.770
They sent the case
back to Alabama.

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:48.240
We go before a trial judge.

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.150
The prosecution stand
up, and say, Your Honor,

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:54.450
it is with deep
sadness that we have

00:36:54.450 --> 00:37:00.420
to inform this court that we
have lost the gun in question.

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:05.720
The judge give them time
to relocate the gun.

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:06.830
She set a court date.

00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:08.337
We go back.

00:37:08.337 --> 00:37:10.170
They comes in, and they
said, Your Honor, it

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:13.880
is with great pleasure that we
inform the court that we found

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:16.370
the gun, but it is
with sadness that we

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:19.100
have to inform the
court again now

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:23.740
we have lost the bullets
that goes to the gun.

00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:27.430
And all this time,
I'm sitting in jail

00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:30.280
thinking that the prosecutor
had lost the bullets,

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:35.380
but he had his own expert
re-examine the bullets.

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:39.610
The man that said that the
bullets matched 30 years ago

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:43.400
was called back to
ask to re-examine.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:48.680
Only this time, he
examined the bullets,

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:52.950
and he informed the prosecutor
that the bullets do not

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:59.620
match the way they
matched 30 years ago.

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:01.750
But the bullets matched
exactly the same

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:04.210
that they did 30 years ago.

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:05.770
Bullets are like fingerprints.

00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:07.930
They don't change.

00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:13.890
My life was not worth
them telling the truth.

00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:21.710
30 years ago, I didn't have
the lawyer that I had in 2005.

00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:25.430
Now the state of Alabama
cannot no longer tell a lie.

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:27.440
Not only did I have
a better lawyer,

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:31.310
but I had three of the
world-renowned experts who was

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:34.250
waiting to debate this thing.

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:36.770
The expert even challenged
the state expert.

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:41.042
Come and show us how
you got this match.

00:38:41.042 --> 00:38:42.990
The expert in Alabama refused.

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:57.410
30 years of pure hell all
because the color of my skin.

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:05.040
The state of Alabama
had every intention

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:09.460
to execute an innocent
man, and had it not

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:14.080
been for Bryan Stevenson,
I wouldn't be here today.

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:19.890
Had it not been
for those experts

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:22.800
that was willing
to tell the truth,

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.650
I wouldn't be here today.

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:29.595
The state of Alabama was seeking
justice and the highest justice

00:39:29.595 --> 00:39:31.470
that they could.

00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:33.401
And that would be to execute me.

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:41.955
Tomorrow will be three
years that I've been free.

00:39:46.330 --> 00:40:02.150
And to this day, not a one
have had the decency to say,

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:04.850
Mr. Hinton, we're sorry.

00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:18.030
Have they not apologized because
I was born a person of color?

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:24.110
Everyday, in my mind,
I tried to find out

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:32.100
why nobody have had the
decency to say I'm sorry.

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:44.310
The state of Alabama
was seeking justice,

00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:50.680
and I've come to Seattle to
ask you one profound question.

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:55.580
Where's my justice?

00:40:58.210 --> 00:41:01.630
Where do I get justice from?

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:10.150
Better yet, who do
I get justice from?

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:16.350
All of you perhaps think that
the justice system is blind.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.140
That is exactly what
they want you to believe,

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:24.350
that the justice
system is blind.

00:41:24.350 --> 00:41:25.880
Every now and then,
they will show

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:29.750
you this lady with a
mask over her face,

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:31.250
and you see this blindfold.

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:39.110
But she knows exactly
what race you are.

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:42.110
She knows exactly
what gender you are.

00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:45.140
She knows exactly what
college you went to.

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:48.830
She knows exactly what
neighborhood you live in.

00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:52.590
She knows exactly something
that perhaps all of us

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:54.800
don't want her to know.

00:41:54.800 --> 00:42:00.200
She knows exactly how much
money you have in the bank,

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:03.840
and she put all of
those things together.

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:06.230
And when you find yourself
in her court room,

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:08.860
it will have already
been determined

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:11.331
whether you're going to be
found guilty or not guilty.

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:16.700
We have two sets of
justice in this world.

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:18.780
For those of you who have
been fortunate enough

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:22.680
to have money, inherit
money, or however you got it,

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:25.860
you have the ability
to buy justice.

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:32.600
For those of us who play
fair and don't have anything,

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:36.530
we are the ones that is filling
up the prison because we cannot

00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:41.480
afford a decent defense.

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:44.850
There is over two
million men and women

00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:46.980
incarcerated in this country.

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:50.910
That is more people than in
some third world country,

00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:54.720
and some of them
are there simply

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:56.790
because of the
color of their skin,

00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:59.010
and there is those
that are there

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:03.420
because they didn't have the
money to hire decent defense.

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:13.700
I ask you, where's my justice?

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:19.210
I ask you, what would you
do if they came for you?

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:22.400
What would you do if you
were charged with a crime you

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.010
know you didn't commit?

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:28.160
What would you do if you
didn't have the money

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:31.250
to pay for a defense?

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:34.820
What would you do if you
took a polygraph test

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:39.170
and passed, but yet
no one believed you?

00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:43.730
What would you do if the
judicial system looked at you

00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:48.380
more for the color of your skin
than the merits of your case?

00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:52.160
What would you do if you
was sentenced to death?

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:56.060
What would you do if you had
to spend the rest of your life

00:43:56.060 --> 00:44:00.210
in a cell the size
of your bathroom?

00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:05.770
What would you do if you've been
waiting all your life to die

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:08.380
for a crime you didn't commit?

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:11.470
How would you survive?

00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:18.460
What would you do after 30
years they finally set you free?

00:44:21.352 --> 00:44:25.180
Now who would you be?

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:26.626
What would you do?

00:44:30.482 --> 00:44:39.850
That book is the second greatest
book that's ever been written.

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:42.160
I know because I know
the author of that book.

00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:52.080
I know that that book will
touch you in some way.

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:56.130
That book put the
legal system on trial.

00:44:56.130 --> 00:44:59.960
That book put you
on trial if you

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:02.730
is one that believe
in the death penalty.

00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:06.120
That book will ask
you look at this name

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.070
and see can you
tell who is innocent

00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:13.380
and who is guilty, because my
name was once on that list.

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:15.120
And as you read his
book, I want you

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:17.130
to put your name on that list.

00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:21.660
And after every ten
name, say innocent.

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:27.300
Every day in this country, the
government kills in your name.

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:29.010
It don't matter that
you live in Seattle.

00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:33.540
You are still responsible for
the government in Alabama.

00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:35.700
No matter how you go
home and wash your hand

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:37.770
and put on this
good smelling soap

00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:43.170
or whatever, that innocent
blood is still on your hands,

00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:47.430
because we as
citizens, we sit by.

00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:48.380
And we say nothing.

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:50.510
We do nothing.

00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:53.180
We allow the government
to do as they please,

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:56.810
and they would have you
to believe that they

00:45:56.810 --> 00:45:59.570
are doing the right thing.

00:45:59.570 --> 00:46:06.390
I was the 152nd exoneree
that had got off death row.

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:08.400
How many men and
women need to be

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:14.280
exonerated before we
as a country decide

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:15.940
that enough is enough?

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:18.000
We don't need no death penalty.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.900
Because once we execute
someone that is innocent,

00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:25.540
and once we find out that
they truly was innocent,

00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:28.340
there is no coming back.

00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:32.120
I am a true believer that
what affect me today could

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:34.800
very well affect you tomorrow.

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.030
Ask yourself.

00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:39.470
I could have been your
father, your brother.

00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:43.120
I could have been
your best friend.

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:49.650
Ask yourself how would you feel
if the system that you know

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:52.810
would take your father,
someone you love,

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:58.090
someone you care about, and
put them in a hole for 30 years

00:46:58.090 --> 00:47:01.090
and have every intention
of executing them simply

00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:03.250
because they didn't
have the money,

00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:08.890
simply because they was born
of a different skin tone.

00:47:08.890 --> 00:47:12.800
Ask yourself how would you feel,
because I've had people come up

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:14.660
to me and say, Mr.
Hinton, I'm truly

00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:17.730
sorry for what happened to you.

00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:22.770
But isn't that the price we
pay for having law and order?

00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:24.560
And I looks at those
people that tells me

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:27.820
that, you have a
right to your opinion,

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:31.460
but I would like to ask
you to be honest with me.

00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:36.250
Would you feel that way if
I had been your brother,

00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:40.570
if I had been your father, if
I had been your grandfather,

00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:43.720
if I had been someone that
you truly love and care about?

00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:46.070
Would you feel that is
the price that we pay?

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:50.380
The system is badly broken.

00:47:53.110 --> 00:47:56.520
I'm at an age where it
won't affect me much longer,

00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:59.190
but I worry about
you young people.

00:47:59.190 --> 00:48:03.360
You must ask yourself
what type of legal system

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:07.830
you want to inherit, and
better yet, what type of system

00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:14.000
you want your
children to inherit,

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:20.660
if you're satisfied to
let it stay the way it is.

00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:23.690
If you're not satisfied,
I often tell people,

00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:26.810
I don't believe in
marching in the streets.

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:29.660
I believe in marching
to the ballot box.

00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:32.090
And I believe in voting.

00:48:32.090 --> 00:48:37.050
And I believe in voting the
way that we need to vote.

00:48:37.050 --> 00:48:38.900
I do not vote on racial lines.

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:41.400
And I do not vote on gender.

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:45.200
I do my homework.

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:49.100
I ask the tough question.

00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:51.620
And if a politician
would have you

00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:56.790
to believe that you are more
safe by having a death penalty,

00:48:56.790 --> 00:49:00.420
that politician is lying to you.

00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:03.675
Statistics shows that states
that don't a death penalty,

00:49:03.675 --> 00:49:06.990
the murder rate is
far less than states

00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:10.962
that have a death penalty.

00:49:10.962 --> 00:49:16.970
I hope that once
you read his book,

00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:19.480
you will change your heart.

00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:21.940
It will teach you
about forgiveness.

00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:28.600
In this book, if you read
nothing else, read about a man

00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:32.455
that I became friends with that
was a KKK member, a man that

00:49:32.455 --> 00:49:35.770
had went out in the street
and hung a young black man

00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:38.140
in the middle of the streets.

00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:41.740
And everybody was looking at
this man because he had three

00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:47.620
Ks in front of his name, and
I erased those three K's.

00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:50.620
All of this man's
life, from the day

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:54.370
he was in his mother's
womb, his mother, his daddy,

00:49:54.370 --> 00:49:55.870
taught him to hate.

00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:58.750
His community
taught him to hate.

00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:01.250
And I asked a profound
question, where

00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:04.570
was Child Protective Services
when this young boy was

00:50:04.570 --> 00:50:07.030
being taught to hate?

00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:09.520
Where was this village
that we often say--

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:11.760
it take a village
to raise a child--

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:14.350
where was this village
when this young man

00:50:14.350 --> 00:50:17.210
was being taught to hate?

00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:18.980
I didn't hear from
the village until it

00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:24.500
was time for him to be tried
and convicted in this village

00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:27.410
sentence him to death.

00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:32.921
And when he came to death row,
just as he was taught to hate,

00:50:32.921 --> 00:50:38.600
I, along with other blacks,
taught him how to love.

00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:41.820
And on the night
of his execution,

00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:43.490
they ask you two things.

00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:46.300
What would you like
for your final meal,

00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:49.360
and do you have anything
you would like say?

00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:56.550
I am proud to stand here and say
that my friend, Henry Francis

00:50:56.550 --> 00:51:00.240
Hays, left this world
saying, that all

00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:03.980
of my life, my mother
and father, my community,

00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:07.190
taught me to hate.

00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:09.180
But the very people
they taught me to hate

00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:13.830
are the people that
taught me how to love.

00:51:13.830 --> 00:51:18.930
And Henry Hays final
words was, "in this night,

00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:25.690
I leave this world now knowing
what true love feels like."

00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:27.760
Just as someone
teaches you something,

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:29.760
someone can teach
you another thing.

00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:35.520
Today, I hope that I
have said something

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:43.822
that will make you go home and
think about a corrupt system

00:51:43.822 --> 00:51:48.030
that at some point
and some time you

00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:51.570
will come face to face with.

00:51:51.570 --> 00:51:54.824
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
for listening to my story.

00:51:54.824 --> 00:51:58.776
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:10.632 --> 00:52:11.620
Thank you.

00:52:16.066 --> 00:52:18.786
Thank you.

00:52:18.786 --> 00:52:20.660
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
coming in and telling

00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:21.770
your story today.

00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:24.180
And I wondered now that
you've gone through this,

00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:28.520
and now that you understand how
the legal system has failed you

00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:32.810
here, do you have
thoughts or advice

00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:37.490
about how we can prevent the
legal system from continuing

00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:40.850
to do this and to shine more
transparency on the cases like,

00:52:40.850 --> 00:52:43.670
for instance, when
you said repeatedly

00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:48.340
that the state would
not look at your case,

00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:50.220
spend an hour
looking at your case?

00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:53.450
And is there something that
could bring transparency

00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:56.937
to that type of
failure for justice?

00:52:56.937 --> 00:52:58.520
ANTHONY RAY HINTON:
Well, let me first

00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:03.880
say that as long as we have a
death penalty in this country,

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:07.370
whether it's through human
error or through pure racism

00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:09.630
or whatever, we're
going to continue

00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:12.500
to execute innocent people.

00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:16.280
The only way we will never
execute innocent people

00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:19.640
is that we don't have a death
penalty in the first place.

00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:24.650
But during my years
on death row when

00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:28.290
we went to the attorney
general and asked

00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:30.860
for him to reexamine
the evidence,

00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:36.410
there is no law that governs
them to reexamine the evidence.

00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:40.820
I think we need to have a
law placed in every state

00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:44.150
that when there is a
question of evidence,

00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:46.940
they should be made to go
back and recheck the evidence.

00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:51.080
And if you still disagree,
someone, as an independent,

00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:54.050
should come in and
settle this dispute.

00:53:54.050 --> 00:53:56.380
There's no reason your
tax dollars should

00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:59.720
have been wasted on
me for 30 years when

00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:01.760
we could have resolved this.

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:04.130
But as long as the United
States Supreme Court

00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:08.270
have given something that--
perhaps none of you know.

00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:11.780
The United States Supreme
Court have given prosecutors

00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:13.190
a blank check.

00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:15.140
They can't be sued.

00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:16.590
They can get up there and lie.

00:54:16.590 --> 00:54:20.120
They can get up there
and fabricate evidence.

00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:22.550
And you can prove
that they did it,

00:54:22.550 --> 00:54:24.920
but you then can't turn
around and sue them.

00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:26.360
But here's the kicker.

00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:28.670
If you get up and
lie for anyone,

00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:30.860
and they prove
later that you lied,

00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:33.470
the prosecution can
charge you with perjury.

00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:35.090
I just believe that
all of us should

00:54:35.090 --> 00:54:37.730
be up under the same
rules and regulation.

00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:39.630
If you can be
charged with perjury,

00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:43.550
why shouldn't the prosecutor
be charged with the same thing?

00:54:43.550 --> 00:54:45.680
We need to study and
make our laws better

00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:47.090
and equal for everybody.

00:54:47.090 --> 00:54:50.280
And I just think that these
types of problems won't occur.

00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:53.030
But as long as we have
the system the way

00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:54.710
it is, and we've
been led to believe

00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:58.780
that the state have the right--

00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:01.580
they are the ones who have to
prove whether you did something

00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:04.400
or don't-- you're the one
that have to prove that you

00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:05.360
didn't do it.

00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:07.850
And if you don't have
the money to prove it,

00:55:07.850 --> 00:55:09.990
chances are you won't prove it.

00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:12.500
And I just think we need
better laws put on the book

00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:16.580
to force the prosecutor to
re-examine the evidence.

00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:20.420
We need to outlaw the fact
that they can't be sued.

00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:24.380
Because what prosecutors won't
go out there and just tell

00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:26.210
lies to get a conviction?

00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:29.000
His motive is to get as
many convictions he can,

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:32.030
and then he wants to
be up for judgeship.

00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:34.820
And he want to be able
say, I sent more men

00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:35.840
to Alabama death row.

00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:39.110
I sent more men and women to
prison than any other judge.

00:55:39.110 --> 00:55:42.710
But what he don't tell you,
most of them was fabricated.

00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:44.790
Most of them was lies
and [INAUDIBLE] lies.

00:55:44.790 --> 00:55:49.340
And I just think that it is
unfair that you can be charged

00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:51.260
for lying, and he can't.

00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:53.881
That's a double standard,
and I'm against that.

00:55:53.881 --> 00:55:56.130
SPEAKER: Thank you very much
for coming to talk to us.

00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:57.380
ANTHONY RAY HINTON: Thank you.

00:55:57.380 --> 00:56:01.280
