00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.020
Determine whether the
statement is always,

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.990
sometimes, or never true,
and explain why.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.760
So the statement is, 3x is
greater than or equal to x for

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.380
all real numbers x.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.090
Well let's try it out with
a couple of numbers.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.010
If you try it out with-- let's
say x is equal to 0.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:24.810
If x is equal to 0, then
3x is equal to 0.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:32.460
Which is equal to 0, which
is equal to x.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.590
So in this situation, if x is
equal to 0, 3x is indeed

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.160
greater than or equal to x.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.860
In this case, it is equal.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.500
So we know that it's definitely
not never true.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.050
And we could try other
situations.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.510
If you put a 1 here, 3 times 1
is 3, which is greater than or

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.870
equal to 1.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.040
So it is either always
or sometimes true.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.630
To cross out always, we just
have to think of a

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.450
counterexample.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.310
And a good counterexample would
be a negative number.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:07.125
If x is negative 1, if x
is equal to negative

00:01:07.125 --> 00:01:09.610
1, then what happens?

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.550
Then 3x is equal to negative 3
and x-- well, we already said

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.070
x is equal to negative 1.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.300
And in that situation, negative
3 is not greater than

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.810
or equal to negative 1.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.190
And negative 3 is not greater
than or equal to negative 1.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.210
It's less than negative 1.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.430
So this is a counterexample.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.790
This is not true.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.180
In general, it's not going
to be true for

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.440
all negative numbers.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.000
So it's definitely not always.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.170
It's only sometimes true.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.240
It's only true in the case
when you're dealing with

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.800
non-negative numbers.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.590
So it's only sometimes true.
