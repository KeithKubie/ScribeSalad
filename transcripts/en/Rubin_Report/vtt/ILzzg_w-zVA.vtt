1
00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.080
[inaudible].

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.640
So what are some of the policies of the new,
if the new right becomes,

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.640
takes over the conservative movement or,
right.

4
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.850
So whatever that is,
that whether they burn the thing down or where they,

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.580
whether they infiltrated or whatever,
the,

6
00:00:18.581 --> 00:00:21.600
the people that care about these ideas broadly that you're talking about,

7
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.760
what does it actually look like politically?

8
00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:25.830
Like what are the things that they would be fighting for?

9
00:00:25.831 --> 00:00:30.831
Polisci this is what's hilarious is you have a group who's United only by their

10
00:00:31.291 --> 00:00:34.080
oppositions.
Progressivism.
What do you want to do?

11
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.940
They have no even close to unanimity.
Someone UN,
military,

12
00:00:38.941 --> 00:00:43.460
John Down like just martial law.
Some like me,
not for me.
Not For me.
Okay.

13
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.270
Thank you.
All right,
good.
Uh,
someone,
a complete liberty meaning anarchy,
uh,

14
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.830
somewhat,
um,
a restriction of the right to vote.
Uh,

15
00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:54.180
some want to accelerate,

16
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.030
they want more leftism cause they think if you accelerate and amplify,

17
00:00:57.031 --> 00:00:59.400
the system is going to collapse because cause the inherent contradictions and

18
00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:04.401
leftism so you have no consensus whatsoever about what the next steps.

19
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.650
And same thing with like for example,
they think people think,
oh,

20
00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:12.100
everyone in this group likes Trump.
Some of them love Trump completely.
And,

21
00:01:12.101 --> 00:01:14.880
and uh,
unabashedly and culture who I've talked about in this book,

22
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.090
she's come out very hard against him and I think she called him a moron or

23
00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:21.300
something like that.
What do you make of her related to Trump?

24
00:01:21.301 --> 00:01:22.890
It was like she was huge pro Trump,

25
00:01:22.891 --> 00:01:25.920
but then he's not know he's not building the wall fast enough for her or a

26
00:01:25.921 --> 00:01:28.440
couple of the other things.
It's like subculture.

27
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.400
You still also some real politic involved culture used to be a real trial,
right?

28
00:01:32.401 --> 00:01:35.400
She knew how to say the exact right things to upset people.

29
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.330
Now she's gotten much more serious,
uh,
and ideological in her later books.
Uh,

30
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.450
it's interesting to see her relationship with Trump.

31
00:01:42.451 --> 00:01:46.200
I mean she said at one point she thought America was like 90%,
no chance.

32
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.380
Now it's maybe 40% because of Trump's election.
Uh,
she's very 90% of trans.

33
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.860
What that American's done,
we're done.
She thought it was like,

34
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.020
we're over 90% chance.
And then she was like,
okay,

35
00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:58.200
maybe it's 40% that were done because Trump got all that there.
Um,

36
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.100
I can't really speak for her,
but she is a very kind of a interesting character.

37
00:02:02.101 --> 00:02:05.730
And I discuss your ideas at length cause her book Adios America was probably the

38
00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:08.910
most influential book of the 2016 Election Cycle.

39
00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:12.900
That's the book where Trump got the idea of they're sending the rapists.
Uh,

40
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.310
who do you find you can debate with on the other side of this?
So I get you can,

41
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.760
you can be around people on the right that you disagree on a lot of these

42
00:02:20.761 --> 00:02:23.640
different things and you don't come out of the racist camp and all that stuff.

43
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.810
Do you find that there are some good actors on the left that you can engage
with?

44
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.460
Oh,
I have a lot.
Uh,
people like Glenn Greenwald,
Michael Tracy,

45
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.170
Jimmy door.
Um,
I actually don't debate cause I'm not interested in persuasion.

46
00:02:37.171 --> 00:02:38.160
I'm just there to have fun.

47
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.030
And I think debating is often a waste of time and it's always a waste of time.

48
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.840
I mean,
the cost benefits.
So I don't really do,

49
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.950
I've had a few people on my show who are,
you know,
pretty far left.

50
00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:51.330
No Mickey constant was on.
Uh,
I also you'd like to baiting with conservatives.
Um,

51
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.210
cause I really disagree with them and since I'm coming at them from this center

52
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.100
line on that,
uh,
conservatism,

53
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.950
conservatism is progressivism driving the speed limit.
So,
uh,

54
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.260
one of the things I discuss in this book is National Review.

55
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:06.860
My favorite Paleontology magazine in the late nineties,
they had this,
uh,

56
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.620
uh,
editorial comparing the fight for gay rights to a theoretical fife for

57
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:12.970
necrophilia and saying,

58
00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:15.520
what's the difference between fighting for two men to have sex with each other

59
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.560
as opposed to,
uh,
having sex with a corpse?

60
00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:19.750
And it was just a very disturbing article,

61
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.510
but now the conservative case for gay marriage.

62
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.040
So what are principles are there that would have you say that then and have you

63
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:32.020
say this now.
So it's disturbing then.
And the a hypocrisy is disturbing,
uh,

64
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.913
to this day as well.

65
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.600
<v 1>So you're,
you're more,
you care more about the hypocrisy of it,
not the,</v>

66
00:03:36.601 --> 00:03:37.980
you don't care about gay marriage.

67
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.030
<v 0>Well,
I,
I mean I care about both.
I mean,
if you're going to have a principal,</v>

68
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.530
I would have more respect for someone to be like,

69
00:03:42.531 --> 00:03:44.960
gay marriage is wrong because of the Bible,
blah,
blah,
blah,

70
00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.020
and stick to that as opposed to I'm anti gay then cause I'm the phony and now

71
00:03:50.121 --> 00:03:53.270
Mancy gay now cause I'm a phony.
You're bringing nothing to the table.

72
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.630
<v 1>Yeah.
But I mean you protect you specifically.
You don't care.
I do.</v>

73
00:03:57.631 --> 00:04:00.650
I wouldn't want,
I don't care.
I'm glad that you're married to that too.
Well,

74
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.550
that's what I meant.
I mean,
you don't care.
I mean,
Karen and negative sense.
Oh,

75
00:04:05.551 --> 00:04:09.290
of course.
No,
no.
Yeah,
no,
absolutely.
Please Mary.
Whatever you want.
Yeah.

76
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.090
Mary a corpse.
We'll know.
Well yeah,

77
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.160
but you do have limits only if they're good to like,
oh,

78
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.440
only if they're good then you can marry a quarter.
Yeah.
Um,

79
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.580
how crazy do you think things are going to get as we roll into 2020?

80
00:04:20.581 --> 00:04:21.720
Because I think we're still

81
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.730
<v 0>possible healthfully.
And here's something that I,</v>

82
00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:28.120
I've called that once I say no one can really kind of deny it.

83
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.920
A historically the president or the nominee hasn't really engaged with the other

84
00:04:32.921 --> 00:04:35.680
party's primary process.
For the first time in history,

85
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.950
a sitting president is going to be live tweeting the debates and the primary of

86
00:04:41.321 --> 00:04:44.770
the other team.
And not only that,
it's not like he's going to combinate like,
oh,

87
00:04:44.771 --> 00:04:49.270
I disagree with his economic plan.
He's loving nukes in his Trump Ian style.

88
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.570
And none of these 23 candidates are good to know what to do.

89
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.150
And none of their advisers who are getting paid a lot of money,

90
00:04:55.151 --> 00:04:57.760
social media experts,
I'm going to have know what to do.
There's no blueprint.

91
00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.540
And the question becomes,
is it a badge of honor that Trump is clowning me?

92
00:05:01.541 --> 00:05:05.380
Does that make me a strong candidate?
Do I ignore him?
Am I above the fray?

93
00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:07.780
Like historical people used to do like,
oh my opponent,
you know,

94
00:05:07.781 --> 00:05:11.680
that kind of stuff.
So this is going to be absolutely hilarious.

95
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.880
And you want that hilarity.
The more chaos,
the better politically.
Yeah.

96
00:05:15.881 --> 00:05:18.400
I don't want people to be able to get together and impose their will.

97
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.720
<v 1>So what if you were one of the 23,
what would you do</v>

98
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.090
as someone that knows how to play the trolling game that knows how to,
you know,

99
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.540
throw the bombs back,
let's say,
what would you do?
Trump.

100
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.550
So you're onstage trumps,
you know,
do it as Twitter thing.
You get off stage,

101
00:05:36.551 --> 00:05:37.420
you see what's going on,

102
00:05:37.421 --> 00:05:40.510
what would you do or what would you tell if you were an advisor to one of these

103
00:05:40.511 --> 00:05:41.740
people,
what would you do?
Oh,
well I,

104
00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.100
I know you don't want to give away all your texts have designed,

105
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.660
I would never advise it,
but in all seriousness,
uh,

106
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.740
<v 0>what I would do is if you look at when he was a comedy central roast and they</v>

107
00:05:52.171 --> 00:05:55.440
ask them beforehand,
they said,
what jokes can you make and can you make?

108
00:05:55.441 --> 00:05:59.690
The only thing he wasn't comfortable being joked about was that he's not as rich

109
00:05:59.691 --> 00:06:02.750
as he wants as he claims he is.
So since that's his line,

110
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:05.930
I would hit him with that line as much as possible.
But at the same time,

111
00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:09.170
it's hard to troll someone who is that?
You know,

112
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.690
Hiroshima in a China shop.
I mean,
he's easy.
It is,
but I don't,

113
00:06:13.691 --> 00:06:17.420
Justin Amash got him pretty good I think over the weekend with coming out in

114
00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:21.200
favor of impeachment.
I think that really ruffled his feathers were on the,
oh no.

115
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:23.210
You know what it is.
This is what I would hit him with.

116
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:28.100
I would say you brag during the campaign that you would hire the best and

117
00:06:28.101 --> 00:06:31.880
smartest people.
How come all these people are resigning,
you know,
and,

118
00:06:31.881 --> 00:06:35.360
and hit him with that.
His big core competency,
alleged core competency.

119
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.540
How competent do you think he is or it isn't a,

120
00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:40.940
I actually forgetting the tactic,

121
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.880
the trolling tactic and Twitter as competent as being president,

122
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:46.520
but as being protein.
It's hard to tell because there's,

123
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.940
I've that theory that probably isn't that crazy that when you become president,

124
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:51.260
they sit you down and they're like,
all right,

125
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:53.150
this is what you can do and this is what you can't do.

126
00:06:53.151 --> 00:06:55.460
The fact that Obama was droning everyone all the time.

127
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:59.720
It seems like it's out of his,
you know,
peacenik background or it could be that,

128
00:06:59.721 --> 00:07:02.480
you know,
he was a closet,
you know,
Hawk the whole time.
We don't know.

129
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.720
I don't think any of us really know what it's like to be president.

130
00:07:05.721 --> 00:07:10.721
The fact that he hasn't gotten a lot of his big promises through is kind of a

131
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:11.810
big deal.

132
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:16.810
The fact that he has taken on unprecedented opposition and his head is still

133
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.850
being held hide.
His approval ratings are still relatively high.

134
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.500
I mean that's a bit of an accomplishment.

135
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:25.520
So since you wrote a book on North Korea.
Yeah.
And there's been a little,

136
00:07:25.521 --> 00:07:26.570
I think last time I had you on,

137
00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:29.720
maybe they were in the beginnings of some of those discussions.

138
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.840
Where are we at with North Korea right now?
I am.

139
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:37.280
So North Korea has this secret weapon which causes everyone on earth to have

140
00:07:37.281 --> 00:07:38.114
amnesia.

141
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.660
And what happens is North Korea goes through these cycles as night follows day,

142
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:44.450
which is there'll be warmongers,
we're going to nuke America,

143
00:07:44.451 --> 00:07:48.890
we're going to kill everyone,
blah,
blah.
And then six months later we want peace.

144
00:07:48.891 --> 00:07:50.570
Please work with us,
please work with us.

145
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.200
And they've just gone back to the war cycle and everyone's like,
oh my God,

146
00:07:54.201 --> 00:07:57.320
we've never heard this for North Korea had sentence president Trump to death.

147
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:01.230
They were threatening to new Guam and Alaska and even previously that they were

148
00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:05.910
threatened in new Boston.
So it's,
this is how they this terrible,
oh,

149
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:08.090
come on now.
Um,

150
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.980
so this is where they are right now.
I am very hopeful.

151
00:08:12.981 --> 00:08:17.960
The thing I'm very happy with with president Trump is that North Korea is now on

152
00:08:17.961 --> 00:08:22.280
the front pages because we need to engage with this most evil country.

153
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.270
And I was on Fox and friends first or a while ago and they said,

154
00:08:26.271 --> 00:08:28.970
what is your big concern with the summit?

155
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.240
And I said to continuing enslavement of the North Korean people so that whenever

156
00:08:32.241 --> 00:08:34.490
you're looking at this issue,
always ask,
in my view,

157
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:39.640
what does this mean for these 20 million hostages who are being kept enslaved by

158
00:08:39.681 --> 00:08:44.420
this evil government that starved it's population on purpose during the 90s and

159
00:08:44.421 --> 00:08:46.820
killed one to 2 million people.
That's not funny.

160
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.840
So do you think that Trump is sort of the perfect person for this,

161
00:08:50.841 --> 00:08:55.010
that as North Korea vacillates back and forth with all this rhetoric that Trump

162
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:55.980
actually match them

163
00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.180
<v 1>at that and that might be the thing that kind of allows a detente</v>

164
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:01.660
<v 0>I don't know about perfect,</v>

165
00:09:01.661 --> 00:09:05.680
but I you have to have hope for these people especially,

166
00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:07.480
I mean not to sound whatever.

167
00:09:07.481 --> 00:09:10.030
Once you've been there and you've seen people there,

168
00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:12.700
everyone I met in North Korea is still there.

169
00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.540
Like every single person I saw on the street,
every kid,
every grandma.

170
00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.570
And it messes with your head because this is what 2012 they come into.

171
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.810
Your life has changed since 22 I'll think of much mine has and none of theirs

172
00:09:22.811 --> 00:09:24.910
has.
I still see my guide,
you know,

173
00:09:24.911 --> 00:09:27.550
pictures of her on Instagram and she's still trapped and she's like a

174
00:09:27.551 --> 00:09:31.360
millionaire there,
but she's still trapped in that prison with those Gildan bars.

175
00:09:31.361 --> 00:09:33.730
So it's very disturbing.

176
00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.650
How does an anarchist care about foreign policy?
Well,

177
00:09:37.651 --> 00:09:39.640
because this the go since the governments,
the enemy,

178
00:09:39.641 --> 00:09:43.330
this is the most evil government on earth.
This is a pretty,
uh,
easy syllogism.

179
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.410
<v 1>Interesting.
You don't really think about that though.</v>

180
00:09:46.411 --> 00:09:51.411
I mean generally when people think of a more libertarian view of the world,

181
00:09:51.661 --> 00:09:53.790
it's like,
no,
just let everybody do whatever the hell.

182
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.820
<v 0>Well,
I'm not going to let the government do whatever the hell they wanted these</v>

183
00:09:56.821 --> 00:09:59.460
people.
Yeah,
I mean,
and that's the other thing,
like we have it.

184
00:09:59.461 --> 00:10:03.330
So even though it's not your government,
these are human beings and you know,

185
00:10:03.331 --> 00:10:06.210
being born in the Soviet Union,
being Jewish,
these were two chances.

186
00:10:06.211 --> 00:10:08.310
My family could have been sent to a concentration camp.

187
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.280
So the fact that we have concentration camps right now,

188
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.600
that you could see them on Google earth,
you know what,
not high school,

189
00:10:13.601 --> 00:10:15.990
I was talk about how the Holocaust happened.
How the hell happened?

190
00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:19.920
Something similar happened in the 90s in North Korea against its own population.

191
00:10:19.921 --> 00:10:24.060
So this is something that maybe other people don't care.
But for me,

192
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.080
it's kind of like there,

193
00:10:25.081 --> 00:10:28.470
but for the grace of God go I and when I met the guy that I had,

194
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.970
she had the same haircut my mom had in like 1982 which is a cutting edge in

195
00:10:31.971 --> 00:10:36.180
North Korea,
but it's just looking at like a sliding doors thing and it's like,

196
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:36.931
holy crap,

197
00:10:36.931 --> 00:10:40.050
I could have been born here and instead of sitting here in my Willy Wonka

198
00:10:40.051 --> 00:10:42.600
costume,
you know,
who knows what would've happened to me.

199
00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:48.700
<v 1>What do you think's going to happen to the traditional conservatives?
Oh God,</v>

200
00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:49.211
I,

201
00:10:49.211 --> 00:10:54.211
I is it absolutely over because they can't withstand what's coming on both sides

202
00:10:54.681 --> 00:10:55.360
of it.

203
00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.550
<v 0>I don't see how they come back because I don't,</v>

204
00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:00.990
they didn't bring that much to the table to begin with as opposed to like give

205
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:05.260
it socking to the left and now Trump is talking to the left more than anyone

206
00:11:05.261 --> 00:11:07.920
else has.
I'm going to be talking to Ben domination,
you know,

207
00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.070
not that long from the federalists.

208
00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:14.010
And I'm very curious to hear his take on this book and this thesis because it

209
00:11:14.011 --> 00:11:17.200
could be because he's someone that is more of a traditional,
hardcore,
pure,

210
00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.650
conservative,
mutual respect.
I like him a lot.
Um,

211
00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:23.090
but I don't see how they regain,
uh,

212
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:26.980
this party especially because if one of the big issues with conservatism and

213
00:11:26.981 --> 00:11:28.720
maybe republicanism is young people,

214
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:34.200
young people are going to be drawn to humor and edginess and memes and they're

215
00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:38.080
not going to be drawn to kind of like a,
Hey,
remember Reagan?

216
00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:40.660
Reagan's great,
he ended the Cold War.

217
00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:43.870
But this is not going to be a selling point for your movement.
And also the,

218
00:11:43.871 --> 00:11:46.960
I think young people are also drawn to aggression,
um,

219
00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:50.440
and kind of flipping over tables.
And that's what the new right does offer them.

220
00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.130
<v 1>Are there political leaders outside of however much</v>

221
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.590
<v 0>Trump is involved in this?
Are there some other people that you like?</v>

222
00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:57.640
I know that's the weird thing.

223
00:11:57.641 --> 00:12:00.070
It's like you don't want a political leader per se,

224
00:12:00.071 --> 00:12:02.380
because you don't want to be personally who I like.
Yeah.

225
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:07.000
Well or that you think can sort of grab some of these pieces and do something

226
00:12:07.001 --> 00:12:11.140
good in your estimation?
Uh,
I can't,
I'm sure there are Tulsi Gabbard.

227
00:12:11.141 --> 00:12:15.720
I like anyone who brings more of the antiwar message.
Uh,

228
00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:17.410
funny you wrote a book called the New Right,

229
00:12:17.411 --> 00:12:21.910
and you're picking a candidate who running as a democrat.
Sure.
Anti War Democrat,

230
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.140
but I,
interesting.

231
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:28.200
I would love it if there was a complete consensus in Washington that war is a

232
00:12:28.421 --> 00:12:32.980
last resort and an absolute nightmare.
That is my goal.
So I just like,

233
00:12:32.981 --> 00:12:36.280
we agree that slavery is a nonstarter.
The like,
sure,

234
00:12:36.281 --> 00:12:38.260
I'll get the argument that maybe we have to go to war,

235
00:12:38.261 --> 00:12:40.720
but the fact that we can be so glib about it and be like,
oh yeah,

236
00:12:40.721 --> 00:12:42.910
we're just gonna add.
Here's another example.

237
00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:45.730
Do you think that we've crossed a little bit of a threshold when it comes to
war?

238
00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:48.550
I mean,
I feel like the mistakes of Iraq and nobody knows why the hell we're in

239
00:12:48.551 --> 00:12:51.950
Afghanistan still Trump is not beating wardrobes.
You know,
there's,

240
00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:55.780
there's stuff about,
there's always this over the top rhetoric related to Iran,

241
00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:58.840
but I see,
I don't sense,
this is a guy that wants to just,

242
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.550
I think he's actually very against the blog.
These nation building,

243
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.290
the blood lust of the establishment,
which I include.

244
00:13:05.291 --> 00:13:08.020
The corporate press cannot be overstated.
Uh,

245
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.980
when 2016 Trump's the nominee,
we heard it every single day.

246
00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:14.830
He's crazy.
He's going to give us to world war three.

247
00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:18.040
He's going to get pissed off at a tweet from China and press the nuclear button.

248
00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:19.360
Remember we heard this all the time.

249
00:13:19.361 --> 00:13:21.730
Carly fury and I got asked this the second debate,
the first question,

250
00:13:21.731 --> 00:13:24.250
do you trust president Trump with his finger on the nuclear button?

251
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:27.400
And now China has hacked our systems.

252
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:30.040
Russia has tried to interfere with our elections,

253
00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.640
and the press is constantly saying,
do something about it.
Do something about,

254
00:13:33.641 --> 00:13:35.130
do something.
I'd do something about Venezuela.

255
00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:39.880
So the fact that he's not getting us into world war three is not being used as a

256
00:13:39.881 --> 00:13:43.570
slight against him by the same people who regarded that as a problem when he was

257
00:13:43.571 --> 00:13:48.100
a nominee.
It's horrific.
And this has been a longtime coming.

258
00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:51.580
How much since,
uh,
the,
we talked about yellow journalism in high school.

259
00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:54.790
I remember the Spanish American war,
and then they pretend they went away.

260
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:58.540
It didn't go away.
The same press wants,
if it bleeds,
it leads.

261
00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.560
They can't wait to get us into another engagement.
It's,

262
00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:04.960
it's disgraceful what happened.
What has to happen with the press then?

263
00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.310
And I mean this in terms of cable news,
mainstream news,
Network News,

264
00:14:09.311 --> 00:14:12.700
I mean this vox Huffpo sure.
The battle is speed.

265
00:14:12.701 --> 00:14:16.810
All the battle is won when the average corporate journalist is regarded with the

266
00:14:16.811 --> 00:14:21.480
exact same way as the average tobacco executive.
They have a job.
Uh,

267
00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:25.840
they're promoting their product.
Their product is cancerous and deadly.

268
00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.600
They're often bright people.
They're often good people,

269
00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:30.940
but be aware of what it is that they're selling you.

270
00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.670
So how do we find some people to trust in the mix of all of this,

271
00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:39.100
in this big mess?
Uh,
trust,
trust,
but verify.
I mean,

272
00:14:39.101 --> 00:14:41.440
I'll use the Reagan.
I mean,
trust is,

273
00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:43.330
I'm not interested in trusting people initially in,
in,

274
00:14:43.331 --> 00:14:47.920
in a trusting ideas and creating mechanisms that people can't enforce their

275
00:14:47.921 --> 00:14:51.920
wills.
The trust won't be necessary.
Like I don't need to trust like Ebay,
right.

276
00:14:51.921 --> 00:14:56.050
I don't need to trust that other guy is going to be a honorable because there

277
00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:58.490
are different systems I can get my money refunded,
so and so forth.

278
00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:01.640
So there's no reason for me to have a political leader trust because

279
00:15:01.641 --> 00:15:03.860
systemically he's going to betray me at some point or another.

280
00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.360
<v 1>God,
there's a lot here at malice.
Thank you.</v>

281
00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.520
Take me somewhere else altogether.

282
00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:13.600
<v 0>W what do you mean?
Where else do you want to go in this conversation right now?</v>

283
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.490
Oh,
well I got,
I mean,
I've got a million things rattling here.
We're here.

284
00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.890
We're your humerus.
Yeah.
Doesn't it bother you?
I,

285
00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.880
one of the things I defend in this book is dark humor.

286
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.320
And here's the let's tie back to North Korea.
Yeah.
I knew a refugee and he said,

287
00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.170
so when people say that's not funny,
right?
Uh,

288
00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.120
it's this puritanism HL Mencken said,

289
00:15:31.121 --> 00:15:34.030
puritanism is the idea that someone somewhere is happy,
right?

290
00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.460
I knew this refugee North Korean refugee,

291
00:15:36.461 --> 00:15:39.160
and he went to high school here and he's talking to his friends and they go,
hey,

292
00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:41.680
remember when we were kids we had Pokemon?
And he goes,
yeah,

293
00:15:41.681 --> 00:15:43.900
except instead of Pokemon and watch my dad's starved to death.

294
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:48.840
Now are you going to tell him that's not appropriate?
Right,
right.
Are you,
uh,

295
00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:51.170
do you know what it's like to,
what is his coping mechanisms?
I use it.

296
00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:55.090
Do you know what it's like to watch someone's hungry,
starve to death?

297
00:15:55.091 --> 00:15:57.940
And it's your own dad?
We can never wrap our heads around this.

298
00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:00.910
So for you to tell him that kind of joke is not appropriate.

299
00:16:00.911 --> 00:16:02.100
How dare you buying McFarland?

300
00:16:02.101 --> 00:16:04.750
A great comedian was roasting Jim Norton and she said,

301
00:16:04.751 --> 00:16:07.660
your show is so unlistened bubble.
I'd rather hear my daughter drown.

302
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:11.710
Now that's very dark,
but are you telling me she doesn't love her daughter?

303
00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.180
Are you telling me she doesn't know how to tell a joke?

304
00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:17.880
So the metaphor I use when people say a certain subject is not,
uh,

305
00:16:17.881 --> 00:16:22.750
appropriate for humor.
I say it's like flour.
Flou F L O U R is flower food.

306
00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:26.650
Well,
no one eats flour,
but everyone eats it when it's processed and baked.
Right?

307
00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.440
So same thing with jokes.
This darker the subject,

308
00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:33.010
the harder it is to make it palatable.
And I have examples of,
you know,

309
00:16:33.011 --> 00:16:36.080
they made me cut one joke,
but I have examples of all sorts of,
you know,

310
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:38.650
subjects that are supposed to be off limits.

311
00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:42.580
And maybe you personally don't find it funny if someone's been assaulted and

312
00:16:42.581 --> 00:16:45.790
they're like,
you know,
these kinds of jokes set me off.
That's there.

313
00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.810
But the idea that no one,
yeah,
she'd find that funny,
isn't it?

314
00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.950
<v 1>Well,
it's also stealing something that's very human is that we use humor.</v>

315
00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.810
It comedy is tragedy plus time.

316
00:16:54.811 --> 00:16:58.260
We use humor to be able to look back on the past.

317
00:16:58.261 --> 00:17:01.560
I mean if Mel Brooks couldn't of made fun of Hitler,

318
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:05.190
couldn't of made fun of the Holocaust,
that was,
that was actually healing for,

319
00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:08.160
I'm sure for him personally,
but for millions of other people.

320
00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:13.060
<v 0>But the establishment which gets by on legitimacy and quality conversation,</v>

321
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.000
it cannot abide that court jester laughing at them

322
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:19.920
<v 1>is do you think that's why they took out the AOC parody on on Twitter because it</v>

323
00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:21.100
was really freaking out.

324
00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:24.400
<v 0>They took out a lot of parody accounts and it's strange.</v>

325
00:17:24.401 --> 00:17:28.330
All those Trump parody accounts are still up and the Para and sign live,

326
00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.780
which is their right and their great do it make for you should be making on the

327
00:17:31.781 --> 00:17:35.200
president.
But you're not saying that life is great,
but why not?
Sure.

328
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.540
Pretty crappy.
I haven't watched it in one.
Yeah,
no,

329
00:17:37.541 --> 00:17:38.830
I mean I haven't watched it in 15 years,

330
00:17:38.831 --> 00:17:40.690
but every time I see a ten second clip it's like,

331
00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:44.050
it's basically as basically as good as the gene wilder Willy Wonka movie.

332
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:48.520
So that's a call back,
my friend.
Yeah,
I understood it was a call back.

333
00:17:48.521 --> 00:17:50.040
It's just the ludicrous thing I've

334
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.450
<v 1>ever heard in my entire life.</v>

335
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:55.230
Someone who I love your outside the box thinking and yet

336
00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:01.420
<v 0>it's bizarre.
The point is,
uh,
humor is,
if it's this,</v>

337
00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:02.470
it's a Jewish thing.

338
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:06.040
It's this Jewish thing of laughing to keep from crying and it's a very waspy

339
00:18:06.041 --> 00:18:08.590
thing,
you know,
it's like,
oh,
you know,
you don't make the kind of jokes,

340
00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:09.453
the dinner table.

341
00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:13.810
And just because something isn't for someone doesn't mean it's not for no one.

342
00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:18.190
And one of the elements of the evangelical left is the idea of universalism.

343
00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:22.210
Everything has to be inclusive,
everything has to be for everyone.

344
00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:26.530
And my answer is no,
not everything has to be for everyone.
And that's okay.

345
00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:29.290
Not everyone is welcomed my house.
Not everyone's going to enjoy this book.

346
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:31.540
And you know what?
If you don't think I'm interesting or funny or smart,

347
00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:35.500
I wish you nothing but goodwill.
This a big world,
go live your best life.

348
00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:40.600
<v 1>Do you think that it doesn't make sense or does it deeply that they're obsessed</v>

349
00:18:40.701 --> 00:18:41.900
with our differences?

350
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:44.990
They're obsessed with our skin color differences in our sexuality and our gender

351
00:18:44.991 --> 00:18:45.470
difference.
That does.

352
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:48.560
I mean that is the entire thrust of everything that they're giving us.

353
00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:52.520
And yet they're also the ones that want us to be exactly the same.
Uh,

354
00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:55.430
well is that because,
is that a feature or a bug?
Actually,

355
00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:57.720
<v 0>I don't know if it's a feature or a bug.</v>

356
00:18:57.721 --> 00:19:00.270
It certainly works for them to some extent because what,
you know,

357
00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.810
kind of evangelical ProQuest and isn't,

358
00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:05.580
gives people is a sense of certainty and it also gives them a sense of being

359
00:19:05.581 --> 00:19:09.720
saved.
Right?
So once I recognized the pervasiveness of rec of racism,

360
00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:12.990
I've Kinda been initiated into the mysteries of this faith.
And therefore,

361
00:19:12.991 --> 00:19:13.920
since I'm inherently good,

362
00:19:13.921 --> 00:19:17.520
now I'm in a position to condemn heretics and centers and if necessary,

363
00:19:17.521 --> 00:19:19.940
wiped them off the face of the earth.
So they,

364
00:19:19.941 --> 00:19:23.640
they want us to be the same in terms of being saved,

365
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.230
but they don't want us to be necessarily save in terms of a literal,
yeah.

366
00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:29.280
<v 1>I don't know that I've ever heard you talk about this specifically,</v>

367
00:19:29.281 --> 00:19:32.460
but how much of what you think is going on with the evangelical left,

368
00:19:32.461 --> 00:19:35.820
as you just described them,
is just a disconnect from faith?

369
00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:39.290
<v 0>Oh,
I think it's the degeneration of the Social Gospel.</v>

370
00:19:39.291 --> 00:19:42.680
So I traced this so conservatives,
you know when I talk to them,
they're like,
oh,

371
00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:47.120
they admit that the left controls culture and media and Hollywood and thing and

372
00:19:47.121 --> 00:19:49.970
things like that,
and you say,
well,
how did this happen?
And they're like,

373
00:19:49.971 --> 00:19:52.460
we have to have our own version and go,
how did this happen?
They're like,
oh,

374
00:19:52.461 --> 00:19:53.960
it used to be,
I'm like,
when?

375
00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:57.950
When it was the 1930s when literal communists were running Hollywood,
right?

376
00:19:57.951 --> 00:20:00.890
When Woodrow Wilson is playing birth of a nation at the White House,

377
00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:04.760
FDR has so many Democrats that they have to sit on the republican side of the

378
00:20:04.761 --> 00:20:07.100
seats in Congress.
It makes no sense.
Other than that,

379
00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:10.100
you're saying it's not that they lost control,
they never had control.
Correct.

380
00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:11.450
It's always been,

381
00:20:11.451 --> 00:20:16.451
and there's a reason because leftism lends itself to innovation and creativity

382
00:20:16.461 --> 00:20:19.580
because one of the aspects of leftism is liking what's new,

383
00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:21.500
liking what's innovative,
this psychological thing.

384
00:20:21.501 --> 00:20:24.350
And there's nothing wrong with being conservative saying I don't like new stuff.

385
00:20:24.351 --> 00:20:26.510
I like things to say that's if that's fine for you,

386
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:30.260
but that's going to be a huge disadvantage when you're trying to attract people

387
00:20:30.261 --> 00:20:33.410
who are artistically minded because they're going to be drawn to those who are

388
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:35.360
maybe not overly openly mine.

389
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:39.450
<v 1>Right?
Because it sounds good.
I'm for progress.
Everyone's for price,</v>

390
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.130
but it depends what you're progressing.

391
00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:45.400
<v 0>Correct.
Right.
Is the rub.
So how conservatives,</v>

392
00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:49.030
how low the left controls culture and built it is one of the big themes of this

393
00:20:49.031 --> 00:20:49.271
book,

394
00:20:49.271 --> 00:20:52.600
and it's I think filling in a big hole on the right because conservatives really

395
00:20:52.601 --> 00:20:54.860
don't know.
And here's another example,
concerns.
You remember our,

396
00:20:54.861 --> 00:20:58.330
sure back in the nineties Jon Stewart,
you know the 2000 excuse me,

397
00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:02.350
was running the show.
And the answer was let's have a conservative daily show.

398
00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.000
That's not creativity.

399
00:21:04.001 --> 00:21:07.260
That's just mirroring what someone else has built as opposed to people like I

400
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:09.280
would say like rush Limbaugh and Roger Ailes,

401
00:21:09.281 --> 00:21:11.980
rush Limbaugh invented basically talk radio made or what it was.

402
00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:15.820
Roger Ailes was told we want you to compete with CNN.
He goes,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

403
00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:17.380
I'm going to destroy CNN.

404
00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:21.460
And CNN was all news and he made it this news entertainment opinion thing.

405
00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.000
And then CNN followed suit.

406
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.170
So those are two examples of the right actually creating something,

407
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:28.900
a kind of engineers you think we ever get to.

408
00:21:28.901 --> 00:21:32.170
Something that feels a little more stable.
Again,

409
00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:36.100
I don't work at right now I think stability politically means oppression.

410
00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:37.900
And I think the stability of like,

411
00:21:37.901 --> 00:21:41.350
let's suppose the fifties and this is one thing that I'm hopeful with social

412
00:21:41.351 --> 00:21:43.300
media,
they were entire schools of thought.

413
00:21:43.301 --> 00:21:46.540
They were made invisible because they were threatening to the social order and

414
00:21:46.541 --> 00:21:50.380
now they have to pick people off one by one instead of entire schools of
thought.

415
00:21:50.381 --> 00:21:53.770
And that is progress in a good way.
What if you were picked off?

416
00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:58.420
I'm too charming and I know I,
I mean I can be Glib suck.
It would suck.

417
00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:00.370
I mean what would you do?
I mean,

418
00:22:00.371 --> 00:22:03.520
because I know what a lot of people are thinking.
It's like,
you know,

419
00:22:03.521 --> 00:22:06.760
we've seen enough of the names that we've mentioned throughout this shirt get

420
00:22:06.761 --> 00:22:08.620
picked off and get suspended and get banned.

421
00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:11.890
It's not that there are best buddies or anything,

422
00:22:11.891 --> 00:22:16.060
but there were everyone's sort of in the same sort of circles at some level.

423
00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.150
Uh,
again,
coming from that Soviet background,

424
00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:22.030
I know that idea of like it could be you tomorrow.
It's not.

425
00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:24.250
It's always at random cause that way you keep everyone's scared.

426
00:22:24.251 --> 00:22:26.030
It's close to dive into that a little bit more.
Sure.

427
00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:29.950
So one of the techniques that the Soviets did is it wouldn't be like the worst

428
00:22:29.951 --> 00:22:33.940
people who would get kicked off like a barrier said,
find me the man,

429
00:22:33.941 --> 00:22:34.774
I'll find you the crime.

430
00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:37.960
So style and I do not think we're in a style and a society,

431
00:22:37.961 --> 00:22:40.090
I'm just using this as a metaphor,
a very loose metaphor.

432
00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:43.330
I just really want that to be clear because we've got a ways to go before that.

433
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:47.110
But the,
the principal to keep a population kind of submissive is,

434
00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:48.640
it's not always the loud mouth.

435
00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:52.450
You pick the housewife or you pick this grandma and then everyone knows you

436
00:22:52.451 --> 00:22:53.284
could be next.

437
00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:56.530
So you only got to take out like three people and that 100 are going up

438
00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.670
basically fall in line.

439
00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:02.820
And because Twitter's rules are ambiguous and it's seemingly at random and they

440
00:23:03.431 --> 00:23:04.210
don't even give warning,

441
00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:07.990
they could've sat down that AOC account said these three tweets are offensive,

442
00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:09.880
delete them there.

443
00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:14.470
So even though he did nothing wrong by the rules that they supposedly put out

444
00:23:14.471 --> 00:23:17.400
there,
I mean he labeled it as a parody account.
That's the main thing.

445
00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:19.720
And many people have more than one account and very,

446
00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:23.440
and also if you're want to be,
have this kind of public square,
you know,

447
00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:27.160
political conversation.
Once someone is a certain level of stature who are,

448
00:23:27.161 --> 00:23:28.390
you know,
kind of an influencer,

449
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:31.840
it might be that Jack has to talk to them personally or there has to be three

450
00:23:31.841 --> 00:23:33.820
checks before their band.
Or You could have warnings.

451
00:23:33.821 --> 00:23:38.680
I mean there's a lot of systems for keeping people who are part of this thriving

452
00:23:38.681 --> 00:23:41.890
conversation in place.
But that's not what they want and that's their right.

453
00:23:41.891 --> 00:23:43.510
But this is something that people should recognize.

454
00:23:43.511 --> 00:23:48.511
So you would say that the tech companies want to keep us all in semi-darkness

455
00:23:48.921 --> 00:23:52.730
all the time because that's the easiest way to easy.

456
00:23:52.731 --> 00:23:54.830
But it seems to be effective for them in terms of,

457
00:23:54.831 --> 00:23:58.490
cause then you have self censorship.
Right?
Because you know,
I had this tweet,

458
00:23:58.491 --> 00:24:02.190
I don't even remember what it was and I was scared to put it up because I'm like

459
00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:07.120
at any moment that I have saw Ron can fall on me and on booted.
Yeah.

460
00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:10.100
And I'm sure you know this feeling very well.
So that's what their youtube stuff.

461
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:12.110
Yeah,
no,
I know it extremely well.

462
00:24:12.111 --> 00:24:16.460
And it's like if I'm even remotely close to where the cliff is,

463
00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.700
man,
things have shifted in a seriously dangerous way.
I mean,

464
00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.730
there will be a certain amount of people that don't want me talking to you.

465
00:24:22.731 --> 00:24:25.780
There are certain amount of people that didn't want me talking to,
to Cernovich,

466
00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:28.310
et Cetera,
et cetera.
And I have to figure out who is who.

467
00:24:28.311 --> 00:24:30.470
I think it's okay to talk about that in the book.

468
00:24:30.471 --> 00:24:35.471
How is it okay for Barbara Walters to sit down with like Kadafi who murdered so

469
00:24:35.931 --> 00:24:38.990
many people?
Uh,
Diane Sawyer with Charles Manson,

470
00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:43.880
I mean with a swastika on his forehead that telling me the Diane Sawyer didn't

471
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:48.050
endorse all the views of Charles Manson because that seems to be what they say

472
00:24:48.051 --> 00:24:50.890
about if I sit down with somebody,
I must indoors older boy.
It's amazing.

473
00:24:50.891 --> 00:24:53.630
And when they're like,
oh,
he follows this person on Twitter,

474
00:24:53.631 --> 00:24:57.170
it's like everyone follows the president and he's the Dorset.

475
00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:59.990
Like when CNN plays his video,
his speech,
does that mean they're,

476
00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:03.950
they're endorsing it.
So it's a very weird situation again,

477
00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:07.130
because they're legitimate.
You're unorthodox.
You're not legitimate.

478
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:10.760
You don't have the same rights in a sense that they do.
Well,

479
00:25:10.761 --> 00:25:13.320
we talk about it right before we started,
but you saw the way media,
uh,

480
00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:16.810
media matters went after me cause I was going to have mayor Pete on and

481
00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:20.570
immediately went ahead of him though.
Yeah.
Well,
so that's the thing.
Yeah.
Well,

482
00:25:20.571 --> 00:25:24.590
can you take that away?
I mean you,
you know exactly how it works.
Like they can't,

483
00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:27.350
like when Donald Trump Jr,
uh,

484
00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:32.300
took a tweet of mine and put on Instagram and for days I was spending people
off,

485
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:35.270
basically it was like,
well,
they can't get a Trump so they're going to get at me.

486
00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:38.840
So if they can meet you,
don't give a crap about media matters,
I'm sure.

487
00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:41.810
But they can sure get to Pete because they'll have his ear and it worked

488
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:45.080
apparently.
I mean,
think how sad and depressing that is.
Forget,

489
00:25:45.081 --> 00:25:48.560
forget mayor Pete coming in here and doing the show,
it's actually irrelevant.

490
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:51.320
I would like to have talked to the guy,
but that strikes me is irrelevant.

491
00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:56.560
It's more that either he or his handlers are willing to bow to the mob that he,

492
00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:00.410
you know,
his people basically agree to do an interview.

493
00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:05.240
And then because media matters Huffpo and which the latter two are supposed to

494
00:26:05.241 --> 00:26:08.810
be places of journalism,
they are leveraging,
uh,

495
00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:12.000
or trying to influence a political candidate from calling.

496
00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:15.560
Because the only reason a mayor of Indiana town is in the running for the

497
00:26:15.561 --> 00:26:18.230
presidency is because of Huffpo media matters.
And Vox,

498
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:22.400
I the idea this a platform for even Senate beggars belief.

499
00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:26.150
So of course he's going to cow tow to the people who put them in the position.

500
00:26:26.151 --> 00:26:29.240
He has this guy's no natural constituencies like 37 years old.

501
00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:34.220
We've got a big battle ahead of us.
Yeah.

502
00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:38.220
And the important thing is,
uh,

503
00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:42.380
to have fun and enjoy life because we're still free and we're still blessed in

504
00:26:42.381 --> 00:26:44.280
this country.
And this is one of the things I do disagree with,

505
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:45.600
with many POCs than you,
right?

506
00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:48.930
These people think America's ruined were destroyed.
There's no hope.

507
00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:50.190
And it makes me very,

508
00:26:50.191 --> 00:26:53.640
very sad because you go on log in and you find more creative people doing

509
00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:57.890
awesome things,
then you can count.
Yeah.
And we,
we definitely focus,
seemingly we

510
00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:58.970
<v 1>focus on the negative more,</v>

511
00:26:58.971 --> 00:27:01.550
but that is one of the things that when I see you on Twitter I'm like,

512
00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.260
you are actually having fun with it.

513
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:08.390
<v 0>Oh yeah.
And there is a need,
this endless political politicy politicization.</v>

514
00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.970
Yes.
Did I say that?
Yes.
You did.
Yeah.
Of everything.

515
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.680
It's making people crazy and depressed.
Uh,

516
00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:17.150
one of the things I really hated about the left and a certain kind of the left

517
00:27:17.151 --> 00:27:20.600
is the idea that the personal is the political.
And to me,

518
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:24.950
if I disagree with someone politically that this would have any ramification on

519
00:27:24.951 --> 00:27:29.370
our friendship is so profoundly disturbing.
I can't even begin the,

520
00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:33.400
like if,
God forbid,
some of my family dies and I have to look at my phone,

521
00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:36.410
I'd be like,
well,
I can't call this person because they're a Bernie person.

522
00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:40.040
What kind of human order twisted plays twist the place.

523
00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:43.340
And even people who are like regular Christians though,
think in these terms.

524
00:27:43.341 --> 00:27:45.150
Like I have good friends who I'm staying with a couple there.

525
00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:48.320
They're all solid questions.
If my mom,
something happened,
my family,

526
00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.900
one of theirs,
I mean,
you're Jewish.

527
00:27:50.901 --> 00:27:53.270
This would never even enter their heads and not even in a million years.

528
00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:56.480
But it's like,
oh,
you're a Trump voter.
You are a Hillary voter.
I can't,
you know,

529
00:27:56.481 --> 00:28:00.530
whatever.
With you,
this is very,
very tribal and disturbing to me.

530
00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:05.120
Have you figured out any ways to deprogram some of these people?
Yes.

531
00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:09.620
A humor.
Um,
I think it's,
I think once you,

532
00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:14.730
I encourage people to see the absurdity of their position and also it's tell

533
00:28:14.811 --> 00:28:16.250
them you can let go.

534
00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:21.650
You don't have to be so ideological all the time.
Life is wonderful.

535
00:28:21.651 --> 00:28:24.790
Enjoy your life and you shouldn't be depressed.
Let's put,

536
00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:28.880
let's suppose Mike Pence,
if you're gay and my prints is president,

537
00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:33.290
that might suck for you.
But come on,
go to what do we,
Whoa,
go to hamburger.

538
00:28:33.291 --> 00:28:35.180
Mary's have fun.
I mean,

539
00:28:35.181 --> 00:28:38.330
this is not really a reflection of your life because they will always be a

540
00:28:38.331 --> 00:28:41.510
president that you hate.
So focus as much as you can.

541
00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:45.980
And this isn't the fairly shocking message on living your life to the fullest.

542
00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:50.740
<v 1>That's it,
man.
Yeah.
I don't need to ask you anything else.
That's it.</v>

543
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:55.150
I think let's get people,
regardless of where the politics fall on any of this,

544
00:28:55.151 --> 00:28:58.260
it's like,
let's get people to realize it's still pretty good.
And,

545
00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:01.570
and don't get too caught up in all the literacy.

546
00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:04.690
<v 0>And just when I'm trolling someone,
just retweet it and sit back and laugh.</v>

547
00:29:04.691 --> 00:29:09.070
Those were all my trials.
Where do you get this jacket?
Uh,
I may,

548
00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.120
I know Beluga made it

549
00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:15.670
<v 1>follow the Willy Wonka of politics.</v>

550
00:29:15.671 --> 00:29:18.610
Michael Malice on the Twitter at Michael Malice.

551
00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:23.520
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>
