00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.610
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.390
In this video, I'd like us to
work on an example of something

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.840
you actually saw in one
of the lecture videos,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.790
and that's about
reduction formulas.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.070
So what I'd like us to
do is to find a reduction

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.290
formula for the integral of
sine to the n x dx, which

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.270
I'm denoting by F sub n of x.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.050
That's actually, F sub n
of x denotes the integral

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.620
of sine x raised to the n dx.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.640
So the object here,
just to remind you

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.770
of what we'd like
to do, is to be

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.620
able to write F sub
n of x in a form

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.590
where maybe it involves
some functions,

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.760
but any integral
that it involves

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.040
is an integral of sine
to a lower power than n.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.040
So an integral of sine x
to a lower power than n.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.030
So that's the object.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.020
The object is to write
this down in such a way

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.210
that this integral is equal
to some functions maybe,

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.040
product of some functions,
added to another function that's

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.472
like F, but with
a lower subscript.

00:01:08.472 --> 00:01:10.680
So I'm going to give you a
little time to work on it.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.330
Why don't you pause the video,
take some time to work on it,

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.500
and when I come back,
I'll show you how I do it.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.030
OK.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.890
Welcome back.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.530
Well, hopefully you were
able to make some headway

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.260
on this problem.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.150
So let's take a look again
at what we want to do,

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.920
what the goal is, and then
we'll figure out a good strategy

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.940
to do that.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.860
So the goal is to be able to
write F sub n of x as something

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.501
that involves a lower
numbered subscript than n.

00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:43.000
Right?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.410
So we'd like to be able to
take this integral, that's

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.079
a power of sine x, and
reduce the number of powers.

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.370
You know, it would be great
if we could just write down

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.550
a final formula, but
if we're able to reduce

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.680
the power of sine x, then we're
able to head in a direction

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.070
where we could
start to write down,

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.320
start to write this
down as functions

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.710
that don't involve integrals.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.350
So the first step in
these kinds of things

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.450
is finding a reduction formula.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.480
So a couple of things
I want to remind us.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.610
We're going to make
the common substitution

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.160
that we make for powers of
sine or powers of cosine

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.291
that we see a lot.

00:02:22.291 --> 00:02:23.790
Well, I guess,
actually there's two.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.165
When you just see
a sine squared,

00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:27.750
sometimes you do this half
angle formula, or double angle

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.560
formula, that Joel has
mentioned in some videos.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.620
But in this one, we're more
interested in manipulating

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:40.780
the identity sine squared x plus
cosine squared x equals one.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.490
In particular, we're going to
replace one of the sine squared

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.810
x's, or we're going to
replace two of the sines

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.170
by 1 minus cosine squared x.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.355
So that'll be our first step.

00:02:54.355 --> 00:02:55.980
So we're going to do
that substitution.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.371
We'll break it into some
pieces, we'll see where we get.

00:02:58.371 --> 00:02:58.870
OK?

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.150
So let me come over here,
and I will start the problem.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.060
So I'm starting
with f sub n of x,

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.600
and I'm going to rewrite
it as the integral

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.520
of sine to the n minus
2 x quantity 1 minus

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.600
cosine squared x dx.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.740
So let me take a step back.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.730
So what did we do here?

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.670
We took two powers of
sine, and we replaced them

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.680
by what I said earlier.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.141
We replaced them by 1
minus cosine squared x.

00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:29.640
Right?

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.270
So this is a sine squared x.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.490
Here I have sine x
to the n minus 2.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.270
When multiply those together,
I get sine x to the n.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.440
So everything's still
working out so far.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.510
Why is this good?

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.480
Well, notice the terms we have.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:52.350
Sine to the n minus 2
x dx minus the integral

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:59.640
of sine to the n minus
2 x cosine squared x dx.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.830
OK.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:02.970
This we like.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.860
Why do we like this?

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.380
Because it's actually is
just like the F sub n of x,

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.930
except it has a lower power.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:18.590
So this piece is actually
F sub n minus 2 of x.

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:19.820
So that's something we like.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.195
Because it's already reduced
the power of sine x by 2.

00:04:24.195 --> 00:04:24.820
So that's good.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.670
That's part of the
reduction idea.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.900
This one, obviously we can't
write it in terms of capital F

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.990
with some subscript.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.430
And it maybe doesn't look so
easy to integrate right away.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.240
But let's think about
it for a second, how

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.800
we could split this thing up.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.750
And the goal was to use
an integration by parts.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.210
So we're going to examine
this integral in particular.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.165
So let me just write
that one down again here.

00:04:51.165 --> 00:04:53.290
So we need to analyze--
I'm going to drop the minus

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.581
sign for the moment, n minus 2.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.100
So our goal, again, is to
try and write this somehow.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.350
Either manipulate it so it
looks like a capital F function,

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.161
or manipulate it so that
the integral sign is gone.

00:05:12.161 --> 00:05:12.660
OK?

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.540
That's our main goal here.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.540
So let's look at what
we can do with this.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.711
Well, I can split this up.

00:05:18.711 --> 00:05:20.460
What I'm going to do,
it's kind of tricky,

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.610
but what I'm going to do, is I'm
going to take all of the sine

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.770
x's, and I'm going to take
one of the cosine x's.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.349
And I'm going to
make that one thing,

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:31.640
and I'm going to make the
other cosine x another thing.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.265
And I'm going to
write them down first,

00:05:33.265 --> 00:05:35.540
and we'll figure out
which is a good u

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:36.760
and which is a good v prime.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.530
So that's going to be one thing.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.750
And then the other
cosine x is going

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.217
to be-- does that look
like an equals sign?

00:05:49.217 --> 00:05:50.800
Equals is going to
be the other thing.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.290
So again, sine to
the n minus 2 x times

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.160
cosine x times cosine
x gives me what's

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.880
up here, inside the integral.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.510
And now what I
really want to see,

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.710
I'm going to use an
integration by parts.

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.840
Well, this is easy to integrate
or take a derivative of.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.530
But the point is that
now I can integrate this.

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.390
And why can I integrate this?

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.730
Well, I can do a
substitution on this.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.351
So this is kind of complicated.

00:06:13.351 --> 00:06:15.100
Because there's first,
you have to notice,

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.790
an integration by parts is
a good way to go with this.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.560
And then you have to
see, oh my goodness,

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.820
one of the steps of integration
by parts requires substitution.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.710
So it's a little tricky.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.701
But I'm going to make
this, then, my v prime,

00:06:28.701 --> 00:06:31.920
and I'm going to make this my u.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.970
Now, I'm going to come over to
the other board to figure out,

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.510
just to make sure I
do the v prime right.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:38.090
OK?

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.051
And then I'm going to
finish off this problem.

00:06:40.051 --> 00:06:41.550
So we'll come back
here in a second.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.051
So right now, this
is a question mark.

00:06:44.051 --> 00:06:46.300
We're going to make sure we
do the v prime part right,

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.150
and then we're
going to write down,

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.970
this should be u*v minus
the integral of v du.

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:52.890
OK?

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:55.520
So let me give
myself some space.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:03.810
So I'm trying to integrate now
sine the n minus 2 x cosine x

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:04.822
dx.

00:07:04.822 --> 00:07:05.390
All right?

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:09.310
That's my integral
of v prime dx.

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.470
OK, so this will give me v.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.506
Well, let's see what we do.

00:07:13.506 --> 00:07:14.880
We're going to
now make-- I don't

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.040
want to use a u for
my substitution,

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.720
because I already
have in my mind a u.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:26.720
So I'm going to let w
equal sine x, and then dw

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.920
is equal to cosine x dx.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.380
Right?

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.710
What's the point here?

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.250
Why do we see this
as easy to integrate?

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.370
Because this is powers of sine,
and the derivative of sine

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:38.260
is cosine.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.040
So that's why this lends itself
to a substitution so easily.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.930
So that should be
fairly familiar by now,

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.570
but just to make
sure we're clear.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:51.896
So then this is now the integral
of w to the n minus 2 dw.

00:07:51.896 --> 00:07:52.590
All right?

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:54.600
I have sine x to the n minus 2.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.580
So that's replaced by
w to the n minus 2.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.750
And then dw replaces
cosine x dx.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.590
And that is pretty easy
to integrate, I think.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:06.630
That's w to the n
minus 1 over n minus 1.

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:09.516
I'm not going to worry
about my c's right now.

00:08:09.516 --> 00:08:10.890
That'll come up
right at the end.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.473
We'll put in a plus
c if we needed to.

00:08:15.607 --> 00:08:17.190
But, so don't worry
about your plus c.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:18.841
I don't want to
carry that around.

00:08:18.841 --> 00:08:19.340
OK.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.540
So then when I when I look at
this, what does this tell me?

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.380
This tells me that if this
is the integral of v prime,

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:31.930
this tells me that v is equal
to sine x to the n minus 1,

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:36.080
sine to the n minus
1 x, over n minus 1.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.480
OK?

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.480
This whole bit was to help us
in the middle of the problem.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.646
So this was the v we needed.

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:42.840
All right?

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.705
So let's come back, fill in
a little piece we needed,

00:08:45.705 --> 00:08:47.580
that little gap we had,
and then we'll finish

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.250
the problem on the far right.

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:50.390
So let's come back.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:51.510
Where was I?

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:52.670
OK.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.080
So I was integrating
this quantity.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.080
Sine to the n minus 2
x cosine squared x dx.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.110
And I was trying to use
integration by parts.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.410
So I had u and v prime,
and I've now calculated v,

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:05.510
and I know what du is.

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:07.880
So I'm going to write
down what this equals.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.470
This is going to be
u, which is cosine x.

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:14.730
And I'll just write down v here,
so we'll see what it is again.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:22.160
Times sine to the n
minus 1 x over n minus 1.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.870
And then I have
to subtract v du.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.230
So this is v. And what's du?

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:31.110
du is, or I should say, u prime
is how you saw it in class.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:34.477
u prime is negative sine x.

00:09:34.477 --> 00:09:35.560
So what am I going to get?

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.870
I'm going to get negative
sine x times the v that I had.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:43.305
So when I subtract, I'm going
to end up with a plus sign.

00:09:43.305 --> 00:09:45.505
And I'm going to
have plus, I'm going

00:09:45.505 --> 00:09:48.830
to pull out the constant,
1 over n minus 1,

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:53.110
integral, now let's look at
the magic that happens here.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:54.160
OK.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.910
Let's make sure you
agree with this power.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.130
It's the nth power of sine x.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.230
So let's double check.

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:06.550
I said u was cosine x, so
u prime is negative sine x.

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:11.380
So I have to take u prime v.
u prime is negative sine x.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:17.870
If we come over here, we see
v is sine x to the n minus 1,

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:22.680
so u prime v is indeed
negative-- well, I should say,

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.750
v is the sine x to the n
minus 1 over n minus 1.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:30.390
So u prime v, in fact,
has the power n on sine.

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:33.140
So that's maybe a little bit
complicated and nerve-racking,

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.160
but that's OK.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.580
We're actually headed
in the right direction.

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.460
So I'm going to
rewrite the stuff

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.085
we know, and we'll see how we're
headed in the right direction.

00:10:41.085 --> 00:10:42.340
OK.

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:46.430
So again, we were trying
to find F sub n of x.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:48.780
And I'm going to write out
the pieces we already knew.

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:52.080
So we had an F sub
n minus 2 of x.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.030
That was the first term we had.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:58.300
And then we analyzed
this second piece.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.870
And the second piece
is the one that we just

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:01.960
spent a little while on.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:08.100
And that gave us a cosine
x sine to the n minus 1

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:18.420
of x over n minus 1, and
then a plus 1 over n minus 1.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:19.630
And what was our thing here?

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:23.050
Our thing here was
F sub n of x, again.

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:23.550
OK.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:25.133
So this might be a
little complicated.

00:11:25.133 --> 00:11:27.520
So I'm going to show us where
all the pieces come from,

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.620
just remind us.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.290
So we started with F
sub n of x, and I'm

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.790
claiming there are two
pieces that are of interest.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:34.420
OK?

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:38.030
The first piece--
let's come back over.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.705
The first piece, this
was our F sub n of x.

00:11:40.705 --> 00:11:41.580
We wrote it this way.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.890
The first piece was the
F sub n minus 2 of x.

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:46.280
Sine to the n minus 2 of x.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.490
No problem.

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:51.017
Then we subtracted
this integral.

00:11:51.017 --> 00:11:53.100
And so I spent a little
while trying to figure out

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.490
how to write that integral.

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:57.650
And that integral was
written right down here.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:00.430
So I have to subtract
off all of that.

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:02.850
And the point is that this
integral here, integral

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:05.570
of sine x to the n, the
quantity of sine x to the n,

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.580
is F sub n of x, again.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.580
Now you might be nervous,
because again, we just

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.760
said, we see the
same thing over-- we

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.144
see what we want to reduce
on the right-hand side.

00:12:14.144 --> 00:12:16.060
But now all we have to
do is a little algebra.

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:20.200
So I'm going to come over and
show you the magic of algebra.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.540
OK?

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:25.630
Let's, to make this
as easy as possible,

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:29.900
I'm going to erase the
parentheses here, and put

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.680
that minus sign here, so I don't
have to rewrite the whole line.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.350
OK?

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:39.410
So the parentheses are gone, and
I've distributed the negative 1

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:40.680
to both terms.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.120
Now notice, I want to
figure out what this is.

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:49.120
I'm going to figure out
what that blue thing equals.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.470
Well, we're back to sort
of an algebra problem.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:55.500
We can isolate the
blue things, and solve

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.200
for what's in the blue box.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.139
So that's what
we're going to do.

00:12:59.139 --> 00:13:00.180
So what do we have to do?

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:04.059
Well, we have to add this
to the left-hand side.

00:13:04.059 --> 00:13:04.850
And what do we get?

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:05.766
Let's see what we get.

00:13:05.766 --> 00:13:12.120
We get 1 plus 1 over n minus 1.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:22.690
F sub n of x is equal to F sub
n minus 2 of x minus cosine

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:29.170
x sine x quantity to the
n minus 1 over n minus 1.

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:33.900
So all I did was I added
1 over n minus 1 times

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.580
F sub n of x to the left-hand
side-- well, to both sides,

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.310
so it moved to the
left-hand side--

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:42.360
and there was one of them here,
and there's 1 over n minus 1

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.230
of them here.

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:46.000
And let's make sure
we can simplify that.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:46.500
Let's see.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.970
We get n minus 1 over
n minus 1 plus 1.

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:51.780
I think it gives me
n over n minus 1.

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:55.660
So that gives me
n over n minus 1.

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:59.060
I guess I'll write it again.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:13:59.995
We're really close.

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:06.579
And then this whole mess again.

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:13.220
And now, we only
have one more step

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.850
to figure out what
F sub n of x is.

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:22.290
And that is to multiply both
sides by n minus 1 over n.

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:25.630
n minus 1 over n
multiplied here gives me 1,

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:33.460
and so then I get n minus 1
over n, F sub n minus 2 of x,

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.680
minus-- the n
minus 1's kill off,

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:46.790
and I just get cosine x sine
to the n minus 1 x over n.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:49.497
So this is our answer.

00:14:49.497 --> 00:14:50.580
Because what is the point?

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.620
Why can I say, well,
I've reduced it?

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.710
I've reduced it because
I have-- the only

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:59.570
integral I have is an integral
that was a power of sine x.

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:02.100
And that's the goal, is
that I have it in the form.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:06.010
This is the power of sine
x to the n integrated.

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:09.360
This is sine x to the
n minus 2 integrated.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.581
and this is just a function.

00:15:11.581 --> 00:15:12.080
OK?

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.440
And, you know, if
we want to say,

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:19.970
what's the true antiderivative,
we have to allow for a plus c

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:21.640
here, for a true antiderivative.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:28.351
But we're really interested
in this part here.

00:15:28.351 --> 00:15:28.850
OK?

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:31.410
Because if we evaluate
this at bounds,

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:33.450
that's going to go away.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:35.540
But I want to just make
sure we understand--

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.520
I think we understand the goal.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.040
Maybe the hardest
part of this problem

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:45.310
is once you come over here,
was once you have these two

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:46.250
components.

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:49.180
So we did the substitution
that seems natural.

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:51.145
You have these two components.

00:15:51.145 --> 00:15:52.895
This one, you should
be able to recognize,

00:15:52.895 --> 00:15:54.480
is in the form you want.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.390
This one is the hard
one to deal with.

00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:00.340
But the trick is to see that
under the right splitting up

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:02.966
of these functions, one of
them is easy to integrate,

00:16:02.966 --> 00:16:05.340
and one of them, you know,
it's easy to integrate or take

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:06.250
a derivative.

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:08.196
So I have a little
bit of freedom.

00:16:08.196 --> 00:16:09.570
You don't want to
substitute back

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:13.047
in for cosine squared
with 1 minus sine squared,

00:16:13.047 --> 00:16:15.380
because it will get you right
back to where you started.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.980
You would be
substituting one way,

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:18.710
and then substituting
the other way.

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:20.269
So the goal at this
point is to sort

00:16:20.269 --> 00:16:21.810
of-- the trick with
this one, I mean,

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:24.090
is this integration
by parts, which

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:26.520
requires some substitution.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:30.110
So hopefully this was a
good exercise for you,

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:33.280
and you see some
of the strategies

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.810
that one needs to reduce
the powers of sine x.

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:40.750
You can do a very similar
type of thing with cosine x

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:41.250
to the n.

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:44.524
So if you felt like, I'm not
quite sure about this method,

00:16:44.524 --> 00:16:46.440
you might want to try
and do something similar

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:50.530
with cosine x to the
n as your function

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:53.290
that you're integrating, and
see if you can reduce that.

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:54.950
And I guarantee you
can find a formula

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:57.340
for that in a book
or online, if you

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.040
wanted to check that answer.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.188
So I guess this is
where I'll stop.
