You've reached the end of this course.

&gt;&gt; Before we say good bye,
we want to leave you

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.920
with some of the most important
takeaways from this course.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.350
&gt;&gt; First ,think about profitability
from the very beginning.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.476
&gt;&gt; Don't fly blind, use data and
keep improving the way you collect and

00:00:18.476 --> 00:00:19.270
analyze it.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.380
&gt;&gt; Make sure you're charging
the right users the right amount

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.140
at the right time.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.810
So work hard, be nice, and make money.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.790
&gt;&gt; Your business valuation comes down
to profitability and growth metrics.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.350
Go have both.
