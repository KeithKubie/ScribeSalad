00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.640
This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Harry’s.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.230
Have you ever been asleep and been jolted
awake by a SUPER loud sound?

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:15.519
Science says that sound only exists in your
head!! *mind blown* Oh,wait... actually that

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:29.060
might be considered insensitive.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.232
Exploding head syndrome sounds like someone
is going to have a lot of cleanup to do, but

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:36.070
it's not about heads that REALLY explode,
but rather a sleep disorder.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.930
Have you ever been asleep or drifting off,
and been suddenly JOLTED AWAKE by a super

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.100
loud sound?!

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.640
THAT'S exploding head syndrome.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.710
The sound has been associated with a gunshot,
explosion, a thunderclap, or a cymbal clash;

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.490
and though it seems real, it's all in the
mind of the person experiencing it.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.140
I've never heard of this, but I've TOTALLY
experienced it; so obviously I have to know

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.140
more.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.020
Exploding head syndrome (EHS) was first described
in the 1870s in Virginia Medical Monthly as

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.250
a "sense of a pistol shot or a blow on the
head."

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.439
It was largely ignored, until 1988 when the
Lancet published a paper that gave it a name[1].

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.570
Today, the American Sleep Association (ASA)
characterises EHS as a painless loud sound

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.189
sometimes accompanied by a flash of light
followed by anxiety, increased heart rate

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:22.310
and shortness of breath[2].

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.720
It can interfere with normal sleep patterns,
which has any number of other effects -- search

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.250
DNews; videos for sleep.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.250
There are a lot.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.409
In March, the Washington State University
researchers announced the findings of their

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.369
study of 211 undergraduates and found about
one in five students had experienced EHS[3];

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.220
though it'a ms most common in people over
50; and SLIGHTLY more common in women[4],[5].

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.920
Other studies have found the prevalence closer
to 1 in 8[6].

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.420
EHS isn't a minor disorder.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.229
People are jolted awake, and with a huge amount
anxiety, believing someone is breaking in

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.189
or a bomb went off a simply cannot determine
what has happened!

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.899
It's so disturbing to some people that the've
contrived a conspiracy theory involving electronic

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:04.090
microwave burst harassment by the gub-ment[7].

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.090
[a]

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.310
In the early 90s, scientists hooked people
up to electroencephalographs, electrooculographs

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.060
and submental electromyograms EEGs or similar
devices to watch activity in the brain, and

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.310
they didn't find any evidence of problem.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.170
But they did note brain patterns tipped toward
alertness just before the onset of an "attack"

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.910
and then everything returned to normal with
no lasting effects[8].

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.380
Scientists have tested its connection to headaches
and neurological disorders like epilepsy,

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.300
and have yet been unable to determine a cause,
or a good test for it.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.440
But they have a hypothesis for why it happens.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.640
When the brain settles in for sleep the brainstem
reticular formation begins to take over from

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.090
the major control neurons.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.680
The BRF controls heartbeat, breathing, eye
movement, and sensorimotor reflex and control[9].[b]

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.540
Scientists think in people with exploding
head syndrome, the neurons don't shut down

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.010
correctly and instead they fire all at once
for some reason causing this fantastic sound.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.600
Evidence seems to point to the brainstem reticular
formation, because it also controls sleep

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.390
paralysis, which is occasionally associated
with EHS.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.860
A German study of EHS found that while there
is no cure, the best treatment is to reassure

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.390
people that YES it's in your head.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.870
It's completely fine.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.960
And it's not going to harm you.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.140
But it's weird and strange and research is
ongoing, and needed.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.860
We couldn't have made this episode of DNews
without support from Harry's.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.290
If you need a razor to shave with.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.290
Try Harry's!

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.730
Harry's was started by a couple guys who liked
shaving so much that bought a razor factory

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:30.730
to make their own.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.740
They're cheap, they show up at your door,
and they're sharp both in look and… well,

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.740
sharpness.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.350
Not only did they make it so you don't have
to pay a ton for blades, they made them easier

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.350
to get!
