00:00:00.112 --> 00:00:03.400
I'm going to start with an example from unit three. You are

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.080
asked to define a procedure union, that takes inputs as two lists

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.170
and modifies the first input list to be the set union of

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.230
the two input lists. We had the lists of pages to Crawl

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.930
as well as the pages that we found linked from the

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.830
current site and we wanted to combine those in a new list

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.560
of pages to Crawl. So that's what we needed union for. So

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.200
that's what we did was define a procedure that took the 2

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.420
input lists, and output a list that was their union. This made

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.000
sense in CS101. Because we were learning about lists, and how to program

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.620
on lists. But it doesn't make a lot of sense if your real

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.230
goal is to actually do what we needed for the search engine. So,

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.360
for this quiz, what I want you to think about is, which

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.070
of the following. Would be the best thing to do if instead of

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.380
doing this as a programming exercise to learn to program, you are trying

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.510
to build a search engine and realize that what you needed to do

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.800
was union the links that you had to search

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.510
with the new links that you found from the current

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.490
page. Here are the options. Select the one that

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.390
you think would be the best one to do first.
