of positivist manifesto I'm not any kind
 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.910
of positivist manifesto I'm not any kind
of positivist really but it was but the

of positivist really but it was but the
 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.170
of positivist really but it was but the
idea that you could think rigorously

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180
idea that you could think rigorously
 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.090
idea that you could think rigorously
about these important questions and that

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100
about these important questions and that
 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.370
about these important questions and that
you could sort of break break through

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380
you could sort of break break through
 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.069

clearer vision of what the world was
 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.710
clearer vision of what the world was
really like and what was really

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720
really like and what was really
 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.120
really like and what was really
important and so on that struck me I

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130
important and so on that struck me I
 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.639
important and so on that struck me I
think it's very exciting and I was going

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649
think it's very exciting and I was going
 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.770

through a religious crisis at the time I

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780
through a religious crisis at the time I
 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.039
through a religious crisis at the time I
was I was evangelical 15 16 year old and

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049
was I was evangelical 15 16 year old and
 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.010
was I was evangelical 15 16 year old and
I was and I suppose I was in the process

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020
I was and I suppose I was in the process
 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.929
I was and I suppose I was in the process
of losing my faith though I wouldn't

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939
of losing my faith though I wouldn't
 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.480
of losing my faith though I wouldn't
have known that at the time but I was

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490
have known that at the time but I was
 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.039
have known that at the time but I was
very interested in sort of theological

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049
very interested in sort of theological
 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.319
very interested in sort of theological
questions and again the kind of rigor

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329
questions and again the kind of rigor
 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.719
questions and again the kind of rigor
with which philosophical argument could

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729
with which philosophical argument could
 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.670
with which philosophical argument could
address these questions which were

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680
address these questions which were
 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.240
address these questions which were
addressed I thought less interestingly

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250
addressed I thought less interestingly
 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.430
addressed I thought less interestingly
perhaps by

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440
perhaps by
 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.260
perhaps by
the sort of Sunday school or a religious

the sort of Sunday school or a religious
 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.630
the sort of Sunday school or a religious
setting I think that was part of what

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640
setting I think that was part of what
 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.750
setting I think that was part of what
excited me I have to say that while

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760
excited me I have to say that while
 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.280
excited me I have to say that while
that's what sort of brought me to the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290
that's what sort of brought me to the
 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.920
that's what sort of brought me to the
subject I don't find myself terribly

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930
subject I don't find myself terribly
 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.490
subject I don't find myself terribly
interested now in in those questions in

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500
interested now in in those questions in
 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.680
interested now in in those questions in
the United States where the vast

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690
the United States where the vast

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290
religious belief haven't thought much
 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.140
religious belief haven't thought much
about what that means I mean they

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150
about what that means I mean they
 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.310
about what that means I mean they
haven't thought about what it means not

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320
haven't thought about what it means not
 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.050
haven't thought about what it means not
in terms of what they should do but in

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060
in terms of what they should do but in
 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.150
in terms of what they should do but in
terms of how they should think and in

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160
terms of how they should think and in
 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.600
terms of how they should think and in
particular people are very vague I think

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610
particular people are very vague I think
 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.630
particular people are very vague I think
about what they mean when they say that

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640
about what they mean when they say that
 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.940
about what they mean when they say that
they think there's a God and one of the

they think there's a God and one of the
things that I found helpful in

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450
things that I found helpful in

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.940
philosophy as a 16 16 17 year old was 10
spy philosophers to say but most of whom

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950
spy philosophers to say but most of whom
 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.100
spy philosophers to say but most of whom
were quite devout and religious but but

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110
were quite devout and religious but but
 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.020
were quite devout and religious but but
they were nevertheless people who wanted

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030
they were nevertheless people who wanted
 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.300
they were nevertheless people who wanted
to be more sort of rigorous about what

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310
to be more sort of rigorous about what
 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.610
to be more sort of rigorous about what
that meant than most people I'm using

Aristotle said you should adopt the

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.930
 
basically philosophical research has

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940
basically philosophical research has
 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.000
basically philosophical research has
done by reading and writing and talking

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010
done by reading and writing and talking
 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.330
done by reading and writing and talking
to people and I would say that you know

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340
to people and I would say that you know
 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.710
to people and I would say that you know
the what philosophers try to do is to

the what philosophers try to do is to
get clear as we can about the conceptual

get clear as we can about the conceptual
