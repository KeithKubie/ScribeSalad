00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.800
So this thing is actually the logo of Trinity Maths Society.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.700
Trinity College in Cambridge, Maths Society,

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.480
when they have lectures about mathematics, and they go out socializing to the pub,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.380
well their Society has this as their logo.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.980
It's a square made of other squares

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.100
but all the squares are different sizes.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.400
So, see this one here with 50?

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.780
Well that means it's a 50 unit by 50 unit square.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.960
This one here with a 35 is 35 by 35.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.280
All these squares are different sizes

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.680
yet they fit together to make one big square

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.760
which is 112 by 112.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.280
So it's called a squared square.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.260
Why have they picked this as their logo for their Society?

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.100
Because they're nerds!

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.740
Well, yeah. And that.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.200
AND, because it was Trinity Maths students that solved this.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.480
This one is actually the smallest possible squared square.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.640
This is something that feels like it would be done by the ancient Greeks or something.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.620
This feels like an old problem.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.500
How can you make a square from other squares of different sizes?

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.140
That feels like a classic problem.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.800
This didn't really turn up until the 20th century, which surprises me.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.160
They are integer squares. We're not using the same square twice

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.460
Or if you do, they're called imperfect

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.280
so you can use that. But I'd rather they're all different sizes.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.380
There were four students at the Trinity Maths Society that really solved this problem.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:35.340
They were called Arthur Stone, Cedric Smith, Roland Brooks and Bill Tutte.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.100
The first three were maths students.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.040
Bull Tutte was actually a chemistry student, but he was in the Maths Society because he liked maths.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.020
So you don't have to be a mathematician to be in the Maths Society.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.040
I think it was Arthur Stone who brought this problem in, who heard of this problem before.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.720
The only thing that had been done before was there were

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.960
a couple of rectangles that had been found made out of squares.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.080
Not quite the same thing.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.320
Here they are. Just two. There were just two rectangles that had been found.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.420
One of them uses nine squares.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.380
The other uses ten squares.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.520
Rectangles they are easier than making squares.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.400
But only two had been found so far, so the students started to find more.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.860
Their methods were a little bit ad hoc, so they were trying to find these rectangles.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.320
They were hoping that they would get lucky and find a square made out of squares just by chance.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.620
But it wasn't working.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.320
They kept trying. They found rectangles, but they just couldn't find a square.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.900
They thought, right, we're going to have to get more systematic.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.860
So when they started finding these rectangles made out of squares

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.540
they thought, okay, let's do this.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.860
And they started to extend the horizontal lines like this

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.000
You see this horizontal line? (tootootoot right)

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.480
Once you've extended the lines, we're gonna turn this rectangle into a network.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.660
And what you do is you connect two horizontal lines if the square are touching

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.000
So this one here, 25, is touching these two horizontal lines.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.680
That's the top of 25 and that's the bottom of 25.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.620
So I'm just gonna connect them with a line

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.700
I'm actually gonna draw an arrow here to show top to bottom

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.480
and mark it, that's the 25 square.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.320
So I'm just gonna do the whole thing, now, with a network.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.380
So, 16, that's the top of sixteen, that's the bottom of 16

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.340
Let's connect those with a line.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.560
And I'll mark it with 16. That's the 16 line.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.980
And then I'll keep going.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.140
So they turned it into a network.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.340
And when they did that, they recognized it.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.020
They went, that seems familiar.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.660
And why they recognized it was because it reminded them of an electrical network.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:49.820
If you connect this to a battery, and if these were wires in a network, and each wire has one unit resistance

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.340
and you connect it to a battery which has the same potential as the height of the rectangle

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.800
and put all these numbers in, these are the currents that flows through that electrical network.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.180
So, suddenly they realized that this was connected to electrical networks

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.020
and they could use all this maths that was already there, and they could borrow it completely

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.420
to solve the squared square problem.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.940
In particular, these are called Kirchhoff laws.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:24.560
A couple of Kirchhoff laws are, the current flowing in to a point should equal the current flowing out of a point.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.740
So let's look at the current flowing in to here.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.860
36 is flowing in, 2 is flowing in, so we've got 38 in total flowing in.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.220
And flowing out, we've got 33 and a 5

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.220
So it, they are equal.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.280
Another thing we can learn from Kirchhoff laws

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.500
if you've got a circuit, like this circuit here,

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.220
a circuit should make zero - I'll show you what I mean.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.240
So if I'm going from here, you've got a 9, we've got a 7, which makes 16

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.160
and then I go in the opposite direction here, so this is a minus 16

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.880
So all together, the whole circuit is a zero.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.000
Easy!

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.420
Yeah, so all this maths suddenly you can just borrow

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.760
and they could solve the squared square problem.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.180
A couple of things they solved on the way,

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.120
they showed that the smallest squared rectangle just uses 9 squares,

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.360
and there's two of them actually. That's one of them.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.480
That's the smallest squared rectangle, meaning it just uses 9 squares

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.520
And the other one was that one that was done before then.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.840
Remember there were two that was done previously, one of those is a small squared rectangle.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.160
They showed that there are no cubed cubes. And that's kind of disappointing.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.280
You can't make a cube out of cubes of different sizes.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.840
So using these networks, they could find what made valid squared rectangles

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.620
and what are not valid squared, without having to draw out the squared rectangles.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.720
So they started to build up a catalog.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.640
One of their ideas was, if they could find a squared rectangle

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.740
and another squared rectangle that had the same dimensions, they could do it like this.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
A squared rectangle like that

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.600
and another one which had the same dimensions

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.780
but using completely different squares inside.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.300
So, they're mutually exclusive but they're the same size.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.920
And then you could join them together like this.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.960
This would be a square up here, this would be a square here,

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.620
and it would make a squared square automatically.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.740
Or, if you can't do that--

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.740
Wouldn't it have duplicates in it, though?

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.720
So you want to avoid duplicates.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.500
So you want two squared rectangles which have no squares in common.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.260
That's what they were looking for.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.800
Or maybe they could have one square in common if it was a corner square

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.140
because you could do this.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.620
You could have a rectangle like this,

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.940
another one that's meant to be exactly the same dimension

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.580
that just share one corner, and that would make a squared square as well.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.640
So that was their plan, and it worked.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.660
And they finally found one. The first squared square!

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:58.080
It was massive, the first one they found. It used 55 squares.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.800
And then they started to improve it. They wanted to find smaller ones.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.280
They found one that used 38.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.760
Bill Tutte found one that used 26, and these were getting better.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.380
And the question was, what's the smallest squared square?

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.820
Now, that is something they struggled with

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.340
because it became too hard a problem.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:23.300
And this was a problem that was then left open for another 38 years

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.960
until the 1970s, until computers came along.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:32.140
And in using computers, they could use these students' methods that they had done,

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.980
they could use those methods with a computer and began searching for squared squares,

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.880
and they found the smallest uses 21 squares.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:45.940
It's definitely the smallest. It's unique. There's only one squared square that uses 21.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.480
This is it.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.340
There are none that use fewer squares.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:55.080
And then you can look at many that uses more than 21 squares.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:59.460
But those students, all of them became mathematicians.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:03.880
Well, one of them became a civil servant but he was still a maths fan.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.700
I think that was Roland Brooks.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:11.380
But the other three became mathematicians, including Bill Tutte, who started off as a chemistry student.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.960
He swapped over to maths.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:18.900
He then became a Bletchley Park code breaker in World War II.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.640
A very important job.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.700
And became a proper mathematician after the war.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.340
And he was a pioneer in graph theory, which is the maths of networks,

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.680
and he credits this problem as his training in graph theory.

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:36.700
Okay, so, we've seen this one which is the smallest squared square.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:40.000
The dimensions of it is 112 units by 112 units.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.740
There is actually smaller squares if we just talked about dimensions

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.300
but they use more squares, and they're not unique either.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:54.400
There are three known squares that are that size. They are smaller dimensions but they use more squares.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:59.520
One thing I found that was interesting. Theoretically, we can do this.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.780
One squared plus two squared plus three squared plus four squared,

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.760
imagine consecutive squares,

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.200
going up to ... 24 squared

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.260
is equal to

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.340
a big number, I'm not even sure what it is, well, I can tell you what it is,

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.100
it's 70 squared

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:22.220
which means that it is theoretically possible to make a square which is 70 by 70

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:26.640
made out of consecutive squares, one, two, three, four

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.740
but it can't be done.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:35.020
It's so tempting. The maths looks like it can be done, but geometrically they don't fit together.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:42.180
It's SO disappointing. I know, it'd be like a magic squared square perfect super perfect.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.360
And it's so disappointing it doesn't exist.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:47.580
Or does it?

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:48.800
No it doesn't.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:49.600
Oh.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.200
Another favorite squared square is this one.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:10:01.460
I say it's favorite because this one was actually found before the Trinity students found theirs.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.000
They were scooped.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:09.880
Everyone else is like, not a very nice square, is it? Should we tell Matt? He seems so excited about it.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.360
You know what I am excited about it!
