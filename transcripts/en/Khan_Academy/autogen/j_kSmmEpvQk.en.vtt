00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.270
 .. 

00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.740
 In the very first immune video, where we talked about 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.580
 The defense mechanisms are not specific, and we said if we had 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.400
 Type some pathogen - let's say it's bacteria - 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.040
 That our macrophages recognize either the proteins in the 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.770
 Bacteria, or it may have been some other species of pathogenic organisms - 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.095
 Some other sign of pathogens. 

00:00:18.095 --> 00:00:20.780
 He does not know what kind of pathogen it is, but that's in 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.820
 Enough enough. 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.170
 You will swallow the causes of the disease. 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.220
 So let's say this is a blimp. 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.060
 One of those receptors affects one of the proteins 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.560
 This is on the surface of this bacteria in this case 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.800
 Say, Gee, this is not a good thing to be around and so on 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.520
 You will swallow it. 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.830
 So the membrane is just going to surround the nurse-and 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.060
 This part will go. 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.440
 Is going to kind of poke in and the nurse is going to 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.290
 Get trapped and get soaked - 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.570
 Phagocytosis. 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.910
 So the final product - we've seen this in the first video where 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.520
 I talked about the phobia - it's that we'll put a top-up 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.160
 Then the membrane will be completely around. 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.349
 This is going to poke in and bubble about this thing and 

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:08.970
 So we're going to be sitting nurse 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.100
 Inside the pancreas. 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.680
 They will be surrounded by a membrane. 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.220
 That called membrane is ingested. 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.560
 We learned that there are different types of 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.380
 The macrophages - can be plump, can be 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.280
 Neutrophils, can be dendritic cell - and we have 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.250
 Like this and then we also saw in this video, it is not 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.460
 Just do it - no buds 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.390
 Just digest this thing. 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.970
 This in itself is very useful. 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.160
 They got these bacteria out of the way. 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.850
 If this virus, it only got this virus out of the way. 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.560
 But that is not even more. 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.850
 It then takes it IT - or it breaks. 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.700
 They do not actually have use - well, it breaks. 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.430
 There are many ways you can do it, but the bottom line is, it 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.680
 Operations on it. 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.010
 .. 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.930
 They will disperse the nurse - and we saw this first video on 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.810
 The macrophages that we actually have to wait for her bond solutions 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.009
 Dump all types of particles that are going to break up and 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.810
 These bacteria, in this case, are cut into 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.060
 Its constituent molecules. 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.000
 .. 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.250
 And then some sub-residue of food, special chains 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.060
 Of peptides - remember, proteins are long 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.580
 Chains of amino acids. 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.610
 Proteins are short chains. 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.930
 So you can take short chains of those and they are going to 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.565
 Bond for special proteins. 

00:02:34.565 --> 00:02:37.320
 .. 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.800
 This is mainly the theme of this video. 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.350
 So let's say they bond to this protein, your bond 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.410
 Your protein. 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.200
 And then get those proteins transferred or get 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.920
 Membrane or on the outer surface of the cell are this 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.750
 Themselves along with the piece of pathogenesis. 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.420
 That pathogen is the final product after fagocetozide 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.800
 That the pancake will look something like this and that 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:08.320
 These antigen will be presenting proteins, I think 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.080
 We could call them and was bound to parts of it 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.870
 The original nurse. 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.800
 Let me do it here. 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.060
 So it was a bit of the original cause of the disease that I had 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.010
 It is painted in green here. 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.820
 These proteins are right here, these are called - they 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.120
 A fancy word, I talked about it in the previous video - 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:47.140
 These complexes are called major histocompatibility, 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.170
 Or MHC for a short time. 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.170
 When we talk about macrophages or macrophages 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.270
 Dendritic cells are present on special cases 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.600
 Macrophages, major histocompatibility complexes 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.700
 That what they offer after I have digested this 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.380
 Molecule - this is the second MHC class. 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.630
 Let me write this down. 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.250
 This MHC class II protein. 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.899
 It may sound like I'm really going to go into details 

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:21.880
 What these proteins are, but we're going to see this key 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.190
 To activate other parts of the immune system, in particular 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.450
 Cell mediated parts of the immune system. 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.630
 So this was the case with balsam or thymus. 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.250
 They swallow something, they chew all the top, and then portions 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.860
 From something chewed until they were eating, hang it on these 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.700
 The second MHC proteins and MHC proteins go to these 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.740
 Cell surface. 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.015
 The same thing - or actually not quite the same - 

00:04:45.015 --> 00:04:49.030
 Something very similar happens with B cells. 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.820
 So if we have a B cell - which color is good. 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:53.900
 (B) for blue. 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.590
 We know B stands for a stock exchange, but it can stand for bones 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:58.940
 Marrow just as well. 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.560
 Suppose that we have a B cell and they got a membrane by binding it 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.910
 Body it. 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.450
 Remember, very specific because B cells. 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.910
 So all of the membrane binding antibodies, every 10,000 or so 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.500
 Of them on this cell B, they also expressed the same 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.920
 Variable part. 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.720
 So this cell in particular. 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.690
 So remember, this was unspecified. 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.450
 When we talked about pimples, these guys only 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:24.440
 I say, you're a bacterium. 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.980
 I was a virus. 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:25.940
 I do not know what type you are. 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:26.830
 I'm just going to devour you. 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:27.430
 You look Shady. 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.140
 I'm going to mess you up. 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.435
 I do not know what type you are or whether it is 

00:05:29.435 --> 00:05:30.410
 You've seen before. 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.540
 When we talk about B cells, we are talking about 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.080
 Adaptive or immune-specific. 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.190
 Even these - variable ends of these membranes are binding 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.060
 Antibodies: Specific to certain parts of some 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.650
 Pathogens, to some epitopes. 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.030
 Remember, the abitobes were the parts of some pathogens 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.010
 That these specific strings can be identified as bonds. 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.660
 So let's say we are dealing with 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.370
 Virus in this case. 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.400
 Let's say that the virus just happens to be 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.110
 Bond to this cell b. 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.760
 Remember, there may be other - in fact, there 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:08.910
 Definitely tons of other B cells around, but what 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:17.130
 The changing parts are all different. 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.940
 This is what I always find amazing about B cells that 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.610
 They come from the same genetic line, and their genes 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.580
 They were switched around in their development so that they could 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.830
 They produce billions of combinations of these 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.380
 Proteins, or variable ends of those antibodies. 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.400
 So let's say we have some viruses. 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.300
 Let me say it is bacteria. 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.850
 When I did the other cell example, I said we were dealing 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:41.460
 With viruses. 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.860
 But let's say some new bacteria are just some part of 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.550
 Its surface occurs only to bind only this cell B- 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.740
 Because this cell is just right to combine. 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.010
 So some part of its surface binds only to that cell b 

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:57.600
 There is a right. 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.760
 That part of the surface that connects, remember, though 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.000
 Called Beaverton. 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.920
 This is the part of our connecting nurse 

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:06.780
 Variable Sequence. 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.030
 This Bao cell will not bind this cell because it is 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.540
 Different sequences here, but that binds to this B cell 

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.180
 And then start the activation process. 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.830
 We will go to // - this in itself will sometimes get the cell b 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.660
 Activated, but you can usually need help from a T helper 

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.830
 Cells - we will talk more about it. 

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.130
 We said, once this happens, you get it once 

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.620
 Activate or start the activation process, this guy 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.850
 It gets soaked in fact - and I'm not talking about it at 

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:34.740
 Another video just because I did not want to go too 

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:35.400
 Lots of details. 

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:42.230
 Where it gets swept all this in cell B. 

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.870
 And then when it gets activated, it's rife 

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.960
 The same usually need T cells there and some 

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.245
 Become part of them plasma cells B, some part of them 

00:07:52.245 --> 00:07:53.495
 Memory cells become b. 

00:07:53.495 --> 00:07:58.590
 .. 

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:02.350
 Remember, plasma cells b say, Jie, I've been activated. 

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:05.180
 I only produce tons of these antibodies. 

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.850
 So cell plasma will only produce tons of these 

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:10.720
 Antibody and spit on them so that they never start 

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.020
 Attach to more and more of the causes of the disease and just mess 

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:18.650
 Them in different ways, either mark them to the other 

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:23.070
 Macrophages or macrophages corrode them up - or mark two of them 

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.380
 So you can pack them where it can not work properly. 

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:25.700
 whatever. 

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.120
 I will not go into details in this. 

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.390
 This is when it gets activated. 

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:31.860
 But the interesting thing is that cell B will also be done 

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.909
 What do macrophages do? 

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:41.840
 The cell will take this guy in the cell. 

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:47.100
 Perhaps he was initially attached to a body - and broke 

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:55.140
 For him, take a piece of this nurse and attach to the MHC 

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:59.790
 II proteins are then displayed on the surface. 

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.495
 Even a cell is also present in antigen. 

00:09:03.495 --> 00:09:06.970
 .. 

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:11.220
 So this is also the second MHC complex-key 

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.790
 complex histocompatibility - and just so you know, histo 

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:14.700
 Means tissue. 

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.050
 So this is related to whether something is compatible with 

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.260
 Tissue in the body and we will talk about it and 

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.380
 How do you relate to planting and all that. 

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:25.750
 So this is also the second MHC class. 

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:28.250
 Either way, whether we're talking about B cells that 

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:31.950
 Identify a very specific nurse - it can be 

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:37.090
 Specific virus, specific protein, a specific bacteria, 

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:40.350
 Or in cases of macrophages, they will only say, 

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:41.210
 Oh, you look shady. 

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:42.050
 Let me be you. 

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.300
 I do not know what kind of bacteria or viruses or protein 

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.940
 You, but in both cases, they both submerge them, take 

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.190
 Cut them, chop them, and present them in these 

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.580
 The surface in the complex with the main 

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:57.040
 The complexes are histocompatibility. 

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:01.450
 Cells that do this are called even a professional antigen 

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:02.700
 Display cells. 

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.080
 .. 

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.770
 This is what they do to live, although they do other 

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.430
 Things, as we saw. 

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:10.750
 The macrophages eat things. 

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:14.640
 B cells generate antibodies or memories where 

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.355
 They can be activated later to generate antibodies, but these 

00:10:17.355 --> 00:10:25.730
 A professional antigen is called cell display. 

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:29.630
 An antigen in question is this small piece of 

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:35.420
 The actual thing that you are trying to follow, that little 

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.720
 Piece - the actual part of the pathogenesis, that's what 

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.520
 Antigen - where it is displayed to the antigen. 

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:48.630
 It is professional because it takes pathogens from 

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:51.940
 Fluids from our system and then sweeps them, breaks them, 

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.510
 And then submit them. 

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:57.810
 Now there is also a nonprofessional antigen 

00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:58.530
 Display cells. 

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:00.910
 In fact, most cells have this. 

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.600
 In fact, even these guys. 

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.770
 In fact, I'm going to wait for the next video. 

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:05.960
 I realize all of my videos are getting long. 

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:10.280
 So you probably think, these guys in both cases 

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.030
 Submerge them, cut them, and offer them, 

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:13.320
 What's good for? 

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:18.690
 You'll see this second MHC, and these are recognized 

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:20.290
 Helper T cells. 

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:23.830
 It will be part of the mystery of how we have immunity 

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:24.420
 The system works. 

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:28.160
 So in the next video clip, we'll talk about the MHC I'm viewing 

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.450
 Cells, and all the cells of the body. 

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:32.091
 ..
