00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.930
To cover the intrinsic problem of eliciting requirements,

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.670
many different techniques have been proposed. So here

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.260
I list some of most traditional techniques for

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.290
requirement elicitation and as I present those, please keep

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.140
in mind that these techniques can be used

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.230
separately or combined. A first technique is called background

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.740
reading. And, this technique involves collecting information by

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.840
reading existing documents such as company reports, organizational charts,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.280
policy manuals, job descriptions, documentation of existing systems and so

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.400
on. And, this technique is especially appropriate when one Is

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.370
not familiar with your organization for which the requirements are

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.950
being collected. So you want to get some background before interviewing

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.240
actual people. And one of the main imitations of these

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.930
kinds of approaches is that written documents might be out

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.320
of sync and they often are out of sync with

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.970
reality. Tend to be long winded. It may contain many irrelevant

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.850
details, so you may have to look at a lot

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.810
of materials to extract enough information. The hard data and

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.650
samples techniques consist in deciding which hard data we want

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.680
to collect and choosing the sample of the population for which

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.750
to collect such data and hard data includes facts and

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.790
figures such as forms, invoices, financial information, survey results, marketing

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.300
data, and so on. And the sampling of this data

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.170
can be done in different ways. For example, the typical ways

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.200
to do random selection. Interviews are another typical approach for

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.870
requirement solicitation, and this is the approach that we use for

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.910
the first project in this course, for instance. Interviews can be

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.720
structured in which case there is an agenda of fairly open

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.450
questions or they can be open ended in which case there

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.770
is no preset agenda and the interview is more of a

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.500
conversation. On the positive side, interviews can collect a rich set

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.260
of information because they allow for uncovering opinions as well as

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.230
hard facts. Moreover, they can probe in depth through follow

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.790
up questions. On the more negative side, interviewing requires special

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.400
skills that are difficult to master and require experience. And

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.890
it is not enough to collect a lot of information. If

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.520
this information is hard to analyze or even irrelevant, it

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.250
might become useless. So you need to know how to conduct

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.180
an interview in order to take advantage of these techniques.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.440
Surveys can also be extremely useful for gathering new requirements because

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.550
they can quickly collect information from a large number

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.520
of people. Moreover, they can be administered remotely. For

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.610
example, by email, through the web. On the other

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.750
hand, surveys tend to severely constrain the information that

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.430
the user can provide and might miss opportunities to

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.460
collect unforeseen, relevant information. Finally, meetings are generally used

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.690
for summarization of findings and collection of feedback, so as

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.500
to confirm or refute what has been learned. So the

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.660
only additional thing I want to mention about meetings

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.920
is the fact that it is fundamental that have clearly

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.970
stated objectives and are planned carefully. This is something that

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.730
should be quite obvious, but doesn't always happen in practice.
