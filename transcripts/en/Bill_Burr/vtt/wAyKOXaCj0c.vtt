00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:01.900
Okay.

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:02.890
<v 1>Hey, what's going on?</v>

3
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.620
Is Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

4
00:00:05.621 --> 00:00:08.660
November 28th,

5
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.610
2016 that I'm doing on November 29th at Tuesday. What's going on? How, why

6
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.030
I'm I am okay. Case you are wondering. I got a little, uh, I don't know.

7
00:00:19.031 --> 00:00:22.180
I got a little S. I've been fighting off this car for like two fucking weeks.

8
00:00:22.181 --> 00:00:25.570
Who's kidding? Who? Right. And I, uh, you know,

9
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.120
I was fighting off and it was getting worse and Nia kept going.

10
00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:29.770
Why don't you take some medicine?

11
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.210
Why don't I take tech some of this new thing next? All right.

12
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.403
Holy Shit.

13
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.710
Half fucking my hats off to anybody that can get fucking drunk off their,

14
00:00:38.711 --> 00:00:40.510
that stuff. Jesus Christ.

15
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.560
That's like peppermint Schnapps Times fucking 20.

16
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.050
I really is Mucin X. It's like schnapps on steroids. It's just, you know,

17
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.180
one of the, you know,

18
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.450
the other others have these dumb champ challenges like the mannequin challenge.

19
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.160
I don't understand. What is the challenge?

20
00:00:57.161 --> 00:01:00.220
Just hold still is somebody pans around the room.

21
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.440
That's a fucking challenge.

22
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.840
How the fuck did we go from faking a lunar landing fake in that faking out the

23
00:01:07.841 --> 00:01:12.350
whole fucking Russians. And they got so freaked out that day. Day One,

24
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.970
they went on a hissy fit for the next fucking 30 years before they finally went

25
00:01:15.971 --> 00:01:20.520
broke. Right in the early nineties cause we,

26
00:01:20.521 --> 00:01:24.030
we accepted the challenge of the faking of the lunar land.

27
00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:27.300
Maybe we even got there, the Luna land landing challenge.

28
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.600
Now we're fucking all the mannequin. Oh, planking. Yeah.

29
00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:35.400
I lay face down and somebody takes a picture of me. Oh dude, that's epic.

30
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.090
Jesus Christ. I don't know you what the f you know what it is,

31
00:01:39.091 --> 00:01:43.650
is these fucking goddamn cuts. Young people these days, you know, no offense,

32
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.000
right? God bless his,

33
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.660
let's say fucking spend their whole lives with these fucking reality,

34
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.560
virtual reality. God Damn things on their head. They're playing video games.

35
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.790
They don't have any skills. The second you take the fucking laptop,

36
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.580
you take the fucking laser tag thing, the pink gun,

37
00:01:59.581 --> 00:02:02.820
whatever the fuck technology is. The thing that, you know, that new thing that,

38
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.260
that, that they're trying to get old people into the virtual reality, like,

39
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.080
like live in a fucking life is, it isn't enough.

40
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.320
Like I want to leave this fucking world really is, you saw it all, huh?

41
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.920
You're been to Venice, rode a boat through the fucking canal.

42
00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:23.550
You haven't done shit. All right, so this is the deal.

43
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.740
They don't fucking know how to fucking do anything.

44
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.760
Is this such an old man rent not to do anything.

45
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.660
They're just fucking literally laying face down in the road. You know,

46
00:02:33.661 --> 00:02:36.960
and somebody takes a picture. Is, is this is, it's epic.

47
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.760
It's fucking epic. Now granted in the 70s, they did have pet rock,

48
00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:43.830
so I might be full of Shit. But you know what it is,

49
00:02:43.831 --> 00:02:47.250
the great thing about being old is you lack perspective.

50
00:02:47.251 --> 00:02:50.670
When you talk about anything new, you're just like, dad's different.

51
00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:52.790
It scares me. Um,

52
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.730
I don't get the mannequin challenge. I don't, you know, and that,

53
00:02:57.731 --> 00:03:00.100
that was like the, when they also had the, uh,

54
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.450
whatever the Harlem shake was initially it was a dance and then it was just that

55
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:09.190
stupid youtube thing, the ice bucket challenge, all of that Shit,

56
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.170
you know, if your instincts aren't immediately to not be part of the group, um,

57
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.960
I don't know what that says about you.

58
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.110
I don't want to says about me that I immediately ice buck or everybody's doing

59
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.980
it. Well then fucking I'm not doing it. Oh yeah.

60
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.410
Anti social sick. Freckled headed bald cunt. What's wrong with you today?

61
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.020
Hang on a second. Rico law.

62
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.030
Yes. I've been fighting this fucking thing off. You know, I have a bad feeling.

63
00:03:40.031 --> 00:03:43.900
It might be one this cigar that I got that there's something in there,

64
00:03:43.901 --> 00:03:45.970
some sort of bacteria because I was fine.

65
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:50.971
And then I smoked with Versie on his birthday and then I smoked with Bobby Kelly

66
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.990
had fucking comics come home back to back nights.

67
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.000
And then I just had this fucking cough. You don't,

68
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.700
it's not like he inhaled the goddamn things.

69
00:04:00.701 --> 00:04:02.410
It's not like I smoke one every fucking day.

70
00:04:02.411 --> 00:04:04.810
I smoked one like once every two weeks. Oh,

71
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.610
they've been on a little bit of a bender. Okay. Um, so anyways,

72
00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:14.350
so Sunday night, you know, it's been a good 15 days since I smoked out. Right.

73
00:04:14.351 --> 00:04:16.150
I'll smoke. Another one went down with my buddy.

74
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.310
We watched the Broncos chiefs game,

75
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.650
arguably the greatest Sunday night football game ever.

76
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.270
I lost track of how many fucking lead changes there were. Um,

77
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.980
just, you know, and I wasn't drinking. I haven't drank since thanksgiving.

78
00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:35.950
I kind of bottomed out thanksgiving. Right. You know what's back.

79
00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:39.460
I had a great thanksgiving, by the way. Great fucking thanksgiving. Um,

80
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.990
we ended up day. Talk about that already. I think I already did.

81
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.850
Maybe I didn't. I don't remember. I started talking. I hadn't gone to it yet.

82
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.980
That's right. That's what it was. Listen to this shit.

83
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.790
We went to somebody else's for Thanksgiving and everything was fucking

84
00:04:54.791 --> 00:04:59.020
delicious. Every side was fucking not only delicious,

85
00:04:59.021 --> 00:05:03.580
it was a home run. It's the best thanksgiving I've had since I've been a kid.

86
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.450
When I ate my mom, my parents house, you know, my mother cooked.

87
00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:10.690
So it just automatically tastes right. Cause that's the only thanksgiving,

88
00:05:10.691 --> 00:05:15.010
you know? Right. But that once you move out,

89
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.590
you're eating other people's food and no matter what,

90
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.590
it's always a little bit different. It's not quite the same.

91
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.680
You get that feeling of, fuck, it's over.

92
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.490
I have to pay rent now I'm going to get old. Right?

93
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.590
I'm going to be that person.

94
00:05:29.591 --> 00:05:32.290
What happened to him and then I fucking die and blah blah, blah,

95
00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:35.200
Blah Blah and all that bullshit. Right? So anyways,

96
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.270
we had a great fucking Thanksgiving and I had this fucking bottle of Bourbon

97
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.200
that I brought. That was my responsibility. When the fuck is my phone,

98
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.840
I gotta give this thing a shout out man. You know,

99
00:05:46.841 --> 00:05:51.430
they say you can't judge a book by by its fucking cover. Um,

100
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.140
I actually judged this bottle of just by how cool the fucking bottle looked.

101
00:05:55.141 --> 00:05:58.370
So let me scroll through my, it was called angels in something or other,

102
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:00.201
by the way,

103
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:03.410
it rain like a motherfucker out here and I have water collecting up on my roof.

104
00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:07.130
Again, fucking cons. It's unbelievable.

105
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.360
It's just fucking, it's just, it's just not even right.

106
00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.640
So I got to get the third fucking people out here to see if they know how to fix

107
00:06:15.641 --> 00:06:19.270
it. Ah, God damn. And I thought I took a picture of it. Nah, I gotta find it.

108
00:06:19.271 --> 00:06:23.080
Hang on a second. You know, I'm gonna hit pause. I'll hit pause. All right.

109
00:06:23.081 --> 00:06:27.340
I found it. Angels envy. It's a Kentucky Bourbon.

110
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.820
God dammit. Was that delicious? And uh, me and two other people, a,

111
00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.660
we finished the bottle and, uh, I dunno,

112
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.550
I got like to my last one and I was just like, you know what? I think this,

113
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.300
uh, I think it's time for me to shut it down. You know,

114
00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.890
maybe once in awhile the drinking just gets a little bit too fucking far and

115
00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:52.360
then I just shut it down. So I walked away cold Turkey, thanksgiving night,

116
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.980
cold Turkey. I buck and walked away from it. And um,

117
00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.853
<v 0>you know,</v>

118
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.330
<v 1>I'm not gonna lie to you. I miss it. It's only been four days.</v>

119
00:07:02.331 --> 00:07:06.740
I'm still thinking about you sending out letters and shit. Um, yeah,

120
00:07:06.741 --> 00:07:08.990
I'm just going to shut it down probably until, um,

121
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.790
I'd say maybe the Rose Bowl New Year's day or whatever. I already got it,

122
00:07:13.791 --> 00:07:16.520
shut it down and get a fucking kid come. And so it's over. You know what,

123
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.550
you know what people, I gotta be honest. I had a great run.

124
00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:25.490
I got the stories, you know, I spent a few,

125
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.520
a few hours in jail. I mean, I've done, you know, went to court.

126
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.180
I had the whole, you know, had to apologize to people.

127
00:07:32.181 --> 00:07:36.080
I had a very full experience with alcohol, you know,

128
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:40.430
talk to some chicks that were way out of my league. You know, I,

129
00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:43.040
I did it. I had the whole thing, you know,

130
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.580
stayed on the outskirts of bar fights to make sure that I didn't get pummeled.

131
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:58.040
So that's it. So anyways, um, believe it or not, as bad as my coughs sounds,

132
00:07:58.041 --> 00:07:59.830
it's way better than it was fucking yesterday. I was going,

133
00:07:59.831 --> 00:08:02.990
I wasn't going to put you through that shit. So anyways, so Sunday night, yeah,

134
00:08:02.991 --> 00:08:05.410
smoked a number of those cigars. And yesterday I woke up, I just,

135
00:08:05.411 --> 00:08:09.710
I was having a fucking coffin fit. Granted I was already run down.

136
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:12.980
So yesterday, um, I didn't do shit.

137
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:17.240
I gotta tell you that was like the greatest six hours of my life,

138
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:21.860
not doing shit. But somewhere in that six hour, uh,

139
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:24.140
after the six hours I was going out of my fucking mind.

140
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.470
I don't know how you guys do it, you know, not you guys.

141
00:08:27.471 --> 00:08:30.800
Just whoever the fuck is out there that just can just truly take a god Damn Day

142
00:08:30.801 --> 00:08:35.390
off. Like I go fucking nuts. After six hours was great. I laid there,

143
00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:37.940
I watched like two, three episodes of, um,

144
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:40.730
Westworld getting caught up.

145
00:08:40.731 --> 00:08:44.630
I'm up to like episode a six I'm going to watch today. Right?

146
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.260
And I'm loving that show.

147
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:52.730
Although he can't watch more than two or three a day, it's just too much, man.

148
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.260
It's like you just gotta be, you know,

149
00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:02.070
it's a lot of shit going on to kind of take in and then also having now doing my

150
00:09:02.071 --> 00:09:04.860
own little show, that's only a half hour. When I look at that show,

151
00:09:04.861 --> 00:09:09.120
I just think of like, how fucking long did it take them to do this?

152
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.050
And then I'm going to sit here and I'm going to watch it in two days and then be

153
00:09:13.051 --> 00:09:16.830
that douche going when season two coming out. You know, it's like,

154
00:09:16.831 --> 00:09:21.150
it's a fine bottle of wine and I'm just going to Chug the thing, you know,

155
00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:24.810
after the third glass, I'm not really tasting it anymore cause I'm so hammered.

156
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:29.310
I might as well be drinking like fucking red, white and Blue Beers. Some shit,

157
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:33.330
right. Just doesn't seem right. So anyways,

158
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:38.550
that's what I did yesterday and um, I'm feeling much better. Thank Christ. So,

159
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:43.360
um, by the way, today's November 29th, which is, uh,

160
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:47.130
the five year anniversary since the passing of one of the funniest and greatest

161
00:09:47.131 --> 00:09:48.630
people I ever met Patrice O'Neil,

162
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:54.360
speaking of which there are still some tickets left for the, uh,

163
00:09:54.361 --> 00:09:57.630
the fifth annual Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit. Um,

164
00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.320
all the proceeds after we pay for the, uh, the venue. Of course,

165
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:05.970
our only expense, um, you know,

166
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.490
it goes to all of his loved ones. That's been a tremendous success.

167
00:10:08.491 --> 00:10:12.750
And this year we have, we have, um,

168
00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.930
let's get the whole line up here for God's sakes. For God's sakes.

169
00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:20.280
We got Leslie Jones, we got rich foss, we got Bobby Kelly,

170
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:25.230
Keith Robinson, Gary Gulman, Dan Soda, Soda,

171
00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:28.680
right. And Myself, um,

172
00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:31.500
there's going to be another great year of, um,

173
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.380
I'm just getting to see all those people, you know,

174
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.340
I never get to see them anymore cause I'm always out here gigging on the road or

175
00:10:38.341 --> 00:10:41.400
living out here in La Bababababa bus. So, um,

176
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:43.800
that's going to be a Tuesday,

177
00:10:43.801 --> 00:10:48.750
February 21st at the New York City Center. And um,

178
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:52.500
you know, it's just a, it's just a great event and um,

179
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:57.660
thank you to everybody who's come to it in the past years and um,

180
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.450
you've guys have done a wonderful thing. Um,

181
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.670
keeping all his loved ones comfortable.

182
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:07.560
And I'm very proud of that whole charity thing because, um,

183
00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.620
you know, as tragic as it was that he was gone,

184
00:11:10.621 --> 00:11:14.580
I'm very proud of the fact that all of his friends stepped up and that all of

185
00:11:14.581 --> 00:11:15.780
his loved ones or comfortable,

186
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:20.250
cause I know that that's what he would have been concerned with. So with that,

187
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:21.713
um,

188
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:25.200
I'm actually doing another benefit for those who can't make it to New York City.

189
00:11:25.201 --> 00:11:29.040
If you're in the La area and you would like to, um,

190
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.860
you'd like to help out on another benefit.

191
00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:33.870
I have another buddy of mine that died.

192
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:37.290
So what happens when you get into your forties, man, it's fucking brutal.

193
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.670
Is a couple of your buddies die too young man, it's awful. This guy,

194
00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:46.380
Pete and I started out with him in, um, 1992, um,

195
00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:49.620
did stand up with them from 92 to 99 and then he moved on to writing with

196
00:11:49.621 --> 00:11:54.550
National Lampoon. He did some stuff for the UFC. Just a great guy. Unfortunately

197
00:11:56.710 --> 00:12:01.030
he had a heart attack a few weeks ago and about a month ago. So, uh, Tuesday,

198
00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:03.070
December 6th at the laugh factory.

199
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:07.540
I'll be doing a headlining set there and I'm a bunch of pizza friends from back

200
00:12:07.541 --> 00:12:11.260
in the day, a bunch of comics. We haven't all been on the same show in forever.

201
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:16.540
Probably 20 years. We'll be a going on, um, earlier in the night.

202
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:20.980
Uh, it's going to be a great thing and a, it's a memory of him. So there you go.

203
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:25.630
So enough with the, uh, friends of mine that have passed away unfortunately. Um,

204
00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:30.360
let's talk about some shit here. I fi I got a wife,

205
00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:34.120
I've got to give a shout out to fucking Nico Rosberg when in his first Formula

206
00:12:34.121 --> 00:12:36.940
One championship, um,

207
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:40.450
the final few laps of that race were amazing. Right?

208
00:12:40.451 --> 00:12:44.230
For those of you who are not into it, basically what the situation was,

209
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:49.390
Lewis Hamilton had won the last three. Nico Rosberg had never won.

210
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.810
They both drive from Mercedes. Okay. So Nico's,

211
00:12:52.811 --> 00:12:55.960
the young upstart Louis is the grizzled vet,

212
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:57.370
even though they're both fucking young.

213
00:12:57.371 --> 00:12:59.650
It was kind of like days of thunder of both.

214
00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:04.090
Both people look like fucking Tom Cruise is basically it, right?

215
00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:09.100
It's like two tongue, the old Tom Cruise, right? Scientology,

216
00:13:09.101 --> 00:13:12.070
Tom Cruise versus fucking, um,

217
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:16.360
what was that movie that they will all in where they were the, the,

218
00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:21.250
the socials in the greasers the fuck was that movie called? I knew that one.

219
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:22.760
<v 0>Okay.</v>

220
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.930
<v 1>Ah, God dammit. What was it called? Matt Dylan was in it.</v>

221
00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:31.630
Emilio Estevez Istep as, ah,

222
00:13:31.631 --> 00:13:36.460
the dirty dancing guy. Roadhouse guy. The karate kid was in it.

223
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:37.930
Tom Cruise was in it.

224
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.230
Who else was in that fucking movie? Everybody was in that fucking movie.

225
00:13:43.231 --> 00:13:45.300
Everybody like there was like nine people in that fucking movie.

226
00:13:45.301 --> 00:13:47.670
They had all went, uh, see Thomas Howell.

227
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:49.770
They all went on to star and movies that made,

228
00:13:49.771 --> 00:13:53.160
I would love to see how much fucking box office, every,

229
00:13:53.161 --> 00:13:56.130
every guy that started as a greaser in that movie ended up making. You know,

230
00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:59.970
you got to hate being the one fucking greaser that didn't make it right.

231
00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.400
That's when you just got to look at yourself like, dude,

232
00:14:02.401 --> 00:14:06.210
what the fuck everybody in this ensemble cast?

233
00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:10.960
I got to find out what it is now. All right, Tom Cruise I m.

234
00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:15.360
D. B. How do you spell Cruz wrong?

235
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:19.770
I somehow spelled it with to use eos. Tom fucking crows.

236
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:24.780
Toyos all right. There he is. Smiling, looking sort of normal.

237
00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:28.490
As normal as he possibly can. Well, what the outside,

238
00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:34.320
oh, the outsiders. All right, here we go. Let's, let's this,

239
00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:39.030
this is the fucking lineup. See Thomas how Matt Dillon, Ralph Machio.

240
00:14:39.031 --> 00:14:41.910
Patrick Swayze. Rob fucking low.

241
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:46.020
Emilio Estefan is Tom Cruise.

242
00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:48.123
<v 0>Okay.</v>

243
00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:53.150
<v 1>Alright. That alone right there. One, three, four, five,</v>

244
00:14:53.151 --> 00:14:53.661
six.

245
00:14:53.661 --> 00:14:58.661
The first seven guys all went on to star in movies.

246
00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:04.460
Tom Cruise alone has done billions in box office. Matt Dillon,

247
00:15:04.461 --> 00:15:07.280
the amount of money he's done, Ralph Machio, the fucking karate kid.

248
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.510
Patrick Swayze, dirty dancing alone. Forget about ghost,

249
00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:14.910
right when they were in the claymation class and what did,

250
00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.900
and he comes up behind her and they go, oh wow.

251
00:15:17.901 --> 00:15:22.901
The time of my life would be Goldberg grabbing your tits.

252
00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:29.020
I swear. Emilio Estevez Right. He was in stakeout.

253
00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:33.680
He was in fucking, uh, the breakfast club.

254
00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:36.650
<v 2>Um,</v>

255
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:39.830
<v 1>he was in the cowboy movies, right? And he played Billy the kid. Gigamon,</v>

256
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:43.760
you know, all these fucking people are, and you got a guy like Glenn Withrow.

257
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:48.260
The fuck happened to him. Diane Lane, she was in my leaf, Garrett. Jesus Christ.

258
00:15:48.261 --> 00:15:52.280
He sold a bunch of albums. Tom Waits was in that fucking movie.

259
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:58.610
Then there was a William Smith who plays the store clerk. You went by William,

260
00:15:58.611 --> 00:16:01.850
if you went by will, you know, could've been a whole different story.

261
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.260
So anyways, I don't even know what the fuck I'm too. Oh yeah. So Nico Rosberg,

262
00:16:06.261 --> 00:16:07.550
right? So here's the deal.

263
00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:11.300
The way the points worked out was Louis Hamilton had the win. The fucking race

264
00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:16.530
provided Niko didn't crash, all right? If Nico was going to finish the race,

265
00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:21.960
Louis had to win the race and Nico had to become in fourth place or worse,

266
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:26.720
and then Louis would have won his fourth in a row. Okay.

267
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:30.980
But a lot of three peak out there for not nobody.

268
00:16:30.981 --> 00:16:34.280
Who the fuck does four in a row? You never see that shit, right?

269
00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.290
So it comes down to the law.

270
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:39.260
All Niko had to do was finish in third place in no matter what Lewis Hamilton

271
00:16:39.261 --> 00:16:44.150
did, the shit was over. So you get down to like five fucking laps to go.

272
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:48.200
Nico Rosberg he's in third place, he's a fucking lunatic.

273
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:52.160
He passes the thing. It was a red bull car and all the guys,

274
00:16:52.161 --> 00:16:54.340
I love the guys who announced it, they're always so fucking cool.

275
00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:59.900
Like whenever there's a pat Ho Cho go god, they're always doing that shit.

276
00:16:59.901 --> 00:17:03.710
It's like, dude, do you have money in that car? Is that your son in there?

277
00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:08.330
I mean, after reason we're watching this shit. It's to see him crash.

278
00:17:08.331 --> 00:17:11.150
It's like watching hockey. Half of it's to watch the game.

279
00:17:11.151 --> 00:17:13.630
The other half is to watch somebody beat the fuck out of somebody. I want,

280
00:17:13.631 --> 00:17:16.700
I want to see somebody spin around a little bit. You know,

281
00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:21.020
I want to see a fender. Right.

282
00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:26.930
So anyways, uh, so get senator. The last five laps,

283
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:29.750
Nico goes around, whoever the fuck was in second place.

284
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:34.610
How can burger or fucking one of those other guys are Timo Nikunen,

285
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.790
Timo, Salani I dunno. Anything, any of the other drivers yet.

286
00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:41.330
It's my first year watching it, right? He fucking passes the guy.

287
00:17:41.331 --> 00:17:44.360
Now he's in second place. So now loads just like what the fuck.

288
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:46.880
So Lewis Hamilton starts slowing down,

289
00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.220
trying to let the third and fourth place cars catch up,

290
00:17:50.221 --> 00:17:54.150
which they're doing all right. Now they're a fucking team.

291
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:59.530
They're on the same team. So evidently when the head dude at Mercedes,

292
00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.590
you know, if you're on the Mercedes teams,

293
00:18:02.591 --> 00:18:04.720
if your team calls you and tells you to do something,

294
00:18:04.721 --> 00:18:07.210
you're not supposed to disobey a direct order. I'm telling you,

295
00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.490
this is like top gun and fucking

296
00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:16.660
Jay's the thunder. Sorry. It's just a little touch of a bullet people, right?

297
00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:21.440
So he gives [inaudible], they give Lewis a direct order to go and Louis a,

298
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:24.490
you gotta drive faster here. Come on. We want to win this race.

299
00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:27.010
And Lewis just says,

300
00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:30.880
he just says back into the radio on TV,

301
00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:34.450
basically said, um, well, um,

302
00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:38.950
I'm still in first place and I'm comfortable with my current position,

303
00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.720
basically. Meaning like,

304
00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:43.720
I'm not going to drive any fucking faster and I'm good enough that even if

305
00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:48.760
Nico's right on my ass, I know he's not going to try to go around me, you know,

306
00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:53.950
risking crashing cause he's got it. So for the last five fucking laps you,

307
00:18:53.951 --> 00:18:55.600
I just on the edge of your fucking seat,

308
00:18:55.601 --> 00:18:59.540
like is this guy in third place going to go around Nico Rosberg um,

309
00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:03.820
he didn't, Lewis Hamilton disobeyed a direct order.

310
00:19:03.821 --> 00:19:08.440
I believe Robert Duvall came out in the end and started screaming at somebody.

311
00:19:08.441 --> 00:19:13.000
I can't remember, but um, it was kind of funny like whenever,

312
00:19:13.001 --> 00:19:16.480
like they're both on the podium, which was almost every race this year.

313
00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:19.390
Nico and Lewis like wouldn't even look at each other. It was fucking like,

314
00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:22.600
oh my God, I'm not even talking to you right now. I'm like,

315
00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:24.880
so like not even talking to you right now.

316
00:19:24.881 --> 00:19:26.410
Like it was that whole fucking energy.

317
00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.040
So when Nico wins the thing,

318
00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:33.370
they actually shook hands and there was some fucking clown interview and them

319
00:19:33.371 --> 00:19:36.940
going, Oh, I kind of blocked a shot. Can you guys do that again? It was great.

320
00:19:36.941 --> 00:19:41.020
And then they just sort of begrudgingly shook hands or whatever and the guy just

321
00:19:41.021 --> 00:19:43.990
goes, oh, that's great. It's, it's all good. Again, if something like that,

322
00:19:43.991 --> 00:19:47.150
it's like, dude, it's very far from all good again. So, um,

323
00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.950
I believe this season starts up again, either the end of March or the,

324
00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:53.140
or the beginning of April. And uh,

325
00:19:53.141 --> 00:19:56.650
I jumped on this year after they raced in Monaco and I had a great time fucking

326
00:19:56.651 --> 00:19:57.130
watching it.

327
00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:01.900
I actually started to think of the sheer amount of fucking money it must cost to

328
00:20:01.901 --> 00:20:04.750
have a Goddamn to run a Formula One team.

329
00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:08.170
I can't imagine how much fucking money you got to ship that car around the

330
00:20:08.171 --> 00:20:12.150
fucking world like nine times. And you know,

331
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:14.190
you got a couple of other cars you've got to bring with it.

332
00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:19.220
It's got to cost you $1 billion. It has to, does it bill?

333
00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:23.360
Have you ever tried to ship even your fucking Prius to Connecticut? No.

334
00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:26.660
So then you really don't know how much it costs. Ah, you got me. Whatever.

335
00:20:26.661 --> 00:20:29.690
I know it's got to cost a lot of fucking money there, right.

336
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:33.980
So anyways, anybody watch Ohio State, Michigan?

337
00:20:33.981 --> 00:20:36.170
I know this is kind of old games, but I don't give a fuck.

338
00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:38.090
Did you guys watch that?

339
00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:41.510
It's one of the best games I've seen between those two and a long fucking time.

340
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:46.940
And um, Michigan just kept fucking up when they got the ball.

341
00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:51.010
They had the Goddamn game one. Do you notice how, what's his face there? The,

342
00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:53.680
for whatever reason, I can never remember the last name.

343
00:20:53.681 --> 00:20:57.280
The fucking coach in Michigan. Jim Harbaugh. Ah,

344
00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.980
do you notice he was wearing the woody Hayes glasses?

345
00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.560
I actually had a theory that if they won,

346
00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:07.510
he was going to take the glasses off on their fucking logo on the 50 yard line

347
00:21:07.511 --> 00:21:11.110
and steps stomp on him. You know, like after Jewish people get married,

348
00:21:11.111 --> 00:21:14.260
they step on the fucking glass. He was going to do that with the fucking his,

349
00:21:14.261 --> 00:21:16.120
his woody Hayes glasses.

350
00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:19.930
And I loved that he called out the referee in and all that shit. You know,

351
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:23.890
I'm not saying I 100% agreed with them and all that shit, but uh, you know,

352
00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.180
I thought they got to call right on there.

353
00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:28.860
First down I stood up to when I saw live action, I was like, yeah.

354
00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:34.960
And then I saw a fuck. He got it. I thought he got it anyways.

355
00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.530
Um, but all my Michigan Buddies, they were all texting me.

356
00:21:38.531 --> 00:21:41.500
That was a home job and all this type of shit. So who do you like guys?

357
00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:46.210
It's probably gonna be Alabama, right? That had a nice,

358
00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:50.890
had an easy time with fucking Auburn. She,

359
00:21:50.891 --> 00:21:53.800
the kicker for Auburn, he grew up in an Alabama family.

360
00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.160
Rolltide family in Alabama didn't give him a scholarship,

361
00:21:57.161 --> 00:22:02.161
so he goes to fucking Auburn now and his grandfather calls him turncoat fucking

362
00:22:02.861 --> 00:22:05.730
lunatics down there. Right. Scary Danielson. The whole game keeps going.

363
00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.420
Goes turncoat kicking it for three.

364
00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.200
I didn't think this podcast is remotely funny, but maybe,

365
00:22:14.201 --> 00:22:18.100
maybe he just laughing at me coughing up a fucking lung hair. Um,

366
00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:21.310
anyway, so it's going to be Alabama

367
00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:29.700
and I'm going to say it's going to be Ohio state for the championship and his

368
00:22:30.431 --> 00:22:34.840
old Billy red face having only watched about 15 college games this year,

369
00:22:34.841 --> 00:22:38.680
having never played beyond the third grade level. This is my prediction.

370
00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.410
All right. Organized. Anyways,

371
00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:45.340
I played enough pickup football for the first time I ever threw up my back was

372
00:22:45.341 --> 00:22:49.810
playing fucking football and uh, it's never been the same, you know?

373
00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:52.030
No, it's not the first time.

374
00:22:52.031 --> 00:22:54.580
The first time was when that kid put me in the figure four leg lock and fourth

375
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.180
grade outdoor recess. That's the first time I threw it out.

376
00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.800
The next time was playing football.

377
00:22:59.801 --> 00:23:01.840
And then the third time was another wrestling thing.

378
00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:05.760
I tried to lift my younger brother up over my head, like Tony Atlas and the,

379
00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:10.780
the upper third of my spine folded. It felt like, and uh,

380
00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:13.270
you know, that's given me problems ever since then. You know,

381
00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:18.460
that's probably why I leaned on the mic stand. Anyways, plowing ahead here.

382
00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:22.210
I think it's going to be, it's going to be fucking Ohio state, Alabama.

383
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:22.900
Obviously.

384
00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:27.580
I'm picking the number one and two teams and I think a Alabama Beats Ohio state

385
00:23:27.581 --> 00:23:32.581
this time simply because I thought Iowa state had a lot of problems with debt

386
00:23:32.951 --> 00:23:36.010
defense there in Michigan. Um,

387
00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:41.230
and I think Alabama's defense is even better and Alabama's off fence is not

388
00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:46.100
going to make the fucking mistakes that Michigan's, um, offense made.

389
00:23:46.101 --> 00:23:46.580
You know,

390
00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:49.970
you don't watch an Alabama team and they fumble a fucking snap on the one yard

391
00:23:49.971 --> 00:23:53.000
line. They just don't do shit like that. You know what I mean?

392
00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:56.820
Cause what's his face? Nick Saban that Luna ticket,

393
00:23:56.821 --> 00:24:00.470
he probably fucking waterboard you know how angry a dude, you know,

394
00:24:00.471 --> 00:24:02.990
that guy makes me feel good about my anger when I see that guy.

395
00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:04.850
I was joking about this,

396
00:24:04.851 --> 00:24:08.720
I did a Jeff's this areas podcast and we were fucking joking about,

397
00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:13.900
my favorite fucking thing to do is to watch Alabama going in like down by seven

398
00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:16.343
and half time.

399
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:21.050
I love when the halftime reporter comes up and starts talking to Nick Saban and

400
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:23.990
the, the, the look of fucking anger on his face.

401
00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:28.550
All he wants to do is go into the locker room and call everybody's mother a cunt

402
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:31.020
that's wearing his uniform. Right?

403
00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:34.130
But he's got to sit there and talk to some chick on the side like I like,

404
00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:37.020
<v 3>so why do you think it is your dad? [inaudible]</v>

405
00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.540
<v 1>yes. It just sit there. You know,</v>

406
00:24:38.541 --> 00:24:41.990
he just wants to slap the wig right up for fucking head. But he doesn't do it.

407
00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:46.820
He doesn't doe it. They sits there with his fucking,

408
00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:49.730
I dunno what it is on his head. You know,

409
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:56.120
he makes Donald Trump look like fucking a Fabio.

410
00:24:56.121 --> 00:24:57.410
I'm trying to think of somebody who's good here.

411
00:24:57.411 --> 00:25:00.650
Who the fuck even has good heroin. You never even know anymore, right?

412
00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:04.250
Everybody goes around, they get, they get the troops from the Beck, you know,

413
00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.010
PLM, but the potatoes get put out right up on the front line.

414
00:25:07.011 --> 00:25:09.110
Now is now what they do.

415
00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:13.550
Then everybody goes swimming and nobody knows what's going on. Right? Tell you.

416
00:25:13.551 --> 00:25:17.300
It takes a real man like myself to walk around looking like Charlie Brown.

417
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:21.530
I'm telling you. Red, redheaded, Charlie Brown. Um, anyways,

418
00:25:21.531 --> 00:25:23.840
let's read some advertising here for this week everybody.

419
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:27.770
Let's see what we got here on the docket. How about those?

420
00:25:27.771 --> 00:25:30.050
Bruins finally went in a game, right? Second I started watching.

421
00:25:30.051 --> 00:25:34.670
They go into a three game fucking skid. Just let you know what a big one.

422
00:25:34.671 --> 00:25:37.730
A big, you cannot put a price on what does it Dana,

423
00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:42.440
Ciara brings to this Boston Bruin defense. All right, a frame bridge.

424
00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:45.740
All right? If you previously listened to this show,

425
00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:49.040
you've heard me talk about frame bridge. Hey, relax. Okay.

426
00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:52.730
Some people fast forward through these things. They may,

427
00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:57.350
they make it super easy and affordable to cut to custom frame your favorite

428
00:25:57.351 --> 00:26:01.760
things. You got a nice Dick Pic. Ah, they got the frame for you.

429
00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.960
I'm from art and prints and posters to the photos on your phone.

430
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:11.300
They're expert team handcrafts each custom frame here are the new US handcrafts

431
00:26:11.301 --> 00:26:13.070
it. I thought they just measured it.

432
00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:17.030
They hand craft this thing and we'll send it to you and in days,

433
00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:21.230
not weeks or months. All right? That's why you're gonna love frame bridge.

434
00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:26.960
That's why sending a custom frame picture with frame pitch is the go to gift

435
00:26:26.961 --> 00:26:30.920
this holiday season. That's a great gift. You don't have any fucking money.

436
00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:33.620
Just frame a cell phone picture, you and the other person.

437
00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:38.120
Just write like friends or smile. Put a little Emoji on it.

438
00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:39.981
This is beautiful.

439

32 minutes in. Was there anything else I wanted to fucking talk about?

534
00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:14.180
Uh Oh dude, I started going through my shit cause I'm, I'm,

535
00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.760
I'm selling my Prius, right?

536
00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:21.450
So I'm going back and I'm trying to find the title to my car and of course I

537
00:32:21.971 --> 00:32:25.960
can't find this fucking thing. And I find the title to my wife's car,

538
00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:28.240
to my car and my old truck.

539
00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:33.130
And I also found a copy of a title to this 88 Honda accord.

540
00:32:33.131 --> 00:32:35.350
I had like fucking 15 years ago.

541
00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:36.890
<v 0>Okay.</v>

542
00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:41.030
<v 1>I had the DX was the LX. You had the LX five speed manual transmission.</v>

543
00:32:41.031 --> 00:32:44.920
What a great fucking car that was. God Damn it. I loved that car. Um,

544
00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:47.340
I found a copy of that, but nothing for the Prius.

545
00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:50.960
And now I gotta go fucking to the DMV and get a copy of it and all that

546
00:32:50.961 --> 00:32:55.460
bullshit. Um, ended up getting rid of that shit.

547
00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:59.120
Move on with my fucking life. I'm

548
00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.800
gonna get a fucking God damn conference call coming up here in 10 minutes.

549
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:08.450
I'll have to finish the rest of the podcast later. I apologize. You know,

550
00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:11.990
that's what it is. Patriots jets. Did you watch that?

551
00:33:11.991 --> 00:33:15.470
How fucking awful that our defense look in the first fucking half. Good Lord.

552
00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:21.010
Um, I mean, I know we're banged up and everything, but uh, I don't know.

553
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:27.290
Remember that time when we traded Richard Seymour long time ago and every

554
00:33:27.291 --> 00:33:29.870
Patriot fan was like, dude, what the fuck did we do that for?

555
00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:32.690
And then the people who were kind of paying attention, we're like, well look,

556
00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:35.300
there was a deal next year. Who's going to be up for free agency.

557
00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:38.150
He was going to ask for a zillion dollars and we knew we weren't going to give

558
00:33:38.151 --> 00:33:40.010
it to them and then we would have gotten nothing for him.

559
00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.370
So we traded them the year before I went on this website and they showed all

560
00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:47.300
that that trickled down from that thing, that trade.

561
00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:50.720
Um, and all the players we got,

562
00:33:50.721 --> 00:33:55.160
how we could be more aggressive because of what we got from Richard Seymour.

563
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:59.570
I'm hoping the same thing is that happened this year with, uh,

564
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:03.800
I didn't know if we traded Chen Chandler Jones and we lost them to free agents,

565
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:08.120
free agency, but a fucking dude that we sent to Cleveland,

566
00:34:08.121 --> 00:34:12.590
which I keep Jamie Collins. Maybe that'll turn into something, but uh,

567
00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:17.360
I don't know. It's unhealthy as we are. I'm not, I'm not, I don't know.

568
00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:20.420
I'm not giving him, I never came up. I'm just saying, you know what the fuck.

569
00:34:20.421 --> 00:34:21.710
It's the Goddamn jets.

570
00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:25.250
They will fucking go and crazy to every fucking play they made.

571
00:34:25.251 --> 00:34:28.460
They were going fucking nuts. You know,

572
00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:31.520
like they just fucking like that was their playoff game,

573
00:34:31.521 --> 00:34:35.210
whichever respected they fucking came to play. But anyways,

574
00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:39.650
so this whole fucking weekend, all I did was watch football and I,

575
00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:43.580
and I was looking for that title and in the process of looking for the title,

576
00:34:43.581 --> 00:34:46.640
I cleaned up a bunch of my shit and I was kinda thinking with the kid coming

577
00:34:46.641 --> 00:34:51.290
along, um, I'm not going to have time to do shit,

578
00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:53.090
but life is going to keep hitting me.

579
00:34:53.091 --> 00:34:56.240
So I want to know where all my insurance forms are.

580
00:34:56.830 --> 00:35:01.100
We're every fucking piece of legal shit that I need. You know what I mean? Like,

581
00:35:01.101 --> 00:35:02.670
do you have your tracking number and all that?

582
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:05.180
And I'm getting all of that stuff organized and um,

583
00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:07.970
I had all these fucking shit that I held on to for,

584
00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:13.240
I had like fucking my insurance auto insurance contract from like 2007 until

585
00:35:13.641 --> 00:35:17.180
now. And I'm like, it expires 12 months after you get a bill.

586
00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:20.450
You've held onto this shit for nine years longer than you need to.

587
00:35:20.451 --> 00:35:24.170
So I shred it a lot of shit, but a underrated,

588
00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:28.550
just finally going through your office and just organizing everything.

589
00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:31.700
I kind of know where like everything is now. And uh,

590
00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:34.550
I wanna I want to do that kind of for everything that I have.

591
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:38.790
So when my kid comes here and then takes marker out and draws all over

592
00:35:38.791 --> 00:35:41.910
everything, I'll know where the fucking insurance shit is. Um, all right, let's,

593
00:35:41.911 --> 00:35:45.480
let's read 'em. Let's read some, uh,

594
00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:50.060
some questions here for the week. Stan hope special.

595
00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:54.530
Is it somebody writing in about the great? Doug Stanhope said, Hey,

596
00:35:54.531 --> 00:35:59.531
bill used your promo code to sign up for CSO so I could watch Stan hope's new

597
00:36:00.081 --> 00:36:03.080
special. I've heard nothing but great things. He said, Holy Shit,

598
00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:06.770
you're still my favorite bill. But Stan hope is a genius.

599
00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:08.690
Why do you guys always have to do that?

600
00:36:08.691 --> 00:36:12.020
You still got to take the piss out of me. I know. He's fucking tremendous.

601
00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:14.630
You know, why can't you just say, this guy's a great comedian.

602
00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:18.410
I'll tie it bell I baguette, but this guy, oh yeah.

603
00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:22.850
Everybody in the Internet's got to do that. If you have a good band,

604
00:36:22.851 --> 00:36:26.060
someone's got his, just sit there and be like, dude, I love you guys,

605
00:36:26.061 --> 00:36:30.560
but it's fucking Doug, Stan hope man. These are fucking,

606
00:36:30.561 --> 00:36:32.930
I know he's a genius. You didn't have to take the piss out of me.

607
00:36:32.931 --> 00:36:36.620
A's fucking better than I am fucking cunt. Um,

608
00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:38.330
he said I wish more people knew about him.

609
00:36:38.331 --> 00:36:41.870
I felt the same way about you years ago when you were just a comedy baby.

610
00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:45.760
A tell you people at Netflix to give 'em the Chappelle treatment. Uh,

611
00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:50.110
love you man. Um, yeah, I've heard nothing but great shit about that.

612
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:53.470
I'm sorry. That's the last to the, the the Ricola

613
00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:59.620
eating on the Mike kind of a fucking amateur. Am I? Um, all right,

614
00:36:59.621 --> 00:37:00.520
well what you're telling me,

615
00:37:00.521 --> 00:37:04.360
every comedian has known about Doug stand help since probably the late nineties.

616
00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:07.870
And um, Doug is, um,

617
00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.560
ever watched those cop movies, you know,

618
00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:13.690
and you know that guy you always has to turn in his badge cause he's doing shit

619
00:37:13.691 --> 00:37:14.830
outside the system,

620
00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:18.400
but he's got a good heart and in the end he arrests the bad guy and it's all

621
00:37:18.401 --> 00:37:20.860
good. That's who Stan hope is. Right.

622
00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:23.980
But the entertainment industry hasn't figured that out yet.

623
00:37:23.981 --> 00:37:28.090
But eventually he will be standing on their fucking city hall steps as they give

624
00:37:28.091 --> 00:37:31.090
them the key to the city. That's what I'm hoping. But, um,

625
00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:37.410
my rule with all of these guys is I don't watch this standup special just cause

626
00:37:37.721 --> 00:37:41.770
I can't have an hour and an hour and a half of this shit floating around in my

627
00:37:41.771 --> 00:37:46.090
head cause it'll influence, you know, I'm of to paranoid about that.

628
00:37:46.091 --> 00:37:50.020
But my rule is that with all these guys, Rogan, Stan Hope,

629
00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:51.131
Louie Chappelle,

630
00:37:51.131 --> 00:37:55.060
all of these guys that if they come into a comedy club that I'm at,

631
00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:59.530
and a, they're going to go do a set. I will watch them. That's how I do it.

632
00:37:59.531 --> 00:38:04.531
But I don't watch their specials cause I'm too paranoid about any sort of

633
00:38:04.541 --> 00:38:08.410
overlap or whatever. But, um, having said that,

634
00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:13.630
every time Doug, Stan hope's specials come out, always,

635
00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:14.350
always,

636
00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:18.520
always for like three to six months afterwards comics that just taken me aside.

637
00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:22.630
Go do it. If you seen Stan hope's new fucking special. Um, yeah,

638
00:38:22.631 --> 00:38:27.550
he's fucking incredible. And, um, I don't know.

639
00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:30.160
Well, I dunno why. I Dunno. Why,

640
00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:35.170
what it is about comics like that, that they just a,

641
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:41.260
I don't know if the industry just won't give the same,

642
00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:44.230
don't you know what it is at the end of the day where if you ever have a

643
00:38:44.231 --> 00:38:45.760
question about an artist you like,

644
00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:50.740
just imagine Doug Stanhope on TV trying to sell your Ritz crackers. Okay.

645
00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:55.120
How long could he talk about those crackers before they would have a major

646
00:38:55.121 --> 00:38:57.820
fucking PR? And I think that's what it comes down to. All right.

647
00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:05.080
There's the people that are truly are the greats and then there's the people

648
00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:09.280
that are really good, but they won't fucking, you know,

649
00:39:09.490 --> 00:39:12.880
they can sell a box of Ritz crackers. That's what it kind of comes down to.

650
00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:17.290
And Doug, Stan hope is one of those fucking guys. What makes them great?

651
00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:20.710
So maybe that's what it is. I like that this guy's like that.

652
00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:23.830
You gotta have the fucking road guys. You know what I mean?

653
00:39:23.831 --> 00:39:28.150
You can't have everybody just fucking hanging out with the, I don't know,

654
00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:32.290
Eddie Showbiz, you know, at a fucking, you know, in an election party.

655
00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:36.820
You know what I mean? And talking about issues. Hi,

656
00:39:36.821 --> 00:39:41.800
I'm fucking Sandy San Sam cakes and I'm here to talk about the fucking, uh,

657
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:46.570
the slaughter of baby seals and all of that. You know, that main stream,

658
00:39:46.571 --> 00:39:49.540
like I'm step off your private jet,

659
00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:54.310
take the time to give a fuck for 20 minutes before you get back to yelling at

660
00:39:54.311 --> 00:39:57.670
your personal assistant. There's that level of uh,

661
00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:01.000
connecting with people and then there's what Stan hope does,

662
00:40:01.001 --> 00:40:05.050
where he fucking goes, where they're at. That guy is literally played,

663
00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:07.330
I would say, you know,

664
00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:11.380
let's say there's 10,000 comedy clubs in this country.

665
00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:15.280
He's played at least 9,998 of them.

666
00:40:15.281 --> 00:40:19.230
That fucking guy has played as much as I've done a bunch of play.

667
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:23.410
That guy has been fucking everywhere and that's why,

668
00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:28.120
that's why he's as good as he is, that his work ethic, he's fucking prolific.

669
00:40:28.121 --> 00:40:29.720
He's one of my favorites of all time.

670
00:40:29.721 --> 00:40:34.721
So I wish I knew what the name of the specialist maybe I can like go to look at.

671
00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:36.790
I'll look that up. You know what I gotta to hit pause.

672
00:40:36.791 --> 00:40:38.110
I get this fucking conference call.

673
00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:40.150
I'll be right back and I'll also have the name of the special.

674
00:40:40.151 --> 00:40:40.984
What do you think about that?

675
00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:44.230
And this will be like fucking like an eighth of a second year life.

676
00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:47.560
Just like those fucking millennials. What their virtual reality glasses,

677
00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:49.360
what's said over there and Whoa, it's guy.

678
00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:53.770
I fucking hate that commercial where the kids are sitting there freaking the

679
00:40:53.771 --> 00:40:57.130
fuck out. Like they don't realize that it's not a real world.

680
00:40:57.370 --> 00:41:00.940
And then the greedy corporate cons. Then what do they got to do?

681
00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:04.300
They got to have the old curmudgeon guy like me actually older than me.

682
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:05.860
And then what are you kids do?

683
00:41:05.861 --> 00:41:10.540
And then he puts it on and then of course he's completely enamored, right?

684
00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:14.020
And now he's going to be into this shit. Get the fuck Outta here.

685
00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:16.690
Fuck those glasses. I swear to God man,

686
00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:20.590
like the amount of people that are going to get mugged while they have those

687
00:41:20.591 --> 00:41:22.940
fucking things on in public. Cause I'll tell her right now,

688
00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:24.760
these fucking kids are so goddamn stupid.

689
00:41:24.761 --> 00:41:28.390
They're wearing one of those in like on a city bus and just fucking have it on

690
00:41:28.391 --> 00:41:29.620
there. You know what I mean?

691
00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:34.010
That's like walking into white Cornell's little fucking baskets

692
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.401
<v 4>with what?</v>

693
00:41:34.401 --> 00:41:38.330
Cobra in there and you stick your head in with your virtual reality glass

694
00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:42.950
glasses and you can't see the snake anymore cause you're in fucking a middle

695
00:41:42.951 --> 00:41:46.550
earth. Ah, the old man's coming out of me this week. All right.

696
00:41:46.551 --> 00:41:47.384
Hang on a second.

697
00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:48.793
<v 0>Okay.</v>

698
00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:54.660
<v 4>All right. Now back, just like dad, an hour of fucking conference calling. Huh?</v>

699
00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:58.310
Don't you wish you were me? Is there anything better than a conference call?

700
00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:01.220
Hey, let's get on and make a call and have a conference.

701
00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:02.823
<v 0>Okay,</v>

702
00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:06.120
<v 4>everybody can talk and share ideas.</v>

703
00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:10.110
Have another hour of your life go by that you're never gonna get back.

704
00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.330
All right? You know, this is how old I am.

705
00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:15.510
You know what's on my Christmas list this year? You know,

706
00:42:15.511 --> 00:42:20.511
this pajamas I've had the same pair of fucking pajamas for like I don't,

707
00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:24.390
I don't even know how long. Like, I don't know, maybe, uh,

708
00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:27.780
early two thousands, you know,

709
00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:32.520
I'm trying to think all this shit that I've watched on TV and these jam jams and

710
00:42:32.521 --> 00:42:36.270
they've just had it, it's fucking over and I've actually dropped.

711
00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:40.650
Not even the hint, I just demanded. And you get to when you get to be my age,

712
00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:42.270
cause no one gives a shit about you anymore.

713
00:42:42.271 --> 00:42:45.930
You can't ask for something for Christmas. You gotta start,

714
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:50.610
you gotta make demands with like a touch of a threat, Kate, I'm just saying,

715
00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:53.470
<v 1>okay, just throw, put this out there,</v>

716
00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:56.230
but we be in everybody's best interest.

717
00:42:56.650 --> 00:43:00.820
If I've got some new pajamas this Christmas, that's all I'm saying. Okay. Huh?

718
00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:05.040
You like where you live in? You like this phone.

719
00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:07.073
<v 0>Okay.</v>

720
00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:10.510
<v 4>There better be some jam jams under the fucking tree. Um,</v>

721
00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:14.860
anyways, and then no matter what, then he ended up being wrong.

722
00:43:14.861 --> 00:43:18.070
Like I had a fucking argument with my wife this week about the way she fucking,

723
00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:21.400
you know, stacks up the dishes in the sink. You know what I mean?

724
00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:22.810
I Dunno if your wife does this shit,

725
00:43:22.811 --> 00:43:27.811
but there'll be like a pot sitting in the fucking sink and then they have a

726
00:43:28.211 --> 00:43:31.060
plate, right? What do they do?

727
00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:35.200
They stick the plate on top of the thing and then they take another bowl and

728
00:43:35.201 --> 00:43:38.830
they stick it on top of the plate and then you just got this leaning Tower of

729
00:43:38.831 --> 00:43:41.080
Horse Shit and you fucking sink. It's like,

730
00:43:41.081 --> 00:43:45.040
why don't you put the plate underneath the pot and then just see if the pot can

731
00:43:45.041 --> 00:43:45.750
fit in the bowl.

732
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:48.690
The ball could fit in the fucking pot and then it takes like a third of this

733
00:43:48.691 --> 00:43:51.540
space. Yeah, no,

734
00:43:51.541 --> 00:43:56.290
you have to take a door to that fucking gay gay, you know,

735
00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:57.880
make rather rather than make,

736
00:43:57.881 --> 00:44:01.140
it looks like this 10 weeks of fucking dishes here. This is like two meals,

737
00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:03.750
you know, one of those fucking,

738
00:44:03.751 --> 00:44:07.170
one of those fucking dumb arguments where you end up getting in your car and

739
00:44:07.171 --> 00:44:10.950
driving away. And then afterwards you just sitting there going, what the fuck?

740
00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:12.930
I'm literally driving down the street right now,

741
00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:18.330
contemplating giving this woman everything that I own and moving into a one

742
00:44:18.331 --> 00:44:21.450
bedroom apartment over the way. She stacks dishes in the sink.

743
00:44:21.451 --> 00:44:25.290
But I'll tell you when you live with somebody, it seems so fucking important.

744
00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:30.330
All right, time off. Dear Billy body. [inaudible] I think you're awesome.

745
00:44:30.331 --> 00:44:32.790
Thank you. And I have a crush on you and I'm,

746
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:34.800
<v 6>hey,</v>

747
00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:39.880
<v 4>there you go. I thought the left term was going to be, and I'm a dude. Um,</v>

748
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:43.090
I love the, you take care of yourself and are always striving to be better.

749
00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:44.530
This is great. I've, you know what,

750
00:44:44.531 --> 00:44:46.210
if I were you guys listening to this right now,

751
00:44:46.211 --> 00:44:49.840
I would be highly suspect of whether or not I actually wrote this in. Um,

752
00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:54.130
my husband and I haven't seen you live yet and we want,

753
00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:58.960
we want to this year, if you happen to be coming back to Wisconsin, well,

754
00:44:58.961 --> 00:45:02.020
where the hell were you a few months ago? You know,

755
00:45:02.021 --> 00:45:06.580
when did you develop this crush in October? I was there in September. Uh,

756
00:45:06.581 --> 00:45:10.780
do you think you'll be touring as much or will you be taking the year off to

757
00:45:10.781 --> 00:45:15.700
spend time with your newborn? Love you and I love Nia. Um,

758
00:45:16.330 --> 00:45:19.480
oh, I'm totally going to be the absentee father. I already have that worked out,

759
00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:21.780
you know, going to be doing like 56

760
00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:26.640
<v 1>weeks on the road. Now obviously my schedule will be a little bit different. Um,</v>

761
00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:33.030
be honest with you. I'd, I don't know. Um, I do know, however, that,

762
00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:35.430
um, you know,

763
00:45:35.431 --> 00:45:39.270
when I was getting ready to do my special rather than doing one night in every

764
00:45:39.271 --> 00:45:41.790
city, you know, when I did that little,

765
00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:45.240
I played a smaller theater and I spent a week in Durham,

766
00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:47.230
like just Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and I,

767
00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:53.040
it's so much more enjoyable way of doing the road rather than doing one night in

768
00:45:53.311 --> 00:45:56.460
Durham one night and fucking Poughkeepsie one night here.

769
00:45:56.880 --> 00:46:00.690
It just becomes a fucking thrash. And when you're an older fellow like myself,

770
00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:05.700
you know, I like going to a place, hanging out with the people,

771
00:46:05.701 --> 00:46:09.060
seeing where they eat, go into a game. That's how I always fucking did it.

772
00:46:09.061 --> 00:46:10.590
So I'm gonna try to do more of that.

773
00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:15.630
And I was just in Madison and funny you should bring up going back to Milwaukee.

774
00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:20.610
Uh, uh, Wisconsin was, I haven't been to Milwaukee and um,

775
00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:25.050
well I guess it was October of, it's amazing. I can always remember this.

776
00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:29.790
It was like October of 2015 so it's been, uh,

777
00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:34.350
we'll call it December at this point. So it's been 14 months. So,

778
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:35.010
um,

779
00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:40.010
definitely in 2017 not only will I be coming back to Milwaukee,

780
00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:44.590
uh, I plan on spending like, uh,

781
00:46:44.730 --> 00:46:49.730
three or four days there because that Milwaukee had not only a great cigar bar,

782
00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:54.480
it had the best fucking steam of any place I've ever been to.

783
00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:57.480
And it was at a hotel called the Pfister,

784
00:46:57.570 --> 00:47:02.310
I swear to God at the hotel is called the Pfister. It's P, f.

785
00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:06.690
I. S. T. E. R. If you add Milwaukee, dude, I'm telling you man, Milwaukee,

786
00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:10.230
don't sleep on Milwaukee. Great people, great food,

787
00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:14.340
great fucking Lakefront property for a song. Right?

788
00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:17.700
And the sickest fucking steam room you're ever going to go into.

789
00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:22.530
You get your own private like lifestyles of the rich and famous fucking, it's,

790
00:47:22.531 --> 00:47:24.370
it's unbelievable. So, um,

791
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:27.990
<v 4>no, when you get to be my fucking age,</v>

792
00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:30.610
that's the type of shit that's appealing to you on the road.

793
00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:35.140
You know what I mean? It's not like God, dude, you gotta go to Miami,

794
00:47:35.141 --> 00:47:38.920
they got all these hot chicks down there. I'm a fucking creepy old married guy.

795
00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:40.750
Where is there a steam room?

796
00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:46.540
Listen to me. I got to Berkeley locis

797
00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:52.380
I ain't got time for the WHO was, um, anyways, uh,

798
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:54.250
so yeah,

799
00:47:54.251 --> 00:47:58.300
tonight I'm actually doing the Steve Allen Theater and whatever the fuck they're

800
00:47:58.301 --> 00:48:01.360
calling it now, and I'm just basically running my whole new hour.

801
00:48:01.361 --> 00:48:02.680
I'm so fucking excited.

802
00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:07.480
I've gotten past the whole morning period of missing my old jokes.

803
00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:11.770
I'm past the whole now. Not as funny as I was on stage and you know,

804
00:48:11.771 --> 00:48:15.910
I took all the bullets out of the gun. I'm shooting fucking plagues up here. Um,

805
00:48:15.911 --> 00:48:18.160
this is my favorite fucking thing in the world.

806
00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:21.120
I'm so excited tonight about the show. Um,

807
00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:23.500
and just seeing where it goes.

808
00:48:23.501 --> 00:48:26.410
And I got a couple of buddies of mine coming down who were musicians,

809
00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:29.740
so they're going to get to see that whole fuck cause I already told him,

810
00:48:29.741 --> 00:48:31.590
I was like, all right, you guys want to come down. This is gonna,

811
00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:35.570
this is gonna be the real deal. This is not the a old tried and true there.

812
00:48:36.110 --> 00:48:39.570
All right. Coping with being single. Oh.

813
00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:45.280
Oh I already like this right here. Hey Billy, master of fuck. It's um,

814
00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:48.220
I've been single my entire life.

815
00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:52.810
I'm into my later twenties and still haven't found any lady that I really hit it

816
00:48:52.811 --> 00:48:55.930
off with. I've struggled with being single for a long time,

817
00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:58.450
but I've been working through it. I'm okay with it,

818
00:48:58.451 --> 00:49:01.870
but I still have my dark moments. My question to you is,

819
00:49:01.871 --> 00:49:06.730
when you were single for all those years, did you ever get lonely or feel alone?

820
00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:10.030
Uh, did you ever think you'd be single forever?

821
00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:13.720
What helped you to endure through those times and how did you cope with it?

822
00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:18.760
Yes to all of that. Yup. As I figured some things out.

823
00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:22.870
I've been doing bucket list types of stuff that helps me get through it. Yeah,

824
00:49:22.871 --> 00:49:24.730
I do. That's a great thing to do when you're single.

825
00:49:24.731 --> 00:49:29.050
Go do all that shit you want to do cause a, you know, you meet somebody else.

826
00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:32.560
Yeah. You know, you might not have the time.

827
00:49:33.650 --> 00:49:36.970
This person says, I've gone to see some of my favorite bands play live.

828
00:49:36.971 --> 00:49:40.480
I've traveled a little and I've been working towards finding a career path that

829
00:49:40.481 --> 00:49:44.200
I really enjoy. So I believe I'm doing some good things,

830
00:49:44.201 --> 00:49:47.980
but I still have my days when I suffer through it. A little a,

831
00:49:47.981 --> 00:49:51.670
but I've learned to sit in that pain for a bit and find good things.

832
00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:56.440
Uh, saying something dumb at work. Oh that's the next one.

833
00:49:56.441 --> 00:49:59.110
I thought that was the guy signing off or the woman,

834
00:49:59.111 --> 00:50:02.260
whoever the fuck does says I'm all right. My question to you is,

835
00:50:02.261 --> 00:50:05.850
you've been single all those years. Did you ever get lonely or feel alone?

836
00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:09.280
Here's the thing, I was never lonely for the first,

837
00:50:09.281 --> 00:50:12.220
I don't know how many years of my life until I had a girlfriend.

838
00:50:12.221 --> 00:50:14.590
And then lost my girlfriend. And then after that,

839
00:50:14.890 --> 00:50:18.310
that's the first time I felt like, oh, I don't have a chick. It's weird.

840
00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:23.450
I didn't have my first serious girlfriend till I was like 23,

841
00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:28.070
something like that, 22, 23 years old. So I was fine

842
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:31.580
<v 1>with being single. And that thing lasted like, I dunno, like eight, nine months.</v>

843
00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:32.713
And uh,

844
00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:37.470
I ended up breaking up with her and that was right before I started doing stand

845
00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:40.040
up. And, um,

846
00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:44.300
I remember the first six weeks of being like, fuck,

847
00:50:44.301 --> 00:50:48.200
how long is it going to take for me to get over this person? And, um,

848
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:51.950
it's weird, man, like getting over a person, it's like,

849
00:50:51.951 --> 00:50:55.370
it's like quitting the booze. It's a habit. They're a habit,

850
00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:58.310
you know what I mean? I always call him at this time,

851
00:50:58.311 --> 00:51:03.050
then he got to fill up those fucking times, but you just can't fill them up.

852
00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:08.560
You kinda gotta go through the morning of them not being there anymore and then

853
00:51:08.661 --> 00:51:11.600
you start filling them up with other stuff. But like, dude, I think travel,

854
00:51:11.601 --> 00:51:14.090
seeing bands and everything. The great thing is too,

855
00:51:15.350 --> 00:51:16.790
the fact that you're our lady,

856
00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:21.350
the fact that you're single and you feel alone is a very healthy thing.

857
00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:23.241
You know what I mean? Now,

858
00:51:23.241 --> 00:51:28.241
if you are totally fucking single and you didn't feel lonely at all,

859
00:51:29.490 --> 00:51:30.261
I guess maybe you know,

860
00:51:30.261 --> 00:51:32.750
maybe you're just a fucking someone who doesn't want to be with anybody.

861
00:51:32.751 --> 00:51:34.760
That could also be cause as long as you're not out killing people,

862
00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:38.060
you know what I mean? As long as you don't feel the need to hunt,

863
00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:39.740
as long as you're not feeling that,

864
00:51:39.741 --> 00:51:42.230
and as long as you are right with whatever it is you're doing,

865
00:51:42.231 --> 00:51:44.810
then you should be fine too. During your fucking late twenties through,

866
00:51:44.811 --> 00:51:46.910
trust me, someday you're going to be married,

867
00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:50.210
you're going to have a fucking kid coming like I got right now,

868
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:53.090
and you're all of a sudden, all your drum videos you're thinking,

869
00:51:53.091 --> 00:51:55.550
I'm going to get, I gotta get rid of those. I got to get rid of all this shit.

870
00:51:55.551 --> 00:51:56.990
I got to get rid of all of this stuff.

871
00:51:57.410 --> 00:51:59.630
And there's this feeling that I'm having right now.

872
00:51:59.690 --> 00:52:01.400
Will I ever play drums again?

873
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:06.200
But fortunately I married the coolest woman ever so I just was able to sit down

874
00:52:06.201 --> 00:52:06.891
with her. This,

875
00:52:06.891 --> 00:52:09.800
this might help you if you're afraid to get in a relationship because you feel

876
00:52:09.801 --> 00:52:11.150
like you're going to lose all of this stuff.

877
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:15.080
You just let the person you're with know what's important.

878
00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:17.810
And I already said that. My wife, I said, listen,

879
00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:23.090
here's the deal like once a week, okay, you pick a day,

880
00:52:23.091 --> 00:52:27.470
once a week when this kid is not sleeping through the night and you can just go

881
00:52:27.471 --> 00:52:27.970
somewhere,

882
00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:32.150
get a massage or just go someplace and fucking sleep or I'll take the kid and go

883
00:52:32.151 --> 00:52:34.370
drive around. I'll let you sleep for fucking hours and hours,

884
00:52:34.371 --> 00:52:38.540
whatever the hell it is. Okay. All you gotta do is let me keep playing drums,

885
00:52:39.530 --> 00:52:40.610
taking drum lessons and that shit.

886
00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:44.060
That'll be my spot thing cause I don't really need to sleep cause I'm a fucking

887
00:52:44.090 --> 00:52:44.923
lunatic.

888
00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:50.380
And also I'll still get to do the road twice a month and you know,

889
00:52:51.291 --> 00:52:52.640
I'll use that time to sleep.

890
00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:56.450
I'll do my shows at night and then I'll go right to the hotel and I will sleep

891
00:52:56.570 --> 00:52:59.600
till the fucking cats come home. The cows come, whatever the fucking animal is,

892
00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:03.490
and then I'll come back recharged. You know what I mean? But we,

893
00:53:03.550 --> 00:53:06.910
we make sure that we kind of worked that stuff out with each other. So, um,

894
00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:09.230
if you're afraid to get in a relationship,

895
00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:12.560
just know that there's a cool people out there as long as you, uh,

896
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.440
I don't know. Yeah. You never heard me say this,

897
00:53:15.441 --> 00:53:19.100
but women in general pretty cool if you just tell them what the fucking deal is.

898
00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:24.470
Um, but I have issues with women. So even as I said that,

899
00:53:24.471 --> 00:53:26.100
just picturing how many women just

900
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:28.170
<v 4>went like, oh my God, yes. That like,</v>

901
00:53:28.171 --> 00:53:31.200
that annoyed me even though they were agreeing with me. It's weird.

902
00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:34.260
I got a lot of fucking issues. So, um, yeah, I definitely felt,

903
00:53:34.261 --> 00:53:35.910
I felt like I was never going to meet the one.

904
00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:39.690
I felt like there was something wrong with me and all of this type of shit.

905
00:53:39.691 --> 00:53:40.524
Just know this.

906
00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:45.650
Every one of your friends that's in a relationship is secretly envious of you,

907
00:53:46.591 --> 00:53:49.560
even if they're with the right person. That's how much fucking work it is,

908
00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:54.930
you know, every once in a while, you know, I look at fucking, um, you know,

909
00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:59.040
I'll look at up, I'll look at a playboy like Joe de Rosa and I'll be like,

910
00:53:59.041 --> 00:54:02.760
God damn it man. What the fuck did he's got? He's, you know,

911
00:54:02.761 --> 00:54:07.020
he's key skis living the life, you know, but then, you know,

912
00:54:07.021 --> 00:54:09.440
you come home and your wife make some fucking cookies. You like,

913
00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:13.080
this is pretty cool too. Alright. Saying something dumb at work.

914
00:54:13.081 --> 00:54:15.570
So I'll say to this person, you, you, you find, dude,

915
00:54:15.571 --> 00:54:17.220
you're in your late twenties. Um,

916
00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:21.630
the same way that you have goals with, um,

917
00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:24.660
your career in bucket list stuff should have,

918
00:54:24.661 --> 00:54:28.410
she should have some goals about the kind of person that you want to be with

919
00:54:28.411 --> 00:54:31.200
like a women after I actually do shit like that.

920
00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:34.350
Women actually sit down and think about the kind of, guys don't do that.

921
00:54:34.890 --> 00:54:38.010
We just sort of ping pong the wrong. I'll stick my fucking tick in that.

922
00:54:38.011 --> 00:54:40.890
You know, we idiots. Um, but if you actually, you know,

923
00:54:41.250 --> 00:54:44.280
get a little bill Belichick, you know, see what's missing, you know,

924
00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:48.300
from your half, see what you're looking for. What do you want,

925
00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:52.110
you know, do you want a woman that wants kids?

926
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:54.750
Do you want a woman that can cook and your traditional,

927
00:54:54.751 --> 00:54:57.030
do you want a career woman? Like what do you want? You know,

928
00:54:57.031 --> 00:54:59.040
I can tell you right now, if you want a woman that can cook,

929
00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:00.600
we'll actually sit down and cook.

930
00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:06.240
I'll tell you right now that's like a, I dunno,

931
00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:08.690
you know, like every, once every, I don't know how many years they have,

932
00:55:08.691 --> 00:55:10.530
they have that and that 1983 draft,

933
00:55:10.531 --> 00:55:14.430
like women do not foe women's do not be cooking anymore.

934
00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:19.020
All this feminism shit, it's really a sad thing. But men of, you know,

935
00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:23.940
it's our fault because we didn't put a value on it. Great.

936
00:55:23.941 --> 00:55:27.610
I'm out there busting my ass. You Ain't here pickling cucumbers, right?

937
00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:30.370
I just gave him shit. Making a meal for somebody.

938
00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:35.150
One of the nicest things you could ever do. You know? But what happened?

939
00:55:35.151 --> 00:55:38.150
How we talk. Shit we gave, we didn't give him a fucking respect him now looking,

940
00:55:38.190 --> 00:55:38.931
they don't want to cook up.

941
00:55:38.931 --> 00:55:42.930
The mothers are out there running around Willy Nilly wearing pantsuits running

942
00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:47.890
and running for president of the United States. I mean, that's a mad job.

943
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:51.490
No kidding.

944
00:55:51.490 --> 00:55:54.490
You're the funniest fucking thing ever is how sick you have to be to want to be

945
00:55:54.491 --> 00:55:57.100
president. The fact that Hillary Clinton is depressed right now,

946
00:55:57.340 --> 00:55:59.710
that she didn't get a job. Well,

947
00:55:59.711 --> 00:56:03.010
she was going to have to put her head on the pillow every night knowing she just

948
00:56:03.011 --> 00:56:07.000
made a decision that bombs were just dropped and possibly landed on somebody's

949
00:56:07.001 --> 00:56:09.730
baby and she, she's,

950
00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:12.970
she's depressed that she didn't get that fucking job. It's unbelievable.

951
00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:14.740
What do you think her pajamas look like?

952
00:56:16.090 --> 00:56:19.480
She definitely has the fucking guy once, right? Like the flannel

953
00:56:21.970 --> 00:56:25.780
wearing the pants. Um, I liked the pantsuits.

954
00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:29.290
I don't know why everybody gave a shit about it. I always like Rhoda, you know,

955
00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:33.580
Rhoda, Mary Tyler Moore, they fucking filled those things out. You know,

956
00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:37.840
walking around with your little bungees up against that Rey on. All right.

957
00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:42.010
Say something dumb at work saying something dumb at work. Okay.

958
00:56:42.011 --> 00:56:45.820
What do we got here? Um, yeah. Fuck you guys. Mind if I just do the last bit of,

959
00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:47.200
you know what? That's a country move.

960
00:56:47.201 --> 00:56:51.190
I'll read this and then I'll do the advertising. Hey Bill. Longtime Fan.

961
00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:55.090
Probably listened to you too much. T once again, you start with the compliment,

962
00:56:55.091 --> 00:56:58.420
then you give me the old fucking Shank to the kidney. Longtime Fan.

963
00:56:58.421 --> 00:57:03.160
Probably listened to you too much. All right. Too. Too much. When it's too much.

964
00:57:03.161 --> 00:57:07.810
That's, that's two o's. All right. All right. Here's my problem.

965
00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:12.340
I was at, I was at Work Party, I think you mean at a work party?

966
00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:17.320
Talking to my colleagues. I work as an RN in an ICU.

967
00:57:17.350 --> 00:57:20.760
Okay. That's a registered nurse in an intensive care unit. Huh?

968
00:57:20.890 --> 00:57:24.940
I have some nurses in my family. Uh, we have a new

969
00:57:26.850 --> 00:57:28.830
to our unit hired joining us,

970
00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:31.950
but she's worked as a nurse for 25 years already.

971
00:57:32.310 --> 00:57:34.650
My friends said she's joining my rotation.

972
00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:37.680
I say out loud in my typical bill,

973
00:57:38.010 --> 00:57:42.110
blurt burn a inflection Ogh is now how cheese.

974
00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:44.340
Another old broadened our line there.

975
00:57:44.730 --> 00:57:49.730
Several colleagues heard this and now every day is some new twist on my comment.

976
00:57:50.250 --> 00:57:53.640
Some chirping is fine, but half the unit is over 50.

977
00:57:53.940 --> 00:57:55.680
I want some joke comment.

978
00:57:56.460 --> 00:57:59.940
I don't want some joke comment to help me haunt me for years. Bill,

979
00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:04.040
how do I get this to go away? Thanks. Um,

980
00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:06.473
<v 0>okay.</v>

981
00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:13.500
<v 4>I, I would just say with them, I, I just, I wouldn't back off.</v>

982
00:58:13.590 --> 00:58:16.350
I would just keep doing the Archie bunker and she's another role.

983
00:58:16.351 --> 00:58:20.340
Broaden a line there and then when they, they, yeah, this lady to world,

984
00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:22.380
you know, good. All of you with your menopause,

985
00:58:22.890 --> 00:58:24.390
but you can't do that at work now.

986
00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:27.840
You can't do that work now because you're not making it a safe place.

987
00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:30.660
This is a safe space.

988
00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:32.913
<v 0>Ugh.</v>

989
00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:37.690
<v 4>Oh my God. That alone, that alone gave Trump about 200,000 votes.</v>

990
00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:47.320
Fucking adults saying, you're not making this a safe space.

991
00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:50.920
It just fucking did.

992
00:58:50.921 --> 00:58:54.070
They all have a meeting and they came up with that fucking horrific. That what,

993
00:58:54.110 --> 00:58:57.880
what was the second choice? I just don't understand that.

994
00:58:59.710 --> 00:59:01.760
I, I, you know something, I have to be honest with you.

995
00:59:01.761 --> 00:59:03.860
I don't know how you get out of that and right there,

996
00:59:03.861 --> 00:59:07.250
that's why I do what I do for a fucking living because there's no way I could be

997
00:59:07.251 --> 00:59:10.700
in that level of a childish fucking environment that people,

998
00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:12.490
what did you mean about that? What do, what am I,

999
00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:15.890
how many fucking thoughts have you had in your head today? Your old fucking bag.

1000
00:59:16.370 --> 00:59:19.520
That if they were publicized that you'd even still have a job as a nurse.

1001
00:59:19.521 --> 00:59:24.260
Get the fuck Outta here. Yeah. You don't, you know what? Just just, you know,

1002
00:59:24.290 --> 00:59:27.770
women like suites just come and just bake a fucking pie or some shit.

1003
00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:29.773
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1004
00:59:29.950 --> 00:59:33.430
<v 4>Ugh. Anyways, I'm sorry. Going through that. I'm sorry you were quoting me,</v>

1005
00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:36.340
but you know what? You also kind of blamed me a little bit there. We say,

1006
00:59:36.570 --> 00:59:38.860
listen to me too much. You were thrown a little bit of blame.

1007
00:59:39.090 --> 00:59:40.360
You went a little Peyton manning there.

1008
00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:43.850
We had protection issues as what you just did to me there. Um,

1009
00:59:46.530 --> 00:59:47.363
<v 0>okay.</v>

1010
00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:49.520
<v 4>I don't know how much is, but you're still bringing that, yeah.</v>

1011
00:59:49.521 --> 00:59:50.490
You still bring that up?

1012
00:59:50.491 --> 00:59:52.680
You should've heard what I said this morning or something like that.

1013
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:56.910
I would just do that. Um, that is kind of funny.

1014
00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:01.120
Who gives a shit? Do you like the job?

1015
01:00:01.210 --> 01:00:05.390
That all depends on how much you like the job because or watch he's old.

1016
01:00:05.391 --> 01:00:09.730
You're all old. I wouldn't fuck any of you, you know, I dunno. I Dunno.

1017
01:00:09.810 --> 01:00:12.110
I don't know how to get out of that. Um,

1018
01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:15.340
anybody has any suggestions tweeted at me and I'll fucking retweet it.

1019
01:00:15.370 --> 01:00:18.730
Maybe this person follows me on Twitter and can help them out. Uh,

1020
01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:21.890
would it help if I know if you are a man or a woman? I have no idea. All right.

1021
01:00:21.891 --> 01:00:26.450
Dollar Shave Club. I'm guessing a man. If you're a woman,

1022
01:00:26.451 --> 01:00:30.020
you're the coolest woman ever that you said that. No. The all broad here.

But razors aren't the only thing you need in the bathroom.

1026
01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:43.070
What about some shower stuff? Huh?

1027
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:46.020
What about when you wash it off the old tape?

1028
01:00:46.021 --> 01:00:48.770
It turns out dollar Shave Club thought of that too.

1029

stamps.com everybody, oh Jesus,

1078
01:03:44.830 --> 01:03:48.960
Saint Nick is coming here for all the good Christians out there. He's a saint,

1079
01:03:48.961 --> 01:03:50.700
but he doesn't care about Muslims.

1080
01:03:50.701 --> 01:03:54.990
Jews are fucking a Buddhist people, right?

1081
01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:59.400
What about all those a aboriginals? Whatever the fuck they worship, Huh?

1082
01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:02.820
How come Santa Claus doesn't go to them? You know why? Cause they'd be like,

1083
01:04:02.821 --> 01:04:04.200
oh my God, it's another white man.

1084
01:04:04.201 --> 01:04:08.220
And they fucking put a poison dart enough and it served them right. You know,

1085
01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.490
it served them right. Even though he didn't do anything. He'd be a martyr,

1086
01:04:12.330 --> 01:04:15.420
you know, big stupid red suit laying face down in it, right?

1087

stamps.com with the holidays almost.

1088
01:04:18.601 --> 01:04:21.690
I'm surprised that government has never tried to set up Santa Claus by sending

1089
01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:24.390
them into some area where there's indigenous people.

1090
01:04:24.690 --> 01:04:27.900
Just set them up for a fight the way we did when we took over this fucking

1091
01:04:27.901 --> 01:04:28.621
country. You know,

1092
01:04:28.621 --> 01:04:32.070
so we could justify the genocide of those wonderful people that when they killed

1093
01:04:32.071 --> 01:04:34.970
a squirrel, they used all of it unlike us. What do we do? Huh?

1094
01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:37.470
Through the inside of the fucking womp rat.

1095
01:04:37.471 --> 01:04:40.950
And then use the rest of the hat for what is a goof?

1124
01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:14.890
Oh, key dokey. Fun Times in Syria.

1125
01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:20.080
Billie the cunt. It's Martin from Sweden. Thank you for this podcast.

1126
01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:24.580
No worries. It's been more than 10 years since I was almost raped in Syria.

1127
01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:29.110
What the fuck? Although time passes,

1128
01:06:29.111 --> 01:06:31.150
the story seems to never get old.

1129
01:06:32.730 --> 01:06:33.563
<v 0>All right.</v>

1130
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:35.050
<v 4>You know, I, I,</v>

1131
01:06:35.230 --> 01:06:37.750
you really just going to fuck with me on this God damn level here.

1132
01:06:37.870 --> 01:06:42.270
Am I supposed to believe this is true? How time flies? It's like you're,

1133
01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:44.510
you're looking back fondly on this. This is weird.

1134
01:06:44.930 --> 01:06:49.070
I was 17 when me and my class went on a school trip to Syria,

1135
01:06:49.550 --> 01:06:53.620
puts in parentheses, Middle East. Go Fuck yourself, Jason.

1136
01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:57.270
I know I'm American. I know we're serious. All right.

1137
01:06:57.271 --> 01:06:59.790
One day all of my classmates were out snorkeling.

1138
01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:03.990
I stayed in the hostel bed because I had a fever.

1139
01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:09.380
Two aspirins later I found myself out looking for my class in sauna,

1140
01:07:09.421 --> 01:07:13.350
like temperatures with a foolish mindset. My blonde,

1141
01:07:13.351 --> 01:07:17.730
blue eyed nature fit, figured the aspirin had cured my fever,

1142
01:07:18.030 --> 01:07:23.030
so I was in quite good spirits for about seven miles of searching for the other

1143
01:07:23.251 --> 01:07:25.890
Swedes. This is creeping me out.

1144
01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:28.830
Now the fever was kicking back and in at this point,

1145
01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:30.953
<v 0>uh,</v>

1146
01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:33.250
<v 4>and I'd given up my endeavors of snorkeling.</v>

1147
01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:36.940
I didn't know where I was or how to get back to my hostel. At that moment,

1148
01:07:36.941 --> 01:07:40.300
a taxi pulled over. The driver asked if I wanted to get a Lyft.

1149
01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:43.030
I said I didn't have any money to offer,

1150
01:07:43.031 --> 01:07:47.710
but he insisted that no money was needed for the ride. Oh, Jesus is right. Yes.

1151
01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:53.130
High fever and good amounts of gullibility led me to step into the cab and off

1152
01:07:53.261 --> 01:07:58.030
we went, hi, welcome to Syria. The taxi guy said, you are very beautiful.

1153
01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:00.820
I didn't want to be rude. So I said, thanks back at him.

1154
01:08:01.030 --> 01:08:03.460
Then he asked me if I liked women. Sure. I replied.

1155
01:08:03.461 --> 01:08:08.260
Then he asked if I liked big women share. I said, and he said, ah,

1156
01:08:08.261 --> 01:08:12.670
you like big because same with your Dick.

1157
01:08:14.250 --> 01:08:15.083
<v 0>He said,</v>

1158
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:20.170
<v 4>what? At this point I regretted getting to the what the fuck? Ah,</v>

1159
01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:24.800
you like big because same with your Dick. He said, okay.

1160
01:08:24.801 --> 01:08:28.880
I thought this was a woman. So it's a guy and now there's dude. Oh Jesus.

1161
01:08:28.881 --> 01:08:30.290
Here we go. At this point,

1162
01:08:30.291 --> 01:08:35.030
I regret getting to the taxi very much in the moment after he was reaching for

1163
01:08:35.031 --> 01:08:37.910
my package while he was driving.

1164
01:08:39.530 --> 01:08:42.350
Oh two that's it. Oh, you in the front seat.

1165
01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:44.750
That's when you got to do,

1166
01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:49.070
what was that fucking Schwartzenegger movie where he gets on the plane with that

1167
01:08:49.071 --> 01:08:53.600
guy and he pretends to tie your shoe and he comes up with the elbow death and

1168
01:08:53.601 --> 01:08:57.530
drives this spine of his nose into his brain and then puts his little fucking a

1169
01:08:57.950 --> 01:09:02.780
Tommy Bahama ad over his face and he goes, don't disturb him. He's dead tired.

1170
01:09:03.170 --> 01:09:05.270
That's what you needed to do was that rod deal.

1171
01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:08.630
I think he needed to go rod deal there anyways.

1172
01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:13.970
I say no stop. I said, but the tracks, he driver was very persistent.

1173
01:09:14.150 --> 01:09:17.420
He wondered why he couldn't touch my penis. Like I owed him the right to do.

1174
01:09:17.421 --> 01:09:20.300
So I was feeling extremely vulnerable,

1175
01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:23.630
being a teenager foreigner and having a high fever at all.

1176
01:09:23.690 --> 01:09:26.870
I shouted at him to stop the car, but he kept on going, dude,

1177
01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:30.350
you've got to start going Dave. The Hammer Schultz here. Right?

1178
01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:35.780
You gotta fucking, he gotta start swinging, man. Uh, but he kept on going.

1179
01:09:35.781 --> 01:09:40.040
I thought about jumping out of the car, but I was, it was going way too fast.

1180
01:09:40.041 --> 01:09:44.600
I also didn't want to start a fight and risk crashing the car. Ah,

1181
01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:48.470
Jesus. At some point, dude, you've got to pick your poison. Did it have airbags?

1182
01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:53.210
Picture pictures of Taliban rape cades with pulp fiction.

1183
01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:58.250
Kim's suits and gag balls was entering my mind as the taxi car continued to

1184
01:09:58.251 --> 01:10:02.960
drive on without any intent to pull over. This is really happening.

1185
01:10:02.961 --> 01:10:04.730
Oh my Lord. I thought to myself,

1186
01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:08.660
luckily we came to a traffic light and I managed to get out of the car and on

1187
01:10:08.661 --> 01:10:13.661
the pavement I started running when I heard him screaming at me.

1188
01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:18.980
One Syrian pound, Mr Oh God,

1189
01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:20.090
now you're going to get paid for getting,

1190
01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:21.680
you got to pay him for moving less than you.

1191
01:10:22.190 --> 01:10:26.090
I got over the experience pretty soon and it would have not affected my life to

1192
01:10:26.091 --> 01:10:29.060
any extent. No fucking way.

1193
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:34.270
People sometimes want me to tell the almost raped story and given pressures of

1194
01:10:34.431 --> 01:10:35.390
the taxi driver.

1195
01:10:35.690 --> 01:10:39.680
I can't help to think how unfunny it would be if I were a girl almost getting

1196
01:10:39.681 --> 01:10:42.590
raped in Syria. Yeah, but you're a guy, so it's fucking hell.

1197
01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:45.140
Everything that happens to a guy's hilarious. Nobody gives a shit.

1198
01:10:45.410 --> 01:10:49.080
My question to you is, why is this kind of a f,

1199
01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:52.700
why is this story kind of funny if it happened to men but awful in every way if

1200
01:10:52.701 --> 01:10:56.990
it happened to a woman. Your thoughts on that after you go fuck yourself.

1201
01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:58.880
PSA Hi to lovely Nia. Um,

1202
01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:03.050
this is why it's funny because you're able to fight him off.

1203
01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:08.270
It's a guy with an accent grabbing your Dick when you tell this story. I,

1204
01:11:08.271 --> 01:11:12.860
my friend, my friend, just like your dead baby, right? It's just hilarious.

1205
01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:16.140
I remember one night we were down at the comedy cellar.

1206
01:11:16.141 --> 01:11:19.050
We were all telling the stories about getting molested as kids and it was one of

1207
01:11:19.051 --> 01:11:21.210
the funniest nights I've ever had.

1208
01:11:21.211 --> 01:11:25.320
It was so fucking Cathartic and we would just cry and laughing.

1209
01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:30.280
And I remember all the comics where, you know, I dunno,

1210
01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:33.270
had a different upbringing. We're looking at it like it was fucked up,

1211
01:11:33.271 --> 01:11:37.440
but it was fucking hilarious to me. Um, and if you told me this story,

1212
01:11:37.441 --> 01:11:39.910
I would be laughing my ass off still knowing that you,

1213
01:11:39.911 --> 01:11:43.890
you probably have some sort of fucking issue and all the pens and all the pens,

1214
01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:47.370
you know, if that was the first person that ever touched you, you know,

1215
01:11:47.371 --> 01:11:48.990
if no girl ever gave you a hand job,

1216
01:11:48.991 --> 01:11:51.030
the fact it was the first guy that ever did it, you know,

1217
01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:54.720
is Harry fucking hand coming over. You know, they could possibly fuck you up,

1218
01:11:54.721 --> 01:11:59.140
but you know, okay, you had a little bit of sexual activity. Maybe it doesn't,

1219
01:11:59.141 --> 01:12:01.420
you know, it's Kinda like, you know, if you're a relief pitcher and you,

1220
01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:04.540
you gotta, you got some saves under your belt, you let up a home run. Yeah,

1221
01:12:04.541 --> 01:12:07.680
give me another fucking ball. But if that's your first fucking pitching me,

1222
01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:09.680
that can fuck with you. Um,

1223
01:12:11.570 --> 01:12:13.700
why is it not funny? Uh,

1224
01:12:13.810 --> 01:12:17.180
when it happens to a woman's the same reason why it's like watching a guy get

1225
01:12:17.181 --> 01:12:21.500
punched in the head is fucking funny. You know, if he was like talking shit,

1226
01:12:21.501 --> 01:12:26.230
it's fucking funny. You know what I mean? But like, you know, kids, women,

1227
01:12:26.231 --> 01:12:29.470
animals like this, just never anything funny about watching them get abused.

1228
01:12:29.471 --> 01:12:33.220
But this just something hilarious about guys.

1229
01:12:33.221 --> 01:12:38.221
I would say the reason why you get having your Dick grabbed and get molested is

1230
01:12:38.231 --> 01:12:42.880
funny. His big, the same reason why the three stooges is funny. You know?

1231
01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:45.370
Imagine the three stooges. If it was women, you know,

1232
01:12:45.371 --> 01:12:47.950
grabbing each other by the hair and slapping each other in the face,

1233
01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:51.760
maybe that'd be a little funny. I Dunno. It's just like a guy thing.

1234
01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:57.010
We like slapstick and there's just something funny about him grabbing you.

1235
01:12:57.310 --> 01:13:01.780
Fuck stick in some car and then he charged you one Syrian pound.

1236
01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:08.160
You know what it really comes down to is I imagined being gay is not accepted

1237
01:13:08.161 --> 01:13:11.280
even remotely and serious. So this guy thought like, all right,

1238
01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:14.820
even if this doesn't go down or if it does go down,

1239
01:13:14.850 --> 01:13:19.500
this story leaves this country and goes back to Sweden. Um,

1240
01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:22.680
so in the way I'm going to say the cab driver was the victim and not you.

1241
01:13:22.681 --> 01:13:24.930
And stop being so selfish. Now I'm fucking with you. Uh,

1242
01:13:25.090 --> 01:13:29.400
I'm sorry that happened to you. Um, well you do, I mean,

1243
01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:33.570
I mean you were kind of asking for it cause you were on cold medication.

1244
01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:36.000
You know, I'm going to blame the victim here. Well, I mean,

1245
01:13:36.001 --> 01:13:40.630
what were you wearing? Um, I dunno dude. That's one of the more a,

1246
01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:43.250
I'd want to say. That's one of the more fucked up stories I've ever heard,

1247
01:13:43.251 --> 01:13:45.770
but a yeah, that, that just goes into that file.

1248
01:13:45.771 --> 01:13:49.850
I've heard enough of those ones. Um, yeah, that's why it's not funny. Um,

1249
01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:52.790
so I would actually say that you are fucked up.

1250
01:13:52.791 --> 01:13:56.780
There's no way you're not fucked up cause that happened to you. And there's, um,

1251
01:13:57.970 --> 01:13:59.440
is that feeling where it's just like,

1252
01:13:59.441 --> 01:14:03.490
why is that funny when that happens to a guy and then you feel like you can't

1253
01:14:03.491 --> 01:14:07.690
fucking, uh, that you should just, yeah. You know, I'm over it.

1254
01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:10.030
Like why would you, that's a horrific fucking thing that happened to you.

1255
01:14:10.330 --> 01:14:11.980
And I'm even like over the whole

1256
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:15.880
<v 1>thing, cause it's a guy like a, you know, fucking shake it off, shake it off,</v>

1257
01:14:15.881 --> 01:14:17.860
and it's part of growing up. There's always gonna be,

1258
01:14:17.861 --> 01:14:19.270
you have a paper route or something like that.

1259
01:14:19.271 --> 01:14:21.910
There'll be some Weirdo come at your junk at some point.

1260
01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:28.690
<v 4>But that's just how it is. I remember when that fucking, um,</v>

1261
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:30.040
<v 1>okay,</v>

1262
01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:33.310
<v 4>that lady cut the dude's Dick off and put it in the garbage disposal.</v>

1263
01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:38.380
One of those shows. It's not the view. I think it's the talk the Asian Lady,

1264
01:14:38.381 --> 01:14:41.920
she was reading it and as she was reading the details, they were all snickering,

1265
01:14:41.921 --> 01:14:45.110
laughing. And I remember that bit I was doing,

1266
01:14:45.230 --> 01:14:48.170
what if some guy cut a woman's titty off and threw it in the garbage disposal?

1267
01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:48.591
I mean,

1268
01:14:48.591 --> 01:14:51.050
they would have done a week long special on that and they would have tried to

1269
01:14:51.051 --> 01:14:54.410
help the lady out raise some money to get her a prosthetic.

1270
01:14:54.411 --> 01:14:56.600
You know what I mean? So a bra wouldn't be all lopsided.

1271
01:14:56.630 --> 01:15:00.260
That's what the fuck they do. But Abbott's to a guide, just fucking hilarious.

1272
01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:05.600
And I also think that that's why guys is so fucking funny, you know,

1273
01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:11.780
cause uh, you know, if a woman gets molested, it's a tragedy.

1274
01:15:11.781 --> 01:15:16.640
If it happens to a guy, it's a sketch. We really don't have any options.

1275
01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:18.650
You just gotta shake it off man.

1276
01:15:19.730 --> 01:15:20.563
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1277
01:15:21.130 --> 01:15:23.380
<v 4>You know, having said all that, dude, I'm sorry that happened to you.</v>

1278
01:15:23.381 --> 01:15:25.510
I'm sure you're emotionally fucked up about it,

1279
01:15:25.511 --> 01:15:28.690
but I would love to hear that story one time cause I want to hear you imitating

1280
01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:29.524
the guy,

1281
01:15:30.510 --> 01:15:32.190
<v 1>you know, and then listen to everybody interrupted</v>

1282
01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:36.240
<v 4>the, so wait, how fast were you go and dude, you couldn't jump on in the car.</v>

1283
01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:39.390
He's grabbing your deck and then everybody be laughing going, yeah,

1284
01:15:39.391 --> 01:15:42.240
but get jumped out. Then he'd be like holding onto your Dick.

1285
01:15:42.570 --> 01:15:45.720
Like Steve has happened. The car half part of the car, right.

1286
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:47.220
Stretching out your Dick. You know,

1287
01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:50.340
and then you have one of those needle dicks cause it's not going to give you any

1288
01:15:50.341 --> 01:15:53.760
more girth. He's just going to, that's what the whole fucking thing would be.

1289
01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:57.190
And then all your friends would laugh and say that you wanted it.

1290
01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:59.920
You know what I mean? Why didn't you sit in the back like a normal person?

1291
01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:03.280
Why did you sit up front? You know, that's what guys would do.

1292
01:16:03.281 --> 01:16:05.440
And they would laugh. You know, you'd just laugh your way through it.

1293
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:08.740
So anyways, I guess I'm going to stop there on the, uh,

1294
01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:12.750
<v 1>I can't, let's stop on something positive. Once again,</v>

1295
01:16:12.751 --> 01:16:16.380
I have two benefits that are coming up to two friends of mine that are no longer

1296
01:16:16.381 --> 01:16:19.620
here. Um, peak coming. Um,

1297
01:16:19.890 --> 01:16:23.010
memorial is going to be December 6th at the laugh factory.

1298
01:16:23.011 --> 01:16:25.590
I will tweet that link and the Patrice O'Neal,

1299
01:16:25.591 --> 01:16:30.330
the five year anniversary of his passing is today. And um,

1300
01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:35.220
the one truly positive thing that came out of that is we get to remember him and

1301
01:16:35.221 --> 01:16:38.100
we get to see our friends and we get to raise some money for his loved ones

1302
01:16:38.430 --> 01:16:39.061
every year.

1303
01:16:39.061 --> 01:16:44.061
And it's going to be February 21st to Tuesday 2017 at the New York City Center.

1304
01:16:46.290 --> 01:16:48.000
