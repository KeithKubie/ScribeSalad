00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:02.840
The function f of x is graphed.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.210
Find f of negative 1.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.660
So this graph right
over here is essentially

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.090
a definition of our function.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.360
It tells us, given the allowed
inputs into our function,

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.300
what would the function output?

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.079
So here, they're
saying, look, what

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:21.270
gets output when we input
x is equal to negative 1?

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.340
So x equals negative 1
is right over here. x

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.730
is equal to negative 1.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.040
And our function
graph is right at 6

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.340
when f is equal to negative 1.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.910
So we can say that f of
negative 1 is equal to 6.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.665
Let me write that over here.
f of negative 1 is equal to 6.
