00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.660
&gt;&gt;Mahim: I'm honored tonight to introduce
Bollywood screenwriter, Shibani Bathija, who's

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:16.590
changing the face of Bollywood cinema one
movie at a time. Before I--

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.590
[applause]

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.980
Before I begin, I must say that not even the
threat of a British Airway strike stopped

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.440
her from being here today.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.730
So, when she thought that her flight may get
cancelled, she still did everything she could

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.300
to be with us. So, that should make us especially
honored.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.300
[applause]

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.660
&gt;&gt;Shibani: It's great to be here. It really
has been wonderful. Thank you.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.579
&gt;&gt;Mahim: Shibani's success lies in her quest
to tell unconventional stories. And since

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.200
2006, everything she's touched has turned
to gold. Her first screenplay was the blockbuster,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.030
"Fanaa," followed by the super hit film, "Kabhi
Alvida Naa Kenha." Three of her four films

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:00.090
are in the highest list of the top grossing
movies, Bollywood movies, of all time.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.670
Her latest film, "My Name is Khan", reunited
her with director, Karan Johar and actor Shah

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:13.960
Rukh Khan, and Kajol; all legends in Bollywood.
We'll start the Q&amp;A with a few questions from

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.409
me and we'll turn the floor to the audience
for questions. Please just raise your hand

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.840
if you have a question and I will be replaying
the questions for YouTube broadcast.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:34.150
So, as mentioned, this entire event, the Q&amp;A,
will be taped for YouTube broadcast. So, if

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:40.689
you have friends and family who you'd like
to share this event with, you can send them

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:41.689
the link after it's online. And with that,
please welcome Shibani Bathija.

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:42.689
[applause]

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:43.689
&gt;&gt;Shibani: Thank you everyone, it's been great
to be here.

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:53.159
&gt;&gt;Mahim: So, Shibani, your latest film, "My
Name is Khan", has been embraced by audiences

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.100
in all parts of the world. It is the highest
grossing Bollywood movie in the Middle East

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:06.690
as well as the UK, and the second highest
grossing in the U.S. Many of the circumstances

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:13.530
seen in the film have also been seen or portrayed
in real life. What motivated you to write

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:20.090
this very timely movie, and why do you think
audiences have reacted so strongly?

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:28.010
&gt;&gt;Shibani: Actually, the idea for setting
a story in the post 9/11 world seen through

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:35.250
the eyes of Muslim protagonist was Karan's
idea, the director, Karan Johar. And it, it

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.001
was something that he wanted to do and he
started off with a slightly different story

00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:44.610
but we worked together to actually bring it
to what you see today.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:51.550
But really he, he needs to have credit to
have the, to have the foresight and also the,

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.590
the appetite and the gumption to actually
take on something like this. And I'm very

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.430
glad that he asked me to, to write it. I'll
always be grateful to him for that.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:10.349
&gt;&gt;Mahim: Great. So, the original version of
the film, different from the version we saw

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.170
today, some think depictions that contained
African Americans that were controversial.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:20.360
Some thought the representation inaccurately
portrays present day America. Those scenes

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.930
have been cut in the international version.
What was your intention when creating these

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.739
characters, and were you surprised by the
response?

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:36.049
&gt;&gt;Shibani: I think that, for me, as a writer,
as talking about it purely from a storytelling

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:41.470
point of view, the fact that this man takes
on this sort of quixotic mission of trying

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:48.900
to meet The President of the United States
and, and say "My name is Khan and I'm not

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:55.710
a terrorist," required him to be a certain
way, yes? And also, required him to, in his

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.069
own way, do something which would bring him
to the attention of the President. Now, if

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:06.230
this was an Indian film, perhaps set in India,
usually hunger strikes work, but considering

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:12.240
that it was transpiring in the United States,
I really felt that, that something that, he

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.180
needed to do something that would be that
special, you know?

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.859
And also, it was really important for him
to do something that united people; that,

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.180
that brought together people from different
walks of life within the mainstream country

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:35.410
in a way that was, that was special and very,
and humanitarian. Hence, the idea of basing

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.320
it in a somewhat contemporary event, around
Katrina and the fact that it happened in the

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.320
United States.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:47.699
An event that people all over the world knew
about, an event that would be under-, well

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:52.840
understood, even by, even to some degree,
by Indian audiences because the tsunami happened.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:59.820
And so this idea of being trapped in a weather
situation where there's a lot of devastation

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.949
all sort of stemmed from that. And that was
really the intention.

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:11.280
Statistically speaking, and, and, as research
bears out, on the poorest portion, areas in

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.690
this country, some of the poorest areas happen
to be in the South, they happen to be rural

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.910
and they happen to be predominantly African
American. This is not something that, that

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:26.639
I came up with or Karan came up with, it was,
it's there in the, in the statistics. So,

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:33.870
that's how the setting came, came about. So,
I'm actually, since I haven't talked to every

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:40.070
single person that, that has this comment,
my question usually is that, "Are you responding

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.710
to the visual interpretation of it, or are
you responding to the fact that such a thing

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:52.590
could happen, or such, or such placement in
the country is anachronistic or wrong in some

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:53.970
way?"

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:59.919
Because as far as I could, as far as I understood,
as far as I could, could discover it was very

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:08.330
much within the realm of possibility as I
explained. So, but, since there's such, there

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.180
was a fair amount of debate over this, the
version that you've seen today, the shorter

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.919
version of the film, has, does not have a
lot of that representation.

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:25.759
Does it make the film better, does it, or
does it sta-, or just sort of allow people

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:33.401
to not be te-, be just led away by something
that one portion of the greater whole that

00:06:33.401 --> 00:06:37.720
they, that they don't, that they didn't quite
like, I'm, I'm not sure. That really is for

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:43.819
audiences to tell. But, there was no intention
either on my part or, certainly not on, on

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:50.990
the part of, of the production or, or of Karan
to, in any way, hurt feelings or sensibilities

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:56.130
or to, to, to misrepresent anything.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:02.040
Also, there's a, there's a cultural; there's
a cultural lens through how a director from

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:09.120
one country, or people from one country, may
see, the, reality of another country, like

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.270
"Slum Dog", for instance. It was very well
received, say in the United States, but not

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:19.680
so much in India because Indians felt, "That's
not us," you know? "That's not how it is.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:25.199
That's a stereotype." So, that happens a lot
as well because it is someone from another

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:31.340
culture taking on another situation, and another
country; often there will be that discrepancy.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:39.970
But, really the film is, is about this , the
core of humanity and this man and his ability

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:44.940
to love despite all, and if that's what stayed
with people and if that's what they could

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:50.520
take home then I, you know, I hope that our
job is done.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:56.639
&gt;&gt;Mahim: Ok. Thank you. So, to switch gears
for a little bit, my next question is about

00:07:56.639 --> 00:08:02.220
the reaction from American Muslims. So, by
and large, American Muslims have reacted incredibly

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:07.430
positively to this film, but there have been
some people unhappy with what they perceive

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:12.599
as a good Muslim versus bad Muslim dynamic,
where the protagonist, Rizwan Khan, is the

00:08:12.599 --> 00:08:15.560
only good Muslim in the film.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:23.009
So, for example, people were upset that when
a mosque was depicted, it was the only time

00:08:23.009 --> 00:08:29.690
when terrorists, for example, were seen in
the mosque. There were no other representations

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:33.580
of a place of worship for Muslims. So, what
are your thoughts when you hear this, this

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:34.580
kind of reaction?

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:41.360
&gt;&gt;Shibani: I think that's, that's perhaps
taking a bit of a narrow view--

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.540
because the whole principle of the film is
there's good people and there's bad people,

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:50.620
and there's good people who do good for others
and bad people who do bad to others and that's

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:56.930
the only difference between them. So, I think
of, of every religion and racial representation

00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:01.970
that you find in the film, if you take each
scene apart you'll find good and bad represented

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.050
on equally on both sides.

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:08.800
So, it's not only that, that Rizwan is good,
his sister-in-law is good, his brother is

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:14.000
good, his mother is good, so those are all
the key characters in the film. And they're

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:21.570
all good practicing Muslims. The particular
scene that you talked about was, is, is again,

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:31.040
representative of a lot of research and a
lot of discussion with people who said that

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:38.399
there are certain places where, that sort
of, harbor, or at least turn a blind eye to

00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:41.750
activities of, of recruitment, you know?

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:50.410
And they very often happen to be in, they
use the place of worship as a refuge and misuse

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:55.430
that space of worship because there isn't
constant monitoring, you see? So, that's actually

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:58.700
what we, what, what was going on rather than
saying its like, "Oh, everybody that goes

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:03.640
to a mosque is, is like that." Because that's
sort of a narrow view to take, to take of

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.640
it.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:08.460
Whereas, I mean, and the, the fact of the
matter is that Rizwan prays when it's his

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:15.089
time to pray, no matter where he is. So, a
building actually does not, does not to him

00:10:15.089 --> 00:10:20.750
represent the best of the religion or the
only way to practice his religion. It is a

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:26.029
daily part of life. It's a, it's a daily process.
It's a way of living, which is really key

00:10:26.029 --> 00:10:28.970
to, to what Islam is anyway.

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:39.720
&gt;&gt;Mahim: Ok. Thank you. So, another question
that I had is about your work in the movie

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:44.780
industry. So, the movie industry for Bollywood
and Hollywood can be a tough place for females.

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:50.810
What has been your experience with this in
Bollywood and have you had to overcome any

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:53.800
obstacles while pursuing your career?

00:10:53.800 --> 00:11:00.990
&gt;&gt;Shibani: I have been very fortunate because
the two houses that I started working with,

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:06.310
Yash Raj Film and Dharma Productions, which
is the producers of "My Name is Khan" as well,

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:13.370
you know are run by people that, that, who
talent and, and dedication and the work that

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:18.769
you put in is, is much more, of much more
importance than gender. And so I, personally,

00:11:18.769 --> 00:11:23.540
can't speak for this because I have been fortunate
where it has not been an issue.

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:28.950
But I have had other stories from other people
where, where it has been and honestly, this

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:36.500
is something that, that's sort of one battle
at a time. One, one day at a time and one

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:42.459
project or contract at a time. The fact remains
that there are many more women actively working

00:11:42.459 --> 00:11:47.870
in the industry behind the cameras, whether
as directors or as writers now than there

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:53.260
was, say, ten years ago. So, that's actually
a positive sign and, and hopefully a sign

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.269
of things to come and changes to come.

00:11:56.269 --> 00:12:02.410
&gt;&gt;Mahim: Ok, so my last question I have before
I open it to the audience was just about your

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:07.800
next work and what you are working on next,
so as big fans of your work, we'd love to

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:12.399
hear what your latest project is, if you can
talk a little bit about that.

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:18.269
&gt;&gt;Shibani: Oh, sure. I've, I've done actually
a couple of scripts post the completion of

00:12:18.269 --> 00:12:24.250
writing of, of "My Name is Khan". One of them
is, is a screwball in the tradition of old

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:29.290
Hollywood screwballs, which I absolutely love.
And have not, it's a genre that hasn't really

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:35.220
been ex-, explored in, in the Hindi context
and so I took a break from, from something

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:43.450
intense and, and, and sort of emotional, like
"My Name is Khan", and I wrote something that

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.260
was completely mad and fun.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:49.731
And it, it was very therapeutic. So, that's
one and the other one is, is a sort of youth

00:12:49.731 --> 00:12:58.209
film, which is sort of, sort of takes a look
at issues of youth in India have with more

00:12:58.209 --> 00:13:03.630
traditional parents and more traditional expectations
versus the world they live in right now. So,

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:08.060
both are very special to me in different ways
and hopefully they will be up and running

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:12.290
and be brought to all of you very soon.

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:18.750
&gt;&gt;Mahim: Great. So, love to open up the floor
to the audience, just wanted to start with

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:26.300
everything with a few question I had. If you
guys had any questions along the line of what

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.180
I already addressed, or anything Shibani had
specifically mentioned, like I said, just

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:33.579
kind of raise your hand and say your question
and I'll repeat it for our YouTube audience.

00:13:33.579 --> 00:13:36.720
Don't be shy. Ok, up in the front.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:46.850
His question was just when, when Shibani was
writing her films, how much of that comes

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:47.850
really from her own experiences in her own
life?

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:52.990
&gt;&gt;Shibani: To address your question specifically,
the events that transpire and, and have, you

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:57.769
know, being sort of, of either Asian descent
or brown skinned, as, as you said and, and

00:13:57.769 --> 00:14:03.270
what that, and the impact of that. I've been
fortunate where, where I haven't had anything

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:10.209
particularly untoward happen to me. I've heard
that that often is because it, because women

00:14:10.209 --> 00:14:16.779
get less of it than men do, in general, which
is the opposite gender bias, I suppose.

00:14:16.779 --> 00:14:23.050
But I do remember this one time where we were
here researching and we went to a small suburban

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:28.970
town, which shall remain unnamed for the larger
part because it, you know it was an interesting

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:35.100
experience, and it was, it's a very homogenous,
very sort of upscale sort of, very pretty

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:41.100
town, you know and myself and Karan and, and
the, my co-dialogue writer, Niranjan were

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:46.170
just sort of walking around and trying to
see if this was a good place to shoot. And

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:50.240
we got these really strange sort of looks
and, and people were not being very friendly,

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:55.180
which is odd for Northern California, you
know? And I just wondered, I was like, "Why

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:56.180
is this happening?"

00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:00.639
Because I hadn't really experienced that in
the time that I studied in, in San Francisco,

00:15:00.639 --> 00:15:07.460
either. And then, I figured it out. The fact
was, it was, it was a 9/11 anniversary. We

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:16.399
happened to be in this town; three obviously
brown skinned people or, or from Asian descent,

00:15:16.399 --> 00:15:25.639
wandering in, an obviously anonymous, anonymously
in a place where we wouldn't normally be in

00:15:25.639 --> 00:15:30.040
the middle of the day. So, what it actually
told me, actually more than the discriminatory

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:36.690
side of it, was that how much fear there is,
you know? And there was fear on both sides.

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:43.610
I actually had a scene in the film, which
is, is not actually shot or in the film, where

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:51.680
it's a Bart station and there's a maulana,
there's a priest, you know from the mosque,

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:55.690
mosque who's wearing tradition outfit and
he's just approaching this bench to wait for

00:15:55.690 --> 00:16:00.970
the next train to come and from the other
side there's, there's a guy who's just done

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:03.040
with his baseball practics-, practice, you
know?

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:07.589
Just coming and he has his bat and so, and
there was this moment where the, where the

00:16:07.589 --> 00:16:12.900
priest looks at the bat, you know? And he's
afraid and the man with the bat looks at the

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:17.980
priest with his robes and he's afraid. And
they both walk away from the bench, you know?

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:23.610
And that was to me a, a thorough representation
of mutual fear, which I think is, is often

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:30.470
at the root of all of these, of all of these
incidences and that particular incidence that

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:35.579
happened to us was, if anything, just demonstrative
of that.

00:16:35.579 --> 00:16:44.040
&gt;&gt;Mahim: Yes, in the back. So the question
is how does your writing process start? Do

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.910
you have a special muse that you recall from
the heavens of the sky or, and how involved

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:49.670
is the director in this process?

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:59.490
&gt;&gt;Shibani: It, it all, it depends. You know,
in, it, with this particular film, Karan had

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:03.209
an idea of how, what he wanted to do in terms
of where he wanted to set it, and the kind

00:17:03.209 --> 00:17:09.090
of story that he wanted to tell. But, he was,
he was lovely at once and we sort of agreed

00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:13.480
that this was going to be the story of the
film, he sort of just let me be, you know?

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:20.750
And just let me go and just write the story
in an organic way. And not all directors will

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:23.940
do that and not all producers will do that.

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:29.281
So, I think it, it, sort of, it's, it's very
individual; it depends, you know? I've been

00:17:29.281 --> 00:17:36.620
fortunate again in working, writing scripts
that, that come from my stories, mostly, except

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:41.309
for "Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna" which was Karan's
story and it was mostly his, his baby, I just

00:17:41.309 --> 00:17:45.850
was, was sort of being the, the part-time
nanny along the way.

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:55.940
But, so, and so that makes it very organic
and as hokey and hooey and woohoo that this

00:17:55.940 --> 00:18:00.830
sounds, but I always feel, I almost fe-, you
know, I almost find that the characters talk

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:04.900
to me and there are days where they won't
say anything and those are the days that,

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:11.060
that, that there's writers block. Because
the idea is not to make them say or behave

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:17.210
a certain way, but to just let them unfold
and just do what, what they would do by their

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:21.530
character. So, that's really an, an important
part of my writing process.

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:25.590
&gt;&gt;Mahim: Yeah, in the front. So, the first
part of that question is why did you choose

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:33.710
to end the life of a young child? And why
was protagonist made an autistic character

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:40.130
and not someone who doesn't have an illness?

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:50.600
&gt;&gt;Shibani: The thing is that you know very
often, again, back up, part of our research

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:56.990
that came up, there was a lot of stuff that
happened in schools, you know? And kids not

00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:04.520
being, not really being able to filter or
to, or to sort of pretend what sort of perhaps

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:08.700
from what they heard from parents or from
other people around them, actually takes things

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.900
to heart and actually act out a lot more.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:20.130
So, so, the setting of that happening as,
as a very, you know, as, as, as a way that,

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:26.850
that fear again can permeate and actually
percolate down to even to schools and to children,

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:33.360
was very integral to how important it is to
address the issue and hence, it happens in

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:39.250
a school and, of course, even for the story,
for it happening to the child creates the,

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:40.430
the larger impact.

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:48.980
Where, where an adult could be able to absorb,
take, move on; with a child, it's a different

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:54.240
ball game. And, so that was very important
to the, to the, to the story.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:58.850
And as far as Asperger's Syndrome, when we
started out with this, and again, this came,

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:03.910
this came from research, Karan had met someone
who actually just sort of said he was, he

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:07.820
was a Muslim gentleman and he just said, he
said," You know I'm just sometimes so frustrated.

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:11.090
I wish I could just go tell the President
that, look, you know, I'm Muslim and I'm not

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:14.860
a terrorist," you know?
And it was just a random comment that he made

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:19.540
and, and so when Karan was telling me about
this, I'm like, "Oh my God. Wow, imagine if

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:24.169
someone actually set out to do this, actually
set out to meet the President." And then he

00:20:24.169 --> 00:20:27.820
said, then I started working backwards and
I said, "Well, but what kind of a person would

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:30.730
this be, right?" And Karan's like, "Yeah,
what kind of person would this be?"

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:35.180
And, so that's where his Asperger's came from,
was someone who would take something literally,

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:42.380
who would take on a, what was obviously said
in anger from, by his, by his wife, but take

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:47.970
it to heart and actually set out on this quixotic
mission, you know? And that's where the Asperger's

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:52.310
came into play and, but once I got into the
Asperger's, a lot of that informed Rizwan,

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:57.980
the character. So, one thing informed the
other, and then it informed the previous thing.

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:03.790
So, it just sort of became this, hopefully,
holistic approach to who he was and why he

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:06.880
decides to do what he does.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:15.320
&gt;&gt;Mahim: Yes, question in the back.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:19.530
[audience question inaudible]

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:32.000
&gt;&gt;Shibani: Yes, you know sometimes I guess
the only way I have to address that, that

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.870
question, actually, is to talk about the process
of writing.

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:42.020
And often what happens is that, that what
is on paper, is becomes a road map to how

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:49.740
things are taken forward. But there are decisions
that are made along the way for whatever reason,

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:55.830
you're enhancing something, or to further
demonstrate, or for passage of time. That

00:21:55.830 --> 00:22:03.630
may modify what that is, and more often than
not, with skilled people behind, behind the

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:08.409
scenes, like Karan and Shah Rukh, and the
whole crew, you know those modifications will

00:22:08.409 --> 00:22:09.409
really work.

00:22:09.409 --> 00:22:15.500
For instance, that whole "can we have sex
now" mandala was something they came up with

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:19.540
on the set, which was wonderful, you know?
And, it's, it works beautifully. For most

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:24.440
people, they really enjoyed that. And this,
perhaps, was one of the things that didn't,

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:28.179
that was a little anomalous. So, you just
kind of go with that a little bit, you know?

00:22:28.179 --> 00:22:32.280
Not everything that you see on screen has
actually been what's on paper. That's just

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:38.010
the, the, it's the reality of my job and,
and the reality that actually a lot of audiences

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:46.980
don't understand or can't see; the fact that
the final product is finally a group effort,

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:54.541
you know? And, and so that's what you, you
go with and as a group, you say, "Yes, that

00:22:54.541 --> 00:23:00.340
may not have been too right." But, there were
a lot of things that were very right, so hopefully,

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:04.700
that balanced it out.

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:09.059
[audience question inaudible]

00:23:09.059 --> 00:23:21.600
&gt;&gt;Shibani: Sorry, which one, which one comes
out in Hindi?

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.330
[audience question inaudible]

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:25.330
&gt;&gt;Shibani: Yes.

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:27.870
[audience question inaudible]

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:38.230
&gt;&gt;Shibani: You know, there's a particular
challenge with a film like this, which is,

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:42.289
which is you're, it's a basically a Hindi
film which has a lot of English, obviously

00:23:42.289 --> 00:23:46.770
because it's based in the United States, so
a lot of times there is a doubling. There

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:51.730
is an English thing, which either has a voice-over,
which helps with the Hindi, or then has a

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:58.029
Hindi sort of echo, almost, you know? So that
audiences get that, which is why the Bobby

00:23:58.029 --> 00:24:04.840
character spoke in English because he worked
for BBC, an American channel, but the, but

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:11.020
the college students get an internship with
ZTV, or whatever, Star TV, whatever that was,

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:18.340
which was a Hindi channel. So that, so that
at every point in time, there is both sides

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:24.350
represented. But, this is a reality of doing
a Hindi film, which has a lot of English in

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:29.360
it. So these, so these are things that one
has to be careful of, just to make sure that

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:33.060
as many people in the audience actually understand
the important information that's given.

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:35.910
&gt;&gt;Mahim: So the question was why was Rizwan
typ-, afraid of the color yellow? Is there

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:39.950
some significance behind that?

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:49.029
&gt;&gt;Shibani: Yes, actually, one of the with
Asperger's this reac-, this strong reaction

00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:55.730
to a color could be one of the traits. And
usually the primary colors, so in his case

00:24:55.730 --> 00:25:03.820
it was yellow. People have often demonstrated
similar, similar reactions to say, red, but

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:08.980
it's, it's, it's very often a symptom with
Aspberger's.

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:13.679
&gt;&gt;Mahim: I saw a question from you in the
front.

00:25:13.679 --> 00:25:14.679
&gt;&gt;Shibani: Yes.

00:25:14.679 --> 00:25:15.679
[audience question inaudible]

00:25:15.679 --> 00:25:16.770
&gt;&gt;Mahim: So the question is where is Banville
and is it on Google Maps?

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:25.950
&gt;&gt;Shibani: [laughs] Yeah, yes actually, I
had been to Danville and not that, you know,

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:32.210
so here's the thing. Danville, the town in
the film, actually is not so representative

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:37.650
of an actual city, and, "Oh, this is what
transpires in this city and this is how these

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:45.039
people are," but more a represen-, it's more
representative of any small, suburban, homogenous

00:25:45.039 --> 00:25:53.620
town. And that's what's really important,
you know? So, the fact that the, that, the

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:59.130
town of Danville, which I actually quite enjoyed,
was sort of stuck with me and I had a friend

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:10.350
from there who talked about in her instance,
being gay, and not, and not being very accepted

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:16.260
in, in growing up. But, it's kind of stayed
with me and sort of, it sort of it flowed

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:23.679
into something else. But it's really more
about homogenous town and, and a close knit,

00:26:23.679 --> 00:26:28.660
small community and a reaction to something,
to something sort of painful in their lives,

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:29.660
so.

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:36.390
&gt;&gt;Mahim: So the question is once you have
a story, how does it actually transition then

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:40.789
on to the final product and how are characters
involved in all of that?

00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:49.669
&gt;&gt;Shibani: Wow, I wish I could say I cast
this film, I'm just like, pick up the phone

00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:55.090
and say, "Hey, Shah Rukh, hey Karan, you wanna
do this film?" No, that was not my department,

00:26:55.090 --> 00:27:02.190
that was very much Karan and I'm glad that
both of them were, were on board.

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:08.039
But, the advantage of actually knowing who
your actors are going to be is that you can

00:27:08.039 --> 00:27:15.559
play to their strengths and you can also work
around some of the things that, that perhaps

00:27:15.559 --> 00:27:20.350
are expected of them and you want to sort
of break expectations. So, in this case, I

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:26.970
mean the fact that, that Shah Rukh has been
so amazingly popular as a romantic hero, the

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:32.000
way he looks at the heroine, the way he looks
in her eyes, these are state trademarks.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.560
I mean, he should get, he can get a patent
on those, right? I mean, amazing, you know

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:41.700
people love him for that. He's wonderful at
doing it, but it would not have worked as

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:49.100
well for Rizwan because if we started seeing
too much of Shahrukh in Rizwan, then the believability

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:55.340
of, of his, of his Asperger's and the process
that he follows, would perhaps have become

00:27:55.340 --> 00:28:03.570
a little less. So, so I, I, because I knew
it was going to be Shah Rukh, I sort of, the

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:09.770
enhancing of the not being able to look in
the eye, him not being able to cry because

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:16.429
Shah Rukh's wonderful tears are also worth
patenting and but it would have again been

00:28:16.429 --> 00:28:17.990
Shah Rukh Khan.

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:22.760
So, there are people with Asperger's who can
cry, you know, it's Rizwan who can't, but

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:29.720
the moment you take that away, then not only
does it give him opportunities as an actor

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:34.000
to go into places that he doesn't usually
have the opportunity to, but it also, as an

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.790
audience, takes away the markers that you're,
that we started looking for in a Shah Rukh

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:48.000
Khan film. So, there was, there was great
opportunity in that and that being said, just

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:54.649
seeing the man Rizwan be Shahrukh Kahn on
screen was lovely because they bring such

00:28:54.649 --> 00:29:01.799
an amazing energy and, and talent to, to making
these characters believable.

00:29:01.799 --> 00:29:04.010
&gt;&gt;Mahim: Ok, I think I saw a question back
there.

00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:12.990
So the question was where can you go to see
the lovely view where Mandira proposes to

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:13.990
Rizwan?

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:19.470
&gt;&gt;Shibani: Actually, that, that spot is Corona
Heights. The view may not be exactly like

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:27.010
that and the fog is not that, it doesn't comply
quite as readily, but yeah, it has that sort

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:31.740
of a spectacle to it on the right day. It
will just give you that kind of feeling. So,

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:35.270
but yeah, if you climb up there on the top
of Corona Heights, you can get a pretty spectacular

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:36.270
view.

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:44.830
&gt;&gt;Mahim: Great. And so I think a question
is back there in the very back.

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:48.060
So, the question is why the Bay Area for the
film?

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:52.460
&gt;&gt;Shibani: So I could get a chance to come
back to San Francisco, which I try to do every

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:53.460
given opportunity.

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:54.460
[laughter]

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:56.809
No, actually, what to me really would appeal
about San Francisco in particular, is the

00:29:56.809 --> 00:30:01.480
fact that Mandira and Rizwan have a, a very
quirky romance. I mean, it's not every day

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:12.830
that you see, see, sort of a woman having
a romantic relationship with somebody who,

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:18.669
you know, she's not quite ready for and who's
significantly different. So, their, the flow

00:30:18.669 --> 00:30:24.460
of their romance was had that sort of quirky,
unpredictable quality which I felt the city

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:32.730
really enhanced because it allows that sort
of "Hey, anything can happen here" sort of

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:36.740
feel to it. So, I'm, that's why San Francisco,
besides, of course, my love for it.

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.559
&gt;&gt;Mahim: Great. I think there's a question
in the cap.

00:30:38.559 --> 00:30:47.720
So the question is how did you get started
as a writer and do you want to venture into

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:48.720
Hollywood?

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:57.899
&gt;&gt;Shibani: I think I was, I was always a writer
in denial. I always loved reading and was

00:30:57.899 --> 00:31:05.010
very good at English composition growing up.
But, I didn't quite maybe have faith in myself

00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:09.070
enough to say, "Wow, can I actually write,
you know?" But, when I was working as a, as

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:13.929
an executive in, at Sony Television in India,
I was working with a lot of in, my job involved

00:31:13.929 --> 00:31:18.559
working with a lot of writers because it was
part of development, content development.

00:31:18.559 --> 00:31:23.040
And I think that's when I discovered the frustrated
writer in me because I was always expecting

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:28.600
them to do things the way I wanted, the way
I saw them. You know, and then I said, "Oh,

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:33.230
that's so not fair because you just want to
write this, right?" I mean, it's not about

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:37.049
whether what they're doing is really great
or not. So I decided not to do that and not

00:31:37.049 --> 00:31:45.450
be an ogre and started writing myself on weekends
and that's how the first script came about.

00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:52.320
That was, that script never got made so for
anybody who's wanting to write either in the

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:59.000
audience here or elsewhere, just an attachment
to note, that you always have a great attachment

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.580
to the first thing you ever write, but you
should start writing it knowing that nothing

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:09.370
may ever happen to it; happen off it, you
know? Because, in retrospect, I think it was

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:13.649
a beauti-, a fantastic beginning. I couldn't
have asked for anything better, but it wasn't

00:32:13.649 --> 00:32:18.291
the first thing I ever wrote. So, that often
happens and you have to sort of go with the

00:32:18.291 --> 00:32:24.590
flow as far as that's concerned. And, I forgot
the second part of your, his question, sorry.

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:27.460
&gt;&gt;Mahim: Oh, Hollywood, are you interested
in making films for Hollywood?

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:32.741
&gt;&gt;Shibani: Oh, in Hollywood. Yeah, I'm certainly
interested in, in writing in the English language.

00:32:32.741 --> 00:32:37.940
It is my first language. Now, whether that
would be a Hollywood production per se, or

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:43.100
just an international production, or an Indie
film, I don't know. I mean, probably the latter,

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:52.899
you know? But I, because I've lived in the
U.S. for as long as I have, because my thinking

00:32:52.899 --> 00:33:00.330
mind and my, my processes are so geared towards
the English language that, I think that I

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:04.679
would be remiss if I didn't attempt at least
to express that.

00:33:04.679 --> 00:33:07.640
&gt;&gt;Mahim: Maybe it can be about Google.

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:09.600
&gt;&gt;Shibani: Maybe it can be about Google.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.600
[laughter]

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:12.560
&gt;&gt;Mahim: Great. Yes, you right there.

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:17.941
So, the first question was since this was
more internationally distributed, did you

00:33:17.941 --> 00:33:22.179
have a different audience in mind when you
wrote it and were creating it? And the second

00:33:22.179 --> 00:33:27.059
question is do you have any more projects
with Karan Johar in the future?

00:33:27.059 --> 00:33:30.919
&gt;&gt;Shibani: Yes, actually, I did have a different
audience in mind, I mean, it was always going

00:33:30.919 --> 00:33:36.269
to be a Hindi film so your core audience is
always going to be people that, that understand

00:33:36.269 --> 00:33:39.070
the language and are familiar with the culture
and with the, with the actors.

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:46.019
I mean, that is always where you begin. But,
it was certainly, it was certainly something

00:33:46.019 --> 00:33:55.230
that because the scope of the story is so
contemporary and yet so universal, we always

00:33:55.230 --> 00:34:00.370
hoped that it will be something that will
touch people regardless of culture and country,

00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:07.559
and more on a basis of being part of the human
race.

00:34:07.559 --> 00:34:13.760
Fortunately it, it, we've been very successful
in that and have had some wonderful emails

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:18.131
and, and contacts from people from, from many
different parts of the world, like Egypt and

00:34:18.131 --> 00:34:28.000
Syria and Indonesia and so, and Germany, and
it's just been, it's been really gratifying.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:34.010
As far as projects in the future, I, Karan
has to only sort of pick up the phone and

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:40.310
say, "I'm doing, I don't know, a Space Invaders
3," and I'll be like, "Ok, when? When do we

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:45.520
start?" He's, he's very special to me and
has been greatly instrumental in, in what,

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:50.970
in doing work that I can believe in, so when,
so whenever he decides that it's something

00:34:50.970 --> 00:34:55.879
he wants to do with me, I'm more than happy
to do it.

00:34:55.879 --> 00:34:58.320
&gt;&gt;Mahim: Great. Yes, right there.

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:04.810
So the question is what was it like filming
in San Francisco? A lot of the scenes in the

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:08.710
movie have large crowds versus in New York
and India and other places.

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:14.190
&gt;&gt;Shibani: I don't know about the crowd's
portion of it, but I had a wonderful experience

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:19.031
shooting in San Francisco because my job was
done; everyone else was working. But, and

00:35:19.031 --> 00:35:22.880
it's always great to be in San Francisco,
but more than that, I think that the people

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:28.240
and the city were just, are always very welcoming.
I mean, there's a very easy, relaxed sort

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:33.830
of set up in shooting in San Francisco. Because
there aren't great, huge crowds and lots of

00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:41.070
cars and, so just blocking off a portion or
whatever, is not as much of a task as it can

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:46.089
be in New York or in Bombay, you know? So,
and then the people are nice. I mean, I don't

00:35:46.089 --> 00:35:50.030
know, it's, it's gotta do with, with that
cold air that comes off the Bay, I suppose.

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:55.089
I, the people are just nice, so it just made,
it made the process for us very, very smooth

00:35:55.089 --> 00:35:56.690
and just very, very fruitful.

00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:59.930
&gt;&gt;Mahim: I think we have time for two more
questions. So, you in the front.

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:10.150
So, like most Bollywood films, there are lots
of dance sequences, so why not in this film?

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:13.520
&gt;&gt;Shibani: God, imagine if Rizwan in the middle
of all of this had to break out into a break-dance,

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:18.911
my God! How would that be? So, yes, it was
a conscious decision because there was a,

00:36:18.911 --> 00:36:28.150
you know it was important for it, for the
topic that we addressed is, is a, more than

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:32.610
a serious issue, it's more, it's an emotional
issue and it's a sensitive issue for a lot

00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:33.610
of people.

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:37.790
So, we didn't want to sort of trivialize it
in any way or create a situation where it

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:41.780
just becomes unbelievable and laughable in
any way because that was just, that would

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:46.770
just be terrible. So, so, yes, it was a, it
was a conscious, it was a conscious decision.

00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:51.270
Because the idea really behind this film is
you know, you have one billion Muslims in

00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:59.650
the world, of which, and I'm being, this is
a generous number, maybe five million, maybe,

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:04.180
maybe, and I'm, this is a very, very generous
number, may be involved in say, subversive

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:12.740
activities or, or, and there's 995 million
people at the very least that don't get a,

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:18.099
that don't get any representation, or a voice
in mainstream cinema, either in the East or

00:37:18.099 --> 00:37:19.099
in the West.

00:37:19.099 --> 00:37:25.740
And this was our, this was our motive behind
the story and getting it out there so we just

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:30.740
didn't want to actually take on anything that
would, any, take away from this or trivialize

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:38.109
it in any way. So, hence the only mini dance
at the wedding where it would, he would dance.

00:37:38.109 --> 00:37:46.530
&gt;&gt;Mahim: Ok, last question. Ok, so, you in
the back.

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:51.359
So, the question was why did Reese not go
to the authorities straight away or call 911

00:37:51.359 --> 00:37:56.260
when Sam was first injured and then ultimately
killed?

00:37:56.260 --> 00:38:02.270
&gt;&gt;Shibani: I think this has got, it has much
more to do with a psychological thing than

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:06.910
it has to do with a logical thing because
Reese is actually going through some, some

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:14.579
sort of, a post-traumatic stress in a sense
because his father's died, so his reaction

00:38:14.579 --> 00:38:17.260
to Sam in any case is not normal.

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:23.270
It's not what he would normally react to.
That compounded with having lost, actually

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:30.900
lost a parent and being confronted by older
boys and under the peer pressure of "if you

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:39.060
tell, you had it from us," and your family
could be threatened; he has one mother. So,

00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:44.020
on Reese, it's really a combination of those
things plus guilt. The fact that on somewhere,

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:51.210
on some level he feels that he's brought this
on Sam, if he had not confronted him or if

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:55.359
he had not talked, sort of said that he was
not talking to him, the boys would not have

00:38:55.359 --> 00:38:57.829
intervened and this would not have happened.

00:38:57.829 --> 00:39:03.339
So, it's a, it's from Reese's perspective
it's much more of a psychological thing of

00:39:03.339 --> 00:39:11.190
fear and guilt and the traumatic stress of
having lost a parent. So, although logically

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:16.190
and practically, he can pick up the phone,
but in the mental and emotional state that

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:20.170
he is, he can't. So, that's really the basis
of where that comes from.

00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:27.120
&gt;&gt;Mahim: Great. Thank you. And with that,
we'll end. We'd like to thank Shibani, once

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:29.260
again, for spending the evening with us.

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:30.260
[applause]

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:34.329
&gt;&gt;Shibani: Thank you and thank you everyone
for coming to the film. For everybody that

00:39:34.329 --> 00:39:40.590
did enjoy it and I know that Googlers have,
have their tentacles all over the world, please

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:47.309
tell friends and, and well wishers to actually
find it and watch it because we feel it's

00:39:47.309 --> 00:39:51.660
the story and a message that if it can go
out to as many people as possible, the better

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:52.790
we'll be, so thank you.

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:53.970
&gt;&gt;Mahim: Thanks.

00:39:53.970 --> 00:39:54.550
[applause]
