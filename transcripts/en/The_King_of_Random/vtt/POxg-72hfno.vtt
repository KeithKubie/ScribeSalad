00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.140
[Captions by Judy V. at Y Translator]
In today's video,

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.800
we're going to use the lace cutter that
we showed you how to make previously,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.260
cut a whole bunch of lace,

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.120
and then follow a bunch of steps
to make a kangaroo hide bullwhip.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.250
Garrett is something
of an expert on bullwhips,

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.690
at least a whole lot more than me,

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:21.320
and in fact,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.900
if you've seen our video on how to make
the paracord and athletic tape bullwhip,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.280
Garrett is the one who taught me
how to do that in the first place.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.240
Here is the idea.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.320
We're going to be cutting out
a lot of kangaroo leather lace,

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.000
wrapping, twisting, and braiding
it around itself to form a bullwhip.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.520
We'll take it outside and
give it a few tests.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.200
&gt;&gt; In order to make this 6 and 1/2
foot kangaroo hide bullwhip,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.900
we're gonna start with a paracord core,

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.280
and we're going to fill
that core with BBs,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.640
so our bullwhip will have a little
bit more heft and weight to it.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.160
&gt;&gt; There we go.
I measured about two feet in.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.020
I twisted this flattened piece of paracord.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.040
As you saw, I pulled out the core so
it's an empty hollow piece of paracord,

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.930
and then I hit it with the lighter just
enough that it really started melting,

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.760
and by squeezing it together,

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.740
it basically just formed
a solid plastic bit in the middle.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.480
So now I'm going to fill two
feet of this with BBs,

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.920
and while I do that,

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.760
Garrett is going to be
cutting some more lace,

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.590
and explaining how you know
how thick your lace should be.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.120
&gt;&gt; So, right now we're working
on the very outside of the hide,

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.620
and the outside is the most
stretchy part of the hide,

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.200
so I'm cutting my strands
to be fairly wide.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.840
So I'm going to be cutting about
30 feet of lace for the first belly.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.300
[Music]

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.980
Now that I've cut about 30 feet of lace,

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.640
I'm going to end this specific cut.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.180
So the way I'm going to do that is I'm
going to slowly kind of taper it off,

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.040
so I still have a nice curvature on
the end of the kangaroo hide.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.140
Now, you can see this outside
part of this-- of the kangaroo hide

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.540
is actually pretty stretchy.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.179
So the next step we're going to do
is to run this through a hook,

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:57.160
and kind of stretch all the stretch out of it

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.900
so that we don't have
a loose braided whip.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.460
So to lubricate the strands,

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.200
I've brought some of this
homemade plaiting soap,

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.240
and basically what this is is just
emulsified lard, soap, and water,

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.180
and it's all kind of mixed together and
then heated up and cooked in a stove,

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.660
and then let to sit and turn into this
kind of pasty lardy substance.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.880
And what we're going to do, stretch them,

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.000
is we're going to lubricate the
strands with this plaiting soap.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.980
So this is going to be our start.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.300
And then we're going to wrap
it around our hook.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.660
So to start stretching it,

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.200
and start pulling it back
and forth on this hook.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.620
So as we go along,

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.560
I'm going to be adding more
plaiting soap to the strands.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.000
&gt;&gt; We've now stretched out this--

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.240
this was 30 feet before
we stretched it out.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.460
&gt;&gt; And it was definitely wider than this.

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:53.959
We can sort of see
the crazy difference here,

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.960
and this is what this looked like before,

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.260
and here it is after.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.900
You can see how much more narrow it is,

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.020
and it got a lot darker too.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.160
Like just basically,

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.860
this just looks like
black leather at this point,

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.420
which is pretty neat.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.520
Okay Garrett, we've got
the strander set back up,

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.779
why are we running it back
through the strander?

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so as we stretched the strands,

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.780
different parts of the leather
stretch a little bit more than others.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.380
So we don't-- we didn't have a
completely consistent width.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.360
So we're running it through the strander
one more time at a slightly smaller width,

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.920
that way we can have a completely,

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.680
or as most as possible,

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.920
a consistent strand.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.200
[Music]

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.780
&gt;&gt; Very cool.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.700
36 feet of our now almost
black kangaroo leather lace.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.980
&gt;&gt; So we need to cut about 8-9 inches
of this [inaudible] steel rod.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.840
[Music]

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.019
&gt;&gt; To make our bar fit a little
bit nicer into our paracord,

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.140
I'm just going to taper
the top a little bit just using a file.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.460
&gt;&gt; So we're just going to use a
piece of scrapped kangaroo hide,

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.660
we're going to lay this down,

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.940
and we're going to measure
how much we need

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.859
to wrap around this entire
a little piece here.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.640
&gt;&gt; So, as we get our leather wrapped
around both the steel rod and the paracord,

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.700
we're then going to wrap it tight
using this black artificial sinew

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.520
[Music]

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.430
We're done.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.980
We finished our whip.
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.300
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.100
This is the completed whip.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.360
&gt;&gt; The leather was just for fun.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.220
[Music]

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.080
&gt;&gt; We are just about ready to start
plaiting our leather lace onto this rod,

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.980
but this is a pretty slick metal
and our leather has some lotion all over it.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.220
So we're going to take some of this sinew,

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.240
and wrap it all the way
around this metal rod

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.380
so it gets a lot better grip
and doesn't just slide right off.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.160
&gt;&gt; So now we're going to want to find
the middle of each of these two strands,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.760
and then we're going to take
the bottom right-hand strand,

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.520
take it over the top right-hand strand,

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.020
and around, behind, and
in between the two left hand strands,

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.440
then back around.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:07.840
[Music]

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.940
Plaited, we have plaited our leather lace

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.480
to-- what is it?
3 feet and 10 inches

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.660
down this whip.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.880
46 inches from the end of the handle over
there to where we braided it right here.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.000
And so now what we need to do is
cut off the four pieces of laces,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.400
and wrap it closed with
some of our artificial sinew.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.680
We're going to stair-step
them all the way back,

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.220
so we end the belly in a way that tapers

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.820
so we don't have this a sudden end.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.780
&gt;&gt; About right here.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.220
About here.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:50.780
[Music]

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.400
&gt;&gt; So next, we need to roll the width.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.500
So when we roll the whip,

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.460
it kind of rounds out all the edges,

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.860
and makes it about as
perfectly around as we can get.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.460
I'm just going to start on this
end and work my way down and back.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.840
And I'm pushing with a fair amount of force

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.160
because I want it to be
as compacted as possible.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.440
You can see a big difference in--

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.200
&gt;&gt; So unrolled here.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.840
Rolled here.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.500
You can see it fairly well
and you can definitely feel it.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.500
I mean this feels like
it's braided and this just--

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.880
you can feel a little bumps in it,

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.060
but it doesn't feel like
the pieces of the plait

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.440
are sticking out the way they are here.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.060
[Music]

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.820
Next, we're going to put a cowhide
bolster on the outside of this whip.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.080
So basically, we're going
to cut a long tapering triangle

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.389
that's going to cover
the entire surface of this whip,

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:43.750
and this is going to help to kind of
reinforce all the area of the whip.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.760
It's going to help to make it
as perfectly around as possible,

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.780
fill in all the gaps and it's going to just
help add a little bit of thickness as well.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.520
&gt;&gt; So what I'm thinking is
we can take this squared up edge,

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.500
we can fit that around
any given part of the whip,

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.280
curl it really tight,

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.200
and then we can mark where it's making
contact with the leather.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:08.580
[Music]

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:13.289
We also-- we want to make sure that the 
bolster's completely straight over the whip.

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:14.979
We don't want it to kind of twist around.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:19.380
Yeah we want we want a straight seam
going the entire way down the whip.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:25.180
[Music]

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.500
Okay. So, we're now going
to be adding leather dressing.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.220
Is this a homemade thing
or just a product that you buy?

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.480
&gt;&gt; No, this is just leather dressing.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.940
It's-- this is Pecard's leather dressing.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:37.980
It's pretty standard for whip making.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.360
One thing that can happen
with leather whips that get dry,

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.220
if they're not very well
conditioned on the inside,

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.520
is the core will start
become kind of crusty,

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.060
and as the different layers of the whip
kind of rub against each other

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.080
you'll actually end up with a squeaky whip,

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.460
and your whip will squeak any
time you move it or try to crack it.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.460
&gt;&gt; Wonder who in the
whip making process was like,

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.000
"My whip is kind of squeaky."

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.480
"I wonder how I can fix that."

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.380
"I'll try adding some
weird goop on the inside."

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:07.040
[Music]

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.900
We've now wrapped the whip all
the way down to the end of the leather,

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:13.400
and in fact, even a little bit
beyond the cow leather bolster

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.230
onto the paracord just a bit,

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:17.940
and Garrett is telling me that
to reinforce it a little bit more,

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.240
we actually want to
keep wrapping it a few times

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.100
because we have a metal stick

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.360
to about right here,

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.720
and if we try and crack
our whip just the way it is,

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.381
then it's just going to end up
hinging right on that point so much

00:08:29.381 --> 00:08:31.060
that it breaks the leather over time.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.620
So to reinforce that,

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.140
we have to go over that a few times.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.300
So what we're going to do is we're
going to keep wrapping with the sinew down

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:38.460
a couple feet

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.840
and then back and then a little bit less,

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.740
and then back and then less again,

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.460
and then back and so we're just going to
kind of be bouncing smaller and smaller

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.880
to give a really tapered reinforcement.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.140
We've wrapped the heck out of this thing,

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.080
and you can see that we don't
have a really sharp bending point

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.280
at the end of the handle
or really anywhere along there.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:59.020
It  just kind of keeps going with
this nice tapered rolling edge.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.160
That's just we want,

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.660
and now we're just going
to take this whole thing,

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.560
and roll it again the same way
we did when we just had the belly.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:08.820
&gt;&gt; So we're going to take our
very high-tech whip rolling device.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:15.980
I sell Artisan whip rolling devices
on Etsy for $480 each.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:16.980
Check my page.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.180
[Music]

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.640
We've now wrapped
and rolled this whole thing,

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.800
so Garrett, what is our next step next?

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:29.100
&gt;&gt; We are going to be cutting
and prepping the overlay strands.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.020
&gt;&gt; More lace.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.060
So we're just going to cut
a bunch of long strands.

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.180
We're actually-- we have two hides,

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.300
so I'm going to work on a hide
and you're going to work on a hide.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:36.920
&gt;&gt; Let's get cutting.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:58.460
[Music]

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.100
&gt;&gt; This leather that we've just cut out,

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.780
we're going to be cutting out
three 22 foot pieces,

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:06.280
and that's because we're
going to be ending in a 6 point fall hitch.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.700
So when we reach the very end
of the whip, the longest strand,

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.560
we're going to be using six strands.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.600
And then we're going to cut
an 18-foot, a 14-foot, and a 10-foot,

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.260
and those will get dropped
at various points in the whip.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.900
I'm holding all our kangaroo lace
by the middles that we found

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.080
when we were cutting them.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.100
I'm going to do a little bit of
braiding to make a little bit of a loop

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.920
that will make it easy
to attach to our whip.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.360
Okay, so I'm going to
take this first strand,

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.760
and then I'm going to go under,

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.240
over,

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.580
under,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:35.920
over,

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:37.160
under,

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.060
over and I'm just going to
kind of lay it over here.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.400
I'm gonna take this one.
I'm gonna go under,

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.080
over.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.500
&gt;&gt; So that second one is just
the opposite of what the first one was.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:48.060
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.440
I'm gonna take this last strand.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:56.120
This is the strain that was all the way
to the right side, the smallest strand.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.160
I'm going to take it, wrap it around,

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:03.560
and then under.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.620
So this under over under over
pattern is called Diamond plait.

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:12.940
[Music]

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.280
&gt;&gt; Right now, at this point,

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.480
it looks like we've got pretty
much the whole handle done,

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.640
and you said that's about
8 inches worth of handle.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.280
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.040
So for on the handle,
we did a diamond plait,

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.940
which was an under one, over one,
under one, over one, under one, over one.

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.780
And if we did that for
the entire length of the whip,

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.100
we would be here for 10 years

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:31.280
and it would be a lot of work,
and it wouldn't be worth it.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.060
So what we're going to do is we're
going to transfer from a diamond plait

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:35.560
to what's called a herringbone plait.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.420
So we're going to take, we're gonna go
under these first three strands,

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:41.100
and then over the next three strands,

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.640
and we're going to continue
that pattern down the thong.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:49.420
[Music]

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.440
Okay, so as we go down
the length of the whip,

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.220
we actually have to drop strands.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:56.660
two strands that are shorter than the rest

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.080
be taken away from the size
where I'm plaiting,

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.990
and just gonna go straight into the core.

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:04.640
So they're just going to be plaited
around as if they are part of the core.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.820
Now, I'm going to cut these off but I don't
want them to be just like an immediate stair-step

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.140
because I want to have
a nice smooth taper.

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:15.940
So to get the best taper possible,
I'm going to cut these at kind of long angles.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:27.080
[Music]

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.240
Now that we finished the--
all the braiding of the overlay,

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.420
we need to add the fall.

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:35.540
To make the fall,
we've cut about four feet of paracord.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.920
It's not going to be an exact science,

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.540
and we are going to make a tapered fall,

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.080
so it's going to have
a little bit of a tapered twist

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.600
that gets thinner and thinner and thinner

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.460
until it becomes just one strand,

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:48.900
until we get to where
the cracker starts.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:52.300
So the paracord has this inner guts to it.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.220
I'm just gonna pull this
down as much as possible.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.060
We're removing the guts from both ends

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.840
because the middle is
where it's going to attach,

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.940
and then it's going to be
twisted up to a certain point.

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:05.300
They're not lining up.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.660
Again, everything with the whip
wants to be tapered. On one side,

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.740
the guts are ending here,
on the other side they're ending here.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:13.760
So we get smaller and then smaller again,

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.000
just because we always like to
go in increments all the way down.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.760
&gt;&gt; The way we're going to twist this...

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:23.280
We're going to twist each
strand in the same direction,

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.700
and let's begin twisting
it around each other.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.940
What we're going to do now is thread
one of these strands into the other strand

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:34.020
so it becomes one slightly thicker strand.

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:37.420
And this lacing needle has
little threads on the inside of it

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.020
that we can thread onto this paracord,

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.500
and it will hold on to it tight.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.600
So I'm going to take this strand that's
been threaded into our lacing needle.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.960
I'm just going to thread it straight into...

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.360
&gt;&gt; Stabbing through
the side of the paracord.

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:53.640
&gt;&gt; That's just gonna go right in.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.480
So now, I'm just going to
run my finger along here

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.500
so that we get the exact same length

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.560
of each strand of paracord.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.600
Then we're going to snip it off.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.800
And I'm going to keep my finger
on here so they don't move.

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:13.920
And I'm going to fuse the inner
and the outer strand together

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:22.160
[Music]

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.720
&gt;&gt; This is the last time we roll it, right?

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.260
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:25.060
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:29.700
[Music]

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:30.890
This whip is looking really sweet

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:35.500
but it doesn't have the iconic
handle decoration bits on it.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:36.900
What are we going to do about that?

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.900
&gt;&gt; We're going to be adding
a heel knot in a transition knot.

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.480
For the heel knot, we're going to build up 
a foundation using some scrap leather,

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.200
and we're going to tack that on
with some nails and artificial sinew.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.620
&gt;&gt; Now, we're adding
a second piece of leather,

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.670
which is going to be kind of cross-shaped.

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:52.420
And we're going to put that over the end of it.

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:57.540
[Music]

00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:59.660
&gt;&gt; Okay. Now we have
our heel knot foundation done.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.680
Now we're going to make
a foundation for our transition knot.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:07.600
[Music]

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.680
Okay. Now, we have our foundations done.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.760
Now we're going to go and tie the knots on.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:23.060
[Music]

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:23.740
There we go.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.580
We've got the knots added onto the handle.

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:27.440
We added a cracker onto the end of it

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.100
that's going to make it so
we can make that popping noise

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.440
we love so much.

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.220
I think we need to give this thing a test.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:35.100
&gt;&gt; Let's go.
&gt;&gt; Let's head outside.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.280
&gt;&gt; Let's get cracking.

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:42.440
&gt;&gt; We have come outside and
it is time to finally test this whip.

00:15:42.440 --> 00:16:12.180
[Music]

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.540
There you go. A fully
functional kangaroo hide whip.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.020
Garrett, thank you so much for
teaching us how to make these today.

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:18.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah. No problem.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.180
I had an awesome time doing it with you.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.234
&gt;&gt; Overall, I think this took
about 12 hours of work to do,

00:16:23.234 --> 00:16:25.720
and we could probably do
it a little bit faster than that

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.380
if we weren't filming at the same time.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.640
That always slows things down
but I would say that's a good estimation

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.240
for how much time it would
take for your first time through.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.040
Garrett, if people are interested
in learning more about whip making,

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.080
what do you suggest?

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.860
&gt;&gt; There were two books that
I actually thought were super useful

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.120
when I was kind of learning
how to make leather whips.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.460
The first was "How to Make Whips"
by Ron Edwards.

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:46.180
Another book that I thought
was really useful was

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.420
"Whips and Whipmaking"
by David Morgan.

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:51.940
and it just gives you a lot of general
knowledge about just whips in general,

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:54.220
all kinds of whips and
it was really really useful.

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.520
If you're interested there links
in the description below of

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.240
where you can get your
hands on those books.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.740
Guys, that's not all,
we've got more for you to see.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.880
That box up at the top will
transport you to our last video,

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.000
where we showed you how to make
the strand cutter that we used a lot today.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.760
The box at the bottom will
show you what YouTube thinks

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.920
you need to be watching next,

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.040
and this bomb in the middle
will subscribe you to the channel,

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.440
so you never miss a video.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.480
Don't forget to ring that bell
and we'll see you in the next one.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:16.380
Talk to you then.
