00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now, I imagine you might have suspected that this was the best answer.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Look at the geometry of a sphere and find a clever way to calculate this circumference.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Now, you may have been tempted by this one,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but, well, yes in science it is generally good to take a lot of data.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
That's a great habit to be in.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
But if every single piece of data you're taking is just a wild guess with no real reason to believe it,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
this isn't going to help.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
This one's a little impractical--wrapping a string around the earth--

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and there's no reason to believe the moon and the earth have the same circumference,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
not to mention, how do we calculate the circumference of the moon?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This leaves geometry, which means this is a job for math.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Let's go to Florence to learn a little more about Eratosthenes' approach to

00:00:45.000 --> 99:59:59.000
to measuring the circumference of the earth.
