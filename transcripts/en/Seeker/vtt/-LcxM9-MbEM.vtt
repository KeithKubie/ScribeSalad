00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:09.990
In 1850, if I were all like, "Good morrow
friends, 100 years hence, we shall climb into

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.520
a contraption taller than that nearby six-story
skyscraper and within it travel, TO THE MOOON."

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:26.240
People be like, "You crazy."

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.650
Rocketry is crazy.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:28.789
It is!

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:29.789
Just admit it!

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.829
It's a painstakingly scrutinized scientific
endeavor akin to Wil E. Coyote jumping in

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.039
a barrel sitting atop of dynamite.

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:41.670
Rocketry is the idea that we can take a missile
and control it all the way to space… which

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.289
is insane in itself, but you have to ask yourself,
what kind of CRAZY things can we DO once we

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.739
get OUT there?!

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.600
And when I looked into it, space scientists
did not disappoint.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.280
Saturn is a crazy place.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.789
There's a weird hexagon swirling at it's North
Pole, not to mention it's got rings or something.

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.260
But it's moon, Titan, has space scientists
really excited.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.830
Titan is one of the closest Earth-like planets
we can study; NASA describes it as a frozen

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.640
version of Earth -- only… not.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.980
Titan has a chemical rich atmosphere, and
the surface is Earth-LIKE, with oceans, rivers,

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.600
mountains and even rain!

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.110
The thing is, the lakes and rivers and rain
aren't water -- they're ethane and methane.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.780
This planet is so similar yet so alien, and
so familiar that scientists believe they can

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.200
send a probe equipped with a submarine.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.160
A SUBMARINE.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.460
The plan, unveiled earlier this month and
penned for 2040, is to use a submarine powered

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.750
by radioactive pellets (like Curiosity on
Mars) to dive below the methane seas and explore

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.950
the ocean, called Kraken Mare.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.810
It's just a study and concept, but if they
did it.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.810
Wowza.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.060
The Kraken Mare hovers around 90 Kelvin (-298
F/-183C), and because of the density of liquid

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.850
methane, nitrogen would have to be used for
ballast.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.260
Not to mention the Mare itself has choppy
waves and tides.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.800
This is some old school stuff, but not the
old schoolest.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.110
How do you feel about dirigibles?

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.930
If you saw our old video on them you know
how I feel.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.420
I think they're fantastic!

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.910
Another crazy idea from NASA, is HAVOC -- the
High Altitude Venus Operational Concept -- alleviates

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.470
all that.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.700
50 kilometers above the surface of Venus,
the temperature is around 75 celsius (167F)

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.020
and gravity is similar to Earth, and daily
radiation exposure on Venus is similar to

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.350
Canada, whereas Mars' exposure is 40 percent
more than Earth average.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.700
So why not live there??

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.212
The plan is to send robots and then humans
who can permanently live above Venus in a

00:02:35.212 --> 00:02:38.959
helium-filled solar-powered airship twice
the size of a 747.

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.450
Venus is ideal for human explorations as its
closer to Earth than Mars, but it's not as

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.060
popular for exploration maybe because the
combination of dense crushing atmosphere,

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.970
heat and sulfuric acid rain… but what do
I know.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.450
And just to toss a wrench in the cool and
crazy, but actually possible tone of this

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.450
episode.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.450
I bring you the Daedelus.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.440
In the 70s, the British Interplanetary Society
wanted to create a craft that could study

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.500
the Fermi paradox -- or the idea that there
are suns billions of years older than ours,

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.300
likely with Earthlike planets, so where the
life at?!

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.750
They've had billions of years to colonize,
so why ain't they?

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.770
The Daedalus is a deuterium and helium-3 fusion-powered
spaceship that is just MASSIVE.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.670
The concept weighed 450 tons, and would have
been able to travel 12 percent the speed of

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.090
light after 46 years of acceleration.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.240
It wouldn't be able to slow down, of course…

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:40.410
So… it's not exactly useful for data collection,
human transport, or exploration.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.940
Not to mention the cost to build, or the crazy
engineering involved.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.819
Daedalus was an engineering proof-of-concept.

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.720
The scientists wanted to prove interstellar
travel WAS possible, assuming we could build

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.130
these crazy things.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.440
Today, the 100 Year Starship Project, while
crazy, probably has a better grasp on reality

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.440
these days.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.440
Disco.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.440
Daedalus.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.440
Man, the 70s was a crazy time.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:13.010
Have you heard about crazy space explorations?
