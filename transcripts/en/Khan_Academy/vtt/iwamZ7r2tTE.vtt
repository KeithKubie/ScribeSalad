00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.440
We're on problem 221.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.660
And let's see, they have--
is all of that in the

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:08.880
denominator?

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.975
Well, I guess it is.

00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:12.850
Let's see, they wrote 1 over--
and I'll write it the

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:13.630
way they did it.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.470
1 over-- and they have this--
you know, I think

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.650
it's got to be 1 plus.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.020
I think it's 1 plus.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.030
The way they wrote
it is weird.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:30.890
1 plus 1 over 1 plus 1/3.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.160
This looks a lot like another
problem that we did.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.060
But anyway, I'll do this one.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.330
So let's see.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:42.740
If we do 1 plus 1/3, that's 3/3,
plus 1/3, so that's 4/3.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:49.570
So then that turns into 4/3,
1, 1 plus, 1 over that, and

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.350
then you have 1 plus that.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.710
And so then this equals
1 plus 1 over 1 plus--

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.880
what's 1 over 4/3?

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.440
Well, that's the same thing as--
1 divided by 4/3 is the

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.400
the same thing as 1 times 3/4,
and that's equal to 3/4.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.340
And what's 1 plus 3/4?

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.050
Well, that's 4/4 plus
3/4, right?

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.000
4/4 plus-- so that's 7/4.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.340
So then that becomes 1 plus 1
over 7/4, which is equal to 1

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:30.580
plus 4/7, and that equals 7/7
plus 4/7 is equal to 11/7.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.720
And that's choice D.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.800
The way they wrote
it was weird.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.960
They wrote it like this,
1 plus down here.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.860
But I assume that this is
what they wanted, what I

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.250
originally had done.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.650
Problem 222.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.580
In the rectangular coordinate
system above--

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.720
well, let me draw it.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.340
That's the y-axis, that's
the x-axis.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.940
y, x.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.050
And they have a point out here
called point p, and they say

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.060
that's at 4. x equals
4, y equals 0.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.940
In the rectangular coordinate
system above, if point r, not

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.060
shown, lies on the positive
y-axis, so it lies someplace

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.700
over here, and the area of
triangle orp , so this is

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.300
point o, and r is going to be
some place on this, is 12,

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.990
what is the coordinate
of the point r?

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.360
So the coordinate of the point
r, let's just call it-- well,

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.070
the x-value is going
to be 0, right?

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.500
And this y-value, I don't
know, let's call it x.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.850
No, let's call it y.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.550
That's a better variable
name for the y-value.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.650
So they essentially want to
know what the area of this

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.120
triangle right here is.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.405
Or actually, they want to know
what y is, given that the area

00:02:48.405 --> 00:02:51.000
of that triangle, they
tell us, is 12.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.610
The area of this
triangle is 12.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:53.660
So what's the area
of this triangle?

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.010
It's the base times the
height times 1/2.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.110
The base is 4, right?

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.300
This is x is equal to 4.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.850
So it's 4 times the height.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.100
Well, the height is going
to be y, right?

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.980
Because the coordinate
of r is 0 comma y.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.780
So 4 times y times 1/2-- if you
don't do the 1/2, you're

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.570
getting the area of the whole
rectangle-- is equal to the

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.570
area of the triangle
is equal to 12.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.010
So you get 2y is equal to 12.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.620
y is equal to 6.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.590
So the coordinate of
r is 0 comma 6.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.010
And that is choice-- oh, they
just ask what is the

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.230
y-coordinate of point r.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.400
So that's 6, and that's
choice B.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.000
Problem 223.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.200
Car A is 20 miles
behind car B.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.170
So let me see if I
can draw that.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.540
So this is A, this is B-- and
it's 20 miles behind it; I

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.500
don't know if that's relevant--
which is traveling

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.320
in the same direction along
the same route as car A.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.130
Car A is traveling at a constant
speed of 58 miles per

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.830
hour, so car A is at 58 miles
per hour, and car B is

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.840
traveling at a constant speed
of 50 miles per hour.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.720
Fair enough.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.140
How many hours will it take
for car A to overtake and

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.660
drive 8 miles ahead of car B?

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.760
So they don't want just
car A to catch up.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.650
They want car A to catch up and
go ahead 8 miles, right?

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.530
And drive 8 miles ahead.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.800
So another way to think about
it is how long will it take

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.890
for car A to go 28 miles
further than car B?

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.900
And the easiest way to think
about it is just what their

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.000
differential is, right?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.070
Car A is going 8 miles an
hour faster than car B.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.360
So the relative velocity
of A relative to B

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.440
is 8 miles an hour.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.280
And you could say that, well,
I don't want to use fancy

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.210
notation, but car A, if you're
sitting in car B and you

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.310
looked at car A, you'd say,
oh, it's going in my same

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.580
direction, but I'm stationary
and it's going

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.160
at 8 miles per hour.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.860
So the question essentially says
if I'm going at 8 miles

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.820
per hour, how long does it take
to go 28 miles, right?

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.230
Because I have to catch up to
20 miles with B, and then I

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.610
have to go 8 more miles.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.260
You could just pretend like you
are in car B and you think

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.430
that you are stationary.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.140
You ignore the fact that the
world is speeding behind you.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.860
And you just see car A.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.910
You say, oh, car A must be
moving at 8 miles an hour in

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.220
the direction in which
my car is pointed.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.650
So, anyway, if you have to go 28
miles, and you're going at

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.190
8 miles per hour, distance
divided by

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.790
rate is equal to time.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:50.490
That's equal to 3 and 1/2 hours,
which is choice E.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:57.400
Next question, 224.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.690
For the past n days, the average
daily production at a

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:12.050
company was 50 units, so for n
days, 50 unit per day average,

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:17.480
if today's production of 90
units, so we have 90 units,

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.850
and that raises the average to
55 units per day, what was the

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.380
value of n?

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:30.830
OK, so the old average would
have been n times 50-- and

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.560
this is kind of obvious
-- divided by n is

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.280
equal to 50, right?

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.200
Now, if I want to average in
this 55, what happens is I get

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:48.110
to n times 50, right?

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.570
That's the sum of the n days
before, the sum of the total

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:53.820
production for the
n days before.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.330
And what I want to do is I want
to have the production

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:01.250
for today, and that is 90, plus
90, and now I'm going to

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.770
divide by n plus
1 days, right?

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:10.620
And now the average is 55.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.290
So we just have to
solve this for n.

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.305
So let's see what we can do.

00:07:14.305 --> 00:07:16.500
I'll do it in a different
color.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:22.670
We get 50n plus 90 is equal to--
multiply both sides by n

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:29.310
plus 1-- 55n plus 55.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:32.080
So let's subtract 50n
from both sides.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:38.020
You get 90 is equal
to 5n plus 55.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:45.930
Subtract 55 from both sides, 55
to 35 is equal to 5n, n is

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:47.840
equal to 7.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.290
And that's choice E.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:57.360
Problem 225.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:05.700
OK, They write x plus 1 over
x minus 1 squared.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:11.510
And they say if x does not equal
0 and x does not equal

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.470
1-- and that's good, because
if x equaled 1, we'd be

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:19.190
dividing by 0 here-- and if x is
replaced by 1/x everywhere

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:22.970
in the expression above-- so
x is replaced with 1/x

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.590
everywhere in the expression
above-- then the resulting

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:29.370
expression is equivalent
to-- I don't know,

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:31.210
let's just do it.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:36.850
So if we get 1/x-- we're just
replacing x with 1/x-- plus 1

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:44.630
over 1/x minus 1 quantity
squared, and that

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:46.510
equals -- let's see.

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:50.900
This is the same thing as
1/x plus x/x, right?

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.740
1 is the same thing as x/x, And
this 1 is the same thing

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.380
as x/x, right?

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.820
That's an x/x.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:05.820
So then this equals 1 plus
x/x over 1 minus

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:10.510
x/x, everything squared.

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:13.050
And this inside of the brackets,
that's the same

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:17.805
thing as 1 plus x/x-- instead
of being divided by this, we

00:09:17.805 --> 00:09:21.900
could multiply by the
reciprocal-- times x

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.730
over 1 minus x.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.740
I just reciprocated this
and multiplied.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:30.050
And this is all still
in the squared .

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:34.560
Now these x's cancel out, and lo
and behold, we get 1 plus x

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:45.600
over 1 minus x squared, which
is the same thing as x plus

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:52.790
1-- well, let's think
about it. x plus 1

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:57.070
over 1 minus x squared.

00:09:57.070 --> 00:10:01.340
And see, that's not one
of the choices, right?

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.480
But let's think about it.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.430
1 minus x, that's the
same thing as-- just

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.020
let me rewrite it.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:13.120
This is the same thing as x plus
1 divided by-- now this 1

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.220
minus x is the same
thing as x minus 1

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.110
times negative 1, right?

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.800
And we're going to square
all of this.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:28.340
Well, this over here, this is
the same thing as x plus 1

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:34.480
over x minus 1 squared
times 1 over

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.820
negative 1 squared, right?

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:40.550
If you take the square of a
product, you could-- this is

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:44.910
the same thing as that times
1 over negative 1.

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:47.450
So that turns into this, and
this, obviously if I'm

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.200
squaring another number,
this just becomes 1.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.450
So I'm left with x plus 1
over x minus 1 squared.

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:55.310
And that's exactly what we
started off with, and

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.060
that's choice A.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.890
And that's the trick, to realize
that this is just a

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:02.100
negative of minus 1.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.665
And you can take a negative 1
out, but we're going to square

00:11:03.665 --> 00:11:07.010
it anyway, so it's going to
turn it back positive.

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:10.330
Next question.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.350
In choice E, actually, in that
one, they tempt you by taking

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:13.930
the negative outside, but you
can't take the negative

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:15.060
outside the square.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.630
You're squaring it, so the
negative will disappear.

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:19.000
Anyway, problem 200.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:19.870
Oh, I'm all out of time.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:21.750
See you in the next video.
