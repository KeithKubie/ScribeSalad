00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.180
Let's begin working on the final project. Now, there is

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.380
a link in the instructor notes that describes the final project

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.200
in detail and if you go through it, you will realize

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.930
that there are three main steps in accomplishing the final project.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.378
The first thing you have to do is come up with

00:00:15.378 --> 00:00:18.905
an idea or a problem statement for your project. Here, you

00:00:18.905 --> 00:00:22.087
can choose to enhance any one of the projects that we

00:00:22.087 --> 00:00:25.343
built in class together or you can choose to work with

00:00:25.343 --> 00:00:28.451
any one of the modules, or external packages that

00:00:28.451 --> 00:00:31.707
are available within Python,or you can come up with

00:00:31.707 --> 00:00:35.282
an original idea for the project, yourself. The second

00:00:35.282 --> 00:00:38.355
step is for you to create a solution design.

00:00:38.355 --> 00:00:41.930
Now,here you will identify all of the steps that

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.100
will take you to create the final projects. These

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.500
steps can be in plain and simple English for

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.520
now. The final step is for you to begin

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.780
programming, so you can realize your project.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.740
By the way, all of these instructions that

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.140
I am giving here are also available

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.410
in the project description document, which is in

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.740
the instructor notes,so I invite you to

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.099
go to that document now, please make sure

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:07.140
you check this box, to let us

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.930
know that you've read through the project description.
