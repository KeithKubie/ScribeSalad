there is a lot of water on Mars and

there is a lot of water on Mars and
 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.919
there is a lot of water on Mars and
there once was a lot of surface flowing

water you don't you don't see it because

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679
water you don't you don't see it because
 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.070
water you don't you don't see it because
it's most of it is mixed with the soil

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080
it's most of it is mixed with the soil
 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.550
it's most of it is mixed with the soil
which we call regolith on Mars so the

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560
which we call regolith on Mars so the
 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.890
which we call regolith on Mars so the
Martian soil can be anywhere from as

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900
Martian soil can be anywhere from as
 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.920
Martian soil can be anywhere from as
little as 1% in some very dry desert II

strategy for getting water when you're

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560
strategy for getting water when you're
 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.069
strategy for getting water when you're
on Mars is to break up the regolith

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079
on Mars is to break up the regolith
 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.270
on Mars is to break up the regolith
which would take something like a

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280
which would take something like a
 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.700
which would take something like a
jackhammer because it's very cold it's

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710
jackhammer because it's very cold it's
 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.240
jackhammer because it's very cold it's
very frozen if you can imagine making a

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250
very frozen if you can imagine making a
 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.750

frozen brick or a chunk of ice that's

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760
frozen brick or a chunk of ice that's
 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.299

mostly soil and maybe half water and a
 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.650
mostly soil and maybe half water and a
half soil that's what you would be

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660
half soil that's what you would be
 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.930
half soil that's what you would be
