00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.740
Horror movies terrorize viewers with tales
of ghosts, monsters, and sometimes a goblin

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.180
or two, but films don�t necessarily have
to have one of those elements in order to

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.160
be scary. Throughout history, there have been
plenty of examples of filmmakers using real-life

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.290
fears to create premises in a movie that are
as frightening as your average paranormal

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:29.110
pest. Here are Screen Rant�s 5 Terrifying
Real-Life Scenarios in Movies

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.890
Apollo 13

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.250
Many kids dream of becoming an astronaut one
day, but one viewing of Apollo 13 might be

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.390
all its takes to turn those dreams into nightmares.
The film is based on the true story of the

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.300
NASA�s Apollo 13 mission. It depicts the
darker side of the profession, as three astronauts

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.310
are left floating in space in a broken module.
Among the many obstacles they face are freezing

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.870
temperatures, rising carbon dioxide levels,
and malfunctioning systems � all of which

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.789
could prove fatal. Even though NASA is aware
of the situation, that doesn�t exactly make

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.850
it bearable, since the worst could happen
at any given moment. Jim Lovell and his crew

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.340
displayed true bravery and courage by never
folding under the immense pressure and finding

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.250
a way to return home safely. Meanwhile, we
were happy to be on solid ground.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.560
127 Hours

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.369
Before setting off on a weekend excursion
to the mountain, Aron Ralston doesn�t bother

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.100
to tell anyone where he�s heading. That
lapse in judgment comes back to haunt him.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.380
Ralston has an accident and gets his arm trapped
under a boulder for a period of 5 days. Director

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.440
Danny Boyle�s shot selection is unnerving
because it illustrates Ralston�s loneliness

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.640
as he endures a slow march, seemingly to his
death.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:45.660
The video messages he records for his loved
ones are especially gut wrenching, and the

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.310
infamous �cutting off the arm� sequence
is a gruesome scene to watch. Seeing this

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.380
movie may encourage you to become a homebody
� and who could blame you�

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.380
Cast Away

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.450
We�ve all fantasized about having our own
desert island, but Chuck Noland would recommend

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.140
you to rethink that. After surviving a plane
crash (which is scary enough), he spends four

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.360
years on an isolated piece of land with almost
no hope of reaching the outside world. Despite

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.090
the company of his faithful companion Wilson,
Chuck is very much alone (a concept that taps

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.050
into one of our basic emotional fears). He
deals with scorching heat, fierce rainstorms,

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.060
and unbearable hunger; he�s even driven
to attempt suicide. As fascinating as it is

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.440
to watch Tom Hanks work his magic, there�s
no denying that this is one horrifying experience

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.230
for anyone to consider.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.230
The Grey

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.100
Forget the marketing lie that promised us
Liam Neeson vs. wolves. The Grey is still

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.670
a solid work of horror. First and foremost
it�s a �man vs. nature� piece, since

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.630
the greatest enemy Ottway and his crew must
face are freezing temperatures in the harsh

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.400
Alaskan wilderness. That�s not to say that
territorial wolves are easy to deal with.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.190
They presented their own challenges as the
group struggled to survive, trying to hunt

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.700
them down whenever they got a chance. Director
Joe Carnahan gave audiences some really tense

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.820
and nail-biting sequences that illustrated
the relentlessness of the environment and

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.950
how there was so little humans could do against
it.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:05.950
Prisoners

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.900
The greatest fear of any parent is having
their child mysteriously go missing, so Prisoners

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.630
is nightmare fuel for anyone with a kid. The
film is so effective because even those without

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.431
any offspring can instantly feel sympathetic
for the characters. As Keller Dover, Hugh

00:03:20.431 --> 00:03:31.910
Jackman portrayed a man consumed by helplessness
and grief. He�s driven to the point of insanity

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.860
struggling to find information about where
his daughter went off to. For anyone trying

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.970
to see themselves in the protagonist, Prisoners
asks a horrifying version of the question

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.170
�what would you do?� and forces us to
consider some shocking answers.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.920
Those are our picks for the most terrifying
real-life scenarios in movies. There any we

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.940
