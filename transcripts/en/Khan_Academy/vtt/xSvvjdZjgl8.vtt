00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.230
- [Instructor] Jerry was reading

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.930
about a study that
looked at the connection

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.380
between smartphone usage
and happiness based on data

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.120
from approximately 5,000
randomly selected teenagers.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.781
The study found that on average

00:00:11.781 --> 00:00:15.060
the teens who spent
more time on smartphones

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.970
were significantly less happy

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.723
than those who spent
less time on smartphones.

00:00:19.723 --> 00:00:21.722
Jerry concluded that spending more time

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:26.050
on smartphones makes teens less happy.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.330
All right this is interesting.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.000
So what I want you to do is think

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.860
about whether Jerry is making
a valid conclusion or not.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.667
And why or why don't you think

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:36.823
he's making a valid conclusion?

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.360
All right now let's work on this together.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.210
This is really important to understand

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.060
because you will see things like this

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.803
in the popular media all the time

00:00:45.803 --> 00:00:49.150
that try to establish a causality

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.310
when there might not be causality.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.080
Or at least where the study might

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.460
not be able to show causality.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.048
So right now Jerry is
saying he's concluding

00:00:58.048 --> 00:01:02.778
that smartphone usage, smartphone usage

00:01:02.778 --> 00:01:05.310
makes teens less happy, so he's

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.910
assuming there's a causal connection.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.055
Smartphone usage causes
teens to be less happy.

00:01:11.055 --> 00:01:15.009
Less happy, can he actually
make that conclusion

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.865
from this study based
on how it was designed?

00:01:17.865 --> 00:01:19.477
Well the first thing to ask ourselves

00:01:19.477 --> 00:01:21.430
is is this an experimental study

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.290
that is designed to establish causality

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.443
or is it an observational study

00:01:26.443 --> 00:01:29.600
where we really can just
say there's an association

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.059
but we really can't make a
statement about causality?

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:34.797
Well in experimental
study he would have had

00:01:34.797 --> 00:01:37.770
to have a control group
and then a treatment group

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.620
sometimes called a experimental group.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.010
So I'll say that's control group,

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.140
that's the treatment or
the experimental group.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.380
And then you randomly assign folks

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.583
to one of those two groups and then

00:01:46.583 --> 00:01:49.790
you would make that treatment group

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.560
use a cell phone more and
see if they are less happy.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.290
That's not what happened here.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.854
What happened here was
an observational study.

00:01:56.854 --> 00:02:01.183
In this study we are
looking at two variables.

00:02:01.183 --> 00:02:06.183
So you have your smartphone usage

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.025
and then you have the teen happiness.

00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:14.370
And they took these 5,000
randomly selected teenagers

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.405
and they figured out
their smartphone usage

00:02:16.405 --> 00:02:19.110
and their happiness, maybe
with a survey of some kind.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.080
And then you could plot those data points.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.976
You would have 5,000 data points.

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:25.100
So this data point right over here

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.520
would be a very happy teenager

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.240
that doesn't use a smartphone much.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.910
This would be a not so happy teenager

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.339
that uses a smartphone a lot.

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:33.847
And so you would plot those data points

00:02:33.847 --> 00:02:36.230
and there might be a teenager

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.260
who's unhappy and doesn't use a smartphone

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.834
or one that is happy and
that uses a smartphone a lot.

00:02:40.834 --> 00:02:42.504
But you can see there's a trend,

00:02:42.504 --> 00:02:44.503
there's an association that in general

00:02:44.503 --> 00:02:48.437
the teenagers who use the smartphones more

00:02:48.437 --> 00:02:50.492
seem to be less happy and the teenagers

00:02:50.492 --> 00:02:54.400
who use the smartphones
less seem to be more happy.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.860
But it's important to realize

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.892
that the causality could
go the other way around.

00:02:57.892 --> 00:03:02.892
Maybe less happy teenagers
use their smartphones more

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.950
and maybe more happy teenagers

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.990
don't find a need to use a smartphone.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.790
Or there could be some variable

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.740
that's not even being
observed in this study

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.834
that has a causal relationship
with both of these.

00:03:14.834 --> 00:03:16.753
So there could be some other variable

00:03:16.753 --> 00:03:19.933
that might cause someone to be less happy

00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:22.081
and use their smartphone more.

00:03:22.081 --> 00:03:24.631
So in an observational
study, you can really

00:03:24.631 --> 00:03:26.682
just say there is an association.

00:03:26.682 --> 00:03:30.050
You wouldn't be able to say
that there is causality.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.728
So Jerry is not making a valid conclusion,

00:03:31.728 --> 00:03:34.703
it's an observational study, we've only

00:03:34.703 --> 00:03:38.553
established an association not causality.
