PAUL: Welcome to this session
on Performance Culture.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.710
I am Paul, on the left there.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.110
I work on Google's
Developer Relations team

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.790
where I spend my time looking
at performance, design, and UX

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.725
and normally where the
three of those meet.

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:18.370
LARA: And I am Lara Swanson.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.090
I work at Etsy and I'm
the Engineering Manager

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.530
for the Performance team.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.220
We help all of the
feature teams who

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.574
are building products or
features or experiments,

00:00:26.574 --> 00:00:28.240
make sure that whatever
they're shipping

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.740
is as fast as humanly possible.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.390
PAUL: Alright so, I guess the
opening question is, why are we

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.790
even talking about
performance cultures?

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.570
Why does this
session even exist?

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.440
And I think to
answer that we need

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.300
to understand a little bit
about where our industry is

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.500
and what we are seeing and
where we think it's going to go.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.630
And it's really about this.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.330
The multi-device web.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.900
We've seen more devices
than ever before come online

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.510
and I think really the
one that stands out

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.590
for me the most is this one.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.620
It's the smartphone.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.540
It represents the most
performance constrained device

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.757
that we have.

00:01:03.757 --> 00:01:05.590
Whether that is in terms
of the screen size,

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.230
or the GPU, the CPU, or its
connection to the network.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.000
And the thing is more and more
people are using smartphones.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.740
In fact, one study suggests
that just over a third

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.970
of American adults
use their smartphone

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.310
as the primary means of
accessing the internet.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.140
Which means for those people
their first experience

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.320
of you, your site,
your brand is going

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.890
to be through their smartphone.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.760
And that is something that we
need to be thinking through.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.310
In fact, it's not just in the
States it's also globally.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.560
So, here we have the percentage
of total global internet

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.310
traffic according
to Stat Counter

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.150
and you can see that the
trend is pretty clear upwards.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.675
And it looks I think sort
of the middle of next year,

00:01:46.675 --> 00:01:48.300
if the trend line is
correct, that well

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.020
cross that 50% marker.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.690
So the thing about this is--

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.940
LARA: Mobile networks can add
a tremendous amount of latency.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.535
So, before a mobile device
can transmit or receive data

00:01:59.535 --> 00:02:02.470
it has to establish a radio
channel with the network.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.470
And this can take several
seconds over a 3G connection.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.370
After the device
talks to a radio tower

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.580
to negotiate when it
can transmit data,

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.030
the network carrier then
must transmit that data

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.070
to its internal network, and
then to the public internet.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.550
So, the combination
of these steps

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.970
can add up to tens of
thousands of milliseconds

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.360
of extra latency.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.330
So, the most
important question I

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.570
hear when I say this
is, well what about 4G?

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.010
4G is awesome right?

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.610
Our networks are improving.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.330
But you have to remember the
new device and fast network

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.090
with an excellent connection
that you have in your pocket

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.580
right now is not a good
representation of what your end

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.680
users are really experiencing.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.980
So, while it's true that
networks are getting better

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.950
you need to remember
that your users are

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.350
on a variety of connections,
with various levels

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.820
of connectivity, and latency.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.000
It's also important to remember
that if you're a site is slow

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.650
people will go elsewhere.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.390
In fact, one study suggests
that as many as 40% of people

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.320
will leave a site when it
takes longer than three seconds

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.220
to load.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.537
So, we have some options.

00:03:10.537 --> 00:03:12.370
In the face of the stuff
that's a little bit

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.676
scary what can we do about it?

00:03:15.676 --> 00:03:17.050
The first option
is to ignore it.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.970
You can certainly say,
you know what we just

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.160
saw those awesome stats.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.131
We say that we're
actually-- we're trying,

00:03:23.131 --> 00:03:24.755
but we don't think
it's that important.

00:03:24.755 --> 00:03:26.170
Maybe mobile isn't the future,
maybe that trend line is going

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.827
to lie to us, maybe networks
will be better immediately,

00:03:28.827 --> 00:03:30.160
I don't think that this is true.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.840
PAUL: No, I tend to think-- no.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.910
LARA: I think that we
can't just ignore it.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:35.860
PAUL: I'd like to.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.443
LARA: Yeah, it'd be
really cool, but I

00:03:37.443 --> 00:03:40.585
think the other option is
to assign performance cops.

00:03:40.585 --> 00:03:41.290
Right?

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.850
Who in here would identified
as a performance cop or janitor

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:44.675
within their organization?

00:03:44.675 --> 00:03:46.115
PAUL: Anybody ever
been one of those?

00:03:46.115 --> 00:03:47.956
LARA: Yeah, somebody who
comes in afterwards cleans up.

00:03:47.956 --> 00:03:49.039
PAUL: Look at these hands.

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:52.670
Look at this. [DEEP VOICE]
Yes that's me, I don't know.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.430
LARA: So, performance
cops, right?

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.976
We come in and we say, hey
designer, hey developer here's

00:03:57.976 --> 00:03:59.350
some better ways
you can do this.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.896
You come in cleaning
up after people,

00:04:00.896 --> 00:04:02.270
you try to make
your site better,

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.430
but the responsibility
solely rests on you.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.340
And this can often lead to a
tremendous amount of burnout

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.816
and frankly, it's
not sustainable.

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:11.690
There's always going to
be new people joining

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.590
your organization, your site
will continue to get slower,

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.310
it'll continue to
be iterated upon,

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.884
the hardware age,
being a performance cop

00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:21.279
is not a sustainable
thing, so that's

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.940
why we're here to talk about
building performance cultures.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.676
PAUL: Wow, I wonder which one
we'll choose from that list?

00:04:26.676 --> 00:04:27.470
[LAUGH]

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.890
PAUL: So, we're all set to build
a performance culture, super.

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.415
But we have to ask
the question what

00:04:33.415 --> 00:04:35.540
do we even mean by a culture.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.002
Well I guess you could come
up with your own definitions

00:04:38.002 --> 00:04:39.960
goodness knows there's
probably a bunch of them

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.720
that you could think
up, but for us today,

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.060
at least in this conversation,
here's the things

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.780
that we actually have in mind.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.490
Firstly, it's a way of saying,
I belong to this group,

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.660
I get them, hopefully
they get me,

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.590
I understand this
particular group.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.180
So, for example being
British, I would

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.535
identify with British culture.

00:04:57.535 --> 00:04:58.410
LARA: You're British?

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.785
I know right it's a relief
for anybody in the room going,

00:05:00.785 --> 00:05:01.500
where is he from?

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.083
His American accent
is really strange.

00:05:03.083 --> 00:05:04.499
LARA: [LAUGH]

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:05.040
Yeah, I know.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.470
So, it's that first and
foremost is just saying,

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.200
yep this is my kind of people.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.590
It's also about how
you think and how

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.650
you reason and rationalize
the world around you

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.150
and the kind of
social cues that you

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.450
look for or the slightly strange
obsession with green liquids

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.580
you may or may
not have, but it's

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.130
that sense of the
world around you.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.410
It's also how you do things.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.340
Whether that's the
side of the road

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.670
you drive on maybe the
wrong side, the words

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.815
that you use for
things or perhaps

00:05:41.815 --> 00:05:44.790
in our case how we go
about crafting the code.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.370
And then lastly, it's
how you celebrate things,

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.270
the things that are
important to you,

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.980
the things that you
celebrate and how

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.880
you go about celebrating it
is unique to your culture.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.670
And we see cultures
at the highest level

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.910
internationally, nationally,
all the way down to our homes

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.040
and so forth, and actually
of course, our workplaces,

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.290
which brings us back to that
whole performance culture

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.814
thing.

00:06:07.814 --> 00:06:09.230
LARA: Yeah, we
were joking when we

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.800
were talking about earlier
that performance cultures are

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.650
kind of a team sport.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.520
It's important to remember
that everybody has to play.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.140
And as you say about sports
there is no "I" in performance.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.170
PAUL: That is true, but if
you're willing to look hard

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.610
enough you'll find there
is "prance-for-me".

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.170
You can stop the slide now.

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:32.128
LARA: Alright, alright.

00:06:32.128 --> 00:06:33.460
So, thank you for that.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.280
So, culture change is
scary and it's hard

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.965
and I can understand especially
for those of us in this room,

00:06:38.965 --> 00:06:40.840
we don't know necessarily
how to approach it.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.120
How do we start to create
or enact performance culture

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.466
within our environments?

00:06:46.466 --> 00:06:48.340
I'm going to go through
some real things that

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.790
have been said to
me as I've gone

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.700
on this journey within the
organizations I've worked in.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.060
Lara, "I don't want to
think about mobile."

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.032
Right.

00:06:59.032 --> 00:06:59.956
PAUL: So whiney!

00:06:59.956 --> 00:07:01.690
LARA: Yeah.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.520
"Lara, I'm a project
manager or a product manager

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.490
and I've look at the deadlines,
I've got some resources

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.270
and frankly building for both
desktop and mobile is going

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:15.250
to take twice as long."
[WHISPER] It's a lie.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.800
"Lara, you at the
performance Manager,

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.220
don't you know
responsive web design is

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.210
inherently bad for performance?"

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:29.700
Or my personal favorite,
"everything changes too fast!"

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.550
So, here's the thing we've
been through this before

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.200
and when it comes
to web development

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.680
we've gone through these
kinds of change the past.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:43.570
Who here has built sites
with tables for layout?

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:44.150
Yes.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:44.934
PAUL: Yes!

00:07:44.934 --> 00:07:46.600
Look at all these guilty hands.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.400
[DEEP VOICE] I don't
do it any more.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.310
LARA: It was a pain.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:51.260
So, at probably every job
I worked at between 2006

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.060
and 2010 I remember
these arguments,

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.050
do we have to move to
a CSS based layout?

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:57.980
In fact, we did.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.360
We did it pretty successfully.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.110
This is more like what
we would use today,

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:05.610
as is actually said to change
again with web components.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.150
Who has heard this from a very
important person, excuse me,

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.537
the important part is
not above the fold.

00:08:10.537 --> 00:08:12.620
When the EP's would have
to scroll to see content.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.770
Yeah.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.510
This is again what
we're seeing today.

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:18.530
We used to worry about
800 by 600 pixel monitors,

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:21.770
now we're worrying about the
spectrum of screen sizes.

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:24.380
This graphic represents
all the devices

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.180
that come to ETSY.com that
have more than 1,000,000 visits

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.710
per month in traffic.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:31.180
We're no longer seeing
just handsets and tablets

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:35.880
and desktops we're seeing
a spectrum of screen sizes.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.370
You may also think
about how we've

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:40.120
changed developing for
different browsers over time.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.620
I remember back in the day we
would talk about cross browser

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:46.690
compatibility or making things
look the same across browsers.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:48.880
Browser hacks, prefixes,
et cetera and this

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.615
is again what
we're seeing today.

00:08:50.615 --> 00:08:52.740
We have to start thinking
about mobile web browsers

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:56.660
in addition to just
our desktop clients.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:58.710
But this is all to say
that change is scary,

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.290
but it's also constant in
our industry and it's good.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:03.420
This is a good part of our jobs.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.770
We've lost crazy table
layouts and now we

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:08.480
have semantic markup and
more people than ever

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.960
before can use our
sights on our apps.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.620
This is good for
us as developers

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.450
and it's really good for users.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:19.410
PAUL: So, we need to
embrace change, good, fine.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:21.180
So, where do we
start when we want

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.250
to create one of these
performance cultures?

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:27.080
Well, the first step for us is
to actually gather some data

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.210
because essentially you
don't know where you're

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.950
going if you don't
know where you are

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:36.280
and you need to understand
how real people use

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.330
your site, like what
devices are they on?

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:39.810
Where are they in the world?

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:43.175
What journey did they
take through your site?

00:09:43.175 --> 00:09:45.050
Which pages did they
arrive on and which ones

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:45.799
did they leave on?

00:09:45.799 --> 00:09:48.620
You need to understand
your own situation

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.170
and if you don't
know today you can't

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:52.770
start telling that story
to the people around you

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:55.540
and get them on board to
build this culture with you.

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.430
So, the immediate thing
that springs to mind

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.430
is just going and have a
look at your analytics.

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:00.580
Go and look at Google Analytics.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:01.954
Figure out what
it's telling you.

00:10:01.954 --> 00:10:03.650
Spend a bit of
time, make reports,

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:06.862
and start to get that
sense of where you're at.

00:10:06.862 --> 00:10:08.570
The next thing you
want to do is actually

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:10.209
look at you load stats.

00:10:10.209 --> 00:10:11.750
So, how long does
it take to load it?

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:15.570
How long does it feel like
it takes to load your site?

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:19.487
Again this is coming down to
the data that you can share,

00:10:19.487 --> 00:10:21.070
but it's also in
this case coming down

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:22.930
to a little bit of
empathy as well.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:25.700
How does it actually feel to
be one of those people that's

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.480
using your site on
a day to day basis

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.010
from somewhere
else in the world.

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:31.940
And for that we can
turn to Web Page Test

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:35.730
and you can ask it to load your
site from a range of locations,

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.860
a bunch of devices, and
different connection types.

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.440
And it is going to give you a
load of really useful, really

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.270
amazing data.

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:43.610
And one feature I
particularly like

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:46.250
is the ability to compare pages,
so you could take for example

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:48.440
your own site and
oh, I don't know,

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.709
the site of your co-presenter
and see who's fastest.

00:10:51.709 --> 00:10:52.500
LARA: Not cool bro.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:53.950
PAUL: Oh yeah.

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:56.590
I actually did
that, as you can see

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.977
and depressingly it's a draw.

00:10:58.977 --> 00:11:01.800
So, yeah.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.240
Could have been
bad, but it wasn't.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.760
I'm sure you can
start to see how

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.730
you could start figuring
out the story here.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:11.870
Like how does it feel
to be one of our users

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:14.801
when you compare it to somebody
else in the world or-- da-duh,

00:11:14.801 --> 00:11:16.175
da-duh, da-duh
you get this idea.

00:11:16.175 --> 00:11:16.850
OK.

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:18.469
So, you start to
get in this insight

00:11:18.469 --> 00:11:20.260
and you don't even have
to leave your desk.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.880
That's the best bit.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.890
But we can get even more
data at Web Page Test

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:27.957
and we can share
that with our team.

00:11:27.957 --> 00:11:30.040
Like how long does it take
before our server sends

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.375
some data back or how
long before our pages

00:11:33.375 --> 00:11:34.686
start rendering?

00:11:34.686 --> 00:11:36.060
But one number I
want to call out

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.470
is this, which is
the speed index.

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.497
It's a bit weird the
way it's calculated.

00:11:41.497 --> 00:11:43.080
You can click on
there there's a link.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.480
And you can click on it
and it will tell you,

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.345
in all the gory detail,
how it figures it out

00:11:46.345 --> 00:11:47.230
and it's pretty cool.

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:47.938
LARA: It's magic.

00:11:47.938 --> 00:11:48.980
PAUL: This is magic.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.330
But it is a really good
number for figuring out

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.120
in milliseconds
how long it feels

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.010
like it takes for
your page to load.

00:11:58.010 --> 00:11:59.680
So, that's a really
good measurement,

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.360
better than say,
the onload event.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.430
But speaking of
perceived performance,

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:06.890
we don't just want
to stop caring

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:09.940
when people-- when
they've landed on the site

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.420
and we go oh, what have we done.

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:15.910
We need to care about scrolling
and animations and interactions

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:18.244
and they all need to be
this silky smooth 60 frames

00:12:18.244 --> 00:12:19.910
a second because
people care about that.

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:25.470
They want that feel of
responsiveness and smoothness.

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:28.756
Again you go to like Dev Tools
to look at your pages for data

00:12:28.756 --> 00:12:30.880
and figure out what your
frames per second is like.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.350
So we get frames
per second, we can

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:36.020
dive into the
frames a little bit

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:38.190
there and find out
where we've got issues

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:39.500
and then start fixing them.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.560
Now if all that's
new to you it's

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.300
time for a shameless
plug, which is

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.314
to say I've got a session
tomorrow morning that will tell

00:12:46.314 --> 00:12:48.480
you exactly what you need
to know about these tools,

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.860
"The Tools You Need to Succeed."

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.317
It rhymes, it's true.

00:12:53.317 --> 00:12:54.900
So, come to that if
you're interested.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:57.530
Anyway, hopefully at the
end of this situation

00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:00.720
we have a load of information,
we have a lot of data,

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.910
and we're starting to hopefully
build this story in our heads

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:07.472
of what it feels like
to be one of our users.

00:13:07.472 --> 00:13:09.930
LARA: So, you've got this data
and you're excited about it.

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:11.860
What do you do with
all of that excitement

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:13.330
and all of that data?

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.490
You should go talk to some
very important people.

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:18.050
You want to enlist the help
of the very important people

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:20.960
at your company and get them to
understand what your users are

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.730
feeling and experiencing.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:25.650
There are few
things more powerful

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:29.030
than a very important person
saying, this is important.

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:30.720
Performance is important.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.660
It's crucial to getting others
at your company invested

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.010
in performance.

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:38.310
So, what can you do
to make this happen?

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:40.230
Here's an idea that
we came up with,

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:42.890
you should send your very
important person one stat a day

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:45.440
for two weeks and see how
long it takes before they cave

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.400
or just get really
annoyed with you.

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.890
One that we often like to
cite is this Google study

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:53.550
that found an additional
200 milliseconds of delay

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:55.790
triggered a 0.3%
loss of engagement.

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:58.820
You may say to yourself,
0.3% is not a lot,

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:00.435
but Google is pretty popular.

00:14:00.435 --> 00:14:01.810
So any kind of
loss of engagement

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:03.770
is going to have a huge effect.

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:07.700
Or remember that old stat that
we just had where 40% of people

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:10.650
will leave a site that takes
longer than 3 seconds to load,

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.330
tell your very important person
that stat and say, by the way

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:17.730
our takes 5 seconds to
load on a 3G connection.

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:19.770
So, after the stat
thing has run its course

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:21.879
consider running
some experiments.

00:14:21.879 --> 00:14:23.920
Measure the business impact
of these experiments.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.960
Know what kinds of metrics
your very important person

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:27.714
cares about.

00:14:27.714 --> 00:14:29.880
Maybe it's balance rate,
maybe it's conversion rate,

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.174
maybe it's something else.

00:14:31.174 --> 00:14:32.840
Go ahead and run
performance experiments

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.590
and see what the effects are.

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:37.420
On Etsy, we ran an
experiment in which

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:39.610
we added 160 kilobytes
of page weight

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:41.700
to a page on a
mobile device and we

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:45.175
saw that it increased
mobile bounce rates by 12%.

00:14:45.175 --> 00:14:46.550
This is the kind
of thing that we

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:48.796
can share with the folks
at Etsy and say, hey,

00:14:48.796 --> 00:14:51.170
this stuff is important look,
at the effects that it has.

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:52.836
However, this is kind
of a negative stat

00:14:52.836 --> 00:14:55.070
and I kind of prefer
to make a positive.

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:56.990
So, what we found when
we eliminated jank,

00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:59.140
that's that
scrolling issue, when

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:01.000
we eliminated jank
on Etsy's activity

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.505
feed we saw people
"favorite" more often,

00:15:03.505 --> 00:15:05.027
and "favorite" more items.

00:15:05.027 --> 00:15:06.610
And this is another
kind of experiment

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:08.980
that you could run, make
something better and measure

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:10.980
the effects before and
after and pick and choose

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.190
the engagement
metrics that you know

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:17.080
your very important person
is going to care about.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.910
You could also use that web
page test film strip, thanks

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:20.410
for that--

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:21.340
PAUL: Your welcome.

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:22.570
LARA: --and take
the video output

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:24.778
and compare that before and
the after the experiment,

00:15:24.778 --> 00:15:27.220
make an improvement, show
how slow it was before

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:30.120
and show how long-- how
short it took afterwards.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.990
And get that person to care
and feel about how this works.

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:38.000
Or compare your site on desktop
to how it loads on mobile

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.440
or compare you're site
in the United States

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.350
to how it loads globally.

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:45.105
Get your very important person
to see and to feel these things

00:15:45.105 --> 00:15:48.330
so that they actually
care about this stuff too.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.700
You want to get them to feel it.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:55.510
Once they understand you can
help them empower others.

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:57.680
By changing how you're
very important people think

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:00.760
about performance it will help
everybody who's surrounds you.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:04.810
PM's, designers, developers
care and work on performance.

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:08.430
PAUL: Speaking about those other
people, so, we've got data,

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:12.680
we've got our VIP's to say,
OK performance is important,

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.980
we see that it's got real value.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.600
How do we then make it so
that the people around us

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:21.350
can actually-- start actually
taking this and using it.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:25.850
Well, the easiest way is to
educate them through something

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:28.650
like a brown bag,
lunch and learn session

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:30.900
on all the tools, all
the data, all the things

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:34.416
that you've figured out about
how you're actually doing.

00:16:34.416 --> 00:16:36.040
And it's not-- as we
said it's not just

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.620
developers, it's
designers, is UX,

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:41.490
it's project
managers, it's anyone

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:45.870
who's involved in what you
do because it's a team sport.

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:48.650
And we want to make sure
that the people that we're

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:51.347
working with know the impact of
the decisions that they take,

00:16:51.347 --> 00:16:53.180
so it's not the case
of, well the developers

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:55.890
have done all they can,
but actually the problem

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.476
is originated from
another place.

00:16:57.476 --> 00:16:58.850
You know if you
include everybody

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:01.457
you've got a much better
chance of success.

00:17:01.457 --> 00:17:03.040
The next thing that's
well worth doing

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.260
is to start documenting
your best practices

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.010
and start writing things up.

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:09.540
Because what gives
you is an easily copy,

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.960
pasteable set up that you have.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.829
It makes it more
obvious about how

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:17.069
to do the right things as
far as you're concerned.

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:19.910
Anybody who joins your company
is going to start figuring out,

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:21.720
oh this is how I'm
supposed to do things,

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:26.220
rather than just having to guess
and muddle their way through.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:32.100
And you can use it to show what
worked and what didn't work

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.700
and if nothing else it kind of
gives everybody a focal point

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.340
and say, right this is-- because
you will find there will be

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:39.710
trade offs in everything you do.

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:42.880
This thing and doing it this
way works because of this.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.445
So it's a really
good place to sort

00:17:44.445 --> 00:17:49.250
of-- it's really good to start
writing these things down.

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:51.170
Another thing that is
definitely worth doing

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.810
is seeing what you're
uses are seeing,

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:55.744
which is to say invest
in a device lab.

00:17:55.744 --> 00:17:57.660
And I mentioned this to
somebody the other day

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:01.431
and they went, "psha
$10,000, really?"

00:18:01.431 --> 00:18:03.930
Because that's what they were
assuming it was going to cost.

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:05.820
Well first of all it
doesn't necessarily

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.450
have to cost that much.

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:13.190
Secondarily, the cost of not
testing across multiple devices

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:15.490
may be way higher and
so, that's something

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:17.800
that you want to
decide for your selves.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.860
But it's a sort of--
it's an out of sight

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:22.960
out of mind kind of
problem, this one.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:26.150
If you put these devices
in front of everybody

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:28.510
it kind of gives
everyone that reminded

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:31.680
that there's this whole range of
devices they should be testing

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.490
on and that they are building
for the multi-device web

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:37.280
and that they need to care about
performance on all of them.

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.070
It's also a social
place as well,

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:42.090
so people can meet and
gather around these devices

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:44.610
and start to figure out
together how you can solve

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:46.580
particular problems and
again that will broaden

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:49.740
the horizons beyond
just the developers.

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:52.850
One thing that is pretty cool
out in the Design Sandbox,

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:55.402
if you haven't seen it
we have a Device Lab.

00:18:55.402 --> 00:18:56.860
And the team there
will talk to you

00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:00.020
about how you can go about
making your own device lab.

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.037
The source apparently
is on GitHub

00:19:02.037 --> 00:19:03.620
because it does some
crazy stuff where

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.870
it which is to all the devices
at the same time, which

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:06.530
is really cool.

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:09.490
So go and see the Design Sandbox
people they will help you.

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:12.869
LARA: And then also if you go
to laraswanson.com/devicelab you

00:19:12.869 --> 00:19:15.410
can see all the slides that I
just gave for a tutorial on how

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:16.220
to build your own device lab.

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.850
How to choose devices, how to
troubleshoot power, and all

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:21.058
of the other things that
we've learned along the way.

00:19:21.058 --> 00:19:22.380
PAUL: Awesome.

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:27.580
Alright, so, you-- it's
great to have the device lab,

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:29.350
but it's not great
if you don't use it.

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:31.600
It's a bit like having a gym
membership and they never

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:32.796
getting on the treadmill.

00:19:32.796 --> 00:19:33.630
Yeah.

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:38.090
So, make time to actually
test your stuff for real.

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:40.440
It's good you've
hopefully got the VIP's

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.910
to say it's important so you can
say actually we need time now

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:46.540
to make sure that
things are working well.

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.444
So go and give your
devices a big old hug.

00:19:48.444 --> 00:19:49.610
Let them know you love them.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:55.530
Like we said earlier
though educating your team

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:57.460
isn't just about
developers and performance

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:00.155
isn't just about an
internal thing some of it--

00:20:00.155 --> 00:20:02.530
sorry it's just not an external
thing it's also internal,

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:04.250
get that the right way around.

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:07.170
It's about everyone who builds
for the web in your company.

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:10.910
And that means in a
lot of ways that you

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:13.100
want to eliminate
duplicate code,

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.170
you want to basically
embrace responsive.

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:19.050
Instead of having a mobile
team that does the M-dots

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:22.230
and you know the other team
that does all the other stuff.

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.970
M-dot.

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:25.010
What do you do for TV?

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:26.180
Do you do TV-dot?

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:27.960
LARA: What do you do
for refrigerators?

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:28.741
PAUL: F-dot?

00:20:28.741 --> 00:20:29.240
LARA: R-dot?

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.169
PAUL: R-dot.

00:20:30.169 --> 00:20:30.960
LARA: I don't know.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:31.380
Don't do that.

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:32.450
PAUL: No, don't do that.

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:34.324
That seems like it's
not going to scale well.

00:20:34.324 --> 00:20:35.610
LARA: No.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.850
PAUL: OK, you said
earlier they do taxies.

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:41.010
LARA: Oh yeah, taxis in
New York have the little--

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:42.176
you can access the internet.

00:20:42.176 --> 00:20:44.430
Mind, [SHOOTING SOUND] blown.

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:46.357
Alright, point
here is your going

00:20:46.357 --> 00:20:47.940
to eliminate duplicate
code, you going

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.580
to make it easier for
your team to iterate more

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.610
quickly, hopefully,
and start to break down

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:55.260
the barriers between you, the
designers, the developers,

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:58.180
and it just gives you a much
greater chance of success.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.150
So, in summary, when you've got
the green light from your VIP

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:03.120
start teaching your
team about performance

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.830
and the impact of their work,
it's going to empower them.

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:08.390
Sorted.

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:12.270
LARA: So, you need to
start surfacing performance

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:13.437
within People's daily lives.

00:21:13.437 --> 00:21:14.978
We can talk about
performance all day

00:21:14.978 --> 00:21:17.680
about how important it is and
when you ship something new you

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.520
can see the end of the day how
much performance was impacted

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.080
negatively or positively.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.660
But this isn't help
people as they're

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:25.296
designing or developing.

00:21:25.296 --> 00:21:27.670
So, the first thing you can
do is add performance to your

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:28.870
build tools.

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:30.740
Automate image compression.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.760
Get a command line tool
running like Grunt or Gulp that

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.790
runs performance
tests and compares

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:37.762
your new work to your
performance budget.

00:21:37.762 --> 00:21:39.220
You could use
something like Travis

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:41.310
to do the in a continuous
integration environment.

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:42.980
And these tools can
even report back

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:45.840
to dashboards, which is
my next recommendation.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.550
So, at Etsy we look at something
like this every time we deploy

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:51.020
code, which happens
upwards of 50 times a day.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.690
When someone deploys
something new

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:54.500
they'll go over to
a dashboard and say,

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.184
how did this impact performance?

00:21:56.184 --> 00:21:58.350
It's really important that
as people are continually

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:00.770
pushing out new work
they can see immediately

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:03.320
how their stuff has affected it.

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.770
But also at Etsy we
have this tool bar

00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:08.310
that sits at the top of
every page of etsy.com

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:10.666
if you logged in as
an Etsy employee.

00:22:10.666 --> 00:22:12.040
And in this we've
got information

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.690
about visitor traffic
and experiments,

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:15.990
but we also have
performance data.

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:17.780
So, we surface the
timing's for people

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:20.790
as they're developing
in developing, staging,

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:22.380
and production environments.

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:23.842
And we also have
a clear baseline

00:22:23.842 --> 00:22:24.800
for what is acceptable.

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:26.800
We'll let you know
if you're violating

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:30.200
one of our performance
service level agreements.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.140
By surfacing your
team's performance data

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.640
during the workflow it'll
help improve their work,

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.409
it'll become baked
into their workflow.

00:22:36.409 --> 00:22:38.200
They'll start to care
about it because they

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.050
can see how their work
directly impacts it

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:42.990
as they're designing
and developing.

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:45.080
And this brings me
to our last point.

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.970
This stuff is going to
make people so excited

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:48.428
and people are
going to ship things

00:22:48.428 --> 00:22:50.060
that are improvements
to your site.

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.000
You should be
celebrating everything.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.705
Again, I'm all about
the excitement.

00:22:53.705 --> 00:22:56.080
I'm all about getting people
pumped up about performance.

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.455
PAUL: Prepping
the talk with Lara

00:22:57.455 --> 00:22:59.300
was like an object
lesson in excitement.

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:00.250
LARA: Nice.

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:03.890
So, for me, this is actually
the most important part.

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:05.950
Back in the day
in August of 2011

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:08.010
the man behind the
sunglasses, Seth Walker,

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:11.000
published Etsy's first
performance report.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.860
He published it on Etsy's news
blog, so it's super public.

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:18.430
He chose a bunch of baseline
business metrics or page load

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:20.420
time metrics,
rather and he showed

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:23.330
how long are our major
pages were taking to load

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:25.952
and you can see there's a huge
outlier here, the homepage.

00:23:25.952 --> 00:23:27.910
It was embarrassing, but
he published it anyway

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:30.160
because this stuff
isn't a secret.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:33.470
What's amazing about this
is that developers teamed up

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:34.246
to fix this.

00:23:34.246 --> 00:23:35.620
As soon as we
publish it, as soon

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:38.470
as Seth put that into the world
people got excited about it

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:40.890
and they wanted to help
and they want to fix it.

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:43.590
And by the next time we
published reports, which

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:46.860
was in November of 2011
there was a huge improvement.

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.255
Not only did the home
page significantly improve

00:23:49.255 --> 00:23:50.520
in page load time.

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.990
It was the fastest
one on this list.

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:55.675
So, you should be
sharing your findings.

00:23:55.675 --> 00:23:57.050
Make sure that
you're celebrating

00:23:57.050 --> 00:23:59.990
externally the stuff that you're
doing to help improve things

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:02.430
along the way, but
also as Paul mentioned

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:04.801
it's important to do
this internally as well.

00:24:04.801 --> 00:24:06.550
This is an example
dashboard that we have,

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:08.020
the Performance
Hero a dashboard,

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:10.670
in which we celebrate
engineers and designers who

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:13.200
make huge improvements
to Etsy's page load time

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.560
and they're not on
the performance team.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:18.460
In this case Chris Fairbanks,
who's on the checkout team,

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:20.680
eliminated a ton
of duplicate code

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:22.139
and had what we
call a Baumgartner.

00:24:22.139 --> 00:24:24.429
Remember that guy who jumped
out of the hot air balloon

00:24:24.429 --> 00:24:25.500
and landed on earth?

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.496
Yeah so every time we
have a graph like this--

00:24:27.496 --> 00:24:28.290
PAUL: It wasn't a
dance move, right?

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:30.225
LARA: It wasn't-- no, it wasn't
a dance move it was a plummet

00:24:30.225 --> 00:24:31.072
to earth.

00:24:31.072 --> 00:24:33.030
Every time we have one
of these, a Baumgartner,

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:34.430
we celebrate this internally.

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:36.100
We put this up on
a dashboard and we

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.650
have that little printout
sign, and we hang out with them

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:39.608
and we're like, thanks.

00:24:39.608 --> 00:24:40.280
Thanks buddy.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.196
And we want to celebrate
the things internally

00:24:42.196 --> 00:24:46.130
lots of high fives, lots
of doughnuts, lots of cake.

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:48.034
You should be rewarding
your innovators.

00:24:48.034 --> 00:24:49.950
It's not just about
coming down with a hammer.

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:51.694
It's not about being
a cop or a janitor.

00:24:51.694 --> 00:24:54.360
This is really about celebrating
improvements and getting people

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.510
excited and invested
in their performance.

00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:59.710
Celebrating wins will
motivate your team

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:02.280
to be performance champions.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:05.622
So, to summarize
gather the data.

00:25:05.622 --> 00:25:07.080
You want to make
sure that you have

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:10.410
a baseline of understanding
how your users feel.

00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:13.250
Again, this is all about
understanding the overall user

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:13.800
experience.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:17.230
It's the aesthetics and
it's page load time.

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:20.340
You then want to share all
that stuff with your VIP's.

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:23.260
Get them to understand what your
users are really experiencing.

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:25.996
Get them to understand what it's
like on mobile and globally.

00:25:25.996 --> 00:25:28.620
Get them to understand also how
this stuff impacts the business

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:32.560
metrics, run some experiments
and share that data with them.

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.420
Once you get a very
important person to say,

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:36.961
this is important or just a few
find that it's awesome enough

00:25:36.961 --> 00:25:38.990
to say this is important,
educate your team.

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:41.270
Do those brown bags
and lunch and learns.

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:43.728
Make sure that your surfacing
that data in their daily work

00:25:43.728 --> 00:25:44.670
flows.

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:50.300
Make sure also-- your
celebrating things.

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:51.550
Again this is a journey right?

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:53.210
You may be at any
step in this process

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:55.459
and you might have to start
again gathering more data,

00:25:55.459 --> 00:25:58.065
getting more VIP buy in,
educating the team again.

00:25:58.065 --> 00:25:59.741
New designers and
developers will join

00:25:59.741 --> 00:26:01.990
and you'll have to do more
brown bag lunch and learns.

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:03.360
New technologies will
emerge and you'll

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.910
want to share that data and
that new information with them.

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:08.440
You'll find new wins and you
want to celebrate that stuff.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:12.846
This is a continual journey and
continually positive process.

00:26:12.846 --> 00:26:13.346
PAUL: OK.

00:26:13.346 --> 00:26:15.710
So, as we said at
the start we're

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:17.910
in this period of
dramatic change

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:22.760
where we're seeing mobile
traffic go, whoosh straight up,

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:28.190
and we're facing this
world where essentially we

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:30.920
need to deal with these
performance constrained devices

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.220
like building for this
tomorrow that we're looking

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:35.800
at involves facing
that fight and saying

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.340
you know what most of the
devices that people are going

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:41.570
to be using are not desktop,
they are not powerful devices.

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:45.280
The thing is it's not really
tomorrow it's kind of now.

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:48.200
And that's the thing about
dealing with performance

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.750
is it really starts and it
can and should start today,

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:53.690
but the only way you're
going to get to that point

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:58.490
is if absolutely everybody in
your organization from the top

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:02.291
to the bottom cares deeply about
performance and its impact.

00:27:02.291 --> 00:27:03.790
And the only way
you're going to get

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:08.300
there is if you start
building performance cultures.

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:08.800
Thank you.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:17.620
We'd love your feedback.

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:20.070
Please do snap the code
or take down the URL.

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:23.000
And we'll be outside if you
want to ask any questions

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:23.670
and say, hi.

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:24.520
LARA: Come hang out.

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:25.020
PAUL: Yeah.

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:25.978
LARA: Thanks everybody.

00:27:25.978 --> 00:27:26.870
PAUL: Thank you.
