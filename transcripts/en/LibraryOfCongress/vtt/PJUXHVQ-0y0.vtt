&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.290
&gt;&gt; NICOLE CHUNG: M.T. Anderson he

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.430 position:56%
for a bunch of different age groups.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.270 position:56%
His book "Feed" was a finalist for
the National Book Award and his book

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.280
"The Astonishing Life of Octavian
Nothing, Trader to the Nation,

Volume 1" won the 2006 National
Book Award for Young People.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.400
His newest book is "Landscape with
Invisible Hand" which is a satire

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.160
of ardent truth in the
mist of colonization.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.510
So, without any further
ado, M.T. Anderson.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:44.780

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.080
&gt;&gt; M.T. ANDERSON: Thanks so much.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.380
It's great to be here.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.680
Thank you all for coming.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.590 position:56%
So, yeah, my name is M. T.
Anderson, and what I'm going to talk

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.980
about today in connection
with my fourth coming book,

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.340
which will be out in
just a couple days,

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.120
"Landscape with Invisible
Hand," is the American landscape

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.080
and how the American landscape can
be transformed through imagination.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.620
So, I grew up in a small town in
Massachusetts, the Town of Stowe.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.410
It was a very small,
boring American town.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.060 position:56%
We were actually proud of how boring
it was because like that was almost,

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.380
it was almost iconic in how dull
it was, you know what I mean?

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.660
Like, so we had the typical
white congregational church.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.810
We had the little, you know
the red Carnegie era library.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.340
Like even the bullies
were like totally.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.090
The bullies who used to beat me
up were totally like old-fashion.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.320
Like there was no cyber
bullying then, they were doing

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.740 position:56%
like all the same things they'd done

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.450
to like Puritan kid back
in the 16th century.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.990
You know, like the monkey
bite, all that kind of thing.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.580
You know, the real classic.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.620 position:56%
So, growing up in this town, I loved
it there, I loved how dull it was.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.140
And you know, at the same time of
course, I always dreamed of kind

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.430
of far-flung bizarre
destinations and adventures.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.260
All around the world, you know.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.030
For example, Conan the Barbarian,

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.540
who I based a lot of
my adult life on.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.300
You can't tell, but beneath this
shirt, I'm pure barbarian brawn.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.350 position:56%
So, I always wanted to be the kind
of writer who would travel the world

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.640
and see sort of these unusual
places and write about them.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.480
And to some extent, I
guess I have done that,

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.130
except I'm somewhat hampered by the
fact that I'm a terrible traveler.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.550
For example, I have all
sorts of gastric distresses.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.040
So, here I am on top of
the Himalayas thinking

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.880
about how far it is to
a bathroom [laughter].

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.400
And I've actually been, I
have so many food allergies

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.070
that I have actually
been hospitalized

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.780
in every continent
except Antarctica.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.590
And I haven't been there, but
I'm sure that once I get there;

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.800
here I am being hospitalized
in France,

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.420
for example, in the Pyrenees.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.050
The funny thing about being;
so, I was following the route

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.350
of the Albigensian crusades
through the Pyrenees.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.660
And I went to a concert
of some medieval music

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.360
in an old medieval castle.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.120
Which was great, except the tuning
of the instruments was so bad I had

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.420 position:56%
like anaphylactic shock as a result.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.800
So, they had to call an ambulance
and things, I was puffing up.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.220
And I was sitting there, and my
girlfriend said to me you know,

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.700
you really look bad, you
need to get out of here.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.990 position:56%
And I was like, well I can't because
like, it's the middle of a song.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:28.750 position:56%
I'll wait until the end of the song.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.280
But those medieval songs are
like 500 freaking verses.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.800 position:56%
So, by the time that the song ended,
I had like pustules all over me.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.570
And so, I stood up and in typical
fashion, like, I mean I know a bit

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.460
of French, but I panicked and
so instead of saying to them,

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.580
because everyone stopped and looked
at me, because there were only

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.250
like 20 people in the audience.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.240 position:56%
And so, everyone stopped and looked
at me and instead of saying to them,

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.450
you know, I'm sorry I am sick,
which is what I was trying to say,

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.040
of course I said to them, I'm
sorry, I'm evil [laughter].

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.490
And then I left.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.540
I can't hang around for this.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.900
So, I'm going to start
smoking soon, like a,

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.100
you know demon possessed
person at a church.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.940
Anyway, so, oh, the other thing
is you know, it was very hard

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.110
to explain to the EMTs,
like to ask them questions,

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.360
because I didn't know in
French any medical terms.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.660
So, instead of saying like
how is my blood pressure I had

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.630
to say things like
is my blood strong?

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.080
It's sounds like Voltaire
or something.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.470
So, anyway.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.220
So, but nonetheless, I have
travelled the world despite this,

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.760
which is how I've had anaphylactic
reactions in every continent.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.580
So, you know, I have been to
Katmandu and I've travelled all

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.700
over the place in France, as
I said following the route

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.230
of the Albigensian crusades.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.760
I've gone to haunted castles
and to ancient Chinese cities,

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.740
ancient Tibetan monasteries.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:07.650 position:56%
And in fact, with a historian friend
of mine, I went into the far west

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.260
of China, the Xinjiang
Uyghur Autonomous Region.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.960
I'm so sorry that you have
to try to translate that.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.140
Right [laughter] in far western
China, searching for the temple

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:27.010
of a rat God, which we
did eventually find.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.780
And I have been to
exorcism ceremonies in Java

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.080
and all this kind of thing.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.390
And yet, and yet, the
strangest thing

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.650
out of all these travels
was not any of the things

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.960
that I've talked about, but coming
back to my home in Cambridge,

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.540
and then looking at it with new
eyes and wondering for example,

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.640
why is it that the guy down
the street is building a large

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.330
weaponized mechanical
spider [laughter]?

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.060
Like, it turned out
after all of that

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.550
that the strangest things I've
seen are at home, you know?

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.270
I went to upstate New York
and discovered that the town

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.110
with the Jell-O factory in
it is right next to the town

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.860
with the Cool-Whip
factory [laughter].

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.910
Upstate New York is an
incredibly weird place.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.060
They were like, this town, there
were rifts opening up in the ground

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.490
that smelled like sulfur.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.130
And people were just like, oh
yeah, it's really bad today.

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:28.570
And I was like, the apocalypse
is happening, don't you notice?

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.400
So, and this is what I
think is really important is

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.790
that we should seek out the stories
that are all right around us.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.890
America is full of
these bizarre stories.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:43.450
And that is where all of you can
be looking for your material.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:47.610 position:56%
For the stories that you want to
tell about the places that you live,

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.510
to celebrate wherever
it is you live.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.610
Your small, boring town.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.610
So, I eventually wrote a novel for
young kids, called "Jasper Dash

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.830
and the Flame Pits of Delaware."

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:04.280
And, the idea of this book was
to actually kind of like take all

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.750
of the stupid things we
say about other countries

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.720
when we write adventure novels,
like, oh, in South America

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.510
and Africa there are dinosaurs.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.800
And that kind of thing, all these
sort of like fictitious things

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.410
that we make up about other
countries and instead apply them

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.480
to a place in America
that I knew that myself,

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.170
and almost no one else
had ever been to,

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:23.600
that is to say Delaware [laughter].

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.340
I mean, and you know,
many of you are from DC,

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.130
you know that the only reason
anyone ever goes to Delaware,

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:34.040 position:56%
correct me if I'm wrong is because
if you're going to New York you have

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.860
to pass through the corner of
Delaware and those jerks charge you

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:44.120
like $6 for 3.5 minutes
of road time, right?

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.340 position:56%
So, this book therefore, is about
some explorers who go into the heart

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:53.160
of deepest Delaware, a place where
people have not been for many,

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.740
many years because of the
exorbitant interstate tolls.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.610
And they discover that it's this
land of wonder with dinosaurs

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:01.680
and lizard people and
all this kind of thing.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.500
So, and in it, I actually said, I
have a note that said, you know,

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.420
please we at this publishing
company want

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.360
to make sure we get all
the details correct.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:14.330
And so, if you are from Delaware,
or have been there or know someone

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:18.910
from Delaware and find that
this is not your experience,

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:24.870
please immediately write a letter
to, you know, correct these errors.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:27.810
And so, then I gave the
address for the Governor

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.360
of Delaware's mansion [laughter].

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.640
Because it's his problem, I
mean you know, it's not mine.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.410
I don't live there.

00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:39.020
So, anyway I got a great letter
from the Governor of Delaware,

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:43.180
which is the only time a state
governor has ever called me Buster.

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:48.630
And he told me, look he said,
stop corrupting the children

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.940
of our state, come down and
visit and I will show you

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.510 position:56%
that our state is very, very normal.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:54.970
It's very, very typical.

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:58.520
It is not a land of wonders,
a land that time forgot,

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.130
or chose specifically
not to remember.

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:04.400
So, I did go down to
Delaware and met the governor

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:12.400 position:56%
and he was a super nice guy, this is
Governor Markell, but I said to him

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.680
at the time, I was like, Dude,
and you know only the adults

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.020
in the audience will unfortunately
remember this period which is

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:22.890 position:56%
about what, would this be, ten years
ago maybe, I was like, my friend,

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:28.150 position:56%
you invited me down here to convince
me that Delaware is a boring state.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:33.060
And yet, one of your, a woman
who is running for Congress

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:36.990
from your state has had to begin;
you see where I'm going with this;

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:43.780
has had to begin her campaign
ads with, "I am not a witch."

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:48.280
I mean what other state has
a witchcraft problem among

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.060
their senators.

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:52.550 position:56%
So, anyway, and then on the way home

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:56.250
from this very meeting I was
driving up route 1 in Delaware.

00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:01.510
And suddenly there are all
these helicopters overhead,

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:03.060
shining lights everywhere.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.810
And it turned out that on the
highway that I was driving on,

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:09.030
I was the last car to get
through because a sniper was

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.710
in an apartment building
shooting at the highway,

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:13.580
and they were closing
down the highway.

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.700
So, I wrote to him and I
was like, well governor,

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.360
I guess I've only been shot
at a couple times in my life,

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.910
and one of them was in your state.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:24.860
So, as I say, think
about all the things

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:29.290
that are actually tremendously
bizarre in the place that you are.

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:31.760
And the way that those
stories connect

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.880
with the history of your town.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:38.490
So, for example, I talk to a
lot of kids about the stories,

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:41.810
the myths they have about
their town and their state.

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:45.010
And for example, they told
me that there was a myth

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:49.680
that the Dupont family had a
bunch; who are from Delaware

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.690
and have beautifully funded a
lot of the stuff in that state,

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:55.850
because the Dupont family had these
sort of children who would come

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:59.380
out deformed as a result of
chemical contact who were all kept

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.010
in a particular house
off in the woods.

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:02.980
And you know people
would got to the house,

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:06.410
you know for their dates and stuff.

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:08.840
But the neat thing about
that is that in a weird way,

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:13.260
even through the medium of
the horrific, of the bizarre,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.150
or the ghost story in a sense.

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:20.000
You get the real history of the
place as well, rolled into that.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.800
Places have these identities
that extend from what is real

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:27.350
into fantasy, into our dream lives.

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:28.970
And I think that that's
really amazing.

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:31.110
That's something to be celebrated.

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:35.300
You know, once again, you
know when I; oh yeah so,

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.980
the American landscape
is, these are pictures

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:43.340
from 19th century American
landscape painters.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.770
American landscape
painting is supposed to be

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:49.240
about describing a place, exactly.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.690
And what that place looks like.

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:55.630
And yet, at the same time,
it's also about what you build

00:11:55.630 --> 00:12:00.230
out of those images of your
landscape in your imagination.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:04.490
All of the castles in the air,
as it were, that you build,

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:08.250
out of what you see around you.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:11.080
And you know, once again to
return to my friend Conan here,

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.630
this does not look like an
American landscape, and yet,

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:17.380
the guy who created Conan
was a kind of a sad sap,

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:20.360
Robert E. Howard, living in Texas.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:24.350
And he says that when he
created his land of Samaria

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:29.330
where Conan is supposed to be a
barbarian, he actually based it

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:32.130 position:56%
on the area that he was in in Texas.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.200
So, even though he's
writing supposedly

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.880
about Europe during the
Dark Ages, in a way,

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.370
it also is an American landscape.

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:43.100
And we should not also forget
that Conan the Barbarian was,

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.810
in fact the Governor of
California [laughter].

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:54.810
So, yeah, I look, I got home
to my apartment in Cambridge,

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:57.490
Mass and I look at this
bizarre tree that someone,

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:02.340 position:56%
this sort of Charlie Brown like
tree that someone planted, and sure,

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:07.550
it is in a sense, there's something
that can be transformed about it.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:13.250
I mean during the day, it
looks like a sort of Han period

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:17.840 position:56%
like sleeve dancer or something from
ancient China, and then at night,

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.650
you see the same tree and
it's transformed into say,

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:23.940
the slender man, you
know what I mean?

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:29.430
All of these things around us,
remind us of the wonders that are

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:30.730
to be found right at home.

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:35.460 position:56%
And there's a beautiful quotation
by T.S. Elliot about this, which is,

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.800
"We shall not cease
from exploration,

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:44.570
in the end of all our exploring
will be to arrive where we started

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:47.890
and know the place
for the first time."

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:51.230
That to me, seems like
the essence for one thing,

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:55.370
of traveling that you go
away, and you learn in fact

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:57.860
where it is that you are from.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.450
You learn to recognize your home.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.170
Because when we live, when
we don't leave our home,

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:04.600
we stop seeing our home.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.910
We don't notice anything
about our hose even anymore.

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:11.650
We stop seeing the people we live,
we take everything for granted.

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:16.350
And it's not until you go away to
a distant hillside and look back

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:19.580
at your town, that you can see
your town for the first time,

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.890 position:56%
and realize, oh that's how it works,
that's what it's actually like.

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:26.020
And I think that literature
does the same thing.

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:29.870
Literature takes us just far
enough away from what we know

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:32.020
that then we can look
back at what we know

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:34.140
and see it for the first time.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.970
See it with new eyes.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:38.380
And that, I think is the
real power of literature.

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.470
So, I'm going to talk just
briefly, I'm going to;

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:41.980
how many minutes do I have left?

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:45.760
I have 15 minutes left?

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.060
Over 15 minutes left.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:51.330
Okay, so I'm just going to talk
very briefly about the books that;

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:54.290
some of the books I've written
and how I feel I have tried

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:58.940
to transform sort of American
places in these books.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.290
"Landscape with Invisible Hand"
which will be out in a few days,

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:04.860
is a satirical science
fiction novel, for example,

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.660
about a kid who is a
landscape painter trying

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:10.620
to paint American landscapes
in the wake

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.250
of an alien colonization
of the earth.

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:15.730
So, the story is told entirely

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.370
through descriptions
of his paintings.

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:22.140
As he kind of records both
the spread of this sort

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:26.630
of alien infiltration and also
the dissolution of his family,

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:29.810
the difficulties he's
having with his own family.

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:34.250
So, obviously in this case, I
really am very openly talking

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:40.010
about landscape and it being
transformed, whereas "Feed,"

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:44.490 position:56%
which is perhaps my best-known novel
is a book about the far future,

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:47.340
actually not too far,
like 2050 or something,

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.950
where everyone has a
chip in their head.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:55.100
A sort of internet chip directly in
their head that allows them access

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:58.240
to this whole sort of
world of telecommunication,

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:01.200
but at the same time,
keeps everyone awash

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.620
in a constant flurry
of advertisements.

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:08.510
So, once again, in this case what
I'm trying to do is create a kind

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:10.940
of a science fiction allegory

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.990
that then shows you the
world we already live in.

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:16.070
I don't care, in a sense,
when I was writing this,

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:19.670
which was a long time ago now, I
didn't care about the technology

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:21.620
and whether we would really
have chips in our head.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.100
Though it does appear we will.

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:27.910
I mean, but we all have that to
look forward to, but nonetheless,

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:30.140
what I really was trying
to do instead was to say,

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.970
this is what I feel right now.

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:34.420
Right now, I already have the voice

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.150
of advertising ringing
through my head.

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:40.890
As a teen, I already had
advertisers saying to me,

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:44.070
this is what you should want, this
is what you should dream about,

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:46.150
this is who you should want to be.

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:50.480
So, once again using the kind
of the science fiction image

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:53.260
to take you away from
what you know just enough

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:57.640 position:56%
so you could see something about
the world that we live in right now.

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:03.820
In my books "The Norumbegan
Quartet," this is a series of books

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:07.150
for some of the younger kids
that are actually set in Vermont,

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:09.460
a place I know and love very much.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:12.590
However, turning it into a kind
of a mythological landscape,

00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:17.080
with an ancient race that is
hiding there playing a kind

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.380
of a magical game.

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:19.680
So, once again this thing

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.100
of like taking a landscape
and transforming it.

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:28.940
And then, finally, my book "The
Pox Party," which the full title is

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:32.410
"The Astonishing Life of Octavian
Nothing, Traitor to the Nation,

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:37.830
Volume 1, The Pox Party"
and " The Astonishing Life

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:41.630
of Octavian Nothing, Traitor
to the Nation, Volume 2,

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:42.930
The Kingdom on the Waves."

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:47.180
These books are actually
set in Boston,

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.860
another place that I know and love.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.820
But in the 18th century.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.170
And the idea is that
they should seem almost

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:57.930
like gothic fantasy novels
or something at first.

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:00.620
Because you don't realize
what it is you're looking at.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.990
And my whole idea was after
you start to recognize,

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:07.460 position:56%
oh wait a second, this is Boston,
this is right before the revolution,

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:12.320
by that time, I want the
reader to feel like the history

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:16.090
that we know too well, that
history of the revolution,

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:20.620
suddenly you can access it again
and see it through new eyes.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:27.800
So, in each of these cases, my
goal is to take something known,

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.610
a place that we know, a
story that we know too well,

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:34.380
and transform it enough that
we can see that story again.

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.590
So, I just want to say to all
of you who are young writers,

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:40.100
or even not young writers, just
people who like to tell stories

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:46.440
to your friends, don't forget the
strangeness that is all around you

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.280
and how to grasp that, and realize

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.610
that the place you live,
is some place special.

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:56.120
And we need you to tell
the stories of that place,

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.690
we need you to tell us all
about where you're from.

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:04.680
So, that you can take us out of
who we are and show us again who,

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:09.240
as a nation, you know who we
are and what we can become.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:13.510
So, thank you very much and I'll
answer questions if there are any.

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:21.520
[ Applause ]

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.580
Otherwise, I'll just stand
up here super awkwardly.

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:28.990
I could do a little like
music song you know.

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:30.290
Do, do, do, do, do.

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:31.590
Do, do, do, do.

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:32.890
Oh, thank God.

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:34.600
&gt;&gt; I'll shoot for one.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.390
Given the fact that you
work with various settings,

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:41.600
various time periods, are you, in
your writing, your initial writer,

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.830
are you more of a panzer
or a plotter?

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:46.390
Are you a major outliner in your?

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:49.720
&gt;&gt; M.T. ANDERSON: Okay, for
those of you who are not writers,

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.180 position:56%
the terms he's using, thank you for
the question, panzer and plotter are

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:54.900
like do you do it by
the seat of pants?

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.500
Like, you don't know
where you're heading into,

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.980
you just start writing the
book, or are you a plotter?

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:02.770
Are you someone who
sets out every single,

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:04.220
you know event ahead of time.

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:06.150
And I've done both is the answer.

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:08.260
So, for "Feed" for
example, I had no idea

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.440
where that story was going to go.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:15.000
But in other things, I've set
out like every single scene

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.770
and have known ahead of time.

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:21.530 position:56%
And as a piece of advice to your
writers, I think books that are more

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:27.230
about character and slow internal
development, might I mean I found

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:28.530
that it's easier for them

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:31.480
if I do not know what is
going to go on ahead of time.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:36.680
But books that are about external,
you know events, and adventure,

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.970 position:56%
those it really helps to know
what's going to go on ahead of time,

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:42.960
because that way you can lay
in clues, you can set things

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:46.020
up so it's satisfying and
has that satisfying snap.

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:48.220
Because you know you always
hate those like mystery novels,

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.270
where you feel like they kind of
made it up on the fly, you know?

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:53.960
So, yeah, so that's
what I would say.

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:57.410
And then I've also done nonfiction
stuff like "Symphony for the City

00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:01.790
of the Dead" which is a nonfiction
book about the siege of Leningrad,

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:04.450
where obviously, I
had to do, you know,

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:07.790
years of research ahead of time.

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:11.680
And it is nonfiction so
I didn't have a choice

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.610
about what was going to happen.

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:14.910
You know what I mean?

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:16.300
Believe me if it had been up to me,

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.790
things would have ended
much happier [laughter].

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.700
Yes?

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:25.190
&gt;&gt; Are there any fantasy worlds

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:28.790
in books you've read
that you really enjoy?

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:30.660
&gt;&gt; M.T. ANDERSON: Are there
fantasy worlds in books I've read,

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.230
yeah thank you, that
I've really enjoyed.

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:36.090
Absolutely, in fact when
I was probably your age,

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:39.070
I used to wish that, like you
know those gateway fantasies,

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:41.690
where like you start in this work
and then you end up in that world

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:45.030
and suddenly you have magic
powers and all that kind of thing.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:48.350
Which I totally wanted
that to happen to me.

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.750
And you know at the
end of those books,

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:54.940
you know they always have someone
come back, you know to this world.

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:58.290
And that was always a letdown for
me, I was like, dude, our world?

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:00.670
Why do you want to go back
to the world of like Stop

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:04.000
and Stops and you know, Weetabix?

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.910
I was like no, stay
in the fantasy world.

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:10.040
We have super powers you moron.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.930
So, yeah, I absolutely, but
they would have been different

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:15.020
from my generation,
I'm afraid than yours.

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:21.430
So, for example "Harry Potter" came
out when I was a youngish adult.

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:26.250
So, for me, it was more people
like "The Earthsea" books

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:29.060
by Ursula Le Guin, which
I really, really loved.

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:32.580
That kind of thing, yeah.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:36.450
&gt;&gt; So, can everybody hear me?

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:40.130
Okay. So, I read your "Symphony
for the City of the Dead."

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:41.430
&gt;&gt; M.T. ANDERSON: Oh, great.

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:45.690
&gt;&gt; And I loved it, but I was
wondering why you chose nonfiction,

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:49.160
and Russia, and the 1940s instead

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.060
of something more American
and more close to home.

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.360
&gt;&gt; M.T. ANDERSON: Okay.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.660
All right, great.

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:55.960
So, the question is why did I?

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.260
So, I'm glad you asked
about this book

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.810
because I have some slides
related to it [laughter].

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:01.110
Not a plant.

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:02.570
Not a plant.

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:07.510
But, so yeah, so this is a
book which is about the siege

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:14.060
of Leningrad during World War
II, which is in fact one of the,

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:17.090
I'm sorry, it is the longest
siege in recorded human history.

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:20.350
And it was a terrifying siege.

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:24.820 position:56%
The Germans surrounded the Russian
City of Leningrad for several years.

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:28.720
And there was no food,
there was no water.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:32.570
More people died in the defense
of; the whole city was sort

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:35.820
of transformed into a
military camp, over the years.

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:40.330
And more people died in
Leningrad, or defending Leningrad

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:43.740
than have died in all
American wars, ever.

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:49.730
So, that is to say like Americans
in any war, if you clump all

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:51.940
of those together,
it is still fewer.

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:55.390
I'm sorry, I know that
I'm not speaking well.

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:59.050
But it is fewer dead
than died in this siege.

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:00.350
And in the middle of this,

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:02.970
there's this composer there who's
writing a symphony about this

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:06.710
as he's working as a
fireman standing on the roof

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:10.790
of the conservatory trying
to put out incendiary bombs.

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:13.320
So, that was kind of the material.

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:17.600 position:56%
Frankly, the reason I decided to
make it nonfiction was the story was

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:24.350
so dramatic, and so bizarre, like
all of the details were so weird,

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:28.920 position:56%
that I felt like if I turned it into
fiction it's going to lose its edge,

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.000
because no one will
really believe it.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.390
I have to insist on the fact
that it is not fiction for people

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:37.710
to believe it, because, and
this comes to the second part

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:40.430
of your very excellent question,
why did I choose a Russian topic

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:42.540
and a World War II topic.

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:47.030
The second part of it is that we
do not know, or we do not think

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:50.930
about that war in the way that
people elsewhere in the world do.

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:55.120
The Russians, for example, do
not, Russian historians don't talk

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.460
about World War II in
the same way we do.

00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:00.370
They talk about something
called "The Great Patriotic War"

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:03.720
which for them starts in
1941, that is to say later

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.200
than we see the Second
World War starting.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:10.090
It has a totally different
narrative associated with it.

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:12.700
So, I wanted once again
to say, this is something

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.000
that we take for granted.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.390
We think, oh, you know the Second
World War we know our stories

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:20.480
of heroism that often are connected

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:23.090
with our own families'
stories of heroism.

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:27.670
My family for example,
fought in the Philippines.

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:32.310 position:56%
So, I think of it very much in terms
of a Pacific theater, or you know,

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:35.840
we think in terms of western
Europe, or North Africa

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:39.950
where American troops
were largely involved.

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:45.100
But at the same time, most of the
deaths in that war on our side,

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:48.040
on the allied side
were Russian citizens.

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:51.020
Because more Soviets died
in that war than people

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:53.680
of all other nations combined.

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:58.280
And then the Chinese, who are often
forgotten entirely in all of this.

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:03.070
So, as a result, I was like,
no I want to write about this,

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:06.200 position:56%
which is in fact, tremendously
important to the way a lot of people

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.350
around the world see this war

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:10.880
and is still affecting
Russian policy today.

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.730
If you look at the way that Putin

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:18.620
and the Russians understand global
politics, it's directly tied

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:21.780
to their sense of things
after that war,

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:23.600
and of trying to create
buffer states

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.210
and protections for themselves.

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:29.020
So, anyway my point is it's
super important to open our eyes

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:32.710
to what's there and to say, I'm
not going to accept the story

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:34.010
that I've always been told.

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:36.500
Instead I'm going to
ask questions about it.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:40.580 position:56%
I'm going to find out all the things
that are sort of the secret truths

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:43.350
that really make this world run.

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:44.650
So, I guess that's my answer.

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:46.510
Thank you very much.

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:50.500
[ Applause ]

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:59.060
I don't know who's supposed
to ask a question next.

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:01.470
&gt;&gt; So, whenever you're writing
your books, do you write them

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:04.730
with these allegories and these
symbols in mind, or do they come

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:06.640
as a result of you
writing them down?

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.730
&gt;&gt; M.T. ANDERSON: I don't know.

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:12.020
Because to me it's not always
about like allegories and symbols,

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:15.340
but just what is it
that I am anxious about.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:17.820
What is it that I care about.

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:21.000
And that's what comes
out in the writing.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.300
You know what I mean?

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:24.640
So, for example, in "Feed" I kind
of knew in the case of "Feed."

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.960
Like, no, there was no question
in my mind that this thing

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.370
with the chip in the head
and all that kind of thing,

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:32.570
that that was you know, I totally
thought of that ahead of time.

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:37.660
Like, oh this is a great way
to explore these emotions.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:40.210
So, you know, it's
different in each case.

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:42.370
But I think by and large, I'm
just writing about what it is

00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:44.950
that makes me anxious or angry.

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:52.240
And trying to understand that
anger and that confusion, yeah.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.590
Yes?

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:56.990
&gt;&gt; Do you have a favorite
place to write,

00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:59.420 position:56%
or favorite like music to listen to?

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:00.720
&gt;&gt; M.T. ANDERSON: A favorite what?

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.050
&gt;&gt; A favorite place to write?

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:03.350
Oh, okay.

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:04.650
&gt;&gt; M.T. ANDERSON: Yeah.

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:06.340
&gt;&gt; Do you have a favorite place
to write, or like type of music

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:08.810
to listen to where
you get most inspired?

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:10.110
&gt;&gt; M.T. ANDERSON: Absolutely.

00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:11.410
Well, both things are true.

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:14.640
So, I mean, I have an office
in my house and that's one

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.630
of the best things about
being a writer, right?

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:20.700
I mean I live in New England and
so there is snow all the time,

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.730
and so I look out the window and
other people have to commute.

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:25.840
And I'm like oh yeah,
I have to commute too

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.630
from my bedroom, down the hall.

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:31.450
It's a great gig.

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:35.640
So, yeah, I mean as far as
listening to music while I write.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.420
I mean I listen to music
very intensely before I write

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:41.830 position:56%
to get myself into the mood for the
specific scene that I'm going to do.

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:44.160
But I can't listen to
music while I'm writing,

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:48.570
because otherwise I attribute to my
own powers the power of that music.

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:49.870
I'm writing away.

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:53.100
I'm like, oh, man this is so
beautiful man, oh this is genius,

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:55.960
and then I read it the next
day and it's totally boring.

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:59.670
And it's because I was moved by
the music, not by my own writing,

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:01.980
you know, so I have to be careful

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:06.010
of using music itself
while I'm writing, yeah.

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:07.310
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:09.670
&gt;&gt; M.T. ANDERSON: Yeah.

00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:10.970
Yes?

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:14.510
&gt;&gt; What's the weirdest thing
that's ever happened to you?

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:18.290
[ Laughter ]

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:19.590
&gt;&gt; M.T. ANDERSON: Pardon me?

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:20.890
&gt;&gt; In Delaware?

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:22.190
&gt;&gt; M.T. ANDERSON: In Delaware.

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:23.490
Yeah, when I was, yeah.

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:26.260
That's one of the, I've
only been shot at twice

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:29.840
and that was the worst of the two.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:33.050
But the weirdest thing?

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:34.350
Well, I'll tell you one neat thing

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:37.060
that just recently happened
which was pretty weird.

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:41.030
So, I recently purchased a haunted
house in the State of Vermont.

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:44.230
They said, it's super
rural there and they're

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:46.170
like well it's really,
really remote.

00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:50.020
And extremely cheap because
no one wants to live there,

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:52.220
but it's this 18th century house.

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:55.860
And I was like yeah, what
could possibly go wrong?

00:29:55.860 --> 00:30:00.620
So, I moved in and I had heard
that there was an unearthly wailing

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:04.470
that actually happened outside
of one of the upstairs windows.

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:06.210
A child wails in the night.

00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:08.000
I'm not a believer
in ghosts by the way.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000 position:56%
So, when I, about four days after I
moved in, I was sitting there typing

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.020
at around 9:30, and indeed I
heard a totally unearthly wailing

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.070
that sounded totally human.

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:22.040
And in fact, I thought it was
someone playing a prank on me.

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.340
But it was not.

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:26.810
I'm assuming that it was
some kind of a large mammal.

00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:28.330
There are a lot of
them around there.

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:29.630
But I still don't know.

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:31.560
But here's the neat thing,
this is what actually moves it

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:33.160
into the realm of the kind of cool.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.860
I was pulling up the floor
boards to replace them

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:42.100 position:56%
in the upstairs bedrooms and I found
some letters from the kids who lived

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.470
in that house in the 1970s,
who had put these letters

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:47.970
in between the floor
boards to the ghosts.

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:50.460 position:56%
And what they said, this is so cool.

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:55.210
What they said was,
"Dear Ghost, I love you.

00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:58.030
I think you are cute.

00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:02.490
I hope your mom buys you a
corgi so you can ride on it.

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:04.530
Do you ice skate?"

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:07.910
Which I though was a great
thing to say to a ghost.

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:12.160
So, what is so beautiful to me as
a novelist about that is the fact

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:17.880
that at once, the girl writing
this wants to comfort the ghost

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:20.230
in some way, which I
think is very beautiful.

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:24.330 position:56%
And at the same time, what she's
doing is comforting herself in a way

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:26.780
by creating a ghost who is sweet

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:29.110
and can be comforted,
if you see what I mean.

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:30.770
So, it's kind of neat to see that.

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:37.660
And also, to finish I guess, in
this image of how the legendary,

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:40.890
or miraculous, or mythical
transforms the real.

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:44.540
Also under those floor boards,
I found all of these items

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:46.080
that the boy who'd
lived in the house

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:49.070
in the seventies had
dropped in there or whatever.

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:50.370
So, you know.

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:52.660
Like and the whole history
of his childhood was there.

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:56.080
So, I found the like Go Fish
cards from when he was eight.

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:59.850
I found the baseball
cards from when he was 10.

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:02.900
I found the Beatles record
from when he was like 12.

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:05.750
And then I found his porn
stash when he was 15.

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:08.890
Which funnily enough it
actually slid down next

00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:13.640
to the giant central fireplace
and was a total like fire hazard.

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.160
So, I was like, you know, we are;

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.260
they are so lucky this house
didn't burst into flame.

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:20.470
And in a way, it would be
symbolically appropriate

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:24.160
to have this old like Puritan
house burst into flames

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.460
as a result of hidden lust.

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:32.360
So, in this kind of case,
you can see that all

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:36.670
around us there are
stories waiting to be told.

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:40.630
And all we have to do is
look for them and understand

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:44.050
that even the myths about
a place really resonate

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:47.830
with that place's history
and where it actually is.

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:49.660
What the place actually feels like.

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:53.660
So, once again, my challenge to
all of you are to find the stories

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:56.800
that are around you and to tell
them, because all of us want

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:59.200
to hear what you have to say.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:01.000
Thank you very much.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:14.340
[ Applause ]
