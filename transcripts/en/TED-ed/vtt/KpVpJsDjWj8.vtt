00:00:06.632 --> 00:00:08.322
Meet the nurdles.

00:00:08.322 --> 00:00:12.801
They may be tiny, look harmless,
and sound like a bunch of cartoon characters,

00:00:12.801 --> 00:00:14.412
but don't be fooled.

00:00:14.412 --> 00:00:17.498
These little guys are plotting 
ocean domination.

00:00:17.498 --> 00:00:21.110
Nurdles are some of the planet's
most pervasive pollutants,

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.129
found in lakes, rivers, and oceans
across the globe.

00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:28.773
The tiny factory-made pellets 
form the raw material

00:00:28.773 --> 00:00:31.338
for every plastic product we use.

00:00:31.338 --> 00:00:33.735
And each year, 
billions of pounds of nurdles

00:00:33.735 --> 00:00:36.354
are produced, melted, and molded

00:00:36.354 --> 00:00:44.298
into toys, bottles, buttons, bags,
pens, shoes, toothbrushes, and beads.

00:00:44.298 --> 00:00:46.767
They are everywhere.

00:00:46.767 --> 00:00:50.691
And they come in many guises,
multi-colored and many-shaped,

00:00:50.691 --> 00:00:54.630
they range in size from 
just a few millimeters to mere specks

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.125
that are only visible 
through a microscope.

00:00:57.125 --> 00:00:59.989
But their real advantage
in the quest for ocean domination

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.765
is their incredible endurance,
which allows them to persist

00:01:03.765 --> 00:01:07.382
in an environment for generations
because their artificial makeup

00:01:07.382 --> 00:01:10.399
makes them unable to biodegrade.

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:13.320
So, just as long as they don't get 
into the environment,

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.399
we have nothing to worry about, right?

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:19.827
The problem is nurdles have a 
crafty way of doing exactly this.

00:01:19.827 --> 00:01:23.837
Produced in several countries
and shipped to plastic manufacturing plants

00:01:23.837 --> 00:01:26.636
the world over,
nurdles often escape

00:01:26.636 --> 00:01:30.440
during the production process,
carried by runoff to the coast

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.389
or during shipping when they're
mistakenly tipped into the waves.

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:38.107
Once in the water,
nurdles are swiftly carried by currents,

00:01:38.107 --> 00:01:42.113
ultimately winding up
in huge circulating ocean systems

00:01:42.113 --> 00:01:45.842
called gyres, where they convene
to plan their tactics.

00:01:45.842 --> 00:01:48.750
The Earth has five gyres
that act as gathering points,

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.998
but the headquarters 
of nurdle ocean domination

00:01:51.998 --> 00:01:55.973
are in the Pacific Ocean,
where the comparative enormity of the gyre

00:01:55.973 --> 00:01:59.054
and the resulting concentration
of pollution

00:01:59.054 --> 00:02:03.258
is so huge that it's known as
The Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

00:02:03.258 --> 00:02:05.957
Here, nurdles have good company.

00:02:05.957 --> 00:02:08.550
This gyre draws in 
all kinds of pollution,

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.916
but because they don't biodegrade,
plastics dominate,

00:02:11.916 --> 00:02:15.178
and they come from other sources
besides nurdles, too.

00:02:15.178 --> 00:02:18.990
You know those tiny beads you see
in your face wash or your toothpaste?

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.366
They're often made of plastic,
and after you flush them down the drain,

00:02:22.366 --> 00:02:25.272
some also end up 
in this giant garbage patch,

00:02:25.272 --> 00:02:29.035
much to the delight of the nurdles,
building up their plastic army there.

00:02:29.035 --> 00:02:32.875
And then there are the large pieces
of unrecycled plastic litter,

00:02:32.875 --> 00:02:38.440
like bottles and carrier bags,
transported by runoff from land to sea.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.560
Over time, these plastic chunks
turn into a kind of nurdle, too,

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.596
but one that's been worn down
by the elements, not made in a factory.

00:02:46.596 --> 00:02:48.713
And as if they weren't 
threatening enough,

00:02:48.713 --> 00:02:51.740
the rough, pitted surfaces
of these microplastics,

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.273
the name we give to all 
those collective plastic bits,

00:02:54.273 --> 00:02:57.241
water-born chemicals stick,
or adhere, to them,

00:02:57.241 --> 00:02:59.128
making them toxic.

00:02:59.128 --> 00:03:03.380
This gathering has grown so immense
that the oceanic garbage patch can shift

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.523
from around the size of Texas
to something the size of the United States.

00:03:08.523 --> 00:03:10.862
But while this toxic tornado
is circulating,

00:03:10.862 --> 00:03:16.268
the birds, fish, filter feeders,
whales, and crustaceans around it

00:03:16.268 --> 00:03:20.780
are just going about their daily business,
which means they're looking for food.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.996
Unfortunately for them,
tiny bits of floating plastic

00:03:23.996 --> 00:03:27.334
look a lot like fish eggs
and other enticing bits of food.

00:03:27.334 --> 00:03:29.918
But once ingested, 
microplastics have

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:34.163
a very different and terrible habit
of sticking around.

00:03:34.163 --> 00:03:37.342
Inside an animal's stomach,
they not only damage its health

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:41.658
with a cocktail of toxins they carry
but can also lead to starvation

00:03:41.658 --> 00:03:46.180
because although nurdles may be ingested,
they're never digested,

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.528
tricking an animal into feeling 
like it's continually full

00:03:49.528 --> 00:03:52.200
and leading to its eventual death.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.739
When one organism consumes another,
microplastics and their toxins

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.019
are then passed up through the food chain.

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.251
And that's how, bit by bit,
nurdles accomplish their goal,

00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:06.541
growing ever more pervasive 
as they wipe out marine life

00:04:06.541 --> 00:04:09.226
and reshape the ocean's ecosystems.

00:04:09.226 --> 00:04:11.468
So, how to break this cycle?

00:04:11.468 --> 00:04:15.536
The best solution would be to take
plastics out of the equation altogether.

00:04:15.536 --> 00:04:19.667
That'll take a lot of time
but requires only small collective changes,

00:04:19.667 --> 00:04:23.771
like more recycling, 
replacing plastics with paper and glass,

00:04:23.771 --> 00:04:26.881
and ditching that toothpaste
with the microbeads.

00:04:26.881 --> 00:04:29.213
If we accomplish these things,
perhaps over time

00:04:29.213 --> 00:04:33.061
fewer and fewer nurdles will turn up
at that giant garbage patch,

00:04:33.061 --> 00:04:35.230
their army of plastics will grow weaker,

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.799
and they'll surrender the ocean
to its true keepers once more.
