00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:08.940
The first time that I saw Rauschenberg's work
is really lost in the fog of memory.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.080
I know it was some time you know, before I
was twenty.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.660
He was kind of an art hero for me.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:23.770
And the reason I went to see Merce Cunningham, which was the only dance I'd ever seen in my early years,

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.120
was because I wanted to see Bob Rauschenberg's
work.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.000
When I worked with Merce Cunningham I had
to reproduce some of Bob's lighting designs

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:43.000
and so I really respected him and I was kind
of overwhelmed always by his prodigious talent

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.120
and his endless creativity and so productive.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.640
He did sets, lights, and costume, and the whole visual look

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.960
which also inspired me to want to do the same thing

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.100
I thought if he could do it so could I. So I did that for a while.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:09.210
For "Travelogue," Bob supplied a bunch of costume accessories, and props, and set pieces.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.393
I do remember he felt that Merce was overusing
something in a way.

00:01:13.393 --> 00:01:17.810
And he said "Let's get him...let's get him to not...it's too fussy.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.650
Let's get him to stop that."

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:27.900
So I mean that's where I picked up the fact
that he was not shy about giving his input.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.100
Oh, no.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.300
Not so much.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.700
I was thinking... This is too much.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.220
Too much draping?

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.980
Yeah I think that we can't do that.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.380
When I was invited to collaborate on this Rauschenberg show

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.160
It was a forgone conclusion that I would do it

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.020
because Rauschenberg was my favorite artist and had been always

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.160
I mean what luck for me. Because it's a chance to

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:12.200
see the work a lot and close and I certainly wouldn't have that reaction if it were someone else.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.440
So it seemed like the perfect thing for me to be doing

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:27.560
And then it's really been an eye opener for me just about exhibition design and how to think about a huge exhibition

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.120
Well I think we should test it in space though

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.200
Well I brought my computer cause I have everything laid out on my computer.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.120
I'm very conscious of my own participations and collaborations with dancers

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.280
and that I'm using video to not upstage the dance.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.360
And that's the continual problem because it's very easy to do.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.920
And I thought he had the...he must have had the same feeling. He didn't want to take over because the dancing is beautiful

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.440
and the dances are right there

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.440
so I thought he'd made the perfect set.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.520
Iâ€™m just wondering if you want to put something
on the floor to make it even? But maybe not.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.440
Actually the colors on the floor are pretty good.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.520
Yeah I love it actually.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.800
I think people are just going to stay here mesmerized

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:31.040
Bob Rauschenberg really set an example for
collaborators about how you could be actively

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.880
engaged with other artists and other artists
and other media.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.920
I think my work is influenced by the spirit of Bob's work

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.880
Nine Evenings is an event that took place in 1966

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:54.200
and it was the first time that there was a major collaboration between technology, the engineers at Bell Labs

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:02.160
and artists. Billy Kluver, who organized it selected a handful of very well known artists at the time

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.280
and invited them to collaborate with engineers

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.160
The events were major New York City art events that everyone went to I suppose.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.000
and they took place over nine evenings and ten artists

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.600
and I guess there were several events per evening

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.600
Everyone approached it differently

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.760
When I look at the documentation, everything raw

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.960
raw technology, raw ideas, really the beginning of something

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.080
Part of my mission with my own work

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:43.960
is I've done a huge body of work of films and videos

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.720
and I'm now interested in showing them in exhibition spaces

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.200
So I kind of explode them and make them a walkthrough experience.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.520
So I approached this the same way. It's a body of material that you want people

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.480
to experience something about

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.120
and the documentation is kind of poor. It's very interesting, but

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.600
but how to make it something that you want to look at

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.840
so that's sort of the challenge

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.880
I see things the way I see them

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.320
as a time based media maker.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:29.760
And because of all my experience working on the stage I have a theatrical sense of how you can do a complete environment

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:38.120
and what lighting brings. I mean all the elements because I worked so long in collaboration with dance on the stage.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.760
To me the work doesn't seem old.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.760
It's in example that you can make work that lives on

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.320
Just the whole process has been really interesting

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.960
Making an exhibition and seeing how an exhibition is made and all the care that goes into it.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.800
It's been life changing for me
