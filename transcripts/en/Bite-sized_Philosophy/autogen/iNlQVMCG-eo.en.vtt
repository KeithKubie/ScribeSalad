deep level the West has lost faith in

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660
deep level the West has lost faith in
 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.200
deep level the West has lost faith in
the idea of masculinity now that's no

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210
the idea of masculinity now that's no
 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.749

same thing and so a Nietzsche knew what
 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.500
same thing and so a Nietzsche knew what
the consequence of that would be I mean

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510
the consequence of that would be I mean
 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.970
the consequence of that would be I mean
that's most of what he wrote about you

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980
that's most of what he wrote about you
 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.460
that's most of what he wrote about you
know and so you'd say well the divine

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470
know and so you'd say well the divine

symbol of masculinity has been

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359
symbol of masculinity has been
 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.359
symbol of masculinity has been
obliterated well so then what do you

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369
obliterated well so then what do you
 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.990
obliterated well so then what do you
expect what it what's gonna happen it's

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000
expect what it what's gonna happen it's
 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.940
expect what it what's gonna happen it's
gonna that means masculinity is going to

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950
gonna that means masculinity is going to
 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.869
gonna that means masculinity is going to
become weak and especially if the symbol

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879
become weak and especially if the symbol
 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.330
become weak and especially if the symbol
has also denigrated right which it

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340
has also denigrated right which it
 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.750
has also denigrated right which it
definitely is so what that means is that

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760
definitely is so what that means is that
 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.819
definitely is so what that means is that
the ideal that man could aspire to is

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829
the ideal that man could aspire to is
 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.080
the ideal that man could aspire to is
denigrated and well then with your ideal

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090
denigrated and well then with your ideal
 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.139
denigrated and well then with your ideal
in tatters you're weak that's that's

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149
in tatters you're weak that's that's
 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.270
in tatters you're weak that's that's
definitional so I think the reason that

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280
definitional so I think the reason that
 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.060
definitional so I think the reason that
men have been responding positively to

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070
men have been responding positively to
 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.219
men have been responding positively to
my my thinking let's say is that I don't

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229
my my thinking let's say is that I don't
 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.050
my my thinking let's say is that I don't
buy any of that I like the masculine

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060
buy any of that I like the masculine
 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.760
buy any of that I like the masculine

fundamentally carnage and pillaging it's

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280
fundamentally carnage and pillaging it's
 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.300
fundamentally carnage and pillaging it's
not fundamentally rape culture you know

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310
not fundamentally rape culture you know
 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.450
not fundamentally rape culture you know
it's not fundamentally world destroying

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460
it's not fundamentally world destroying
 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.850
it's not fundamentally world destroying
and all of those things have been all of

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860
and all of those things have been all of
 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.130
and all of those things have been all of
those aspersions have been cast upon it

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140
those aspersions have been cast upon it
 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.380
those aspersions have been cast upon it
that's partly the guilt of Western

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390
that's partly the guilt of Western
 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.109
that's partly the guilt of Western
society for technological progress even

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119
society for technological progress even
 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.490
society for technological progress even
and those are reasonable challenges to

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500
and those are reasonable challenges to
 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.499
and those are reasonable challenges to
be set before men but they're not

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509
be set before men but they're not
 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.319
be set before men but they're not
reasonable accusations to swallow

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329
reasonable accusations to swallow
 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.569

without criticism what is a masculinity

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579
without criticism what is a masculinity
 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.340
without criticism what is a masculinity
we can aspire to well it's a

we can aspire to well it's a

we can aspire to well it's a
responsibility fundamentally and it's

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630
responsibility fundamentally and it's
 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.999
responsibility fundamentally and it's
it's it's to put it symbolically is that

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009
it's it's to put it symbolically is that
 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.760
it's it's to put it symbolically is that
your your responsibility is to incarnate

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770
your your responsibility is to incarnate
 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.160
your your responsibility is to incarnate
the Spirit of the logos that's your

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170
the Spirit of the logos that's your
 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.830
the Spirit of the logos that's your
responsibility that's your role in life

responsibility that's your role in life
and that

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840
and that
 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.350
and that
is independent to some degree in whether

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360
is independent to some degree in whether
 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.360
is independent to some degree in whether
or not you accept the idea of a

or not you accept the idea of a
transcendent and eternal reality now I'm

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519
transcendent and eternal reality now I'm
 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.920
transcendent and eternal reality now I'm
not making a case for that or against

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930
not making a case for that or against
 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.890
not making a case for that or against
that I those things are beyond human

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900
that I those things are beyond human
 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.600
that I those things are beyond human
understanding but we know what happens

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610
understanding but we know what happens
 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.830
understanding but we know what happens
if people act poorly if men act badly we

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840
if people act poorly if men act badly we
 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.690
if people act poorly if men act badly we
know what happens we know that the world

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700
know what happens we know that the world
 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.850
know what happens we know that the world
turns into something that's so close to

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860
turns into something that's so close to
 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.220
turns into something that's so close to
hell that the difference is trivial we

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230
hell that the difference is trivial we
 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.890
hell that the difference is trivial we
know that that's the story of the 20th

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900
know that that's the story of the 20th
 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.729
know that that's the story of the 20th
century so we should learn that lesson

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739
century so we should learn that lesson
 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.589
century so we should learn that lesson
and what that lesson is is pick up the

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599
and what that lesson is is pick up the
 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.900
and what that lesson is is pick up the
world on your shoulders and walk forward

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910
world on your shoulders and walk forward
 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.850
world on your shoulders and walk forward
pick up the world with all of its

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860
pick up the world with all of its
 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.680
pick up the world with all of its
trouble with all of its suffering with

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690
trouble with all of its suffering with
 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.830
trouble with all of its suffering with
all of its evil and move forward with it

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840
all of its evil and move forward with it
 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.550
all of its evil and move forward with it
and in bearing that burden learn that

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560
and in bearing that burden learn that
 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.000
and in bearing that burden learn that
you're the sort of creature that can

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010
you're the sort of creature that can
 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.160
you're the sort of creature that can
bear that burden and therefore deserving

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170
bear that burden and therefore deserving
 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.620
bear that burden and therefore deserving
of respect that's that's the that's

of respect that's that's the that's
identification with the logos and that's

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950
identification with the logos and that's
 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.509
identification with the logos and that's
I don't I've never encountered an idea

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519
I don't I've never encountered an idea
 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.050
I don't I've never encountered an idea
that's better than that because it's not

it's so not naive it's the opposite of
naive it's like there's terrible evil

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930
naive it's like there's terrible evil
 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.629
naive it's like there's terrible evil
and there's terrible suffering it's

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639
and there's terrible suffering it's
 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:41.000
and there's terrible suffering it's
bottomless but the human spirit is

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010
bottomless but the human spirit is

very poorly characterized it's very
shallowly characterized because it

shallowly characterized because it
 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.430
shallowly characterized because it
