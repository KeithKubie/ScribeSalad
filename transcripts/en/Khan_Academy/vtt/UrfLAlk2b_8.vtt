00:00:00.631 --> 00:00:01.664
- [Voiceover] So in the previous video

00:00:01.664 --> 00:00:04.175
we solved this problem the hard way.

00:00:04.175 --> 00:00:05.850
Maybe you watched it, maybe you didn't,

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.604
maybe you just skipped right
to here and you're like,

00:00:07.604 --> 00:00:08.855
"I don't even wanna know the hard way.

00:00:08.855 --> 00:00:11.037
"Just show me the easy way please."

00:00:11.037 --> 00:00:12.769
Well, that's what we're
gonna talk about now.

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:14.015
Turns out there's a trick

00:00:14.015 --> 00:00:17.837
and the trick is after you
solve this problem the hard way

00:00:17.837 --> 00:00:20.576
with a five kilogram mass
and a three kilogram mass,

00:00:20.576 --> 00:00:22.030
when you find the acceleration,

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.103
what you get is this.

00:00:23.103 --> 00:00:25.300
That the acceleration of
the five kilogram mass

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.320
is just 29.4 divided by eight kilograms.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.908
But when you do enough of these,
you might start realizing,

00:00:31.908 --> 00:00:34.580
"Wait a minute. 29.4 Newtons.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.122
"That was just the force of gravity

00:00:37.122 --> 00:00:39.180
"pulling on this three kilogram mass."

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.074
In other words,

00:00:40.074 --> 00:00:42.012
the only force that was really propelling

00:00:42.012 --> 00:00:45.272
this whole entire system forward.

00:00:45.272 --> 00:00:48.248
Or at least the only external
force propelling it forward.

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:50.090
And then eight kilograms down here.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.980
You're gonna be like,
"Wait. Eight kilograms?

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.402
"That's just five kilograms
plus three kilograms.

00:00:55.402 --> 00:00:57.442
"Is that just a coincidence

00:00:57.442 --> 00:01:00.137
"or is this telling us
something deep and fundamental?"

00:01:00.137 --> 00:01:02.080
And it's not a coincidence.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.893
Turns out you'll always get this.

00:01:03.893 --> 00:01:06.905
That what you'll end up with
after solving this hard way,

00:01:06.905 --> 00:01:08.775
you'll get in the very end,

00:01:08.775 --> 00:01:12.485
you'll get all the external
forces added up here

00:01:12.485 --> 00:01:14.629
where forces that make it go

00:01:14.629 --> 00:01:17.487
like this force of gravity
end up being positive

00:01:17.487 --> 00:01:20.275
and forces that try to resist the motion.

00:01:20.275 --> 00:01:23.274
So if there was friction, that
would be an external force

00:01:23.274 --> 00:01:26.343
that tries to resist
motion, would be up top

00:01:26.343 --> 00:01:29.531
and then you get the
total mass on the bottom.

00:01:29.531 --> 00:01:30.661
And this makes sense.

00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:33.208
The acceleration of this entire system,

00:01:33.208 --> 00:01:36.016
if we think about it as a single object---

00:01:36.016 --> 00:01:39.437
So if you imagine this
was just one single object

00:01:39.437 --> 00:01:40.668
and you asked yourself,

00:01:40.668 --> 00:01:44.098
"What's the total acceleration
of this entire system?"

00:01:44.098 --> 00:01:46.885
Well, it's only gonna depend
on the external forces

00:01:46.885 --> 00:01:49.928
and in this case, the only
external force making it go

00:01:49.928 --> 00:01:52.469
was this force of gravity right here.

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:53.302
You might object.

00:01:53.302 --> 00:01:54.135
You might be like, "Wait.

00:01:54.135 --> 00:01:55.783
"What about this tension right here?

00:01:55.783 --> 00:01:59.191
"Isn't the tension pulling
on this five kilogram mass

00:01:59.191 --> 00:02:00.986
"making this system go?"

00:02:00.986 --> 00:02:03.976
It is but since it's
an internal force now,

00:02:03.976 --> 00:02:07.461
if we're treating this entire
system as our one object,

00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:09.894
since this tension is
trying to make it go,

00:02:09.894 --> 00:02:11.126
you've got another tension over here

00:02:11.126 --> 00:02:12.980
resisting the motion on this mass,

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.280
trying to make it stop.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.236
That's what internal forces do.

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:17.538
There's always equal and opposite

00:02:17.538 --> 00:02:19.377
on one part of the object than the other

00:02:19.377 --> 00:02:20.859
so you can't propel yourself forward

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:22.388
with an internal force.

00:02:22.388 --> 00:02:24.736
So these end up cancelling
out essentially.

00:02:24.736 --> 00:02:26.030
The only force you have in this case

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.805
was the force of gravity on top,

00:02:27.805 --> 00:02:29.442
only external forces,

00:02:29.442 --> 00:02:31.894
and the total mass on the bottom.

00:02:31.894 --> 00:02:33.113
And that's trick.

00:02:33.113 --> 00:02:35.233
That's the trick to quickly find

00:02:35.233 --> 00:02:37.417
the acceleration of some system

00:02:37.417 --> 00:02:38.890
that might be complicated

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.454
if you had to do it in multiple equations

00:02:40.454 --> 00:02:41.852
and multiple unknowns

00:02:41.852 --> 00:02:44.729
but much, much easier
once you realize this.

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:46.417
So the trick, sometimes it's called

00:02:46.417 --> 00:02:50.649
just "Treating systems
as a single object".

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:51.847
Let me just show you really quick.

00:02:51.847 --> 00:02:54.858
If that made no sense, let me
just show you what this means.

00:02:54.858 --> 00:02:56.652
If we just get rid of this.

00:02:56.652 --> 00:02:58.767
So what I'm claiming is this.

00:02:58.767 --> 00:03:00.245
If you ever have a system

00:03:00.245 --> 00:03:02.692
where multiple objects
are required to move

00:03:02.692 --> 00:03:06.052
with the exact same magnitude
of acceleration, right?

00:03:06.052 --> 00:03:08.338
Because maybe they're
tied together by rope

00:03:08.338 --> 00:03:10.326
or maybe they're pushing on each other.

00:03:10.326 --> 00:03:12.660
Maybe there's many boxes in a row

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.954
and these boxes all have to be pushed

00:03:14.954 --> 00:03:16.252
at the same acceleration

00:03:16.252 --> 00:03:19.427
because they can't get
pushed through each other.

00:03:19.427 --> 00:03:22.884
Right, if there's some
condition where multiple objects

00:03:22.884 --> 00:03:26.191
must have the same
magnitude of acceleration,

00:03:26.191 --> 00:03:30.540
then you can simply find the
acceleration of that system

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.045
as if it were a single object.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:34.281
I'm writing, "SYS" for system.

00:03:34.281 --> 00:03:36.223
By just using Newton's second law,

00:03:36.223 --> 00:03:38.204
but instead of looking
at an individual object

00:03:38.204 --> 00:03:40.034
for a given direction,

00:03:40.034 --> 00:03:43.731
we're just gonna do all
of the external forces,

00:03:43.731 --> 00:03:46.999
all of the external forces on our system,

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:49.043
treat it as if it were a single object,

00:03:49.043 --> 00:03:52.233
divide it by the total mass of our system.

00:03:52.233 --> 00:03:54.843
And so when you plug in
these external forces---

00:03:54.843 --> 00:03:56.025
These are forces that are external

00:03:56.025 --> 00:03:58.755
so external means not
internal to the system.

00:03:58.755 --> 00:04:02.524
So if I think of this five kilogram box

00:04:02.524 --> 00:04:06.555
and this three kilogram
box as a single mass,

00:04:06.555 --> 00:04:08.509
tension would be an internal force

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:13.440
because it's applied internally
between these two objects,

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.973
between objects inside of our system.

00:04:15.973 --> 00:04:18.485
But the force of gravity
on the three kilogram mass,

00:04:18.485 --> 00:04:21.021
that's an external force
'cause that's the Earth

00:04:21.021 --> 00:04:23.275
pulling down on the three kilogram mass

00:04:23.275 --> 00:04:26.498
and the Earth is not part of our system.

00:04:26.498 --> 00:04:29.607
Similarly, the normal
force is an external force

00:04:29.607 --> 00:04:33.203
but it's exactly cancelled
by the gravitational force.

00:04:33.203 --> 00:04:35.114
So even though those are external,

00:04:35.114 --> 00:04:36.212
they're not gonna make it in here.

00:04:36.212 --> 00:04:37.072
I mean, you can put 'em in there

00:04:37.072 --> 00:04:38.509
but they're just gonna cancel anyway.

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:41.515
We only look at forces in
the direction of motion

00:04:41.515 --> 00:04:44.249
and if it's a force that causes motion,

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:46.155
we're gonna make that a positive force.

00:04:46.155 --> 00:04:48.282
If it's a force in the direction of motion

00:04:48.282 --> 00:04:49.936
like this force of gravity is,

00:04:49.936 --> 00:04:51.884
we make those positive forces.

00:04:51.884 --> 00:04:55.708
So forces will be plugged
in positive into here

00:04:55.708 --> 00:04:58.649
if they make the system go.

00:04:58.649 --> 00:05:00.608
And that might seem weird.

00:05:00.608 --> 00:05:01.441
You might be like, "Wait.

00:05:01.441 --> 00:05:03.717
"How do I decide if it
makes the system go?"

00:05:03.717 --> 00:05:06.081
Well, just ask yourself,
"Is that force directed

00:05:06.081 --> 00:05:09.357
"in the same direction as
the motion of the system?"

00:05:09.357 --> 00:05:12.167
So, we're just saying the
system is gonna accelerate

00:05:12.167 --> 00:05:14.251
if there's forces that make it go

00:05:14.251 --> 00:05:17.695
and we're gonna plug in negative forces,

00:05:17.695 --> 00:05:20.321
the forces that make the system stop

00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:22.976
or resist the motion of system.

00:05:22.976 --> 00:05:27.037
So maybe I should say,
"Resist motion of the system."

00:05:27.037 --> 00:05:28.611
In this case, for this one down here,

00:05:28.611 --> 00:05:30.610
I don't have any of those.

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.193
So resist motion of the system.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.933
I don't have any of those.

00:05:35.933 --> 00:05:39.215
I could have if I had a force of friction.

00:05:39.215 --> 00:05:42.994
Then there'd be a external
force that resist the motion.

00:05:42.994 --> 00:05:45.835
I would plug in that
external force as a negative

00:05:45.835 --> 00:05:47.814
'cause it resist the motion.

00:05:47.814 --> 00:05:49.719
So even though this might sound weird,

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:51.929
it makes sense if you think about it.

00:05:51.929 --> 00:05:54.805
The acceleration of our system
treated as a single object

00:05:54.805 --> 00:05:56.671
is only gonna depend on the forces

00:05:56.671 --> 00:05:58.547
that try to make the system go

00:05:58.547 --> 00:06:00.846
and the forces that try
to make the system stop

00:06:00.846 --> 00:06:02.269
or resist the motion.

00:06:02.269 --> 00:06:05.254
So if we add those accordingly
with positives and negatives,

00:06:05.254 --> 00:06:06.614
we divide it by the total mass

00:06:06.614 --> 00:06:09.395
which gives the total measure
of the inertia of our system,

00:06:09.395 --> 00:06:11.387
we'll get the acceleration of our system.

00:06:11.387 --> 00:06:13.190
It makes sense and it works.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.237
Turns out it always works

00:06:14.237 --> 00:06:16.653
and it saves a ridiculous amount of time.

00:06:16.653 --> 00:06:19.110
For instance, if we
wanted to do this problem,

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.124
if you just gave me this
problem straight away

00:06:21.124 --> 00:06:22.928
and you were told, "Do
this however you want.",

00:06:22.928 --> 00:06:24.006
I would use this trick.

00:06:24.006 --> 00:06:27.302
And I would say that the
acceleration of this system

00:06:27.302 --> 00:06:29.497
which is composed of
this five kilogram mass

00:06:29.497 --> 00:06:31.377
and our three kilogram mass

00:06:31.377 --> 00:06:32.513
is just gonna be equal to---

00:06:32.513 --> 00:06:35.443
I'd ask myself, "What
force makes this system go?

00:06:35.443 --> 00:06:37.587
"What force drives this system?"

00:06:37.587 --> 00:06:40.705
And it's this force of gravity
on the three kilogram mass

00:06:40.705 --> 00:06:42.569
that's driving this system, right?

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:44.510
If you took this force away,

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.206
if you eliminated that force,

00:06:46.206 --> 00:06:47.657
nothing's gonna happen here.

00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:49.869
This is the force making the system go

00:06:49.869 --> 00:06:54.036
so I'd put it in my three
kilograms times nine point eight.

00:06:55.643 --> 00:06:56.476
And at this point,

00:06:56.476 --> 00:06:58.654
you might be like, "Well,
okay, that gravity made it go.

00:06:58.654 --> 00:07:00.698
"Should I include this gravity, too?"

00:07:00.698 --> 00:07:04.347
But no, that gravity is
perpendicular to the motion for one

00:07:04.347 --> 00:07:06.890
so this gravity isn't making the system,

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.420
that's just causing this
mass to sit on the table

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.308
and for two, it's cancelled
by that normal force.

00:07:12.308 --> 00:07:13.756
So those cancel anyway,

00:07:13.756 --> 00:07:16.010
even though they're external forces.

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.391
This is it, this is the only
one that drives the system.

00:07:18.391 --> 00:07:21.386
So I put that in here and
I divide by my total mass

00:07:21.386 --> 00:07:23.428
'cause that tells me how
much my system resists

00:07:23.428 --> 00:07:25.245
through inertia,

00:07:25.245 --> 00:07:27.483
changes in velocity,
and this is what I get.

00:07:27.483 --> 00:07:28.534
I get the same thing I got before,

00:07:28.534 --> 00:07:32.085
I get back my three point six eight

00:07:32.085 --> 00:07:35.037
meters per second squared,
and I get in one line.

00:07:35.037 --> 00:07:37.646
I mean, this trick is
amazing and it works,

00:07:37.646 --> 00:07:38.958
and it works in every example

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.825
where two masses or more masses

00:07:40.825 --> 00:07:44.209
are forced to move with
the same acceleration.

00:07:44.209 --> 00:07:46.864
So this is great. This'll
save you a ton of time.

00:07:46.864 --> 00:07:48.661
This is supposed to be a three here.

00:07:48.661 --> 00:07:50.238
And to show you how useful it is,

00:07:50.238 --> 00:07:51.704
let say there was friction,

00:07:51.704 --> 00:07:53.867
let's say there was a
coefficient of friction

00:07:53.867 --> 00:07:56.124
of zero point three.

00:07:56.124 --> 00:07:57.787
Well, now I'd have a frictional force

00:07:57.787 --> 00:08:00.509
so there'd be an external
frictional force here.

00:08:00.509 --> 00:08:02.640
It'd be applied this five kilogram mass.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.508
I'd have to subtract it up here.

00:08:04.508 --> 00:08:06.203
So if I get rid of this---

00:08:06.203 --> 00:08:08.535
So it's not gonna be three
point six eight anymore.

00:08:08.535 --> 00:08:12.699
I'm gonna have a force of
friction that I have to subtract.

00:08:12.699 --> 00:08:16.630
So minus mu K so the force of friction---

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.309
I'll just put force of friction.

00:08:18.309 --> 00:08:21.232
And so to solve for the force of friction,

00:08:21.232 --> 00:08:23.403
the force of friction
is gonna be equal to---

00:08:23.403 --> 00:08:25.610
Well, I know three times
nine point eight is---

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:26.599
Let me just write this in here,

00:08:26.599 --> 00:08:30.766
29.4 Newtons minus the force
of friction it's given by.

00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:34.851
So there's a formula
for force of friction.

00:08:34.851 --> 00:08:38.184
The force of friction is always mu K FN.

00:08:39.193 --> 00:08:41.411
So the force of friction
on this five kilogram mass

00:08:41.411 --> 00:08:44.370
is gonna be mu K which is point three.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:48.067
So it's gonna be zero point
three times the normal force,

00:08:48.067 --> 00:08:50.492
not the normal force on our entire system.

00:08:50.492 --> 00:08:52.451
I don't include this three kilogram mass.

00:08:52.451 --> 00:08:55.318
It's only the normal force
on this five kilogram mass

00:08:55.318 --> 00:08:58.332
that's contributing to this
force of friction here.

00:08:58.332 --> 00:09:00.445
So even though we're treating
this system as a whole,

00:09:00.445 --> 00:09:03.102
we still have to find individual forces

00:09:03.102 --> 00:09:06.434
on this individual boxes correctly.

00:09:06.434 --> 00:09:08.819
So it won't be the entire
mass that goes here.

00:09:08.819 --> 00:09:10.491
The normal force on the five kilogram mass

00:09:10.491 --> 00:09:14.658
is just gonna be five kilograms
times nine point eight

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:19.399
meters per second squared.

00:09:19.399 --> 00:09:21.535
I divide by my total mass down here

00:09:21.535 --> 00:09:26.257
because the entire mass is
resisting motion through inertia.

00:09:26.257 --> 00:09:28.880
And if I solve this from my
acceleration of the system,

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.110
I get one point eight four
meters per seconds squared.

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:35.871
So this is less, less than
our three point six eight

00:09:35.871 --> 00:09:36.849
and that makes sense.

00:09:36.849 --> 00:09:38.642
Now, there's a resistive force,

00:09:38.642 --> 00:09:40.324
a resistive external force,

00:09:40.324 --> 00:09:42.508
tryna prevent the system from moving.

00:09:42.508 --> 00:09:43.824
But you have to be careful.

00:09:43.824 --> 00:09:45.583
What I'm really finding here,

00:09:45.583 --> 00:09:49.100
I'm really finding the
magnitude of the acceleration.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.508
This is just giving me the magnitude.

00:09:50.508 --> 00:09:51.350
If I'm playing this game

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:54.007
where positive forces
are ones that make it go

00:09:54.007 --> 00:09:56.802
and negative forces are
ones that resist motion,

00:09:56.802 --> 00:09:58.389
external forces that is,

00:09:58.389 --> 00:10:00.643
I'm just getting the
magnitude of the acceleration.

00:10:00.643 --> 00:10:03.489
Individual boxes will have that magnitude

00:10:03.489 --> 00:10:04.529
of the acceleration

00:10:04.529 --> 00:10:07.104
but they may have positive
or negative accelerations.

00:10:07.104 --> 00:10:08.039
In other words,

00:10:08.039 --> 00:10:11.289
this five kilogram mass
accelerating to the right,

00:10:11.289 --> 00:10:13.339
gonna have a positive acceleration.

00:10:13.339 --> 00:10:15.877
In other words, the acceleration
of the five kilogram mass

00:10:15.877 --> 00:10:18.197
will be positive one point eight four

00:10:18.197 --> 00:10:20.181
and the acceleration of
the three kilogram mass

00:10:20.181 --> 00:10:21.677
since it's accelerating downward

00:10:21.677 --> 00:10:24.291
will be negative one point eight four

00:10:24.291 --> 00:10:25.124
meters per seconds squared.
