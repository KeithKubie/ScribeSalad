ELIZABETH CHOE: Pulling
together this teaching team,

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.490
I kind of felt like Nick
Fury from The Avengers.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.590
Tapping into all these people
that I came across either

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.250
as a student, or working with.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.452
Video production,
that was something

00:00:22.452 --> 00:00:23.660
that we covered in the class.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.750
It's not a solo
effort, and I think

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.870
teaching video production very
much is not a solo effort.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.920
So Chris and I had been talking
about this for several years,

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.220
I feel like.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.070
Just going through
your class, and then

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.540
talking about the program,
and the videos that we make.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.290
We'd just been tossing
around these ideas.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:50.360
And George and I have
worked together extensively,

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.190
she said with a heavy
sigh, on Science Out Loud.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.980
Josh and I met at a
conference purely by accident.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.040
And I knew you guys were
doing awesome animation work,

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.300
and that was something
that I didn't really

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.090
feel like much expertise on.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.890
Just like storyboarding
in general,

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.890
which is really important for
students, and for everyone

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.049
really.

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.590
And then we had a couple other
guest speakers here and there.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.130
So it was really--
so teaching something

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.461
that doesn't have an
objective answer, in physics

00:01:31.461 --> 00:01:33.710
there's a right answer to a
problem set, for instance.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.170
In media production or creative
writing, or anything like this,

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.390
you can't just be
like, well this

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.970
is what makes a good
answer, necessarily.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.230
I feel like something
that helps solidify,

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.760
or helps you come to a
good feedback mechanism

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.310
for students is
to have people who

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.020
are good practitioners of
whatever media you're making.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.880
So, you know, if you're
teaching creative writing,

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.690
hopefully you'd be a pretty
good creative writer.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.370
If you're teaching media
production, or storyboarding,

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.990
hopefully you're a good
animator, or story boarder.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.910
Hopefully you're a decent host.

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:13.380
JOSHUA GUNN: Fair to middling.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.650
GEORGE ZAIDAN: I know, right?

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.150
Tolerable.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.070
ELIZABETH CHOE: So that
was why from the beginning

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.152
I felt like it had to be team
effort to teach this class.

00:02:26.152 --> 00:02:27.860
GEORGE ZAIDAN: I think
you had a skeleton

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.770
outline for the
course, and then you

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.890
filled in the parts, the
learning objectives for parts

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.940
that you were going to
do, and then each of us

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.330
filled in our parts, and
then we all commented

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.740
on the other people's parts.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.510
Which was a good way to do it.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.170
ELIZABETH CHOE: It's
tricky because, its not

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.300
like a linear sort of knowledge
comprehension format where

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.050
first you learn
scripting, and then you

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.970
can learn storyboarding, and
then you can learn hosting.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.920
That's actually how we
first approached it,

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.509
and it got really hairy because
there's so much overlap.

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:01.300
GEORGE ZAIDAN: Why?

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.390
ELIZABETH CHOE: Why did
we approach it that way?

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.140
GEORGE ZAIDAN: No.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.300
Why did it get hairy?

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.600
ELIZABETH CHOE: Well,
because I think Chris,

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.884
initially you wanted--

00:03:08.884 --> 00:03:10.620
CHRIS BOEBEL: I caused
all the trouble.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.300
GEORGE ZAIDAN: What did you do?

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.750
ELIZABETH CHOE: I'm like,
well what should I talk about?

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.220
CHRIS BOEBEL: Yeah, there
was a lot of coordination

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.140
that we-- Josh and I,
especially, I think,

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.450
we felt the need to coordinate.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.525
Because there are
things that are

00:03:22.525 --> 00:03:24.150
similar when you're
thinking about kind

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.360
of telling a story in
animation and in live action,

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.640
but there are also things
that are different.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.330
And we wanted to make sure
that we weren't overlapping

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.780
each other, and that we were
kind of complementary and not

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.387
repetitive or contradictory.

00:03:37.387 --> 00:03:39.220
So I think we ended up
kind of restructuring

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:46.125
a little bit the first few
sessions of the course.

00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:47.304
I'm trying to remember.

00:03:47.304 --> 00:03:48.720
ELIZABETH CHOE:
It was interesting

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.390
because in terms of the big
picture learning objectives,

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.130
I worked with Jaime a lot,
the other course instructor.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.180
And she has never
done video production.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.370
She wasn't familiar
with the content.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.650
But she's more familiar with
just instructional design

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.776
in general.

00:04:06.776 --> 00:04:08.400
So she would ask me
all these questions

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.110
that I wouldn't necessarily
think to ask or answer,

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.530
like at the end of the
day, what are the skills

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.320
that you want people to have?

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.519
And then what are the sort of
learning objectives that you

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.890
want them to aspire to?

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.305
And those are two very
different things, right?

00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:28.790
Because I don't really care if
they were masters of Final Cut

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.290
by the end, because that
doesn't really matter.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.510
The objective is can you
articulate a clear story?

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.710
But she and I would
meet to sort of figure

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.710
out what are the big
picture learning objectives

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.890
that we want, and
then it was a matter

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.400
of how can we take all these
details and all these very

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.080
important plastic elements, and
pick at the most relevant ones

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.380
to match to the objectives.
