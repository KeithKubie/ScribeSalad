01:20:27.710 --> 01:20:27.720
whole process behind it you know that
 

01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:29.390

01:47:34.420 --> 01:47:37.050
question about is there a feminism which

01:47:37.050 --> 01:47:37.060
is disinterested I think it's really
 

01:47:37.060 --> 01:47:40.410
is disinterested I think it's really
difficult to say that there is because

01:47:40.410 --> 01:47:40.420
difficult to say that there is because
 

01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:43.230
difficult to say that there is because
you know if we understand feminism

01:47:43.230 --> 01:47:43.240

01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:46.220
you know if we understand feminism
really as a movement

01:47:46.220 --> 01:47:46.230
really as a movement
 

01:47:46.230 --> 01:47:50.370
really as a movement
built on gender identity or women's

01:47:50.370 --> 01:47:50.380

built on gender identity or women's
experiences of violence or whatever

01:47:53.490 --> 01:47:53.500

01:47:56.580 --> 01:47:56.590
of course we are leaving out you know
 

01:47:56.590 --> 01:48:00.420
of course we are leaving out you know
many groups of women and and so you know

01:48:00.420 --> 01:48:00.430
many groups of women and and so you know
 

01:48:00.430 --> 01:48:04.800
many groups of women and and so you know
we we know that this whatever was called

01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:04.810
we we know that this whatever was called
 

01:48:04.810 --> 01:48:06.780

class and sexual identities and all that

01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:13.330
class and sexual identities and all that
 

01:48:13.330 --> 01:48:15.900
class and sexual identities and all that
right so it's hard to say that it's

01:48:15.900 --> 01:48:15.910
right so it's hard to say that it's
 

01:48:15.910 --> 01:48:17.730

the interest is right what is our
 

01:48:21.190 --> 01:48:23.070
the interest is right what is our
interest and I think that is the whole

01:48:23.070 --> 01:48:23.080

because if we're saying at the same time

01:51:17.180 --> 01:51:17.190
because if we're saying at the same time
 

01:51:17.190 --> 01:51:19.940
because if we're saying at the same time
that we have gendered identities and we

01:51:19.940 --> 01:51:19.950
that we have gendered identities and we
 

01:51:19.950 --> 01:51:21.530

from that I mean that what I'm

01:51:27.530 --> 01:51:27.540
from that I mean that what I'm
 

01:51:27.540 --> 01:51:28.880
from that I mean that what I'm
suggesting is that there could be

01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:28.890
suggesting is that there could be
 

01:51:28.890 --> 01:51:31.370
suggesting is that there could be
perhaps another way to contest out that

01:51:31.370 --> 01:51:31.380
