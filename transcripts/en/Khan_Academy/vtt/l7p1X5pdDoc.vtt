00:00:00.389 --> 00:00:04.054
Voiceover:Let's say that
you've got some matrix C,

00:00:04.054 --> 00:00:05.950
trying my best to bold it,

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.814
to make sure you realize
that this is a matrix.

00:00:08.814 --> 00:00:14.068
Let's say that we know that it has a rows

00:00:14.068 --> 00:00:16.108
and b columns.

00:00:16.108 --> 00:00:20.355
It's an a by b matrix.

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:23.452
Let's say that we are going to multiply it

00:00:23.452 --> 00:00:27.765
by some identity matrix.

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:30.854
Once again let me do my
best to attempt to bold this

00:00:30.854 --> 00:00:31.962
right over here.

00:00:31.962 --> 00:00:35.426
We're going to multiply the
identity matrix I times C

00:00:35.426 --> 00:00:37.738
and of course we are going to get C again

00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:40.043
because that's the identity matrix,

00:00:40.043 --> 00:00:42.086
that's the property of
the identity matrix.

00:00:42.086 --> 00:00:46.503
Of course C, we already
know is an a by b matrix.

00:00:46.503 --> 00:00:51.978
A rows and b columns.

00:00:54.193 --> 00:00:57.312
Based on this, what
are the dimensions of I

00:00:57.312 --> 00:00:58.608
going to be?

00:00:58.608 --> 00:01:02.802
I encourage you to pause
this video and think about it

00:01:02.802 --> 00:01:03.963
on your own.

00:01:03.963 --> 00:01:06.680
We've already done this
exercise a little bit,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.037
where we first looked at identity matrices

00:01:09.037 --> 00:01:10.522
but now we're doing it with a very ...

00:01:10.522 --> 00:01:11.773
We're multiplying the identity matrix

00:01:11.773 --> 00:01:13.594
times a very general matrix.

00:01:13.594 --> 00:01:15.834
I'm just even speaking in generalities

00:01:15.834 --> 00:01:17.157
about these dimensions.

00:01:17.157 --> 00:01:19.874
Well one thing we know is
that matrix multiplication

00:01:19.874 --> 00:01:20.991
is only defined

00:01:20.991 --> 00:01:23.016
is if the column, the number of columns

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:25.932
of the first matrix is
equal to the number of rows

00:01:25.932 --> 00:01:27.228
of the second matrix.

00:01:27.228 --> 00:01:35.449
This one has a rows, so this
one's going to have a columns.

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:38.696
Now how many rows is
this one going to have?

00:01:38.696 --> 00:01:41.477
We already know that matrix
multiplication is only defined

00:01:41.477 --> 00:01:43.474
if the number of columns
on the first matrix

00:01:43.474 --> 00:01:45.620
is equal to the number of
rows on the second one.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:54.615
We know that the product
gets its number of rows

00:01:54.615 --> 00:01:56.365
from the number of rows

00:01:56.365 --> 00:01:58.794
of the first matrix being multiplied.

00:01:58.794 --> 00:02:01.593
The product has a rows

00:02:01.593 --> 00:02:03.690
then the identity matrix right over here

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.975
has to have a rows.

00:02:05.975 --> 00:02:08.610
What's interesting about this?

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.058
When we first got introduced
to identity matrices,

00:02:12.058 --> 00:02:13.651
we were multiplying,

00:02:13.651 --> 00:02:15.837
we picked out a three by three example

00:02:15.837 --> 00:02:17.870
and we got a three by
three identity matrix.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.353
What's interesting about what
we've just proven to ourselves

00:02:21.353 --> 00:02:24.321
is the identity matrix for any matrix,

00:02:24.321 --> 00:02:25.889
even a non square matrix,

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:27.888
a and b could be two different values.

00:02:27.888 --> 00:02:30.741
The identity matrix for any matrix

00:02:30.741 --> 00:02:33.288
is going to be a square matrix.

00:02:33.288 --> 00:02:37.345
It's going to have the same number of rows

00:02:37.345 --> 00:02:39.208
and the same number of columns.

00:02:39.208 --> 00:02:41.603
When we think about identity matrices,

00:02:41.603 --> 00:02:45.515
we can really just say, well
is this the identity matrix

00:02:45.515 --> 00:02:46.886
that is a four by four?

00:02:46.886 --> 00:02:47.745
Is it a three by three?

00:02:47.745 --> 00:02:48.707
Is it a two by two?

00:02:48.707 --> 00:02:50.724
Or I guess one by one?

00:02:52.846 --> 00:02:55.240
The convention is, it isn't
even to write identity

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.166
two by two is equal to
one, zero, zero, one.

00:03:00.166 --> 00:03:02.911
The convention is actually just write I2

00:03:02.911 --> 00:03:04.997
because you know it's
going to be a two by two.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.157
It's going to be a two by two matrix,

00:03:08.157 --> 00:03:10.320
it's going to be one, zero, zero, one.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.099
Identity five is going to
be a five by five matrix.

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.394
It's going to be one,
one, two, three, four.

00:03:16.394 --> 00:03:19.121
Zero, one, two, one, three.

00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:22.206
Zero, zero, one, zero, zero.

00:03:22.206 --> 00:03:25.006
Zero ... you get the idea,

00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:27.795
zero, zero, zero, one, zero.

00:03:27.795 --> 00:03:30.266
Zero, zero, zero, zero, one.

00:03:31.004 --> 00:03:32.130
Just like that.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.671
The whole point here is just to realize

00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:34.857
that your identity matrix

00:03:34.857 --> 00:03:37.152
is always going to be a square matrix

00:03:37.152 --> 00:03:39.356
and it works even when you're multiplying

00:03:39.356 --> 00:03:42.227
non square other matrices.
