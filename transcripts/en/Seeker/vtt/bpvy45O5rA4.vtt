00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:08.130
The International Space Station contributed
data to science, kept 200 souls alive in space

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.420
and, travelled more than 1.5 billion miles.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.670
I think that's pretty good, right?

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:21.839
Let's pack it 
in.

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:26.220
Back in 2010, the U.S. considered abandoning
the ISS because of problems with the Russian-made

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.759
Soyuz launch vehicles, and political fights
have caused tension since then too.

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.610
Russia has just signed on to continue supporting
the International Space Station until 2024

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.050
rather than building a Russian-only station.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.039
The International Space Station is an incredible
piece of multinational technology, with former

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:46.899
nemeses coming together to create this football-field-sized
scientific space camp.

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.030
But it's expensive, and not getting any younger…
or cheaper.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.480
Plans to build the ISS began in 1993 and it
was completed in 2011.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.030
It's larger than a six bedroom house and weighs
almost a million pounds.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.230
A rotating crew of humans have been sheltered
in the station continuously since 2000, creating

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.320
the need for 130-plus launches to build and
supply the place.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.850
The ISS is the single most expensive man-made
object in existence; costing 160 billion dollars

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.850
to date.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.810
The U.S. ponied up $100 billion, while Japan,
Canada, Europe and Russia chipped in for the

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:20.810
rest.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.060
That's a huge drawback in a lot of eyes.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.229
Is a 90s-era piece of solar-powered science
technology worth keeping around?

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.670
The damn thing was running WindowsXP until
2013!

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.600
Now it's on Linux.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.020
In a word, yes.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.899
Though the station is not without its problems
-- according to one NASA Administrator, micrometeoroids

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.070
and orbital debris are a concern and the solar
arrays already look like a QUOTE "west Texas

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.859
stop sign," but it's the only microgravity
lab we have, and simply by existing it's fostering

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:56.310
political cooperation between 15 countries
and creating jobs the world over.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.450
Building the ISS was really hard, and that
drove people to invent new technology and

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.100
create new science.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.310
Since the first crew arrived, the ISS has
hosted more than 200 people who've completed

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:15.100
over 180 spacewalks and 278 research projects
comprising 1000 experiments,; each one teaching

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.830
us about our planet or the life upon it, how
it all fits together, how our organisms survive

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.350
in space AND how they survive on Earth.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.270
Maintaining and supporting these intrepid
explorers is great for jobs in research, science,

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.100
engineering, manufacturing, and even vocational
skills both at home and abroad.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.710
Commercial space alone is said to create nearly
12-thousand jobs a year!

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.160
And space-based research led to vaccines for
salmonella and antibiotic resistant bacteria,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.270
new ways to treat cancer, robotic surgical
techniques, and on and on.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.760
According to the NASA Administrator in charge
of the ISS -- they can conceivably keep it

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.820
maintained and working until 2024, but after
that it's iffy.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.520
The components should survive until 2028,
NASA says, and the next 10 years will be filled

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.510
with even MORE experiments on the humans living
in space, the Earth's climate, and getting

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.780
humans into deep space.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.160
If we want to visit asteroids or go to Mars,
we need to learn more about how microgravity

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.150
affects humans; what better place than a science
lab in microgravity!?

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.770
With NASA and the ISS's help, private space
companies will compete to get up there, driving

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.480
down costs to get to low-earth orbit!

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.430
Even politicians are on board with keeping
the station flying, recognizing it shows America

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.900
QUOTE "continues to hold the high ground."

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.020
And over time we're going to see MORE return
on the investment as this is the early stages

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.380
of ISS experiments

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.200
In 15 years or so, the ISS will likely have
to be de-orbited -- or purposefully crashed

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.690
into the ocean.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:46.972
That will be a sad day.

00:03:46.972 --> 00:03:50.720
But for now, the ISS is our last best hope,
for space science.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.030
