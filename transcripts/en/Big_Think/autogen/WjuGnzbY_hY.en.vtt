00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.519
one of the things that we've discovered

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529
one of the things that we've discovered
 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.549
one of the things that we've discovered
in the science is that children who

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559
in the science is that children who
 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.220
in the science is that children who
already have moral intuitions from the

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230
already have moral intuitions from the
 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.720
already have moral intuitions from the
time they're extremely young

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730
time they're extremely young
 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.359
time they're extremely young
so even 14 month olds will go out of

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369
so even 14 month olds will go out of
 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.460
so even 14 month olds will go out of
their way to try to help someone else

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470
their way to try to help someone else
 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.099
their way to try to help someone else
who's in trouble and there's even some

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109
who's in trouble and there's even some
 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.840
who's in trouble and there's even some
evidence that this is true for babies

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850
evidence that this is true for babies
 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.720
evidence that this is true for babies
for infants so the old picture that we

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730
for infants so the old picture that we
 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.810
for infants so the old picture that we
had about moral development was that

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820
had about moral development was that
 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.429
had about moral development was that
children started out being these amoral

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439
children started out being these amoral
 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.069
children started out being these amoral
egocentric creatures and then they had

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079
egocentric creatures and then they had
 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.280
egocentric creatures and then they had
to be socialized into being moral or

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290
to be socialized into being moral or
 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.530
to be socialized into being moral or
caring about other people and that view

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540
caring about other people and that view
 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.590
caring about other people and that view
is sort of exactly the opposite of the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600
is sort of exactly the opposite of the
 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.080
is sort of exactly the opposite of the
view that we have now there was a column

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090
view that we have now there was a column
 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.479
view that we have now there was a column
in the New York Times that said oh you

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489
in the New York Times that said oh you
 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.610
in the New York Times that said oh you
know someone like like Donald Trump is

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620
know someone like like Donald Trump is
 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.220
know someone like like Donald Trump is
like a two-year-old and I was extremely

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230
like a two-year-old and I was extremely
 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.600
like a two-year-old and I was extremely
irritated thought about writing a letter

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610
irritated thought about writing a letter
 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.490
irritated thought about writing a letter
to say that's a terrible insult to

two-year-olds two-year-olds are not
 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.840
two-year-olds two-year-olds are not
narcissistic and egocentric and only

challenge is to try to give children

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180
challenge is to try to give children
 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.539
challenge is to try to give children
information and encouragement for those

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549
information and encouragement for those
 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.880
information and encouragement for those
natural tendencies towards altruism no

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890
natural tendencies towards altruism no
 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.649
natural tendencies towards altruism no
it has to be said that we have a lot of

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659
it has to be said that we have a lot of
 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.789
it has to be said that we have a lot of
evidence that that natural tendency

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799
evidence that that natural tendency
 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.219
evidence that that natural tendency
towards altruism towards helping for

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229
towards altruism towards helping for
 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.870
towards altruism towards helping for
others being empathic to others caring

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880
others being empathic to others caring
 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.450
others being empathic to others caring
for others seems to go hand-in-hand with

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460
for others seems to go hand-in-hand with
 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.330
for others seems to go hand-in-hand with
a tendency to split people up into an

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340
a tendency to split people up into an
 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.789
a tendency to split people up into an
in-group the people that we're empathic

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799
in-group the people that we're empathic
 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.469
in-group the people that we're empathic
for and take care of and then an

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479
for and take care of and then an
 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.389
for and take care of and then an
out-group the others and the others are

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399
out-group the others and the others are
 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.130
out-group the others and the others are
the ones that we don't have to take care

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140
the ones that we don't have to take care
 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.990
the ones that we don't have to take care
of and those two things from an

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000
of and those two things from an
 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.580
of and those two things from an
evolutionary perspective even from

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590
evolutionary perspective even from
 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.260
evolutionary perspective even from
physiological neuroscience perspective

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270
physiological neuroscience perspective
 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.050
physiological neuroscience perspective
seem to go hand-in-hand so the challenge

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060
seem to go hand-in-hand so the challenge
 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.260
seem to go hand-in-hand so the challenge
for a parent is to say give give

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270
for a parent is to say give give
 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.899
for a parent is to say give give
children a sense of encouraging that

children a sense of encouraging that
 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.910
children a sense of encouraging that
sense of belonging and caring about

other people without also having a sense
that you only do that for your group

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
that you only do that for your group
 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:21.650
that you only do that for your group
you cannot care about the other group

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660
 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.720
