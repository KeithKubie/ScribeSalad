Hi everyone

00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:05.680
In this video, we will be talking about two
topics of 3D chapter for

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.210
mathematics of JEE preparation.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.349
The topics are: doing problems on finding
perpendicular distance of a point from line

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.880
and we will be finding equations of a line
perpendicular to two lines given.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:27.870
These are small topics but as in other maths
topics, you should learn the approach to solve

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:28.870
problems like these.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.910
Let us start by finding perpendicular distance
of a point from a line.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.870
We have a line given.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:43.010
Let us saw we have point A, and that is a_vector,
and we have been given b_vector, which is

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.470
the parallel vector.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.670
And we have been given a point P. Let us call
it p_vector.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.479
And we have been asked to find the perpendicular
distance of the point from the line.

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:58.999
You may recall these kind of problems in 2D
in straight lines.

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:02.430
But now its 3D or 3-Dimensinal Geometry.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.030
So how will we solve this problem?

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:13.270
One of the approaches to start this to think
that there is a point C here, let us call

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.270
it c_vector.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.550
And the idea is that we know,

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.680
c_vector=a_vector + \lambda b_vector

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.680
because this point is on the line.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.760
And, PC_vector is perpendicular to b_vector.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.800
This is what we know, right?

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.590
These are the two conditions we know for the
PC_vector to be perpendicular to the parallel

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.590
vector because this is perpendicular to the
line, so it has to be perpendicular to the

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.270
parallel vector.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.310
It should flash to you that the condition
of perpendicularity it PC_vector \dot b_vector

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.310
= 0.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.620
Again, the knowledge of vectors is super critical
in this chapter.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.650
I have emphasized that many times in the last
two videos also.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.630
PC_vector is nothing but c_vector - p_vector.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.810
Thus, c_vector-p_vector \dot b_vector = 0.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:19.150
And c_vector is nothing but (a_vector + \lambda
b_vector - p_vector) \dot b =0.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:31.020
If you were to find the value of \lambda,
you will get, \lambda = ( (p_vector - a_vector)

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.000
\dot b_vector, divided by |b|^2.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Now you have got the value of \lambda, so you can calculate the point, and then you can calculate the distance.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.900
I hope you are able to understand and follow
what we are doing here. You can solve this

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
equation using the associative property by
opening the brackets, and rearranging, you get this.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.000
Let us do a problem on this so that you can
quickly understand.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:33.000
You have been given P=(1,2,3). And the line
is (x-6)/3 = (y-7)/2 = (z-7)/(-2).

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:44.000
How will we find \lambda? I will suggest
you to remember this but you may want to derive it in the paper.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.800
It is up to you. I will recommend
you to remember this, it is

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.050
very easy to remember ( (p_vector - a_vector)
\dot b_vector ) / |b_vector|^2.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:04:02.000
Here,
p_vector = i_cap + 2j_cap+ 3k_cap

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:24.000
a_vector = 6i_cap + 7j_cap+ 7k_cap
b_vector = 3i_cap + 2j_cap - 2k_cap

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.660
If I were to find \lambda here, this would
become

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:46.150
p_vector - a_vector is -5i - 5j - 4k \dot
with 3i + 2j -2k

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.460
( (p_vector - a_vector) \dot b_vector ) / |b_vector|^2.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:59.090
|b_vector|^2 = 3^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 8 + 9 = 17.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:10.070
If you will do this, this will become: -15-10+8
= -17.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:16.120
Thus \lambda = -1.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:35.169
The point c_vector = a_vector - b_vector,
and it comes out to be, 3i_cap + 5j_cap +

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:36.600
9k_cap.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:52.300
And the distance |PC| = (2^2+3^2+6^2)^(1/2)
= 7.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:06:01.790
You know the vector PC now, so you can find
the distance by taking the sum of x_component^2,

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:07.310
y_component^2 and z_component^2, and that
comes out to be 7.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.180
And I hope that is very obvious for you to
solve these types of problems. If you are

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.850
still not very comfortable, please practice.
Just make some problems yourself, make an

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:22.290
equation of a line, find a point, and then
do the problem. It is very easy. If you do

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.750
this several times, it should be quick for
you to remember.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:38.919
Let me give you one more HW problem so that
you can do it on your own. And the HW problem

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:41.620
is:

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:58.880
Find a point on y_axis such that

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:16.290
perpendicular distance from the point to line
x=y=z is unity.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:24.800
So this is an opposite question. You have
been given the task to find the point on y-axis

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.550
such that the perpendicular distance from
the line to the point is unity. So, how will

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:29.550
you do this problem?

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:38.120
You can assume a point: (0, k, 0), and proceed
now, completely the same way. You can very

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:43.259
quickly find the value of this thing (\lambda),
and then you can calculate PC, and you can

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:45.139
equate it to 1, to find the value of k.

00:07:45.139 --> 00:07:51.460
Please do this problem. This will give you
a nice practice to solve the problems of perpendicular

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:57.310
distance of a point from a line.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:05.910
Let us do another problem which I wanted to
do. I will not be giving you any method, I

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:12.699
just want to do an example problem since that
example will be enough to understand the topic.

00:08:12.699 --> 00:08:14.770
The question says we have been given two lines:

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:23.590
(x-1)/1 = (y-2)/2 = (z-3)/3, L1 is this

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:40.729
L2 has been given as (x-2)/4 = (y-3)/5 = (z-1)/6.

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:56.990
The

00:08:56.990 --> 00:09:09.630
question says find the line
perpendicular to L1 and L2 and passing through

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:21.350
1,1,1. How to solve this problem?

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:26.410
So you have been given line L1. Let me write
answer here:

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:33.839
Let us say this is L1 and this is L2. You
have been given a1_vector, b1_vector, a2_vector,

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:42.720
b2_vector. You have been asked to find line
3 for which you know that it is perpendicular

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.930
to both, and it passes through the point.

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:48.830
To find the equation of line, you need a point,
which you already have, and you need a parallel

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:53.990
vector. What is speciality of parallel vector?
That the line is perpendicular to line L1

00:09:53.990 --> 00:10:02.310
and L2. Hence, the parallel vector will be
perpendicular to both b1 and b2.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:06.519
And as soon as I say this, it should flash
into your mind, that this is basically asking

00:10:06.519 --> 00:10:10.560
you to take a cross product. Thats it.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:15.810
If you cannot recall this, please become more
thorough with understanding the physical meaning

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:20.600
of dot product and cross product. We have
discussed here dot product: perpendicularity

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.820
condition of dot product already. We have
done in the last video, that dot product is

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:31.519
used for finding angles. So as soon as I say,
it should come to your mind, the vector perpendicular

00:10:31.519 --> 00:10:35.220
to two vectors is the cross product of two
vectors.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:42.320
So what you have to do is that you have to
find b3_vector = b1 \cross b2, and if you

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:51.640
do, you should remember that for cross product
you have to do this i, j, k â€” and opening

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:52.730
up the determinant.

00:10:52.730 --> 00:11:06.890
So if you do that, this will be: i(-3) + j(6)
+ k(-3). Is this perpendicular to b1 and b2?

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:14.770
You should remember that condition of perpendicularity
is dot product is zero.

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:21.800
So if you take -3 + 12 - 9, that is dotted
with b1, it comes out to be 0.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:27.029
If you dot with b2, -12 + 30 -18, so 30 - 30
= 0. So it is perpendicular to both b1 and

00:11:27.029 --> 00:11:28.029
b2.

00:11:28.029 --> 00:11:29.700
And you already have point.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:44.529
So the equation of line L3 could be easily
written as: (x-1)/3 = (y-1)/6 = (z-1)/(-3).

00:11:44.529 --> 00:11:52.029
This line is perpendicular to both the lines
and passes through (1,1,1).

00:11:52.029 --> 00:11:56.630
I hope that you are able to understand this,
understand how important the understanding

00:11:56.630 --> 00:12:02.220
of vectors is, and how to solve the problems.
We discussed two things here: how to find

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:07.910
the perpendicular distance of a point from
a line. For that, we can remember this formula

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:15.220
of \lambda. Calculate \lambda, calculate the
point, and when you get the coordinates of

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:19.670
the point, you subtract from the original
point to get the distance. I have given you

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:22.390
a homework problem, so please do that at home.

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:27.380
And then we did a problem of finding a line
perpendicular to two lines. For that you are

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:31.580
taking the cross product of the parallel vectors,
and then you will get the equation of the

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:32.580
line.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.970
I hope you enjoyed this video. There are a
lot more interesting videos and topics in

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:39.600
this chapter. So I hope to see you in the
next video. Thank you.
