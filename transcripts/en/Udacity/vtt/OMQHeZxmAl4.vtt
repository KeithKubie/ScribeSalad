00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.490
Investors see thousands
of deals every year and

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.420
they are in a place where they can
really select the ones that they feel

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.281
close affinity with, believe in and
want to go with going forward.

00:00:13.281 --> 00:00:15.582
So, for
them it's really about a matter of fit.

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:19.870
At a very high level,
I think they look at three categories.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.035
The first category, the team.

00:00:21.035 --> 00:00:24.480
They look at the team and they want
to be in a place where they invest in

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.870
people that they say, hey I want
to work with this entrepreneur for

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.730
the next five to seven years and beyond.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.750
So do they have good
chemistry with the person?

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.359
Do they think they're the right
team to push the startup forward?

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.360
The second category they
look at is the market.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.680
Is the market opportunity big?

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.440
Is this something really
worth going after?

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.620
Is there a big problem to be solved
here and do I think there's a good match

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.890
between the team and the market
opportunity they're going after?

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.300
And the third item is the product or the
technology of what the team has done so

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.000
far to actually showcase that there's
a chance they'll exceed on their vision.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.590
So those three things and
in each place the team, the market,

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.020
the product, investors look at a slew
of things and sometimes they decide

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.800
not to invest because they think
the market is not big enough or

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.070
the team is great but
maybe don't have the expertise.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.800
Maybe the product is too early.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.930
And they want to see more proof points,
but

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.050
those are the three big buckets of
items I think most investors look at.
