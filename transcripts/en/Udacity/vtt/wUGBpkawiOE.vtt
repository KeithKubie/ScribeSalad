00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.350
I've presented a very basic introduction
to FHIR which is still very much

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:06.890
in development and testing.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.490
The standard encompasses many
other issues including what

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.990
values termed value sets

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.630
are allowed to define structured
data elements within resources.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.280
I encourage you to explore further and

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.010
stay up to date as
the standard develops.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.807
Recently for example, an article
appeared proposing three new FHIR

00:00:29.807 --> 00:00:33.212
resources to represent
patients genomic data.

00:00:33.212 --> 00:00:37.520
According to Grahame Grieve, a key
challenge facing the FHIR standards

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.182
development effort is achieving the
right balance between functionality and

00:00:42.182 --> 00:00:43.040
complexity.

00:00:44.055 --> 00:00:47.970
FHIR is not intended to
represent all of healthcare.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.130
Rather, it is intended to
contain the key resources and

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.420
details needed to represent the most
common elements of healthcare.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.560
I've served on standard
development teams, and

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.410
it is entirely predictable that
people whose favorite use case isn't

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.260
perfectly covered will push for
inclusion of more and more detail.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.690
Doing so clearly risks
creating the very complexity

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.280
that led to the idea of
FHIR in the first place.
