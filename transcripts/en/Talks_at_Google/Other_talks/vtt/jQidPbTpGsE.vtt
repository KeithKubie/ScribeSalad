00:00:02.162 --> 00:00:04.120
DR. JOHANNES FREIESLEBEN:
Ladies and gentleman,

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.840
70% of all employees
are unhappy at work.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.440
70%.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.360
This is at least if
we trust in Gallup.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.690
Gallup came up with this study.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.800
It's an ongoing, daily
job engagement study

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.060
that they conducted since 2000.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.520
And they found that around
30% of all employees

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.700
are the employees that
companies really love.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.830
They are engaged, they're
happy in what they do,

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.890
they are passionate about what
they do, they're productive,

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.240
but 50% are not engaged.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.080
Are not engaged.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.370
They're sleepwalking,
they're not doing much.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.280
They're not doing harm
either, but 20% do.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.230
20% are actively disengaged.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.780
This is a study for the US.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:56.790
It's on a daily basis.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.130
90,000 employees participate,
roughly, on a daily basis.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.180
Well, one thing I
learned at university

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.810
is that you never
trust only one study.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.600
So there are several studies out
there on unhappiness at work,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.230
and you end up with
very different results

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.250
depending on the study
design, on the participants,

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.370
and on the scaling, and
the definitions you use.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.000
So the range is big.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.360
Some studies for
Germany-- recent studies--

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.380
say 49% are unhappy.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.830
And a big international
consultancy

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.720
came even up with 90%,
which I personally think

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.860
has a hidden agenda behind it.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.690
Most likely they want to sell
some improvement programs,

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.030
but it is a large number.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.900
It is a large number.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.680
And the question is why is that.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.630
Why do we have so much
unhappiness at work?

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.955
I take questions after the talk.

00:01:52.955 --> 00:01:53.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:54.740
DR. JOHANNES FREIESLEBEN: OK.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.240
OK.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.220
Good.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.090
It is a very sorry
state as well,

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.350
if you think about it, because
happiness is maybe the biggest

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.210
gift mother nature gave to
us, in terms of feelings

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.310
that we can experience.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.170
It's a very beautiful
feeling, sensually beautiful.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.210
And it connects us with
a lot of philosophers,

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.400
religious thinkers,
even statesmen.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.540
I mean, all of you know that
the founding fathers of the US,

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.900
they put it even in the
Declaration of Independence,

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.380
that the strive for
happiness is essentially

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.620
a self-evident pursuit
of the human being.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.050
And I think self-evident
it is, because we all

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.010
strive for happiness.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.550
Every single day.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.150
Most of us even say
this is a life goal.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.120
We want to be happy at the end.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.840
So as a scientist,
you are confronted

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.110
with many, many concepts.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.610
Right?

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.040
And what I love to do is
try to put some numbers

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.180
behind concepts, because
sometimes these concepts they

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.270
just sound great, but you want
to see what's the impact of it.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.840
So let's make a little
hypothetical calculation.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.120
We are all in Switzerland.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.290
We have 8.3 million
inhabitants in Switzerland,

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.050
out of whom about four
million are employees.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.870
And let's assume that
since Switzerland

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.190
is a beautiful country-- you
have beautiful mountains,

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.520
lots of chocolate around-- that
only 30% are unhappy at work.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.120
Only 30%.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.360
Not 70, not 50, only 30.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.300
That makes 1.2 million.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.520
Let us assume for the
ease of calculation

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.200
that we could magically lift
up their happiness by 10%.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.840
So let's say 10% of the
work time gets more happy.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.040
On the basis of about
2000 hours per year--

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.250
that's 200 hours per person--
that's 240 million more happy

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.940
work hours.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.630
That is a lot.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.190
And I will show you
in a minute there

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.700
is a direct correlation between
happiness and productivity.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.050
So if you think about, 240
million more productive

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:06.190
work hours per year, that has
a big impact on the society.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.310
And you can do the calculation
for all of the countries

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.170
that we have participants from.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.709
The American scholar and
poet William Lloyd Phelps

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.260
said, about 70 years
ago, the happiest people

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.390
are those who think the
most interesting thoughts.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.040
And I think he is right.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.620
I think he is totally right.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.330
And interesting thoughts are
the drivers of all progress.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.760
For us and for all societies.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.450
So why have so many
people unhappy?

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:39.420
What a waste.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.540
Isn't it?

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.150
What I want to discuss with
you in the next 60 minutes

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.650
is ways of getting out
of this situation, ways

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.850
of improving happiness at work.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.960
And I will present you
a little bit of theory,

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.420
but then I want to present to
you a model that we developed.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.420
A structural model of
how to organize a company

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:00.750
to make people more happy.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.660
But first of all, happiness
is such an essential concept

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.670
that you have a lot of
different perceptions about it,

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.372
so let's define it first.

00:05:14.372 --> 00:05:16.330
It's important to
distinguish it from pleasure.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.220
Pleasure is a
momentary satisfaction.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.450
Ice cream on a hot day, you
consume it, you are happy.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.440
When it's done, it's done,
you're not happy anymore.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.990
Happiness has two main
aspects, and one is hedonic

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.810
and the other is eudaimonic.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.104
Hedonic happiness is
the external happiness.

00:05:36.104 --> 00:05:38.270
That is all the external
events that make you happy.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.410
For instance, your boss
gives you a thumbs up.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.900
Or you move to a
beautiful, new office.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:49.300
You're happy, you enjoy
it, it's a pleasant state.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.832
Eudaimonic is more the inner
happiness, more profound.

00:05:52.832 --> 00:05:54.290
It's a deep dimension
of happiness.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.530
So everything that
comes out of yourself.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.830
The value systems that you have,
the motivation that you feel,

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.460
the fulfillment of
your human potential.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.855
And also doing what is
virtuous in your perspective.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.900
This is a very
profound happiness

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.230
that doesn't need to show
in momentary happiness.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.529
It is the basis of your
personal happiness.

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:25.070
Well, actually, I found a pretty
good definition of happiness

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.790
on Wikipedia.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:30.070
"Happiness is a mental or
emotional state of well-being,

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.170
defined by positive
or pleasant emotions

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.930
ranging from contentment
to intense joy."

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:41.990
What is important to say
here is that happiness

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:43.750
doesn't have to be 100%.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.659
Happy people usually also
have unhappy moments.

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:47.950
They're not happy all the time.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:52.170
Researchers say about 80% of
the time, when you are mostly

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.000
happy, you're a happy person.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.460
So 20% of your time
you can be unhappy.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.120
Also it has no relation
to the intensity.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.040
You don't need to be
euphoric all the time.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.394
Mildly to moderately
happy 80% of your time,

00:07:06.394 --> 00:07:07.560
then you are a happy person.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.440
I will show you now that
happiness is pretty modifiable,

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.030
because if you look at
those four contributors

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:21.370
there, the drivers that cause
happiness in human beings.

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:22.930
You have environmental
contributors,

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.870
we briefly spoke about it.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.810
The ice cream, the nice boss.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.740
Also factors like being
married, having a high income,

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.030
having a great job.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.930
All of those things
make people happy.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.650
However, the effect
is very, very small.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:44.070
Once basic needs are
fulfilled-- the Maslow pyramid--

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:47.060
those external factors
account for about 8% to 15%

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.710
of variation in happiness.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.260
So not a lot.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.000
Individual contributors
account for more.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.250
We talk about personal traits
and genetic set points.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:04.040
Genetics set points is a
very interesting theory that

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.160
actually came up
when researchers

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.110
looked at the happiness
of lottery winners.

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:11.810
And they found that
if you win a lottery

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:13.750
you have a big
spike in happiness,

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.330
but it doesn't last long.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.940
It usually lasts between
three and four weeks.

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.700
And then, funnily
enough, your happiness

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:24.170
comes back to the
level before you won.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.990
Just pretty quickly.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:29.850
So there is some genetic set up
that all of us have, you know.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:33.895
Some are inclined to be
more happy, others not.

00:08:33.895 --> 00:08:35.520
And personality traits
are those things

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.844
that you acquire
during your childhood

00:08:39.844 --> 00:08:41.010
from your family background.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:43.809
For instance,
healthy self-esteem

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:45.205
or a natural optimism.

00:08:48.864 --> 00:08:50.280
Interaction
contributors basically

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.360
means a fit between yourself
and your expectations,

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.350
and the situation you encounter.

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:57.850
I'll give you an
example for that.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:01.190
If you have to go to
a client on Monday

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.260
and you expect a Volkswagen
Golf company car,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.570
you might be very happy
because [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:10.070
that you receive a Golf or
maybe even a better car.

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:13.200
If you expect a Lamborghini,
you might be very disappointed,

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.820
and might be unhappy as
a result. So, basically,

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:20.560
expectations you have
regarding certain situations.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.070
And then, lastly,
behavioral contributors.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:26.370
You can actually
acquire behaviors

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:29.450
that make you more happy.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:32.140
For instance, coming out
of positive psychology,

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.560
using your strengths at work.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.600
You are good-- all of you
are good in something.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.090
If you can apply those strengths
and talents in your daily work

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:43.350
routines, you're going
to be more happy.

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:48.630
If you cannot apply them,
most likely unhappy.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.780
Also you can adopt some advice
from eastern philosophy.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:57.090
So pursuing intrinsic goals
instead of extrinsic goals.

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:59.162
Relationships instead
of money or fame.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:05.920
Being mindful and
aware, knowing what's

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.850
going on around
you in the world,

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:12.230
and involved in a purpose
larger than yourself.

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:14.910
If you look at all
these for drivers,

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:20.660
only the genetics part is
non-modifiable, the rest is.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:21.160
OK.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.950
So happiness actually
can be influenced.

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:32.370
There has been a very
interesting change

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:36.460
in the academic
community regarding

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:39.520
happiness in the past 10 years.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.550
There's always been
the clear correlation

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.390
between happiness and
successful life outcomes,

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:45.420
how we call them.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:51.060
Like wealth, fame, great jobs,
marriage, being attractive,

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.411
and so on and so forth.

00:10:52.411 --> 00:10:53.286
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:55.142 --> 00:10:56.850
DR. JOHANNES FREIESLEBEN:
Let me explain.

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.540
Let me explain.

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:03.520
Usually, the researchers thought
you have to be successful first

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.980
and that makes you happy.

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:05.480
Right?

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.521
You have to be married
and then you become happy.

00:11:07.521 --> 00:11:09.750
Or you earn a lot of money
and that makes you happy.

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:11.750
Well, since about
10 years this view

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:14.690
has changed completely
to the opposite.

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:16.900
They say, well, you
have to be happy first,

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.670
and then you're going
to be successful.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:21.980
Then you're going to have all
those desirable life outcomes.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.540
It has been supported by a
huge study done on, basically,

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.680
all the empirical material
which was out there.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.060
All cross-sectional,
longitudinal, experimental

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.290
studies.

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:36.310
And I think about 1,000 they
revised, and looked especially

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:39.750
at this causality and
found that's the way.

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:41.910
First you are happy,
then you're successful.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:44.650
Of course, there's a little
reinforcing feedback loop,

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:47.600
but the main causality goes
from happiness to success.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.041
So it's worthwhile to be happy.

00:11:52.041 --> 00:11:52.540
Right?

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:57.780
It's worthwhile not only for
you, but also for the company.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:03.950
And this is most likely what
all managers like to look at.

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:06.560
If you have happy
employees you have

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:10.480
employees which are proactive,
creative, innovative,

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.500
motivated, and so on.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:17.990
Have low job withdrawal and
contribute to the organization

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:19.410
in many different ways.

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:23.610
Some researchers call that
organizational spontaneity.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:25.940
That means you help others.

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:30.550
You become an ambassador for
your company out in real life.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:34.790
And you are making a lot of
constructive suggestions.

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:37.080
So all of these points, all
of these direct results,

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:42.730
have been empirically validated.

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:46.640
And the indirect results even
more interesting for a company.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.970
Superior performance.

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:51.030
Of course, if people are happy
and they are more productive

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:53.430
and they are more
committed, you are

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:56.580
going to see it in financial
results at the end of the day.

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:59.640
And this has also been
verified by empirical studies.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.620
They found a very strong
correlation between happiness

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:07.300
of employees and broad
performance measures of 0.50,

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.780
which is a very high
value for a correlation.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:13.130
Employee retention as well.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.780
Any company is interested
in keeping the good people

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:21.510
and if you have a lot of
happy people, meaning you

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:24.090
must do something right.

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:26.510
You give them good
career options,

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:28.540
you give them space to develop.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.980
And so the tenure of
happy people in companies

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.640
tend to be longer than
for unhappy people.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.860
Also not very surprising result.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:40.130
So we can say happiness
at work does matter.

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:42.690
It's not a topic that
has no relevance.

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:43.496
It does matter.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.520
I quickly want to
show you the four

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:56.040
levels on which an organization
can influence happiness.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.600
That's the job level, the
leader level, the team level,

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.170
and the organizational
level itself.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:07.960
And the job level had
received most attention

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.790
in the literature.

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:12.610
I would guess
between 80% and 90%.

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:14.960
There have been hundreds
if not thousands of studies

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:20.490
about job satisfaction, job
engagement, job enlargement,

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:22.380
job enrichment.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:25.850
All of these
task-oriented concepts.

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:28.700
They're going to modify
your job and then

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.531
you want to be
happy-- hopefully.

00:14:31.531 --> 00:14:33.030
Lately, there has
been a shift here,

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:36.530
as well, to a
strength-based approach,

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:40.260
also rooted in
positive psychology.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.220
Where you look more at
the design of the job

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:45.190
according to the strength
of the individual employee.

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:48.940
So we have a shift from a purely
task-oriented concept to a more

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.090
people-oriented concept.

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:56.300
The same holds true in
leadership theories.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.810
Interestingly enough, there
is very little on leadership

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:00.500
and happiness.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.442
Very, very little.

00:15:02.442 --> 00:15:03.150
Don't ask me why.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:04.270
I don't know.

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:08.230
You know, it influences the
happiness of his employees,

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.045
but there's very little
research about it.

00:15:10.045 --> 00:15:11.295
Very little empirical studies.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.340
Well, leader roles also changed.

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.310
About 20 years
back, 25 years back,

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:24.360
you had still the Tayloristic
or Fayol model of leadership.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:29.530
Meaning, a leader plans,
organizes, controls.

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:31.960
Very functional.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.720
And these days leader roles
also include, or shift more to,

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.720
motivating your employees,
coaching them, mentoring them,

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:43.590
developing them,
also their strength.

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:46.090
And monitoring them,
instead of controlling,

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:48.770
which is a fundamentally
different concept.

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:53.390
So, again, we see a shift from
a functional task-oriented

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:57.400
leadership perception to a
more people-centered leadership

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:57.900
perception.

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:01.390
The team.

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:03.520
Well, I guess most
of you could agree

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:07.070
that team members
have a large influence

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:09.320
on your individual happiness.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:13.640
At least, I can relate to
this from my experience.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:17.100
Again, very little
research on this.

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:19.140
Funnily.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:24.250
But it is obvious that if you
work in a team where everybody

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:27.340
takes different to you,
makes you uncomfortable,

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.020
makes you unhappy.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:34.880
I worked in a big bank
before and most bankers

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.920
are very extrinsically
motivated.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.710
So bonus, money, revenue.

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:42.900
And if you are a soul
searcher-- if you

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.519
want to find meaning
in business--

00:16:44.519 --> 00:16:45.810
that's the wrong place for you.

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:47.320
You're going to be unhappy.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:47.960
I was unhappy.

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:53.430
The fourth level is
the organization.

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:56.560
And, again, here
a lot of research

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.470
has contributed to
the question, how

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:02.080
can we make people more happy
on an organizational level.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.630
What did they find?

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:04.819
Culture.

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:07.130
Organizational culture.

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:10.349
And I agree that if you have
a great culture-- if you have

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:13.520
a great value system
in your company,

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.019
if you have a clear mission,
vision, and all of this,

00:17:17.019 --> 00:17:18.810
if you have clear
guidelines for management

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:23.099
how to deal with employees
in certain situations-- yes,

00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:25.849
you will make people more happy.

00:17:25.849 --> 00:17:29.640
But the problem is
it rarely works.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.720
Why?

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.140
Very simple.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:36.900
Because you have to have
100% commitment of everybody.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.480
If you have only
one leader who says,

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.470
yeah, you know, I
don't think it works.

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:42.990
It will not work.

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:47.480
His team-- he will treat
his team as always.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.340
They get frustrated.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:52.930
They say, oh, well, look we have
this culture of mutual respect

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:55.860
and fairness and we
cherish opinions,

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.440
but I cannot approach my leader
and tell him my new ideas.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.550
There's a disconnect.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:03.610
They get even frustrated.

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:05.780
There are very little
organization cultures,

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.240
that I know, that really work.

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:17.760
It is important to note
that happiness is not

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.190
created on those levels.

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:21.910
It's created in
here, in the brains

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:23.350
of every single individual.

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:25.870
In his perceptions
and interpretations

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:28.500
of what's happening there.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.436
So this is a very
individualistic notion.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.860
And there are many scholars
that actually say, well,

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:38.880
because individuals differ
so much in their needs,

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.630
in their wants, their
perceptions, interpretations,

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:46.270
their attitudes-- there is no
single solution to happiness.

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:48.890
And there are other scholars
that even go one step further.

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:52.800
They say, you know, why
should companies, at all,

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.840
get involved in this
happiness business.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.710
There is no single
solution that fits all.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:04.521
Would you agree with that?

00:19:04.521 --> 00:19:05.020
No.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:05.460
Good.

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:06.376
I wanted to hear that.

00:19:06.376 --> 00:19:07.910
I don't agree with that either.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:10.020
I do not agree with that.

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.810
What you see, if you look at
the literature on those four

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:16.860
levels, is a very
interesting thing.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.360
A very interesting observation.

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:22.180
There are no structural
approaches to happiness.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.650
What do I mean with
structural approaches?

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:29.600
Companies are organized in a
certain way we call structure.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:36.279
And these ways have not
changed since about 200 years.

00:19:36.279 --> 00:19:37.195
And I ask myself, why?

00:19:37.195 --> 00:19:41.540
Why can't we find a structure
that promotes happiness?

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:43.600
There's nothing out there.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.170
Why are organizations so rigid?

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:49.890
You come into an organization
as a new employee,

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:54.110
your boss is given, your team
is given, everything is given.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:55.020
It's very rigid.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:02.770
And this is why I want to do
a little excursion with you

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:05.990
into the traditional way
of structuring companies.

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:07.650
Which is this.

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:09.370
You have an overall task.

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:12.650
Producing a service,
producing a product.

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:16.750
You split this into subtasks
and you bundle or cluster

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:18.970
those subtasks
into certain jobs.

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:21.220
Now, you are doing all the
IT work and [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.460
doing all the sales process.

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:27.600
I'm doing all the talking.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:32.584
And then you put those jobs
into a hierarchical structure.

00:20:32.584 --> 00:20:34.000
That's called
departmentalization.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.050
Difficult word.

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:41.564
Well, this is going on
according to function, which

00:20:41.564 --> 00:20:42.730
is the most common approach.

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:44.490
So marketing people
marketing department,

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:47.220
IT people IT
department, and so on.

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:51.020
Or regional structures-- team
Switzerland, team Germany,

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.050
team Austria.

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:55.440
Or project-based-- I
think you at Google

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.970
have a project-based
organization.

00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:01.010
Or you have metrics, which is
a hybrid structure with two

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:02.130
reporting lines.

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:03.820
And they never work.

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.080
I'm not a big fan of those.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:08.050
They never work.

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:11.561
But nothing about happiness
enters the picture here.

00:21:11.561 --> 00:21:12.060
Nothing.

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:13.970
It's just purely task-oriented.

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:19.190
You have this task to
fulfill, there you go.

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:24.260
So I put up this as
a problem statement.

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:27.920
Why don't we shift to a
flexible structure reflecting

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:31.320
different happiness
profiles of people?

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:34.460
Why don't we do that?

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:37.965
If we can structure jobs
according to strengths,

00:21:37.965 --> 00:21:40.298
why can't we structure companies
according to happiness?

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:47.020
We need, basically,
an organizational form

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:50.410
that reflects the differences
in employee's happiness.

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:52.600
And we are all different.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:53.380
That is true.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:57.080
We are all different in
regards to happiness.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:00.260
But so one thing a
solution doesn't fit,

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:01.350
but maybe that does.

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:04.430
Let me present it to you.

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:08.480
As they say, you can choose your
friends, but not your family.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:12.040
And you can choose your job, but
not the people you work with.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:15.000
Thus, many of us,
spend eight hours a day

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.370
working alongside,
or even reporting to,

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:21.190
the last people we would pick.

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:25.079
And, I think, this is
very true in many cases.

00:22:25.079 --> 00:22:26.620
So let's see what
we can do about it.

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:36.790
We developed a model that I
called organizational happiness

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:38.120
model.

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:40.590
And I just didn't find
a better word for it,

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:43.360
but maybe I will in the future.

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:48.170
And to come up with a structure
you have to keep process.

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:52.730
The first is happiness profiling
of every single employee--

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:59.480
existing and incoming-- to look
at personality type, abilities,

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:04.520
interests, talents, business
needs, personal needs,

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:10.200
attitudes, professional
values, ethical values,

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:14.550
preferred leadership
style, personal vision,

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:17.110
and motivators.

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:19.080
You have all
different categories

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:24.540
that code for happiness
in the work life.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:28.690
Preferred leadership style,
for instance, just to pick one.

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:31.225
I guess many of you love
management by objectives.

00:23:31.225 --> 00:23:33.110
Your boss gives
you some objective,

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:34.730
and you run after it.

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:35.570
Independently.

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:36.670
I love that.

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:38.470
But not everybody
loves it like this.

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:40.770
There are people that
love to be micromanaged,

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:45.360
that want to have a clear tasks
that they can repeat every day,

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:49.580
and want to see the boss
10 times a day to check.

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:51.190
That's valid too.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:53.710
Not everybody's the same.

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:56.960
So once we've done the happiness
profile of the employee,

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.750
we're going to allocate
him to the team

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:06.540
leader with the closest
possible happiness profile.

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:08.660
And these clusters--
we call them

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:12.590
happiness clusters-- form the
new teams of the organization.

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:15.630
It's not a marketing team,
it's not a original team,

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:19.015
it's not a project team,
it is a happiness team.

00:24:19.015 --> 00:24:19.515
OK.

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:32.650
Just a brief word on
the happiness clusters.

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:34.920
The mix of the team
can be adjusted.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:39.750
That's nothing fixed
in that structure.

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:41.550
Members have to be similar.

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:44.850
You might have experienced
that from your own personal

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:46.990
background in companies
from your own experience,

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:50.110
that you get along well with
people that tic in the same way

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:51.130
as you do.

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:53.130
That have the same wave length.

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:53.630
OK.

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:54.830
Is that true?

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:56.880
Can you relate to that?

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.880
Are most similar in attitudes,
in beliefs, in values,

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.880
not so much in
talents and abilities.

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:07.030
There's a lot of theory
on complementary teams.

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:10.030
Winning teams, you have to
have different abilities

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:10.550
in one team.

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:11.290
Yes, granted.

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:13.490
But you can do that
with this system.

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:18.000
You have similar people
that differ in capabilities.

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:24.070
So the [INAUDIBLE] is
to structure a company

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:25.820
as clusters of
happiness profiles,

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.198
instead of clusters
of functions.

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:32.215
Now, how could this look like?

00:25:32.215 --> 00:25:33.355
It gets a little complex.

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:41.520
The normal structure you
have seen is the big pyramid.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:44.930
This is a sort of a
pyramid too, but it works

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:47.252
according to different rules.

00:25:47.252 --> 00:25:48.210
Let's start at the top.

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:50.080
The CEO is still the CEO.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.880
So not a big change here.

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:55.460
Then you have the C-level,
the management board-- chief

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:58.350
operating officer, chief
information officer, and so on

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:01.080
and so forth-- same roles.

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.450
They are still there.

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:05.520
You have a new roll called
chief happiness officer,

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.750
and this guy is responsible
for all happiness

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:12.470
leaders, [INAUDIBLE] L,
and all happiness clusters.

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:15.770
So he is responsible,
basically, for all employees.

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:20.079
The normal C-level managers
have no direct reports anymore.

00:26:20.079 --> 00:26:20.870
That's a new thing.

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:29.220
The roads are similar
but a little different

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:32.520
than in a normal
hierarchical organization.

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:36.300
So the C-level managers,
they are still specialists,

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:39.020
they still craft the
strategy of the company.

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:40.490
So we want to go there.

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:45.810
We are going to launch
this new product.

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:47.900
But they don't directly
communicate anymore

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:49.080
with the employees.

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.900
This is done via
the chief happiness

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:53.620
officer and the happiness
leaders of the single teams.

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:56.090
Why is that?

00:26:56.090 --> 00:27:00.830
Because they have the role, or
the task, to make the two parts

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:03.370
fit-- the different
happiness profiles

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:06.510
of their employees
and the goals.

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:11.090
So the work is shaped
regarding the humans

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:14.340
and not the humans are
shaped regarding work.

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:16.260
That's the big topic here.

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:20.319
The employees.

00:27:20.319 --> 00:27:22.110
If you're an employee
and you are allocated

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:24.940
to the first cluster,
because you like the boss,

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:27.550
he likes you, he knows your
strength, he supports you,

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:30.170
he coaches you, he
guides you, great.

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:31.610
You have your happiness cluster.

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:32.830
That's your team.

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:36.060
But you might work on very
different project teams.

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.080
So it is sort of a project
organization that you

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.590
know of here, of Google.

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:42.440
You work in different
project teams

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.780
and you might work with
different employees

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:46.800
from different clusters.

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:47.300
No problem.

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:47.980
You do that now.

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:48.820
Right?

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:52.550
Different departments,
different teams.

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:54.300
What's the big difference?

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:55.770
It is quite complicated.

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:57.570
Isn't it?

00:27:57.570 --> 00:27:59.910
What is complicated here?

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:01.170
The talking.

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:03.320
These people need to talk a lot.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.480
In a normal hierarchical
organization

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.730
you have top-down information.

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:09.320
You have push information.

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:13.552
The C-level manager
says, I want to do this.

00:28:13.552 --> 00:28:15.260
And then he goes to
his department bosses

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.820
and they break it
up in little goals

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:20.615
and then they break it
down to the employee level.

00:28:20.615 --> 00:28:22.760
So Information
pushed from the top.

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:27.155
Here that doesn't work,
because the C-level has to talk

00:28:27.155 --> 00:28:28.280
with the happiness leaders.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.810
They have to coordinate.

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:31.730
They have to make things fit.

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:35.670
It's more of a collaboration
and negotiation

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:39.580
than a hierarchical command
and control structure.

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:50.460
A little word on the
happiness leaders.

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:52.530
They are the new team heads.

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:53.030
Right?

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:55.800
They are the new
department heads.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.400
They are the former
managers, but they are not

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.092
functional managers anymore.

00:29:01.092 --> 00:29:03.300
They might know nothing
about what you do-- actually,

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:05.000
they should know a little
bit, because they still

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.625
have to monitor your goal
progress, and stuff like this.

00:29:07.625 --> 00:29:09.921
They have to talk with
you about your projects.

00:29:09.921 --> 00:29:11.920
They have to have a general
understanding on all

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.390
of the functions in
the company, but they

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:17.770
don't have to be a functional
specialist anymore.

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:19.320
OK.

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:22.380
Their main role
is to mentor you,

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:25.860
to coach you, according
to your happiness profile.

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:28.700
To give you the best
environmental conditions

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:33.386
to be productive and to be
happy, to use your strengths.

00:29:33.386 --> 00:29:34.927
And I give you a
very simple example.

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:41.276
Some of you might be
fathers and mothers.

00:29:41.276 --> 00:29:42.650
So you might have
little children

00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:45.260
that you want to see in the
morning before going to work.

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:49.330
In most companies bosses say,
you have to be here at 7:30.

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:51.501
Work starts at 7:30.

00:29:51.501 --> 00:29:54.460
There's no other way.

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.120
In this structure, if you are
allocated to this happiness

00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:01.224
team where being late at
work is totally fine and OK,

00:30:01.224 --> 00:30:03.140
because everybody thinks
like this-- your boss

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:06.610
and your teammates--
there will be no problem.

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:08.250
The only problem
is the team head

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:11.580
has to speak with the
C-level managers and the rest

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:13.350
of the company to
make that work.

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.600
It's a lot of
cooperation going on,

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.170
a lot of negotiation
in this system.

00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:27.910
So this is the new idea.

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:29.200
Let's assess it.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.110
Let's see where
are the strengths

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:34.680
and where are the challenges.

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:39.340
Well, the strengths are,
in my view, obvious.

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:42.170
You want to lift up the
happiness of your employees,

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:44.295
because you allocate
them to the cluster

00:30:44.295 --> 00:30:47.870
where they could
potentially perform best.

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:50.540
Where they have the
ideal conditions,

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:54.740
the best fit of
happiness and work.

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:59.222
And, as a result, you have a
better company performance.

00:30:59.222 --> 00:31:00.710
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:03.168
DR. JOHANNES FREIESLEBEN: Can
we do a questions afterwards?

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:08.950
Theoretically, this model
works in all organizations

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:11.990
and in all cultural backgrounds.

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.510
In all.

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:13.800
I don't see where
it couldn't work,

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.010
because it's very flexible.

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:18.810
If you, for instance, have
to integrate a company

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:21.950
from the Arabic Peninsula
and people culturally

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:23.450
different there--
that's no problem,

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:25.580
they'll form their cluster.

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:30.620
Or they are allocated to the
clusters that fit them best.

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.120
It promotes company wide
collaboration into action.

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:34.620
It has to, it needs to.

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:38.280
It only functions if
there is a lot of talking.

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:39.740
And it is a very
flexible structure

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:41.470
that can easily be modified.

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:44.860
You, as an employee, you can
also change happiness clusters,

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:47.836
if you somehow feel that
it doesn't work anymore

00:31:47.836 --> 00:31:48.950
in this happiness cluster.

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:50.948
You go to the one
that suits you best.

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:56.440
What about the challenges?

00:31:56.440 --> 00:32:00.650
Well, it's a redesign
of the whole company.

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:02.630
You're talking
about restructuring.

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:07.380
Talk about adjusting processes,
workflows, information flows,

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:09.540
and the like.

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:12.480
It's a big task.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:15.480
However, there might be
big benefits, as well.

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.750
If you do it.

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:18.580
It might demand a
culture change, as well.

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:23.700
If you have a pretty happiness
oriented culture already,

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:24.890
difference is not so big.

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:26.970
So that might work quite nicely.

00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:29.930
If you come from a very
hierarchical organized company,

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:33.480
you might have bigger
challenges there.

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.904
You have new roles for managers.

00:32:35.904 --> 00:32:36.570
That's for sure.

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:38.330
Not all managers might
be happy with that.

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:41.380
For instance, if I would be
a COO, and all of a sudden I

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:43.820
don't have any direct
reports anymore,

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:47.060
I might say, well,
this is a power loss.

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:49.180
In this system-- actually,
in this new structure

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:50.750
is not the classical
power we know

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:52.190
from hierarchical companies.

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:55.210
It is more influencing.

00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:58.100
It is more negotiating.

00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:02.860
So managers need to understand
your roles in this model.

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:06.750
You need to understand that
power works in different ways.

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:09.400
It requires very,
very good persons

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:12.800
to be the happiness leaders
of those happiness clusters.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:16.820
It's a very, very
demanding and complex task.

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:21.930
And the most important shift is
from the hierarchical control

00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:24.670
to collaboration
and self-management.

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:26.560
So the teams-- the
project teams--

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:30.070
are naturally self-managing.

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:33.380
Is it very different
from what we see today?

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:34.600
Yes it is.

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:35.640
It is new.

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:39.920
No company runs on
this model so far.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:44.310
But we have aspects of
it in many companies.

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:46.640
Self-managing teams
are everywhere.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.325
Managing by objective
is everywhere.

00:33:49.325 --> 00:33:49.825
Right.

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:54.330
Making people
happier-- this idea

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:56.480
is in most companies these days.

00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:01.910
They didn't go the final step,
which was such a structure.

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:03.844
So far.

00:34:03.844 --> 00:34:05.510
So I want to conclude
my talk-- and then

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:08.730
we can open the discussion--
with the prerequisites.

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:11.219
When does that organizational
happiness model

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:13.449
work and is effective?

00:34:13.449 --> 00:34:17.540
Well, clearly, it has to
turn in a net benefit.

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:19.320
Otherwise companies won't do it.

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.760
It has to show end results.

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:24.070
So, the increase
in productivity due

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:29.030
to organizational happiness,
due to allocating persons there

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:32.650
where they have
the best fit, must

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:35.270
be bigger than the productivity
loss that you have,

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:39.320
because you have
to coordinate more.

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.790
I believe at the beginning, yes.

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:44.420
You will have a lot of
effort to make this work

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:45.900
in terms of coordination.

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:49.389
But this will
diminish after time.

00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:51.719
And, I'd say, after
two to three years it

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:54.010
will be the same effort
you spend in any company.

00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:57.790
Because also, in normal
functional companies

00:34:57.790 --> 00:35:00.240
the departments need to
talk with each other.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.336
There is collaboration
going on all the time.

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:08.620
It requires a certain
employee attitude as well.

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:11.070
You cannot do that
with everybody.

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:13.860
So what you do--
the proposition is

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:17.310
you create a framework of
those happiness clusters

00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:19.520
where individual
people can perform,

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.030
but they have to
be able to perform

00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:23.910
and they have to
want to perform.

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:24.820
It's not a given.

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:29.050
If you think about those 20%
actively disengaged people

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:31.130
the Gallup found,
maybe they will not

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:35.420
use the leeway in the new
beautiful structure to perform.

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:39.002
Maybe they don't use
their skills to flourish.

00:35:39.002 --> 00:35:40.085
It's up to the individual.

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:48.040
And then you need a
humanistic company culture.

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:51.840
Companies must be very
committed to this.

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:54.660
And they must have some sort
of humanistic viewpoint.

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:57.550
And humanistic management,
basically, centers on the idea

00:35:57.550 --> 00:36:01.840
that every person
is an end in itself.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:07.560
And that you can align business
goals with the humanistic goals

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:08.740
and societal goals.

00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:09.900
They can be aligned.

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:12.630
They're not contradictory.

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:15.390
So it puts the human
being back into the center

00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:16.400
of the equation.

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.210
And this is exactly what
organizational happiness does.

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:20.450
Exactly that.

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:25.060
Regard the human being, when
is that human being most happy,

00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:27.882
when does it perform best.

00:36:27.882 --> 00:36:29.840
And we structure the
company according to that.

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:37.470
And we put the human back
in the center of interest

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:41.320
because all companies
that are out there

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:44.270
are not in the b2b business--
in the business to business

00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:45.010
business.

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:46.680
They're not in
the b2c business--

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:48.220
business to consumer.

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:52.820
They are in the h2h
business-- human to human.

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:54.948
Thank you very much.

00:36:54.948 --> 00:36:57.744
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:59.142 --> 00:36:59.950
Very good question.

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:00.480
Thank you.

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.980
Your question was,
you have certain types

00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:06.080
of people that need control that
are extrinsically motivated.

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:08.370
How do you integrate
them into this structure?

00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:12.100
The short answer is, it's in the
hands of the happiness leader.

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:15.370
So you're allocated, regarding
your happiness profile,

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:16.800
to a certain happiness cluster.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:20.280
To a happiness team led
by this happiness leader.

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:22.140
And he has to really
understand you,

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:23.970
he has to know how you tic.

00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:28.072
He has to know all your strength
and-- well-- weakness also.

00:37:28.072 --> 00:37:30.280
Maybe by experience-- you
will reveal them in a test.

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.510
But He will know
you pretty well.

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:38.190
And he has to design your
work according to your needs.

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:43.193
According to the best fit of
your abilities and the work.

00:37:43.193 --> 00:37:44.755
If you take
extrinsically-- which

00:37:44.755 --> 00:37:50.190
is totally fine-- you
might end up in a team--

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:54.110
we have all team mates
that tic extrinsically.

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:57.410
So for instance, any
chief financial manager

00:37:57.410 --> 00:38:00.050
will likely have a
lot of finance teams

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:00.820
with finance guys.

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:03.420
And they tend to
tic extrinsically.

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:05.250
They love money, they
want to make money,

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:06.250
and that's totally fine.

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:07.374
There's nothing against it.

00:38:07.374 --> 00:38:08.470
It's their motivator.

00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:09.428
AUDIENCE: I'm in legal.

00:38:09.428 --> 00:38:10.945
There's many people [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:10.945 --> 00:38:12.820
DR. JOHANNES FREIESLEBEN:
Oh, OK. [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:15.592
But you know what the good
thing about this structure is?

00:38:15.592 --> 00:38:17.550
You are now on the legal
team and you might not

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:19.560
be extrinsically motivated.

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:21.860
You might be
intrinsically motivated.

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:24.650
In this structure you've
got to be in a team that

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:26.280
is intrinsically motivated.

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.330
So your boss is intrinsically
motivated and your teammates.

00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:32.620
You will collaborate
with the other legal guys

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:37.320
on a project basis, but formally
you will be intrinsic class.

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:38.320
Understand [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.260
AUDIENCE: Ah, so you
change, basically, the role?

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:41.550
DR. JOHANNES FREIESLEBEN:
You change the role.

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:42.381
Precisely.

00:38:42.381 --> 00:38:43.880
AUDIENCE: What does
team mean to you

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:46.090
if projects are done by
people in different things?

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:49.550
Like, for me an optional
project and a team

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:52.792
they go together as one thing.

00:38:52.792 --> 00:38:54.500
Of course there are
[INAUDIBLE] projects,

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:57.360
like you do back-end algorithms
and then [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:02.130
For me it is not like
project and team.

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:04.320
[INAUDIBLE]

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.570
DR. JOHANNES FREIESLEBEN: Yes.

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:10.670
So the question is-- for you
the notions of project and team

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:12.030
goes together.

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:12.640
Right?

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:15.570
DR. JOHANNES
FREIESLEBEN: Well, that

00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:17.314
means you work on
different teams then.

00:39:17.314 --> 00:39:19.772
You work on different projects
you work on different teams.

00:39:19.772 --> 00:39:21.652
Correct.

00:39:21.652 --> 00:39:23.777
AUDIENCE: I think it's more
if you work in one team

00:39:23.777 --> 00:39:25.276
and you collaborate
with other teams

00:39:25.276 --> 00:39:26.750
to accomplish
[INAUDIBLE] projects.

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:28.690
And then you have some
projects that you don't

00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:30.714
need to collaborate with them.

00:39:30.714 --> 00:39:32.880
DR. JOHANNES FREIESLEBEN:
Well, you work in one team

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:35.046
and then you collaborate
with other project leaders?

00:39:35.046 --> 00:39:36.333
Well, this is exactly you.

00:39:36.333 --> 00:39:37.220
That's exactly you.

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:39.886
You are going to be
in one happiness team,

00:39:39.886 --> 00:39:41.970
but your work will be
in different teams.

00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:46.670
Might be with your team mates
from here, but might not.

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:47.170
Right?

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:50.730
Could be completely
different team.

00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:52.110
It's a very flexible structure.

00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:53.820
You understand?

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:56.040
You can be-- depending
on your task,

00:39:56.040 --> 00:40:01.300
on your project-- you can be
in x teams at the same time.

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:04.970
But physically and
management wise here,

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:07.670
in one happiness cluster.

00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:09.790
Did I explain myself?

00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:10.760
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:12.090
DR. JOHANNES FREIESLEBEN: OK.

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:12.735
Next question.

00:40:12.735 --> 00:40:15.224
AUDIENCE: Actually I want to
elaborate on this question.

00:40:15.224 --> 00:40:18.900
I mean, this is really a
very interesting vision.

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:26.240
And I simply [INAUDIBLE]
formulation of society

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:29.060
where a sense of [INAUDIBLE]
is relating happiness and not

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:30.250
money.

00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:30.750
[INAUDIBLE]

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:35.875
But if you look at this
model as you presented,

00:40:35.875 --> 00:40:38.656
there is something
which occurred to me.

00:40:38.656 --> 00:40:41.000
So say I am motivated,
I don't know,

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
by making tea and [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.880
And I will put this in the
happiness questionnaire.

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.810
And I'm assigned to a
team where other people

00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:54.650
like the same things and we
think the same as you say.

00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:58.475
Now say I'm a software
engineer and there would

00:40:58.475 --> 00:40:59.920
be a [INAUDIBLE] person there.

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:03.700
And there would be
[INAUDIBLE] stuff, and maybe

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:05.925
someone from the [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:05.925 --> 00:41:08.099
And OK, we are all on
the same happiness team.

00:41:08.099 --> 00:41:09.140
We have the same manager.

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:10.490
Maybe we sit in the same place.

00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:11.698
Maybe we have lunch together.

00:41:11.698 --> 00:41:14.060
But otherwise we [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:16.534
So we [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:16.534 --> 00:41:18.450
When I work with other
people on that project,

00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:23.000
[INAUDIBLE] like coffee.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.810
DR. JOHANNES FREIESLEBEN: That
is a very, very good question.

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:30.000
The question was, well you want
to be in a happiness cluster.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.500
But most of your work
is in the project teams.

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.950
[INAUDIBLE]

00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:37.512
So how does the happiness
culture affect you?

00:41:37.512 --> 00:41:41.450
It affects you via three ways.

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:46.947
First is, if you have
team events on your site,

00:41:46.947 --> 00:41:49.030
you go to lunch together,
if you have team events,

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:52.870
if you are working on your
own, you sit in a team

00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:56.140
where the people
are the same ways.

00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:59.210
Let's call you friends, right?

00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:01.970
The second thing is
your leader assesses

00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:03.524
you regarding your happiness.

00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:07.720
He has a very complicated role.

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:10.030
And maybe I have to explain
that a little better.

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:13.420
He has to make sure that
the company goals are

00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:15.780
fulfilled, the project
goals, at the same time

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:17.606
your happiness profile.

00:42:17.606 --> 00:42:18.980
You understand?

00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:20.230
This is a very demanding role.

00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:22.220
That is why he has
to speak with the CHO

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:24.410
and the other C-level
managers that might have

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:26.120
an interest in the audience.

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:27.200
[INAUDIBLE]

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:30.300
They have to find the
best fit between the two.

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:34.080
And I give you--
you're totally right.

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:37.930
It has big implications for
companies because it's not only

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:41.960
profit that they're
after, but also happiness.

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:45.090
As humanistic
management proclaims,

00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:48.130
business goals align
with humanistic goals.

00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:51.134
They both have the same value,
otherwise it doesn't work.

00:42:51.134 --> 00:42:52.550
If your company
doesn't understand

00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:55.690
it, if they say we just
want to make bucks, come on,

00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:56.742
it wouldn't fly.

00:42:56.742 --> 00:42:57.870
It would not work.

00:42:57.870 --> 00:43:01.740
Maybe this other company
you want to work for.

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:04.160
AUDIENCE: I have
another question.

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:08.470
So imagine as the CHO and he
has a lot of happiness meters.

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:09.460
All those [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:12.520
So what kind of [INAUDIBLE] is
used, framework or whatever,

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:14.850
in order to classify
these people?

00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:18.570
A poet uses spoken words,
but what kind of words?

00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:20.950
So is there any notion of
what kind of dimensions

00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:25.902
these people want to
kind of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:25.902 --> 00:43:28.080
DR. JOHANNES FREIESLEBEN:
I have to be honest, no,

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:29.630
not at the moment.

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:33.330
This is a very new concept here,
[INAUDIBLE] end of last year.

00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:36.590
And it's not thought
through on the detail role.

00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:40.370
The role of the CHO though
is to provide a framework

00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:43.240
where this happiness
index can work best.

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:46.340
So he has to basically make
the whole organization work.

00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:48.640
He has took to make
sure that if there

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:50.870
are goal conflicts for
instance, which might happen

00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:54.820
all the time between C-level
and happiness [INAUDIBLE],

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:56.270
he has to mediate.

00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:58.670
He has to somehow
find a compromise.

00:43:58.670 --> 00:44:00.260
It's a very demanding role.

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.730
He has also to lead the
negotiation because you

00:44:02.730 --> 00:44:04.080
have those two dimensions.

00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:05.610
As your colleagues
said correctly,

00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:08.300
you have business dimension and
you have happiness dimension.

00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:10.380
They have to go hand in hand.

00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:12.100
They need to be a fit.

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:13.090
That's his role.

00:44:13.090 --> 00:44:16.020
What kind of language he uses,
what kind of systems he uses,

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:17.510
we're not there yet.

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:19.370
But it's about [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:25.270
AUDIENCE: I have some
questions about how

00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:27.350
it's on the role [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:30.810
So let's say for example a
company with 50,000 employees,

00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:34.680
and you have 20 employees
per happiness cluster,

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:37.670
That means you have
2,500 [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:40.930
So the CHOs, they
shoot [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:52.290
And the CHO should solve all
the conflicts between all

00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:53.544
these things, [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:56.850 --> 00:45:00.370
That seems to me to be a
task that would take more

00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:01.544
than [INAUDIBLE] time.

00:45:01.544 --> 00:45:03.210
DR. JOHANNES FREIESLEBEN:
I would agree.

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:07.250
So the question was, if you have
a big company of 50,000 people

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:09.710
and you have 20 people
per happiness cluster,

00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:13.775
you might end up with
2,500 different happiness

00:45:13.775 --> 00:45:19.310
clusters that will be a
coordination and communication

00:45:19.310 --> 00:45:20.860
disaster.

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:23.010
That's impossible.

00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:23.650
Correct.

00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:25.660
But I don't think
it would go there.

00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:27.380
I think it will
go there that you

00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:31.880
might have, not depending upon
the company's size, about 10

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:36.110
to a maximum of 15 different
types of happiness clusters.

00:45:36.110 --> 00:45:40.130
There might be a hundred
happiness clusters at one time.

00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:43.340
[INAUDIBLE] the same procedures
and the same processes,

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:45.385
the same information.

00:45:45.385 --> 00:45:46.260
Do you understand me?

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:48.260
So you don't have
to manage 2,500.

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:49.680
That would be impossible.

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:52.550
You have to manage
a subset of them,

00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:58.152
let's say 500, 300 of one
time-- the same rules,

00:45:58.152 --> 00:46:01.390
the same procedures.

00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:03.080
So that's doable.

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:04.832
2,500 is not doable.

00:46:04.832 --> 00:46:06.745
So I agree.

00:46:06.745 --> 00:46:09.744
I think [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:09.744 --> 00:46:12.160
AUDIENCE: So I think it is a
continuation of the questions

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:14.670
that we'll have before.

00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:17.221
In traditional
companies, the teams

00:46:17.221 --> 00:46:19.512
are usually structured around
like you said department.

00:46:19.512 --> 00:46:21.880
But what you spend most
of your time doing, right,

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:23.035
if you support [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:23.035 --> 00:46:24.474
Like if you sit
with the lawyers,

00:46:24.474 --> 00:46:25.765
you're in the legal department.

00:46:25.765 --> 00:46:29.180
If you sit, that's a
departmental company.

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:32.360
And then here at Google, if
you sit with this [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:36.240
from the teamwork
based on this project.

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:39.795
But in your example, even though
I'm in some happiness cluster,

00:46:39.795 --> 00:46:42.180
I don't actually spend
most of the time.

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:44.520
DR. JOHANNES FREIESLEBEN:
No, that's correct.

00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.420
It depends.

00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:48.550
So the question, if
I can reframe you,

00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:51.415
is how much time do you actually
spend on your happiness team.

00:46:51.415 --> 00:46:52.950
Is that the base
of your question?

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:53.450
AUDIENCE: Right, yeah.

00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:55.450
Just because part of the
parameters of your talk

00:46:55.450 --> 00:46:57.895
was that we spend most of the
time during the day with people

00:46:57.895 --> 00:46:58.340
we don't like.

00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:00.839
So hopefully with this change,
we can spend most of the time

00:47:00.839 --> 00:47:02.760
with people that are
having [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:05.010
DR. JOHANNES FREIESLEBEN:
You might have misunderstood

00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:06.226
me a just a little bit.

00:47:06.226 --> 00:47:08.350
I didn't say you spent most
of the time with people

00:47:08.350 --> 00:47:09.220
that you don't like.

00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:11.236
It might be that you
spend all of your time

00:47:11.236 --> 00:47:12.360
with people you don't like.

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:14.580
But it depends, of
course, on your work.

00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:18.610
So if you look at your work,
you have a certain percentage

00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:21.650
of time that you
do your own stuff--

00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:25.370
and then you can sit
here-- and a percentage

00:47:25.370 --> 00:47:26.570
of time you collaborate.

00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:28.170
And then you have
to be with a team,

00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:31.190
with the project team, whatever
project team you're on.

00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:34.820
And these might be different
from different happiness

00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:35.400
clusters.

00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:36.680
That's correct.

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:39.060
It's hard for me to
say now, will you

00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:40.790
spend more time
collaborating or do

00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:45.380
you sit more at your own
desk and do your own work.

00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:46.920
That's one aspect of it.

00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:49.080
The second aspect, which
is much more fundamental

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:53.820
is not the work,
but the work design.

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:57.560
And this is what your
happiness leader does together

00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:02.770
with the CHO and
the executive part.

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:05.160
And this work
design is also new.

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:07.439
It's not the work
design you know.

00:48:07.439 --> 00:48:08.480
You've got a work design.

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:09.560
OK, these are your goals.

00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:10.920
Go.

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:15.390
But if that makes you happy
or not, no consideration.

00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:20.310
Well, some leaders
are good, even today

00:48:20.310 --> 00:48:22.410
in traditional
hierarchical structures.

00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:24.270
And they know very
well what you can

00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:27.850
and what you can't, what you're
good at and what you hate.

00:48:27.850 --> 00:48:33.290
So they will design the work
accordingly, if they are good.

00:48:33.290 --> 00:48:35.070
So where was the-- yeah.

00:48:35.070 --> 00:48:37.070
AUDIENCE: So I can't
understand [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:42.672
for people sort of more or
less [INAUDIBLE] together.

00:48:42.672 --> 00:48:44.630
DR. JOHANNES FREIESLEBEN:
Only what they think.

00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:47.498
Not only what they--
to some extent, yes.

00:48:47.498 --> 00:48:54.470
AUDIENCE: Do you think is
some risk of maybe [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:56.462
forcing that they
provide [INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:03.100
I guess on a product
level, you can

00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:05.610
think about
[INAUDIBLE] countries

00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:10.430
and sticking only
with [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:12.873
and what implications this
might have. [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:12.873 --> 00:49:16.035
corporation where, at
the moment, if you're

00:49:16.035 --> 00:49:18.460
on a team with people
who think differently,

00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:21.460
your own way and thinking
are not reinforced.

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:24.115
But in this case, [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:24.115 --> 00:49:25.990
DR. JOHANNES FREIESLEBEN:
Very good question.

00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:28.950
The question was if there is
a high risk of groupthink,

00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:32.310
that you foster groupthink
in those groups.

00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:33.990
Well that risk exists.

00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:34.653
That is true.

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:40.010
How do you counterbalance that?

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:42.800
As I said before,
the idea is not

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:45.226
that you find your
perfect clones

00:49:45.226 --> 00:49:46.850
and put all your
clones into one group.

00:49:46.850 --> 00:49:50.780
Then I think the risk would
be very high for groupthink.

00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:54.920
You have to look for
the fundament that

00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:57.620
needs to be the same, I'd
say, like the wavelength,

00:49:57.620 --> 00:49:59.050
the chemistry between you.

00:49:59.050 --> 00:50:00.580
But your abilities
and your talents

00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:03.420
might be completely different.

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:08.570
And I think that minimizes also
the risk of serious groupthink

00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:12.020
catastrophe in those
happiness clusters.

00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:13.820
But I agree this is
a topic that needs

00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:17.070
to be addressed, absolutely.

00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:18.770
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK,
that is actually

00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:21.384
all we have time for today.

00:50:21.384 --> 00:50:25.100
So I would just like to give
a warm thanks to the professor

00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:27.432
for coming in and talking to us.

00:50:27.432 --> 00:50:28.890
And if you have
any more questions,

00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:30.810
I'm sure he'll be available
for a few minutes afterwards.

00:50:30.810 --> 00:50:31.662
DR. JOHANNES FREIESLEBEN: Sure.

00:50:31.662 --> 00:50:32.510
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Thanks very much.

00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:34.720
DR. JOHANNES FREIESLEBEN:
Thank you for having me.
