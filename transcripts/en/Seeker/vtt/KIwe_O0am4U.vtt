00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:03.219
Are we dehumanizing people who are part of
our out-groups today?

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:04.690
How do we ctrl-z this behavior?

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.640
And, will I be able to make this video light and
fun as opposed to dark and depressing?

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.560
Theme song time.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.480
You're going to put it in in post, right?

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.480
You won't have me looking goofy out here, right?

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.820
I don't think he's going to put it in post.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.500
We are the most evolved life forms on Earth
but we still cling onto our evolutionary history.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.630
Humans are tribal creatures, we roll with
cliques that are like us and we consider people

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.500
that aren’t within our tribes as an “other.”

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.800
Those tribal lines, through our evolutionary
history, have transformed from hominids being

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.910
like “yo who’s cavemans is this?” when
you’re out here cavewildin’ to newer lines;

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.850
race, religion, politics, Hogwarts houses,
et cetera.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.400
Think about sports fans; they root for their
team no matter what, that’s their team,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.850
people who root for that team are their “in
group.”

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.380
Anyone not a fan of that team of that is their
“out-group.”

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.630
We all contain multiple in-groups and, in
turn, multiple out-groups, #Intersectionality!

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.960
And this is natural; implicit association
tests, or IATs, show that more often than

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.500
not, people align closely with their ingroups
over their out groups.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.059
We tend to view our in-groups more favorably,
talking about why our music bangs more and

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.220
how our potato salad is better.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.370
We cooperate better with members of our in
group and often root for them no matter what.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.030
A 2005 study showed that sports fans
at a soccer game would be more likely to help

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.000
an injured spectator if they were wearing
the same jersey as them rather than a rival team.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.040
This makes me think of how this could relate
to other two-sided issues.

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:29.190
We’re so tied to our in-groups so any “group
switching" looks like a betrayal.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.590
But for the out-group...think about how aliens
are treated in movies.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.740
Always viewed as interlopers, invaders, infringing
upon our way of life in a threatening way.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.100
We act the same way to non-aliens in our human
out-groups, though we don’t try to

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.660
laser them to death.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.260
We typically view our out-group as homogenous,
all the same because it’s easier.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.480
All Warriors fans are like ____, all Muslims
are like ________, all Slytherins are like ____.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.120
This phenomena not only occurs super quickly,
unconsciously, and automatically with our

00:01:53.131 --> 00:01:57.619
amygdala and insula, but research suggests
it starts very early in our cognitive development.

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.850
Furthermore, pictures of homeless people and
drug abusers have been shown to activate the

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.770
insula, which also activates in response to
disgusting tastes and smells but some researchers

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.060
believe that it also can be linked to an “ethnic”
or out-group marker.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.120
Yikes. That's no bueno.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.660
Humans tend to dehumanize anyone who doesn’t
adhere to what their idea of normalcy is.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.510
Calling people animals, demons, superpredators,
devils, etc is a way to denote that

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.590
someone is awful to the point of being non-human.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.680
And this is more pervasive often and seen more often than we like to admit.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.680
A psychologist named Dr Nour Kteily found a way
to quantify dehumanization by showing mostly

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.440
Caucasian-American subjects a photo of the
“Ascent of Man”

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.620
*bing, this one, right here,

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.180
and asked them to rate different ethnic groups on “how evolved they are.”

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.460
And a lot of people said every group was 100%
evolved, but unfortunately, some people viewed

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.209
Mexican immigrants, Arabs, and Muslims as
the least evolved.

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.000
This is scary because...they are human, and
if people are looking at them as less than

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.180
human, well, it’s easier to ignore their
humanity.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.060
With another politically divisive era 
upon us where lines are drawn in the sand

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.270
and debasing and damaging rhetoric will be
tossed left and right, how do we break this

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.010
trend of dehumanization?

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.400
Easier said than done but research suggests
Individuation, Education, and

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.520
Stopping the Spread of Misinformation. Or, I.E.S.M.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.180
That sounds slavey, I'm not saying that.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.300
Looking at our out-groups as monolithic, generalized,
disgusting people is not the move

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.030
and it can be reversed.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.430
Studies suggest that looking at out-group
members as individuals allows us to see them

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.540
as solo people and not just part of an “other”
group, helping break the cycle.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.340
Not blaming a whole group for single incidents
and using blanket statements like “the Blacks,”

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.040
“the Muslims,” “the immigrants,” helps reinstate
humanity in those people.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.900
Taking the step to learn about other cultures,
religions, races, etc isn’t hard; find and

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.450
celebrate difference while sharing common
ground.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.720
And finally, stop the spread of misinformation. No more fake news.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.680
Dr. Kteily found evidence that his White subjects
wouldn’t dehumanize Arabs and Muslims if

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.260
they read an article about how Muslim actually
admired American values; positive, truthful

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.970
representation matters and can help with social
perceptions of different groups as well as

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.340
push us along on our social cognitive evolution.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.440
Turn us from Squirtles into Wartortles real
quick.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.980
Blastoise.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.500
Let's lighten this bad boy up. If you learned something today and you want to learn something else,

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.140
check out this video about schadenfreude, a hard word to say that I had to say a lot of times.
