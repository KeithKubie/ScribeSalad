neuro star transfer allows you to do is

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879
neuro star transfer allows you to do is
 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.020
neuro star transfer allows you to do is
generate a new image like the one below

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030
generate a new image like the one below
 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.819
generate a new image like the one below
which is a picture of the Stanford

in order to describe how you can

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210
in order to describe how you can
 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.349
in order to describe how you can
implement this yourself I'm going to use

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359
implement this yourself I'm going to use
 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.189
implement this yourself I'm going to use
C to denote the content image s to

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199
C to denote the content image s to
 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.219
C to denote the content image s to
denote the style image and G to denote

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229
denote the style image and G to denote
 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.640

the image you will generate here's

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650
the image you will generate here's
 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.160

another example let's say you have this

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170
another example let's say you have this
 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.310
another example let's say you have this
content image so let's see this is a the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320
content image so let's see this is a the
 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.830
content image so let's see this is a the
Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco and

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840
Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco and
 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.440
Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco and
you have this style image this is

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450
you have this style image this is
 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.410
you have this style image this is
actually Pablo Picasso image you can

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420
actually Pablo Picasso image you can
 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.990
actually Pablo Picasso image you can
then combine these to generate this

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000
then combine these to generate this
 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.679
then combine these to generate this
image G which is the Golden Gate painted

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689
image G which is the Golden Gate painted
 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.140

what you learned in the next few videos

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380
what you learned in the next few videos
 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.980
what you learned in the next few videos
is how you can generate these images

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990
is how you can generate these images
 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.800
is how you can generate these images
yourself in order to implement neural

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810
yourself in order to implement neural
 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.139
yourself in order to implement neural
style transfer you need to look at the

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149
style transfer you need to look at the
 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.330
style transfer you need to look at the
features extracted by confidence at

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340
features extracted by confidence at
 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.819
features extracted by confidence at
various layers the shallow and the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829
various layers the shallow and the
 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.280
various layers the shallow and the
deeper layers of a confident so before

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290
deeper layers of a confident so before
 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.859

our transfer what I want to do in the
 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.580

next video is try to give you better

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590
next video is try to give you better
 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.920
next video is try to give you better
intuition about what are all these

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930
intuition about what are all these
 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.229
intuition about what are all these
layers of a confident really computing

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239
layers of a confident really computing
 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.510
layers of a confident really computing
let's take a look at that in the next

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520
let's take a look at that in the next
 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.760
