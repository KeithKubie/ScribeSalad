00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.736
INTERVIEWER 1: Could you just
tell us a little bit about

00:00:21.736 --> 00:00:23.712
maybe what they might be
feeling about now?

00:00:23.712 --> 00:00:29.490
ERIC MASKIN: If they feel any
way the way I did four years

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.480
ago, they're feeling
overwhelmed.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.410
This day is sensory overload.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.910
You just get hit over and over
again, in a very nice way, but

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:45.625
it's incessant.

00:00:45.625 --> 00:00:48.280
MARK WATSON: They're just the
kind of people you what to

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.130
copy, these guys.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.060
When the question was asked
about what's your new work?

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.430
I think of these guys as being
very excited about their

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.990
latest paper, whatever it
happens to be, and that just

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.060
rubs off on all of us
in the department.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.100
Again, keeps the excitement high
amongst all the faculty

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.340
and all of the students
and everyone.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.430
So congratulations,
and thank you.

00:01:18.318 --> 00:01:20.930
THOMAS SARGENT: So as professors
or students, we're

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.710
really privileged.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.440
We have a wonderful
life of learning.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.280
You're a person, and you
statistically run into

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.340
somebody who knows
more than you do.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.970
And whether or not you could
take advantage of it depends

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.760
on how much time you
spend learning.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.670
That's kind of it, nature
just gives you these

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.570
opportunities to learn.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.040
CHRISTOPHER SIMS: Now I've
been privileged to be at

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.890
Princeton, which is another
great department.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.310
It's a great award, and I'm very
grateful for the award

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.642
and for the environment that
I've been in because it helped

00:01:53.642 --> 00:01:55.910
me to learn and grow.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.742
So thanks to all of
you at Princeton.

00:02:01.742 --> 00:02:04.640
ROHIT LAMBA: A funny thing is
that, when Chris teaches the

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.060
advanced macro course, Tom
sits in the class.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.800
And when Tom teaches, Chris
sits in the class.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.260
It's amazing, they're these
two old guys who are still

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.260
debating about macroeconomics,
they're like 60 years old.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.800
And one can only imagine
what it was like when

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.805
they were at Harvard.

00:02:21.805 --> 00:02:26.680
PAUL KRUGMAN: If it's anything
like mine, they're totally

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.120
having a sort of out-of-body
experience right now.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.650
They're totally shocked,
totally--

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.060
it's wild.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.330
FERNANDA MARQUEZ: It was a very
good surprise hearing

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.830
about it this morning.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.208
We all feel so privileged to
be here studying in the

00:02:41.208 --> 00:02:44.624
Economics Department in
Princeton, and have a faculty

00:02:44.624 --> 00:02:47.420
that's been awarded
this great honor.
