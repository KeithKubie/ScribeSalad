00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:12.870
Okay, look down at this playing bar… it's
going forward right?

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:13.980
Time moves forward.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.980
Why is that?

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:25.950
This new theory is going to bend your mind,
seriously.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.190
My roommate back in DC could say anything
backwards, you could say something to her,

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.320
anything at all, and she could say it back
to you backwards.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.199
Try saying the alphabet backwards, or sing
a Beatles song, or your own name!

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:41.000
Mirror images, backwards things… they are
hard enough to wrap our brains around… but

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.660
what about a whole mirror universe?

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.629
Literally everything in ours, mirrored.

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.670
That's the new theory put forth by physics
to explain time's onward march.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.420
We're not the only universe at this party.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.730
When you look at all the major theories of
physics, Newton's gravitation, Einstein's

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.120
relativity, they all only work if time can
go both forward, and backward.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.330
But as we look at it, time is only going one
direction.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.130
Physicists call it, the "arrow of time."

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.261
It goes in one direction because the second
law of thermodynamics says as the universe

00:01:11.261 --> 00:01:16.590
ages, more entropy is introduced and we measure
time by how much entropy there was before,

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.970
versus now.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.330
There's more now, there's always more now.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.110
Entropy, by the way, is hard to define.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.160
But in a roundabout way, it’s like disorder.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.570
See, just after the big bang happened, the
universe was a consistent soup of particles,

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.160
and slowly they spread and coalesced into
galaxies, solar systems, planets and so on,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.160
adding entropy.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.450
But, a new study in Physical Review Letters
is challenging this whole idea of thermodynamics

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.550
and entropy driving time.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.390
Their findings suggest time is driven, not
by entropy, but by gravity!

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.710
They tested this by creating a computer simulation
that ran from the big bang onward and got

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.170
a surprising result.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.860
There isn't just ONE direction time can flow.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.500
Their simulated universe was EXTREMELY simple,
it had only 1,000 particles and used Newtonian

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.500
physics.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.810
In the simulation, the Big Bang created TWO
universes mirroring each other -- and the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.160
arrow of time flows in opposite directions
in each universe!

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.200
Time flowing both ways aligns with other theories,
but it's pretty shocking to think there might

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.810
be another universe mirroring ours.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.650
Okay, so if this is true, and as always more
research is needed -- then the arrow of time

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.290
in the MIRROR universe is flowing backward
relative to OUR arrow of time, but not for

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.290
THEM.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.409
The perception of time is relative, so whomever
lives in the mirrorverse sees their arrow

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:31.549
of time moving "forward."

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.769
The cool questions involve what if we could
GO to that universe, would we see them aging

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:36.769
backward?

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.409
What about the multiverse, are there infinitely
many mirrorverses in those parallel to us

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:41.409
too?

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:42.409
What's it all MEAN!!?!?!

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:43.640
I know, this is heavy, doc.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.120
There's nothing wrong with the universe's
gravitational pull, and time IS relative,

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.489
but… wow.

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.069
What if WE'RE THE TWIN!

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.819
What if they discovered this long ago and
WE'RE the mirror!

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.069
What if in that other universe they're looking
back toward us saying, look at THOSE guys,

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:59.200
amirite?!

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.989
Physics gets me so loopy… i love it.

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.709
Can you wrap your head around this?

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:14.270
Any smart people out there have more explanations?

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:52.109
