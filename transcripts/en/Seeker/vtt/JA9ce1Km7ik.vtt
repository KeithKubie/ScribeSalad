00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.890
There are prescription drugs for almost everything
these days, vitamins, hormones, medicines,

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.410
inhibitors, killers, boosters, wow… you
guys this sounds like a bunch of gangs...

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:28.340
One of the best selling prescription drugs
in the U.S. is adalimumab, prescribed for

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.320
inflammatory diseases like arthritis or Crohn's.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.010
The thing is, 306 other medications interact
with adalimumab, including 940 brand and generic

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.710
drugs some, like the vaccines for polio, smallpox,
and MMR interact so seriously that the risks

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.309
outweigh the benefits!

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.850
No doctor could know all 1000 interactions…
and that's just with one drug.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.870
According to the FDA, almost half of U.S.
population has used a prescription drug in

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:03.260
the last 30 days, 22 percent of us have used
three drugs in that time, and nearly 11 percent

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.360
have used five or more.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.299
Doctors need to keep a watchful eye on what
medications each of us are taking, because

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.780
sometimes, when drugs mix inside our bodies
the results are dangerous, or deadly.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.130
According to the National Institutes of Health,
DDIs or drug-drug interactions occur when

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.040
two drugs interact with the same product.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.280
If two drugs attempt to alter the same specific
hormone, gene, or molecular pathway for example…

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.120
their attempts to fix a problem could become
a bigger issue.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.799
According to a paper from Stanford, DDIs result
from the drug working too slowly or too quickly.

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:42.450
So, either the enzyme responsible for metabolising
drug B is inhibited by drug A, causing an

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.850
increased concentration in the body, OR drug
A kicks up the production of the metabolizing

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.670
enzyme, diluting drug B. Both are bad, because
then the drug's not doing it's job.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.950
Potentially worse, the two drugs could interact
in a way that produces an effect that neither

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.670
would on their own.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.009
Interactions are often discovered in the testing
of these drugs, and the understanding of what

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.350
pathways, enzymes and genes will be affected
by, and affect, any drug.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.260
Though, a new computer algorithm from Stanford,
data-mines the millions of reports filed with

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.060
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to reveal
as yet unknown side-effects and DDIs by digging

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.709
through medical reports, and available patient
histories!

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.549
DDIs are actually really common, and often
people simply ignore or forget that something

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.909
in their life is actually a drug.

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:32.699
For example, a simple antihistamine which
would normally reduce runny noses, sneezing

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:38.699
or allergic reactions; negatively interacts
with alcohol, sedatives, high blood pressure

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:41.049
medications, antidepressants and more and
more.

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:46.749
In fact, many people forget caffeine, alcohol
and nicotine are drugs and thus have their

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:48.499
own DDIs.

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:54.730
When mixed with alcohol, the over-the-counter
drug known as acetaminophen can cause serious

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.769
liver damage.

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.719
Thinking back to the different types of DDIs
both alcohol and acetaminophen are metabolized

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:02.219
by the liver.

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:08.029
Alcohol causes acetaminophen to break down
more quickly, creating a toxic, and damaging,

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:10.760
byproduct: N-acetyl-p-benzo-key-known Imeen
or NAPQI.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.599
Normally, the liver has a binding agent called
glue-te-theye-ohn which saved it, but not

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.439
under DDI conditions!

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:22.180
That can cause acute liver failure and need
of an immediate transplant.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.180
Serious stuff.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.450
And that's just one DDI!

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.989
When mixed with some prescription medications
alcohol can cause internal bleeding, heart

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.319
damage and far more serious, problems.

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.680
Another thing people forget to consider is
birth control.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.200
Birth control is a prescription medication,
one that many forget to divulge because it

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.969
becomes such a routine part of their lives;
even more so for women who use the ring, the

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:46.099
patch, or another long-term methods.

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:51.639
A 1990 study in Clinical Pharmacokinetics
found no strict evidence that oral contraceptives

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:57.079
can be affected by most drugs, but Planned
Parenthood and physicians will recommend caution

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:01.349
when taking oral contraception and a specific
antituberculous drug.

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.079
However, some analgesics like acetaminophen
-- branded as Tylenol -- may be less effective

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:12.170
when on the pill… while some antidepressants
and tranquilizers may be exaggerated.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.139
In the end, not everyone will have the same
DDI with the same dosage.

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.199
Which is why it's important to read the drug
labels and be conscious of the drugs you're

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:24.320
taking, and be open and honest with your doctor.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.539
If you're curious, look up Drugs.com, it's
run by some pharmacists out of New Zealand

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:31.919
who wanted to make DDIs more transparent.

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.250
It's CRAZY fascinating.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.400
As we get older, we tend to take more drugs,
and a report from Harvard states that Americans

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.800
over 70 often take as many as seven.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:05:17.800
So when it comes to DDIs, more research is
definitely needed.
