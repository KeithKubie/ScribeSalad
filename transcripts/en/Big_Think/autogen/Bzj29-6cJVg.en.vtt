where your sample gets handled by the

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570
where your sample gets handled by the
 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.200
where your sample gets handled by the
lab and we it produces a sample of your

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210
lab and we it produces a sample of your
 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.450
lab and we it produces a sample of your
genome that's about 500,000 snips little

genetic variations long and then that

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219
genetic variations long and then that
 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.750
genetic variations long and then that
gets sent to 23andme and then you're

again you can look at what are your
 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.399
again you can look at what are your
genetic tendencies to this or that

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409

it's tremendously educational if you've
studied men dealing genetics and then

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890
studied men dealing genetics and then
 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.740

you look at your family you can just see

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750
