1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.920
Do you have any thoughts on what [inaudible] disciplines someone can use to

2
00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:07.140
improve their decision making skills as a leader?

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.650
Not only in keeping clarity of thought during high pressured situations and

4
00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:15.120
environments,
but also in making the correct decisions when it is vital.
Okay,

5
00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:16.710
so we've talked about this last week.

6
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.500
You have to learn to detach and how do you learn to detach?

7
00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:23.460
You learned at hatch by putting yourself in stressful situations and then

8
00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:27.570
observing how you react.
So good stress,
stressful situations to put yourself in.

9
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.630
Well,
what makes you stressed?
One thing that will make everyone stressed,

10
00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:34.350
especially when they first start,
is start with Jujitsu.
That's gonna,

11
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.560
that's gonna put you in stressful environments.
Look at sports.

12
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.950
What are you going to do?
You know,
put yourself in stressful positions in sports.

13
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.130
What else makes you stress?
Public speaking,

14
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.790
public speaking makes some people really stressed out and start doing it more.

15
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.170
What about competition?

16
00:00:49.171 --> 00:00:54.171
Shooting where you've got to or hunting where you've got to do something in a

17
00:00:54.391 --> 00:00:59.340
stressful environment or archer,
you know,
I started started archery recently.

18
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.790
You did?
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

19
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.290
And so that's one of those things where you've got to learn to detach.

20
00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:07.890
You gotta learn to pay attention to things that are going on.

21
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.700
If you're all caught up in the moment,
then you're going to miss it.

22
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.060
So that's number one.
If you want to learn to deal with stress,

23
00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:18.240
put yourself in stressful situations that are under some kind of control.

24
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.480
You know,
even something like a paint ball,
you know,

25
00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:26.010
we do gigs at echelon front where we put people through what we call FTX is

26
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.410
where you go out and you're going to fire.

27
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.580
We usually use airsoft because it's a little bit more,

28
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.170
it's a little easier to work with.

29
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.640
But actually what we started using now is we've got these high end laser tag

30
00:01:38.641 --> 00:01:43.200
guns and so that's,
that's what we use.
And they are super effective.

31
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.780
They're there,
they're awesome.
They're awesome training tools.

32
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.150
LikeW if we would've had them,
if we would've,

33
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.010
if they would've existed when I was in the seal teams,

34
00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:51.570
I would have used them then because they're that good.

35
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.520
So we use those and we put people in stressful situations.
Go hit this target.

36
00:01:56.521 --> 00:01:59.310
There's bad guys,
you know people are going to get shot.
There's people yelling.

37
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.000
Put yourself in stress,
stressful situations and learn to detach.

38
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.080
Put yourself in stressful situations with the purpose of learning to detach and

39
00:02:07.081 --> 00:02:11.550
stepping back mentally to figure out what's going on.
Okay,
that's first part.

40
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.310
Next part is how do we make good decisions?
Well,
number one,

41
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.520
making correct decisions.
You've got to study,
you got to know and understand.

42
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.540
You've got to know the background,

43
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.170
you've got to know the historical outcomes of equivalent type decisions that

44
00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:31.170
have happened in the past,
similar situations.

45
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.460
And if you know the history and you know the background,

46
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.440
then you can use those to assess the current situation you're in.

47
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.290
And then once you assess the decisions that you can make,

48
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.530
assess the possible actions that you can take and then assess the outcomes that

49
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:52.740
those decisions will have.
Those actions will have.

50
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.120
And when you're doing that,

51
00:02:54.121 --> 00:02:58.440
you also have to assess the possibilities of inaction.

52
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.090
So a lot of times people forget that one,
they don't know.

53
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.810
They don't know if they should do a or B.
What they forget is there's also,

54
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.700
what if I don't do either?
What's going to happen?

55
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.230
Sometimes not doing either as good,

56
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.250
most that were a lot of times not doing either is bad.
So you've got a or B,

57
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:16.810
what should you do?
Maybe sometimes you've got to pick a or B.

58
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.500
Sometimes occasionally it's better not to do anything and you wait and let the

59
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.670
situation developed a little bit more.
What?

60
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.960
So the point of this is whatever you can know beforehand,
you know,
you learn,

61
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.080
you study,
you understand,
you know the standard operating procedures,

62
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:35.050
you know what various variations have been made on the standard operating

63
00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:39.100
procedures and that's how you go forward and you execute.

64
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:42.610
Now the thing that you have to remember is that you can't know everything

65
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:43.750
beforehand,

66
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.620
which is why it goes back to study and practice detaching and making decisions.

67
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.600
So,
so now let me dig into detaching a little bit.

68
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.510
Let's actually break that down.

69
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.620
Maybe some mechanical steps that you can use.
Number one,
step back,

70
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.660
like literally physically take a step back from the situation that you're in and

71
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.170
move your head and look around.
So when we used to shoot,

72
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.730
they would teach us to scan like you would have to physically move your head.

73
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.410
And what that is is a mental reminder that you need to look around and assess

74
00:04:17.411 --> 00:04:21.310
what's happening.
So once you've taken a step off the line,

75
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.130
whether that's taken a step back from the table,
when you're in a meeting,

76
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.560
if you're a,
if you're a firefighter and there's a fire happening,

77
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.810
take a step back so you can see the bigger picture.

78
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.510
If you're in a cop and and there's a shootout happening,

79
00:04:31.511 --> 00:04:32.830
where can you go to step back,

80
00:04:32.831 --> 00:04:36.980
get some cover and look around and see what's actually happening.
If you're in a,

81
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.540
if you're in a conversation with someone,
stop talking.

82
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.120
If there's an argument going on,
stop talking,

83
00:04:43.121 --> 00:04:46.840
take a step back and actually listened to all the other elements that are

84
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.370
shouting and yelling at each other.

85
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.250
If there's a decision that means to needs to be made,

86
00:04:51.251 --> 00:04:54.790
I don't on a planning situation,
step back from the plan.

87
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.060
Don't just take a step back from it,
look at it more broadly.

88
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.390
So that's step number one is to step back.
Number two,

89
00:05:01.391 --> 00:05:02.201
then you're gonna come up with,
hey,

90
00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:05.710
what are the possible decisions that I can make?
I could go this way.
I A,
B,
d,
a,
B,

91
00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:08.170
c,
d.
I could do any one of these things.

92
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.990
Keep an open mind.

93
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.590
This is the problem some people have is they come up with two decisions,

94
00:05:14.591 --> 00:05:16.600
three decisions and they don't think about anything else,

95
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.100
so you kind of have to like repeatedly detach.
You kind of have to stay detached.

96
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.870
That's why it's good you throw out an idea,

97
00:05:22.871 --> 00:05:26.410
like if we're planning for something and I come up with three ideas,
I say,
echo,

98
00:05:26.411 --> 00:05:28.810
what do you think of these?
I give them to you.
Then I stepped back again.

99
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:30.340
I keep my mind open,

100
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.800
so that's why the more you can get your subordinates to plan,

101
00:05:32.801 --> 00:05:33.700
the better off you're going to be.

102
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.910
The more you can get the people below you in the chain of command to come up

103
00:05:36.911 --> 00:05:38.830
with an idea or come up with the ideas,

104
00:05:38.831 --> 00:05:41.470
the better off you're going to be because you're not embroiled in it.
You're,

105
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.540
you're defacto detached because you're letting them run with it.
Then,
okay,

106
00:05:46.541 --> 00:05:48.670
once you look at your decisions and you've got to look at what the possible

107
00:05:48.671 --> 00:05:52.330
outcomes are,
what are the possible things that can happen?

108
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.950
Is this could,
how bad could this go?
Risk versus reward.

109
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.870
You got to weigh those things out and you got to do it fairly quickly and again,

110
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:00.470
you've got to,

111
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.860
you've got to figure out what's the result or possible outcome for inaction,

112
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.600
and then you just weigh out these various options that you've created and you

113
00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:12.560
figure which one,
which outcome has the most,
which one makes the most sense?

114
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.060
That's that's what's good,
and like I said,

115
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.000
inaction is some people like any action is better than no action,

116
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.160
not always true,
not always true.

117
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.870
Sometimes you can learn more by letting things develop and letting things reveal

118
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.300
what the status is.
So that does make sense.
And sometimes you do hold off.

119
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.130
If if you,
if you can see that a problem is getting worse though,

120
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.580
we'll then we've got to do something.
Then generally,
okay,

121
00:06:40.581 --> 00:06:43.310
let's make some kind of a decision very quickly.
Now,

122
00:06:43.311 --> 00:06:44.780
one of the most important things to remember,

123
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.330
and there's a little dichotomy to this,

124
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.250
is that you don't always have to make giant decisions.

125
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.780
You don't always have to make the,
all the,
the,

126
00:06:55.781 --> 00:07:00.470
the all powerful decision of might,

127
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.200
you know,
it's like,
do we go or do we not go?
You don't always have to say,

128
00:07:06.201 --> 00:07:10.450
we go.
Sometimes you can go,
well,
let's push a little further.
Let's,
let's move.

129
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.070
Let's move a little bit further before we make that decision.
Or,
Hey,

130
00:07:13.071 --> 00:07:16.460
let's stay where we are and see if it develops or let's back up a little bit and

131
00:07:16.461 --> 00:07:20.240
keep watching.
So instead of we go,
or we don't go,

132
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.170
there's actually a bunch of different decisions that you can make besides,

133
00:07:24.171 --> 00:07:27.710
we can go or don't go.
There's a building,
there's a bad guy in it.
Let's go.

134
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.250
Or let's not go.
No,
actually,
let's put eyes on the target for a little while.

135
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.670
Let's,
let's call and see if there's any other intelligence.

136
00:07:34.671 --> 00:07:36.010
Let's put an aircraft over half.

137
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.230
There's all kinds of decisions that you can make.
Let's push a little bit closer.

138
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.630
Let's stage,
let's monitor.

139
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:46.870
So there's all kinds of decisions that you can make that allow the,

140
00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:52.550
the situation to develop further and maybe reveal the proper decision to you in

141
00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:55.760
the long run.
So my,

142
00:07:55.970 --> 00:08:00.110
my fear of saying that is that people be get paralyzed.

143
00:08:00.111 --> 00:08:04.340
What does it analyze?
The parallel and parallel analysis paralysis.

144
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:08.330
That's my fear about saying that because the dichotomy is you can sit around and

145
00:08:08.331 --> 00:08:10.750
analyze and figure out and look at something for over,

146
00:08:10.751 --> 00:08:14.090
for forever while the situation changes and now you lose.

147
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.570
So yes,
you don't have to make giant decisions,

148
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:22.640
but at the same time you gotta be decisive.
There's a dichotomy.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

149
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:27.740
I'm sorry.
Leadership is not easy.
Wrote a whole book about it.
Dichotomy.

150
00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:31.850
Leadership.
Why?
Cause that's what happens.
So there you go.

151
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:36.410
That's my assessment of how you can improve your decision making skills.

152
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:41.780
Experience goes a long way.
Yes.
Yeah.
That's when one of those,
just kind of,

153
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:46.340
when you were talking about the,
the results versus the,
the,

154
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.110
the method,
right?

155
00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.890
Decision making sometimes like the result,

156
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.070
actually both method end results kind of the value isn't even in the results.

157
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.520
<v 1>It's like you haven't getting that experience going through it,
you know,</v>

158
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:03.170
it'll improve your decision making.
Sure,
sure.
Yeah.
Thanks Shane.

159
00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:06.100
<v 0>Anytime you can be in a situation where you're making decisions and getting</v>

160
00:09:06.101 --> 00:09:07.840
experience out at,
you're going to get better at it.
Yeah.

161
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.390
Kind of the value and role playing that is a value.

162
00:09:10.391 --> 00:09:13.420
That's why we do a lot of role playing in echelon for like a little thing and

163
00:09:13.421 --> 00:09:17.090
people might think like,
oh that,
how does that work?
Come and get it,
get it.

164
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:20.020
I watch people all the time.

165
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:24.970
It totally improve as leaders because put them through a role play scenario as a

166
00:09:24.971 --> 00:09:29.560
leader where they're going up against a combative subordinate or a subordinate

167
00:09:29.561 --> 00:09:33.610
that's lazy or I subordinates angry or a subordinate that that wants to leave.

168
00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.250
Like you put,

169
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:37.180
you put a person role playing in those situations over and over again and they

170
00:09:37.181 --> 00:09:39.700
get so much better.
Three iterations,

171
00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:45.060
three iterations and people are exponentially better at handling situations.

172
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.970
<v 1>Yeah.
Cause it's like some,
I mean most of the time anyway,</v>

173
00:09:49.971 --> 00:09:52.830
it's just a matter of them like never seen it before.

174
00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:56.640
And then in the during game time it's kind of like you've got to make the

175
00:09:56.641 --> 00:10:00.300
decision super fast so you can't,
and analysts from the role playing situation,

176
00:10:00.301 --> 00:10:03.150
you can analyze,
you can do whatever and then t and then learn it.

177
00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:06.600
<v 0>I actually should have brought that up.
That's a great point.</v>

178
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:10.170
Is another way that you can get better at making decisions by role play for
sure.

179
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.930
Give yourself the options.
Put,
put your,

180
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.530
set yourself up a pressure situation and have people role play it out with you

181
00:10:16.531 --> 00:10:19.690
of what you're gonna do it.
So it's kind of like,
like mock that.

182
00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.530
That's basically what it is.
It is mock experience.

183
00:10:22.531 --> 00:10:25.560
That's basically what seal training,
well not the basic seal training,

184
00:10:25.561 --> 00:10:28.050
but the seal training that I run,
that's basically what it was.

185
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.900
We're going to have people act like bad guys and you're going to make decisions

186
00:10:30.901 --> 00:10:32.980
all day long.
That's a roleplay.
Yeah.
Get some,

187
00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:38.120
<v 1>yeah,
she,
I remember and again going back to like just seeing it once,</v>

188
00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:42.230
right.
They've seen at one time is is way bigger difference than then.

189
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.530
I mean compared with never seeing it all versus seen at once.

190
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:49.550
The difference between that is way bigger than seeing it like twice versus once

191
00:10:49.551 --> 00:10:53.250
you know,
if you see the ones it's Kinda like,
okay,
now know.
Yeah,
this,
yeah.

192
00:10:53.251 --> 00:10:55.100
It's like night and day.
It's night and day.

193
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:59.150
The difference between knowledge and like,
no,
no,
no.

194
00:10:59.151 --> 00:11:03.470
Knowledge is crazy.
Yeah.
And we see that over and over and over again.

195
00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:06.530
Like an Indiana Jones and the last crusade.
You ever seen that one?

196
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:10.130
I'm pretty sure.
Wait,
how old is that one?

197
00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.790
I saw the all like that series when we shot on Connor was a kid.

198
00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:19.400
I think I see.
So at the end and go through things right?

199
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.030
That they are like these booby traps.
Right?
Do you get the holy grail?

200
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.930
That's what they're doing.
Oh,
then I've seen this one cause everyone,

201
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.270
the guy's face melts,
right?
No,
that's right.

202
00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:32.150
It's the last cycle when they open the Ark.
Oh you gotta shut your eyes.
Yeah.

203
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.430
That's old school anyway.
No,
this one,

204
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:38.180
they have to go through these like these tests or whatever.

205
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:43.210
They're there booby traps to get to the holy grail and one of them was you have

206
00:11:43.791 --> 00:11:47.090
to kneel.
Only the penitent man will pass.

207
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.890
That's what it says in the grill diary,

208
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.610
which is Indiana Jones Dad's diary that took all the notes in.

209
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:57.430
And so he's like all you got interpret that.
Right.
So they had all these people,

210
00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:58.480
there were bad days there too.

211
00:11:58.481 --> 00:12:03.481
So they just send to someone in there and then the guide go in and is a head

212
00:12:03.881 --> 00:12:07.150
gets chopped off.
So you go in there,
you know,

213
00:12:07.151 --> 00:12:10.660
hey that blade is going to come chop off my head cause I seen that one guy get

214
00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:14.800
his head chopped off.
I'm just gonna duck just one time.

215
00:12:14.801 --> 00:12:18.100
That's all I got to know that blade's gonna come out duck.
Good point.

216
00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:19.750
Thanks Cindy.
Grand.

217
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:23.290
Granted there was more booby traps and you kind of got to refer to the grill

218
00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:27.670
diary for the answers.
It's subject to interpretation by the way,
but same deal.

219
00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:31.500
You see the point though,
right?
If you walk through a hall,
I get it.
Yeah.

220
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:34.900
You see that guy get his head chopped off,
you know?
Okay.
I better duck now.

221
00:12:34.901 --> 00:12:38.110
Your best doc.
Yeah.
Yup.
I get it.
Thank you.
One time.
