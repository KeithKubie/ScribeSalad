there are a lot of things that are

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070
there are a lot of things that are
 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.670
there are a lot of things that are
created accidentally in evolution there

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680
created accidentally in evolution there
 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.909

are a lot of side effects so you can

00:00:06.909 --> 00:00:06.919
are a lot of side effects so you can
 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:11.450
are a lot of side effects so you can
evolve a pleasure circuit for adaptive

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460
evolve a pleasure circuit for adaptive
 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.180
evolve a pleasure circuit for adaptive
things so they all eat food and drink

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190
things so they all eat food and drink
 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.910
things so they all eat food and drink
water and have sex and you can evolve

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920
water and have sex and you can evolve
 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.260
water and have sex and you can evolve
social cognition and then you can

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270
social cognition and then you can
 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.420
social cognition and then you can
connect up your social cognition center

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430
connect up your social cognition center
 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.269
connect up your social cognition center
with your pleasure center and then you

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279
with your pleasure center and then you
 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.320
with your pleasure center and then you
can take pleasure from positive social

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330
can take pleasure from positive social
 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.540
can take pleasure from positive social
evaluation which is something that you

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550
evaluation which is something that you
 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.979
evaluation which is something that you
could imagine would promote group

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989
could imagine would promote group
 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.630
could imagine would promote group
cohesion and in hunter-gatherer

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640
cohesion and in hunter-gatherer
 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.319
cohesion and in hunter-gatherer
societies would be adaptive but then

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329
societies would be adaptive but then
 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.510
societies would be adaptive but then
you've built a machine that can be

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520
you've built a machine that can be
 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.940
you've built a machine that can be
operated on in all kinds of ways in

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950
operated on in all kinds of ways in
 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.920
operated on in all kinds of ways in
terms of culture and behavior and we

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930
terms of culture and behavior and we
 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.529
terms of culture and behavior and we
shouldn't fall into the trap and think

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539
shouldn't fall into the trap and think
 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.770
shouldn't fall into the trap and think
that all those ways are adaptive are

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780
that all those ways are adaptive are
 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.160
that all those ways are adaptive are
useful just because they've evolved

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170
useful just because they've evolved
 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.110
useful just because they've evolved
evolution is a tinkerer not an engineer

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120
evolution is a tinkerer not an engineer
 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.770
evolution is a tinkerer not an engineer
as Francois Jacoby Amos Lee said and

as Francois Jacoby Amos Lee said and
 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.050
as Francois Jacoby Amos Lee said and
when you're a tinkerer you throw things

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060
when you're a tinkerer you throw things
 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.120
when you're a tinkerer you throw things
together to solve the problem at hand
