[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.687
FEMALE SPEAKER: Ladies and
gentlemen, please welcome

00:00:06.687 --> 00:00:08.635
Senior Vice President,
Vic Gundotra.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.520
VIC GUNDOTRA: Well, good
morning and hello.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.350
And on behalf of Google, let me
extend our warmest welcome

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.560
to the 6,000 of you here in
attendance as well as the over

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:33.520
40,000 who have joined us in 440
viewing parties across 90

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.920
countries worldwide.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.780
And to the over one million
who are watching live on

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:52.160
YouTube right now, welcome to
the sixth annual Google I/O.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.240
Our platform and services teams
have worked incredibly

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.880
hard to get to this point.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.630
And I hope you're going to be
delighted by some of the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.630
surprises we have in store
for you this morning.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.459
But as that opening
video showed, it's

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:07.220
really not about us.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.510
It's about you, developers,
who are building the most

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.540
amazing and magical experiences
that make those

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.330
platforms and services
come alive.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.010
So when we say thank you, we
really sincerely mean it.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.900
Your support, your enthusiasm,
your building of apps for our

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.290
platform and services has
been deeply appreciated.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.460
And we hope that the things
that you'll see at this

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.160
conference will continue to
inspire you and that we at

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.630
Google will continue
to earn your trust.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.150
So with that, let's get
this keynote started.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.932
Please join me in welcoming
my friend Sundar Pichai.

00:01:45.932 --> 00:01:58.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:59.710
SUNDAR PICHAI: Thank you, Vic.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.270
It's incredibly exciting
to be here.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.500
Welcome to Google I/O. I think
we are in the middle of one of

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.449
the most pivotal moments
in personal computing.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.470
We are going through one of the
most innovative phases in

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.240
personal computing.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.350
Most of you in this audience
have lived through the PC

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.690
revolution.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.140
An incredibly important
revolution in our lifetime.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.560
It started around 1980.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.900
But if you take a look back, for
over 25 years most people

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.200
in the world used one operating

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.670
system, which was Windows.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.090
And in terms of hardware form
factors, it evolved from

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.790
desktops to laptops over
a long period of time.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.480
But fast forward to about
seven years ago.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.030
With the advent of smartphone,
there's been an explosion of

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.780
devices, phones and tablets and
increasingly newer types

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.820
of devices.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.780
People are adopting these
devices at an amazing pace

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.410
because it has a profound
impact on

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.380
their day to day lives.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.670
Nothing captures this moment
as the picture behind me.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.190
These are two pictures in
the same location in

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.240
Saint Peter's Basilica.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.260
The one on the left is a the
funeral of Pope John Paul II.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.030
The one on the right is the
announcement of the new Pope

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.536
Francis recently.

00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:24.740
For sure, different moments,
the one on the

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.390
left this more somber.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.560
But you can see there is one
person way ahead of their time

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.790
with a clam shell phone trying
to take a picture.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.140
But you look at the one on the
right, a sea of phones

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.780
capturing that moment.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.850
The world has changed pretty
dramatically just in a span of

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.120
six to seven years.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.130
Increasingly people are using
many, many different types of

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.990
computing devices.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.720
It's not just desktops, phones,
and laptops anymore.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.860
It's watch with displays.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.990
Its thermostats with displays.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.070
Maybe a car console has a
display and maybe something

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.720
like Google Glass.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.700
When you look at all these
computing devices, it's a

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.580
multi-screen world.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.220
These are all small displays
with a lot of

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.830
computing power in them.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.360
In addition to that,
they have sensors.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.380
They can listen.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.260
They can feel.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.769
They can hear.

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.160
And the amount of computing
power in these screens is

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.860
incredible.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.650
And users are really adopting
these computing devices.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.600
We at Google are incredibly
excited.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.140
This is why we view this as
one of the most important

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.570
moments in computing.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.460
And we're working very,
very hard to continue

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.080
this journey forward.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.140
The reason is at the heart of
this journey is the impact we

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.250
can have on people
around the world.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.720
That's what this journey
of personal computing

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.740
is about for us.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.150
We are very, very fortunate at
Google to have two platforms,

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.840
two large open platforms, two
fast growing platforms, two

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.850
scalable platforms completely
designed for developers like

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.190
you to build amazing

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.940
experiences, Android and Chrome.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.780
Android started with a simple
goal of bringing open

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.440
standards to the mobile
industry.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.390
Today it is the most popular
mobile operating

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.192
system in the world.

00:05:20.192 --> 00:05:28.100
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.790
SUNDAR PICHAI: Chrome, again,
started as a simple journey to

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:35.310
make the web much better, both
as a platform for developers

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.320
and as an experience
for users.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.150
The goal was to design
a simpler,

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.240
safer, and faster browser.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.370
And today it is the
most popular

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.764
browser used in the world.

00:05:45.764 --> 00:05:52.060
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.740
SUNDAR PICHAI: Android and
Chrome, as I said earlier, are

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.890
really designed for people
to build amazing

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.620
experiences on top.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.050
We at Google are working hard
on top of these platforms.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.920
We call this the
best of Google.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.660
We are building products like
search, Maps, YouTube, Google

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.570
Now, and many more new things
which you will hear about

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:10.650
later today.

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.150
So we are working hard on top of
these platforms to push the

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.030
journey of computing forward.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.730
But what really excites is that
developers like you can

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.870
build thousands of third party
applications, great

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.126
applications which really make a
difference on top of Android

00:06:27.126 --> 00:06:28.000
and Chrome.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.460
And that's what a lot of
this keynote is about.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.370
What are we doing on top of
these platforms so that you

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.240
can continue doing the
great work you do?

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.350
With that, let's get started.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.730
We're going to talk
about Android.

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:47.230
So two years ago we announced
we had over 100 million

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:48.952
activations of Android.

00:06:48.952 --> 00:06:51.920
We were incredibly excited at
the rate of the of growth.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.660
And a year ago at Moscone we
celebrated the fact that we

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.180
have four 400 million
activations of Android.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.000
The momentum has been
breathtaking since then.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.298
So let's take a look
at where we are.

00:07:06.298 --> 00:07:08.286
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:09.914 --> 00:08:16.960
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.430
SUNDAR PICHAI: 900 million.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:19.640
It's an extraordinary
achievement.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.160
But it's an extraordinary
ecosystem achievement.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.580
We couldn't have gotten there
without the help of a lot of

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.540
you in the audience and people
around the world, developers

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.800
around the world.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.880
We are incredibly humbled by
where we have reached.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.730
But we have to remember there
are over 7 billion people on

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:35.830
this planet.

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:37.490
So we have a long way to go.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.669
And we think the journey is
just getting started.

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:44.360
So if you look, we're going
to put a map of the world.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.820
And we're going to highlight
for you areas of the world

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:51.970
where the penetration of Android
is less than 10%.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:54.790
And as you can see, while we're
growing very, very fast,

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:57.920
most of the world, the countries
in green here

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.610
represent over four and
a half billion people.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:04.010
And the penetration of Android
is less than 10%.

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.610
But it is growing
very, very fast.

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:09.910
So a lot of this journey is
about bringing that next four

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:13.600
and a half billion people online
and making a difference

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.310
in their lives.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:17.610
So we're going to talk a lot
about what we are doing in

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:21.260
Android both for developers
and users to

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.940
continue this momentum.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:27.450
And to get started, I'm going to
invite Hugo onto the stage.

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:37.500
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.600
HUGO BARRA: Good morning,
everyone.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.130
Thank you, Sundar.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.140
How are you guys doing
this morning?

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:42.900
[CHEERING]

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.440
HUGO BARRA: Great.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.400
You guys just heard about the
spectacular Android ecosystem

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.050
momentum all around the world.

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:57.220
Well it's also been an amazing
year for Android developers.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.880
Here's a pretty insane
number for you.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:06.450
Google Play has just crossed
48 billion app installs.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:06.900
That's right.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.570
48 billion app installs.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:10.710
That's a huge number.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:11.870
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:12.984
HUGO BARRA: Thank you.

00:10:12.984 --> 00:10:13.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:19.540
HUGO BARRA: And two and a half
billion installs in the last

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.320
month alone.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.800
But even better than that, over
the last four months,

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.980
this year, we've already paid
out more money to Android

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:32.460
developer's on Google Play
than in all of last year.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:33.920
And revenue per user--

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:34.713
thank you.

00:10:34.713 --> 00:10:37.030
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:38.730
HUGO BARRA: And revenue per
user, which is a pretty

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:42.100
important stat for all of us, is
two and half times what it

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:46.510
was just a year ago globally.

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:49.250
So you guys, Android developers,
are really the

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:50.350
heart of this ecosystem.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:51.920
And I think that
you know that.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.990
We've been in this incredible
journey together for over five

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:59.270
years now since the first
Android SDK came out.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:03.230
And as Vic said, Google
I/O is all about you.

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:06.170
And we're here to show
that we're listening.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:09.880
And we're here because we really
want you to thrive.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.530
So let's go.

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:12.710
Let's get started here.

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:16.550
The first thing we want to do is
give you a preview of some

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:19.750
exciting developer tools and
services that we're announcing

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:22.570
here at I/O. And, of course,
you'll get to see these in

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:27.440
great detail in the 52 Android
sessions and code labs that

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:32.070
we've put together just for you
over the next three days.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:37.100
All right, so first off is
Google Play services.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.190
A few months ago we launched
Google Play services as a

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:44.090
layer built and managed
by Google on top

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:45.480
on the Android platform.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.310
It includes API that we at
Google use to build our own

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:52.430
apps like Google Maps
and Google Now.

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:54.940
And we're making these APIs
available to you so that you

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:58.720
can make your apps
even better.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.860
Google Play services
are distributed

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:02.170
via the Play Store.

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:06.410
And it's automatically updated
directly by Google

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:09.300
independently of operating
system versions.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:13.800
This means you have access to
the latest APIs consistently

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.260
on all devices.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.360
HUGO BARRA: Thank you.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:23.500
Now, one of the first API's that
we launched as part of

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:28.530
Google Play services was the
Google Maps Android API v2.

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.680
Many of you already use
it in your apps.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.890
You're looking here at
the Expedia app.

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.670
And you can see this is a major
user experience upgrade

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:39.230
compared to the original Android
platform Maps API.

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:42.910
It allows you to build Google
Maps directly into your app,

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:46.960
amazing vector based maps, full
3D movement and rotation,

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.790
and 3D building profiles.

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:51.310
Looks really, really great.

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:55.500
Now, location is a key input
to so many apps.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.800
The Google Maps API is, of
course, a huge part of this.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.490
But today we're going to take
it one step further by

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:04.750
launching three new
location APIs as

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.870
part of Google services.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:10.650
A first API is called Fused
Location Provider.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:13.590
We've completely rewritten our
locations algorithms, taking

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:18.340
advantage of all the sensors so
that location is now faster

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:19.400
to acquire.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.910
It's more accurate.

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:24.790
And we're also adding a new low
power location mode that

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:29.020
uses less than 1% of
battery per hour.

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:35.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:38.310
HUGO BARRA: The second new
location API that we're

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:41.360
announcing today
is Geofencing.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.560
Geofencing lets you define
virtual fences around

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.110
geographic areas.

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:48.870
And those trigger when
the user enters

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.690
or exits these areas.

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:54.200
You can have up to 100 geofences
simultaneously

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.850
active per app.

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:57.680
This has been a big
ask from you guys.

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:58.090
There you go.

00:13:58.090 --> 00:13:59.320
That's what I thought.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.494
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:01.494 --> 00:14:03.720
HUGO BARRA: So I thought
you would like that.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.250
The third new location API that
we're announcing today is

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:08.640
Activity Recognition.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.170
There's been a lot of interest
from the developer community

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:15.330
for apps that help users track
their physical activities.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.990
This new API, Activity
Recognition, uses

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:22.960
accelerometer data and machine
learning classifiers to

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.670
automatically figure out when
the user is walking, cycling,

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:27.710
or driving.

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:30.110
And we do it in a really battery
efficient way without

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:32.140
even turning on the GPS.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.390
So we think there's going to
be a whole new category of

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:36.390
awesome apps that take
advantage of this new

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:37.640
capability.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:44.670
So let's keep going.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:47.310
Another Google Play services API
that we launched a couple

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:50.260
months ago was Google+
Sign-in.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.940
And as many of you know, that
lets people sign into your app

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.620
with their existing Google
credentials so that you don't

00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:00.120
have to create a new account
name space and users don't

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.280
have to remember yet
another passport.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.420
Today we're expanding that
capability by introducing

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.200
cross platform single sign-on.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:09.840
It's really exciting.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.090
And I want to show you
that right now.

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:16.280
So Jai is here in The
Fancy Web site.

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.030
He's on his computer.

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:20.130
He has not created
a Fancy account.

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:23.040
But he is signed into Google.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.700
And when he tries to fancy,
let's say, this margarita

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:28.980
maker, he's prompted to
create an account.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.760
He's going to choose Google+
as his Sign-in method here.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:35.540
Now here's the interesting
part.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.650
He's getting an option to
automatically install the

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:40.910
fancy app on his
Android tablet.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:42.940
That's pretty cool because now
he doesn't have to remember to

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.810
go find it and install
it later.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:47.150
It just does it all for him.

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:50.950
So he's fancied his mixed
drink machine here.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.660
Now let's switch over to his
tablet and take a look.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.870
Now, Jai should have gotten
the notification--

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:00.680
there it is--

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.880
that says the app was
automatically

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.030
installed on his tablet.

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:06.630
This actually just happened.

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:07.400
And we--

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.600
thank you.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.400
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.390
HUGO BARRA: And when he opens
the app here, because he's

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:18.240
already signed in on The Fancy
Web site, he's automatically

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.180
logged into the Fancy on
his Android tablet.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.416
Isn't that cool?

00:16:22.416 --> 00:16:25.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:28.660
HUGO BARRA: So he goes to the
My Collection section, which

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:31.340
shows things that he's fancied
before, there it is.

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.940
That's your margarita
machine, Jai.

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:34.630
That's pretty cool.

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:39.068
So that's cross-platform single
sign-on in action.

00:16:39.068 --> 00:16:44.420
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:45.550
HUGO BARRA: So let's keep going

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:46.930
with Google Play services.

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:49.940
Last year at I/O we announced
Google Cloud

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.950
Messaging, or GCM for short.

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:55.840
GCM is a service that's managed
by Google that lets

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:58.990
you seamlessly push data
from your servers to

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:00.480
your Android apps.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.560
GCM was super well
received by the

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.160
entire developer community.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.460
60% of the top 100 apps
in Play Store

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:10.470
today are using GCM.

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:16.069
We're delivering 200,000 GCM
push messages every second.

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:18.504
That's 17 billion
messages a day.

00:17:18.504 --> 00:17:20.829
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:21.000
HUGO BARRA: Thank you.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.349
And what's even more impressive
is the average

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:26.180
server to server latency.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:30.200
That's 60 milliseconds, which
is actually 30% faster than

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.520
when we launched this service
just a year ago.

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.020
So the news here today is
that GCM is now part

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.900
of Google Play services.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:41.850
And we're announcing three major
new features as part of

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:44.150
a major upgrade.

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:48.360
So, first, GCM now supports
persistent connections between

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.420
your servers and Google.

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.210
With a persistent connection you
can send a large number of

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:57.434
messages to many, many
devices very quickly.

00:17:57.434 --> 00:17:58.390
Thank you.

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:00.780
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.410
HUGO BARRA: Second, we're
launching one of the GCM

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:06.660
features that you have
requested the most.

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.540
And I think you'll like this.

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:11.200
Upstream messaging,
there you go.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.590
You can now use GCM to send data
in the other direction as

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:19.780
well, so from your app to your
servers just as seamlessly.

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.630
GCM, of course, does all the
client side connection

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:23.650
[INAUDIBLE] before you.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:25.770
It automatically retries
if the network

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:27.660
isn't up and so on.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:31.010
So it really helps to keep
battery and data usage as

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:33.550
minimal as possible.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:37.010
Third, and I'm sure you'll
love this one too, we're

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:40.650
launching another GCM API that
synchronizes notifications for

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:44.110
you so that when you dismiss a
notification on one device--

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:45.050
there you go.

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:51.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.910
HUGO BARRA: So that same
notification goes away on the

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:55.150
other device as well.

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:57.910
And you'll see more about
this here today.

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:02.020
All of the three new major GCM
features you saw are rolling

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:03.340
out progressively.

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:05.160
And all you have to
do is sign up.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.150
And you can do that
starting today.

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:10.790
So to summarize, this is
where we are right now.

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:12.580
These are the Google Play
services we've covered

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:18.710
already, the Maps API, the new
location APIs, Google+ sign-in

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:23.010
with cross-platform single
sign-on, and GCM with upstream

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:26.100
messaging and synchronized
notifications.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.350
Now we're going to cover one
more service, a major one that

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:30.880
we're adding today.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.470
So let's talk about gaming.

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:35.500
Everybody loves gaming.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.660
And with the explosion of
tablets all around the world,

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.180
games are doing better
than ever.

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:44.740
And today we're announcing a
new family of APIs built

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:46.750
specifically for game
developers.

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:50.650
We call it Google Play
game services.

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:53.860
So let's talk about that.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:59.150
The first new Google Play game
services API is Cloud Save.

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:03.380
Cloud Save enables you to save
user data across devices like

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:05.930
player progression
and game state.

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:09.520
So if a player finishes playing
level one on his

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.430
phone, for example, he can then
pick up is Android tablet

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:16.800
and start playing right
away from level two.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.740
Thank you.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.100
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:21.880
HUGO BARRA: Next, are APIs for

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.030
achievements and leader boards.

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:27.500
Achievements are virtual trophy
walls that make it

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.565
really easy for you to increase
engagement inside

00:20:29.565 --> 00:20:30.840
your games.

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:35.330
And leader boards use Google+
Circles to connect players and

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.790
really encourage friendly
competition.

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:40.140
Let's put it that way.

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:43.990
So here we are in the game
called the World of Goo.

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:47.000
And from within the game my
friend Jai can launch into a

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.250
leader board and see how he
ranks against other players.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.080
So here in the public leader
boards you can see that he's

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.570
actually not very
highly ranked.

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:56.460
You can't even find him.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:57.680
That's the public
leader board.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:01.180
But that's OK because he's
number two amongst his friends

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:04.270
on Google+, which looks pretty
cool until, of course, you see

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:05.520
who's number one.

00:21:07.422 --> 00:21:12.820
Now, Cloud Save, achievements,
and leader boards are APIs

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:16.860
that we're launching not only
on Android, but also for iOS

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:20.870
and web so you can have cross
platform gaming experiences,

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:22.207
which I think is pretty
important.

00:21:22.207 --> 00:21:28.670
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:29.940
HUGO BARRA: Now here's where
it gets really exciting.

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:33.260
The next Google Play game
services API that we're

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:37.000
announcing today is a
comprehensive multiplayer

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.610
service for matching players and
engaging them in head to

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:42.740
head competition.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:45.250
We know, obviously, because you
tell us, that building low

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:50.250
latency, real time synchronous
games is pretty damn hard.

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:51.800
So we want to help.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.900
So the first thing we'll do is
we're going to deal with all

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:57.290
the hard networking problems and
manage all of the device

00:21:57.290 --> 00:21:59.470
peer-to-peer connections
for you.

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:01.910
And then the second thing we'll
do via Google+ is make

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:05.110
it easier for your players to
invite friends that they want

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:09.580
to play with or against, as
well as quickly find new

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:11.400
people that they
can challenge.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.490
What you'll see here are some
of the developers that we've

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:16.560
been working on to integrate
Google Play games services

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:17.720
into their titles.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:21.060
There's actually lots of games
launching today with many of

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:25.000
these capabilities that
we talked about.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.010
Now, these game APIs that we
just talked about are also

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:31.390
part of Google Play services,
by the way.

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:34.100
And all the core APIs that you
see here, some of the things

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.880
that we talked about today,
will be available via an

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.460
update to Google Play services
that we're rolling out today

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:43.510
to all Android devices,
Froyo and up.

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:47.240
And we'll continue to add the
best of Google innovation so

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:51.420
that you can continue to
build awesome apps.

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.110
Now--

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.690
thank you.

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:56.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:58.530
HUGO BARRA: I want to
shift gears and talk

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:00.540
about developer tools.

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:03.610
One of the most common pieces
of feedback that we get from

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:06.480
you all the time is that you
want more options for Android

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.260
development.

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:10.350
Well, today we want to show you
a new Android tool that

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:11.590
we've been working on.

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:16.860
It's called Android Studio and
it's based on the community

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.786
edition of IntelliJ
from JetBrains--

00:23:19.786 --> 00:23:21.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.140
HUGO BARRA: --which,
obviously, you

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:23.390
guys know very well.

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:30.000
Android Studio is an IDE that's
truly built for Android

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.090
with the goal of making you
faster and much more

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:35.790
productive as an
app developer.

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:37.810
Now, I'd like to show
you this live.

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:40.970
And to do that, here's Tor
Norbye from the Android Tools

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:41.820
team for a quick demo.

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:42.295
Take it away.

00:23:42.295 --> 00:23:43.640
TOR NORBYE: Good Morning.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.440
Today, I want to share with
you a few of my favorite

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.890
features in Android Studio.

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:50.880
As Hugo said, Android studio is
based on IntelliJ, so it's

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:53.690
a fully featured IDE right
from the get-go.

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:55.990
What I love about it is the
attention to detail, which

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:57.980
makes it a pleasure to use.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:01.060
The IDE has a deep semantic
model of your code and it

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:02.180
understands Android.

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:05.990
So that makes the Code Editor
smarter and more productive.

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:07.720
Take, for example, this
code right here.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.380
This is how your write

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.040
internationalised apps in Android.

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.460
You don't hard code
your strings.

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.690
You look them up from
resource files.

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:17.120
Well, this IDE can figure out
what the real strings are and

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.990
show them to you in place in the
editor as if you had hard

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:20.820
coded the string.

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:23.570
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:26.630
TOR NORBYE: So note that the
code is still there.

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:28.380
It's just easier to read.

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:30.420
And we don't just
preview strings.

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:31.940
On the next few lines
you can see that I'm

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:33.470
manipulating some icons.

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:35.540
And those icons are previewed
right here

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.247
in the editor margin.

00:24:37.247 --> 00:24:41.630
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:43.230
TOR NORBYE: And so, likewise,
here's a color file.

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:45.300
And you can see that we resolve
the colors and preview

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:46.630
those in editor margin
as well.

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:52.790
Now, when you're editing your
layouts, you now get a live

00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:54.740
rendering of what the layout
is going to look like at

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:55.590
runtime time.

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:59.590
And what makes this really
powerful is that we have

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:01.490
multi-configuration editing.

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:04.060
So what if I want to know what
this layout looks like on

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:06.090
different screen sizes?

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:07.340
Let's take a look.

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:11.874
So here it is.

00:25:11.874 --> 00:25:18.210
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:20.250
TOR NORBYE: So here, I can see
my current layout rendered on

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:22.770
a 3.7 inch phone, 10
inch tablet, and

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:24.030
everything in between.

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:26.260
It's also showing me that I have
a custom tablet layout to

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:28.470
take advantage of that
extra space.

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:31.140
This feature is also great
for internationalization.

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:34.820
So if we jump into the settings
layout for our app, I

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:38.220
can now take a look at the
languages we're targeting.

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:41.600
And so, here, I can see my
layouts with the different

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:42.860
message catalogs applied.

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:45.440
So I can see Norwegian
in the bottom

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.916
left corner, for example.

00:25:46.916 --> 00:25:50.250
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:51.390
TOR NORBYE: So let's say
I want to make an edit.

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:53.560
Let's say I want to bump up the
font size on this second

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:54.920
label here.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.215
I can do that.

00:25:56.215 --> 00:25:58.300
And that's obviously too big.

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:01.170
So let me go back a little
and make it 26.

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:02.730
So now this looks
OK in English.

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:05.030
But notice that in German right
next to it right over

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:09.010
here, this string is actually
wrapping, which I don't want.

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:10.870
So at this point I could either
continue tweaking my

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:12.180
layout or get a shorter

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.310
translation if that's possible.

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:16.400
So, in short, this is a feature
that makes it really

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.590
easy to ensure that your layouts
work well across a

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:20.540
variety of devices and
configurations.

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:23.070
And while I focused on the Code
Editor today, this also

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:25.920
works in the full UI builder.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.320
We have big plans for
Android Studio.

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.530
We plan to integrate more and
more services into the IDE.

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:34.880
For example, with the simple
menu item, I can add a Google

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.310
Cloud Messaging back
end into my app.

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:40.450
And then I can take advantage
of all those great GCM APIs

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:41.700
that Hugo told you
about earlier.

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:46.720
And this is just scratching
the surface of all the new

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.340
features in Android Studio.

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:50.714
Thank you.

00:26:50.714 --> 00:26:56.920
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.272
HUGO BARRA: All right.

00:26:59.272 --> 00:27:01.370
I think I actually lost
my prompter, guys.

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:04.040
I need somebody to advance
that mainly for me, if we

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.290
could do that.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.650
The prompter, please?

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:12.730
OK, well, then we
can ad lib it.

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:17.570
And so, of course, half of the
game is about building awesome

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:20.810
apps, developer tools, and
services, and so on.

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:25.180
The other half is about
distribution and monetization.

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:26.630
How do you find more users?

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:28.340
How do you monetize your app?

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:32.130
To tell you about a bunch of
new features to the Android

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:36.410
developer console, I'd like to
invite on stage Ellie Powers

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:37.970
from the Android product team.

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:39.220
Ellie, come on up.

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:52.610
ELLIE POWERS: All right.

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:54.050
Hi, everybody.

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:57.210
I'm Ellie and this is Miles.

00:27:57.210 --> 00:28:01.830
So last year at Google I/O we
announced the new Google Play

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:03.570
developer console.

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:07.850
And since then you've sent us
tons of feedback telling us

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:10.240
exactly what you want
to see next.

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:13.300
We've taken that feedback into
account and today I'm here to

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:15.830
tell you about five new features
that we're adding to

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:19.430
the developer console to help
you get more users and make

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:21.520
more money on Android.

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.210
So let's get started.

00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:24.900
The first feature I want
to tell you about is

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:26.980
optimization tips.

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:28.470
So let's take a look here.

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:31.170
We can see all of my apps in
the developer console.

00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:32.920
And let's take a look at Fortune
Teller, which is my

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.020
most popular app.

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:37.430
OK, here we go.

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:38.750
This app is doing pretty well.

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:42.020
But I'm always wondering what
can I do to make Fortune

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:44.280
Teller a bit more successful?

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.230
And that's exactly what
we had in mind with

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:47.800
optimization tips.

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.560
It analyzes your app.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.090
We look at how your app is
doing in the Play Store.

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:55.100
And we offer you insights about
how you can improve it.

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:56.100
So what do we have today?

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:58.650
We have two optimization tips.

00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:01.220
The first one is telling us that
we should design our app

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:04.170
for tablets by uploading
tablet screenshots.

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:06.890
Now, this is really important,
and I should definitely do it

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:09.600
because it will encourage
more users on tablets

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.800
to install my app.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.790
Next, it's telling me that I
have a lot of users who speak

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:17.320
Russian, and they're already
using my app.

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:20.100
But my app isn't actually
translated into Russian.

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:23.180
So that's another opportunity
for me.

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:26.870
OK, I don't speak Russian, so
I need to get some help.

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:28.590
It used to be a lot
of work to find a

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:29.730
translator for your apps.

00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:32.800
You had to search the internet
looking for a good company.

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:34.890
But we want to make
this easier.

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:38.030
So that's why today we're now
going to use our new app

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:40.380
translation service,
fantastic.

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:41.640
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.790
ELLIE POWERS: And we're
announcing this today.

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:47.910
This service allows you to get
professional translations

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:49.790
directly in the developer
console.

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:51.850
And we're going to try it out.

00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:55.090
OK, it takes just a minute to
upload the strings we want

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:58.830
translated into the Google Play
developer console here.

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:01.070
Next, we select the languages
that we want

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.950
to translate into.

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:03.860
So for today, we're, of course,
going to select

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:06.510
Russian and try to help
those guys out.

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:09.010
Next, it's going to show us a
list of all the different

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:10.520
translation vendors.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:13.220
And then I can just pick one
that suits my budget.

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:14.990
And that's it.

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:16.880
Google will send my
strings off to

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.540
the translation company.

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:21.250
And then in about a week they
come back and I can download

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:23.720
them directly from the
developer console.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.105
Super simple.

00:30:25.105 --> 00:30:32.240
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.190
ELLIE POWERS: Some of you may be
interested in participating

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:35.410
in this pilot program.

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:39.340
So please sign up in the
developer console today.

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:41.300
OK, now I've gotten Fortune
Teller ready

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:43.280
for the Russian market.

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:46.610
So I want to invest in a
campaign to promote my app.

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:48.970
But naturally I want
to know which ads

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:50.680
are the most effective.

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:54.060
And that's why we're announcing
referral tracking.

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:56.530
This makes it easy to
understand which

00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:58.710
ads are most effective.

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:00.730
And we're going to switch to
Google Analytics to take a

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:02.130
look at it.

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:04.460
OK, here we're adding
a new report in

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.210
the acquisition section.

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:08.010
This is a conversion
funnel report with

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:09.590
data from Google Play.

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:13.380
It shows us where our installs
come from, like blogs or top

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.680
websites and other
important ads.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.430
So here we go.

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:19.580
This will allow us to track
the effectiveness of each

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:20.350
referral channel.

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:23.220
So in the left we have each of
the channels followed by how

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:28.880
many users view, install,
and launch our app.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:31.920
OK, installations with
an app are really

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:32.850
just the first step.

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:34.730
What you want is for users
to come back to your

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:36.240
app again and again.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:39.020
And I want to understand how
often people are using my app.

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:40.870
I can do that with
Google Analytics.

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:43.680
But I have to go to
Google Analytics.

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.090
So soon we're going to be
showing these great engagement

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:48.380
metrics from Google Analytics
directly in

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:49.700
the developer console.

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:51.220
You'll have all your metrics--

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:52.208
thank you.

00:31:52.208 --> 00:31:55.080
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:56.820
ELLIE POWERS: We want to give
you all your metrics together

00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:58.570
in the same place.

00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:00.240
These two analytics features
are rolling

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.180
out later this summer.

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:03.740
So now we have an app
that people are

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:05.060
launching all the time.

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:07.530
So, of course, it's time
to make money.

00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:10.420
Like you, I just want to have
simple tools to show me how

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:13.000
much money I'm making
every single day.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.320
So now we've added a new tab
to the developer console

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.590
giving us a summary of
our app's revenue.

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:20.420
You can see your global
revenue and how

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:22.150
it varies over time.

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:24.420
And then we can even show
country specific revenue.

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:27.455
For example, we can check how
our app's doing in Japan.

00:32:27.455 --> 00:32:29.840
Wow, it looks like we had
a great day last week.

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.610
It must have been our
new in app products.

00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:32.710
Fantastic.

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:33.490
So that's it.

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:35.380
Revenue is at your fingertips
just like the

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:38.000
rest of your metrics.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.020
OK.

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:39.955
Thank you.

00:32:39.955 --> 00:32:42.630
[APPLAUSE].

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:44.920
ELLIE POWERS: All right, so
we have a successful app.

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.490
We're making lots of money.

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:49.740
So now I'm ready to try some
new features with my app.

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:50.790
Now it's important.

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:53.860
I really want to find out what
do my core users think about

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:56.980
these new features before I roll
them out to everybody?

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:58.910
And from your feedback,
I think a lot of you

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:00.470
want to do this too.

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:04.166
So today we are launching
beta testing.

00:33:04.166 --> 00:33:11.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:13.610
ELLIE POWERS: Yeah, a lot of
you talk to me on Google+

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:16.310
about this one and also
staged roll outs.

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:18.040
Let's take a look.

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:22.700
OK, we now have three tabs in
the developer console, alpha

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:25.670
testing, beta testing,
and production.

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:26.850
We want to start with a small--

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:27.470
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:28.720
ELLIE POWERS: All right,
thank you.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:32.030
We'll start with a small group
of alpha testers and then roll

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:34.430
out to a larger group
of beta testers.

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:35.760
Let's set it up.

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:39.250
OK, we select the APK
for our test.

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:41.610
Next, we're going to use Google
Groups and Google+

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:44.370
Communities to control
access to the app.

00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:47.000
Keep in mind here feedback will
be sent directly to me.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.480
And it's not posted
as public reviews.

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.520
That's very important.

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.890
OK, so now we have
our new version.

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:55.940
We're ready to put it
into production.

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:59.740
But rather than upgrading all my
users in one go, I can now

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:01.370
manage the roll out.

00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:05.070
So we can select a percentage
here, like, let's say, 10%.

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:08.560
and then we'd increase it over
time when we're ready.

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:09.953
OK.

00:34:09.953 --> 00:34:10.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:11.719
ELLIE POWERS: Don't applaud
at the same time.

00:34:11.719 --> 00:34:13.510
Let's start with 10%
on this side.

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:16.800
OK, so that was our five
new features in

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:17.790
the developer console.

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:22.110
We had optimization tips, the
app translation service, usage

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:26.130
metrics with referral tracking,
revenue graphs, and

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:28.697
beta testing with staged
roll outs.

00:34:28.697 --> 00:34:35.389
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:36.639
ELLIE POWERS: All right,
thank you.

00:34:38.969 --> 00:34:40.310
HUGO BARRA: Thanks, Ellie.

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:42.449
So just checking, how's
everyone doing?

00:34:42.449 --> 00:34:43.250
How are you guys feeling?

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:44.115
Pretty good?

00:34:44.115 --> 00:34:45.600
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:46.170
HUGO BARRA: OK.

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:49.560
Well, I don't know about you,
but I'm feeling pretty API'd

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.460
out at the moment.

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:54.420
So I guess it's probably a
good time to move on to

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:58.230
something maybe a little
bit more playful.

00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:02.260
With that, I want to introduce
a man whose name is always

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:04.210
music to my ears.

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:05.690
Ladies and gentlemen,
our resident

00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:07.722
rock star, Chris Yerga.

00:35:07.722 --> 00:35:17.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:18.180
CHRIS YERGA: Thank you, Hugo.

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:19.770
Good morning, everyone.

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:20.670
[JAPANESE], Tokyo.

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:22.220
Thanks for staying up.

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:26.390
All right, so we've just heard
about some great APIs and

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:29.680
tools to help you build the
next wave of Android apps.

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:32.760
But we've also been hard at work
helping users discover

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.460
all your great existing apps.

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:40.380
As we heard, we've been
successful that way with over

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:43.410
48 billion applications
installed from Google Play.

00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:46.170
But our aspirations are
greater than that.

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:48.730
So I'm happy to talk to you
today about some improvements

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:51.340
we're making to Google Play.

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:53.660
We recently launched a
redesigned version of the

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:54.810
Google Play store.

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:58.020
It has a simple clean design
that's designed to scale

00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:01.990
effortlessly across phones
and tablets and the web.

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:06.800
Let's take a look at the Play
store on the Nexus 10 tablet.

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.600
So here we have the store
on the tablet.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:12.130
And it's the same content that
you would see on your phone or

00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:12.600
anywhere else.

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:16.360
But it's presented in a way
that is much more richly

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:18.120
presented here on the tablet.

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:19.950
The content's organized
into collections.

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:22.570
We have some movie suggestions
there.

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:26.330
But the new Play Store isn't
just about looks.

00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:28.420
It's also designed to
help you improve

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:30.150
discovery of your apps.

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:32.820
The Play Store home screen
adapts to you.

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:35.910
So here we see that I've
got some specific

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:37.370
recommendations for me.

00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:40.955
I've got a book recommended
based on a previous book.

00:36:40.955 --> 00:36:43.460
I'm being recommended the movie
"Inception" because my

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:46.610
buddy Advay +1'd it and
some music and apps

00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:47.620
recommendations as well.

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:50.150
But to give you an idea of how
this adapts to different

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:53.910
people, why don't go out on a
limb here a little bit and put

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:58.600
Jai's tablet up side by side so
we can see the difference.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:01.410
And so here with Jai's tablet,
you see he gets the same types

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:02.370
of recommendations.

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:07.270
He's got movies and music, et
cetera because his friends

00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:10.690
have + 1'd things or based on
his previous apps that he's

00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:11.540
purchased, et cetera.

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:15.190
But one interesting thing that I
didn't see until now is that

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:17.410
it turns out you're
a Metallica fan?

00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:17.880
All right.

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:20.890
We should hang out.

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:23.530
All right, I think we've learned
enough about Jai.

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:25.670
So these personalization
features are going to be

00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:27.230
rolling out over the
coming weeks.

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:29.400
But the point is that the new
design of the Play Store gives

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.970
us an excellent foundation for
doing even more than what

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:33.660
you've just seen.

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:37.780
So we also know that many of
you have invested a lot of

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:40.430
energy in building awesome
tablet experiences.

00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:42.390
And we want to ensure that your
work pays off and that

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:44.970
users are able to discover
your great tablet apps.

00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:48.170
So starting today, we're going
to be providing a view in our

00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:52.260
top charts that surfaces
applications that are designed

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:53.490
for tablets.

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:54.780
Now, this view here--

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:55.914
thank you.

00:37:55.914 --> 00:37:57.770
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:57.770 --> 00:37:59.850
CHRIS YERGA: This shows apps
that meet our tablet app

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:00.830
design guidelines.

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:05.220
So they target tablet screen
sizes, use the screen real

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:07.820
estate on the tablets
effectively, et cetera.

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:10.660
And as Ellie showed you in the
demo before, in the dev

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:12.820
console you can get hints about
exactly what you should

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:16.040
be doing here if your app needs
some specific tweaks to

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.060
meet this criteria.

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:21.750
So I said that this UI scales
across a variety of devices.

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:24.780
So why don't we show you how
we're bringing this to the

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:27.245
rest of Play.

00:38:27.245 --> 00:38:29.540
Why don't we pop up
the laptop here.

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:31.670
So over the coming weeks, we're
going to be bringing the

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:34.940
same great Play experience
to the web as well.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:38.160
You'll notice here that it's
the same consistent design.

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:40.630
We have the same content here
along with my personalized

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:41.820
recommendations.

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:45.040
But it's presented in a way that
really takes great use of

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:46.260
the laptop.

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:48.760
And we also have a new
navigation model here on the

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.530
left hand side that easily
allows me to switch between

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:54.550
apps, movies, music,
and books.

00:38:57.966 --> 00:39:02.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:03.370
CHRIS YERGA: You know, on the
run through we didn't put a

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:05.910
picture of a more handsome man
behind me up on the screen.

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:07.920
But I guess that's fine.

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.270
So that's the Play Store.

00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:11.960
But the UX isn't just
about the store.

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:15.416
We also want to bring the same
great user experience to all

00:39:15.416 --> 00:39:17.280
of the play apps themselves.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.670
So over the coming weeks it's
going to be rolling out to all

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:23.960
the Play apps, books,
movies, magazines

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.485
and, of course, music.

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:29.850
So you guys want to
hear about music?

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:34.730
Music unites us.

00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:36.050
It's universal.

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:39.130
No matter who you are or where
you're from, the joy of music

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:40.510
is a constant.

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:43.390
And with ubiquitous mobile
devices, there's the potential

00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:45.860
to bring that music,
bring that joy with

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:48.610
us wherever we are.

00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:51.370
But when a bunch of us on the
Play team got together to talk

00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:55.700
about the next generation of
our music service, we all

00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:58.530
agreed that the reality was
somewhat different.

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:02.190
Yes, mobile devices give us more
choices than ever before.

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:05.625
But they weren't helping us
discover music we loved.

00:40:05.625 --> 00:40:07.420
It felt more like work.

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:10.400
Like, when we were kids,
figuring out what album to

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.890
play was an event.

00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:13.890
It was a ritual.

00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:18.610
So why is it that managing my
que feels like a chore?

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:22.330
So we set out to build a music
service that didn't just give

00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:25.760
you access to a world of music
but also helped guide you

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:26.770
through it.

00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:28.510
And we started from a
great foundation.

00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:31.410
On this very stage two years
ago, we launched our locker

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:33.830
service that allows you to
upload 20,000 of your songs,

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:36.860
stream them across all your
Android devices and the web.

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:40.000
And soon after, we launched our
music store, deals from

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.750
all the major labels
and Indies alike.

00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:46.040
And so today, users in 13
countries globally are

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:50.150
enjoying their music
on Play music.

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:53.210
But what if we gave you access
to millions of tracks from our

00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:55.950
store in addition to your
personal music library?

00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:59.200
And what if we combine the power
of Google to understand

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.780
what you want to hear and get
you right to the music without

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:02.940
any hassle?

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:06.090
A music service that's about
music, and the technology

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:08.050
fades to the background.

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:09.570
We built that service.

00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:12.670
And today I'm happy to announce
Google Play Music All

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:16.170
Access, a uniquely Google
approach to a subscription

00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:17.110
music service.

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:25.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:26.450
CHRIS YERGA: Why don't we
show it to them, Jai.

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:27.700
Let's pop it up on the phone.

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:34.240
All Access starts
with explore.

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:38.130
It's the guided way for you to
browse am entire collection of

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:39.175
millions of tracks.

00:41:39.175 --> 00:41:41.940
And from the moment you enter
explore, we provide

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:44.220
personalized recommendations
based on your listening

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:45.110
preferences.

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:47.410
So here's some of my
personalized recommendations.

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:51.340
We also have a section that we
can swipe over to that shows

00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:55.960
featured content, top albums,
and songs as well as playlists

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:59.740
from our staff of music experts
that's always fresh.

00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:03.800
But if you want to guide our
assistance, we can swipe over

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.430
and look into specific genres.

00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:09.500
So we have 22 top level genres
with more to drill into.

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:12.140
And why don't we picked alt
Indie and go in there and show

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:13.410
them what it looks like?

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:16.340
So once we're in here, you see
expert powered recommendations

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:19.370
here, playlists that are curated
by our music editors

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:22.840
as well as top albums from the
genre and key albums that

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:23.850
define the genre.

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:27.440
But like everything in All
Access, anything you see you

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:30.010
can immediately start playing.

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:32.580
So Jai's picked a track
for us here.

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:36.320
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:37.770
CHRIS YERGA: So,
so far so good.

00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:40.670
But here's where the magic
starts because any thing that

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:43.390
I'm listening to in All Access
I can instantly turn into a

00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:45.350
radio station.

00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:47.310
So Jai hits start radio.

00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:48.250
The song keeps playing.

00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:51.450
But in the background, All
Access has made us a never

00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:54.070
ending mix of related tracks.

00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:56.740
Now, if we're curious about
what's coming up, we can swipe

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:58.380
to take a little peek ahead.

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:01.450
But more importantly, we can tap
on the Playlist icon and

00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:04.477
see in detail everything that's
coming up and tailor it

00:43:04.477 --> 00:43:04.980
to our needs.

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:05.870
So if there's something
there we don't want to

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:08.570
hear, swipe it away.

00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:10.270
Swipe it away.

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:15.230
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:16.250
You want to show them
reordering?

00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:18.470
You can also reorder
tracks in the que.

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:21.170
So this is radio
without rules.

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:24.660
It's as lean back as you want
to or as interactive as you

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:27.380
want it to be.

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:28.630
Thank you.

00:43:31.229 --> 00:43:33.040
All right, Sometimes you
know exactly what you

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:34.080
want to listen to.

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:34.670
And we're Google.

00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:36.870
So there's always search
at the top.

00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:39.390
So right now I'm in the mood
for some James Blake.

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:41.260
Why don't you go ahead
and light that up.

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:45.120
And so when-- all right, one
James Blake fan over there.

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:46.450
That's great.

00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:49.000
So why don't we pop into
the artist here?

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.040
And when we do, we see a couple
of things that are

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:54.850
interesting here about how All
Access blends my catalog with

00:43:54.850 --> 00:43:57.230
all the millions of tracks
available to you.

00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:59.520
So you see here that there's
one album that I previously

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:02.240
uploaded to the locker
from James Blake.

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:05.700
But if we scroll down, we see
the rest of his tracks and

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:07.550
albums that are available
to me in all

00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:09.150
access blended together.

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:12.530
And I notice his most recent
album is available there.

00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:13.950
So why don't you go ahead
and tap on that and

00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:16.520
add it to my library.

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:19.810
So by adding it to my personal
library, now it shows up here

00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:20.440
at the top.

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.810
It's easy for me to access
at all times.

00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:26.250
My library contains all my
personal music that I uploaded

00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:28.380
as well as anything that
I've discovered and

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:29.765
added from all access.

00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:35.260
But other times I just want
the music to start.

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:37.830
I want to get to music
with minimal effort.

00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:39.640
That's where listen
now comes in.

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:43.320
Listen now brings the power of
Google to surface music we

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:44.520
know you're going to love.

00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:46.970
There's always a fresh set
of choices in here.

00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:50.440
So in my listen now view, you
see the album I just added as

00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:53.770
well as some other tracks that
I've played recently.

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:57.510
There's also new releases from
artists that I enjoy.

00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:59.720
And you'll also see interspersed
in here are radio

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:03.980
stations that All Access has
created for us automatically.

00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:06.330
With listen now there's always
a great selection of music

00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:10.310
available to me for my library
and All Access.

00:45:10.310 --> 00:45:11.930
And every day it surprises me.

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:14.220
I can't wait for you all to have
your own magic moments

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:15.700
with listen now.

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:18.170
So so far that's been All
Access on the phone.

00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:20.420
But, of course, it works
great on tablet and

00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:21.710
web browsers as well.

00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:23.570
So why don't we pop
up the laptop?

00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:26.850
This is All Access on
the web browser.

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:29.460
As you can see, it has the same
great set of features.

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:32.860
Listen now is here with all my
suggested content, get me one

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:33.940
click to music.

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:38.210
I've got my library, radio,
and, of course, explore.

00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:41.820
And I can enjoy All Access
whether I'm on my laptop, on

00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:44.670
my tablet, or on my phone.

00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:49.120
So to recap, All Access allows
you to explore millions of

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:51.980
tracks effortlessly
on any device.

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:54.080
Radio without rules,
it's completely

00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:56.590
interactive if you so choose.

00:45:56.590 --> 00:45:59.490
Google powered recommendations
and one click access to your

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:01.210
music from listen now.

00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:04.190
And, of course, the best of
both worlds, your personal

00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:06.270
library blended with ours.

00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:08.110
That's All Access.

00:46:08.110 --> 00:46:10.940
Now, there's a lot more
I could show you.

00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:13.230
But really I want you all
to try it yourself.

00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:16.170
So let's talk about how
you can get it.

00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:19.870
All Access is priced at $9.99
a month in the US.

00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:23.730
But we're also giving everyone
a 30 day free trial.

00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:29.500
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:32.190
Best of all, its launching
today in the US.

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:35.170
And we'll be rolling out to
additional countries soon.

00:46:35.170 --> 00:46:39.070
And if you start a trial
by June 30, you'll pay

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:41.674
only $7.99 a month.

00:46:41.674 --> 00:46:46.450
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:47.290
CHRIS YERGA: That's
All Access.

00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:48.530
It's been my pleasure
to show it to you.

00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:50.330
And now I'm going to call
Hugo back to the stage.

00:46:50.330 --> 00:46:51.340
Thank you very much.

00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:52.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:53.990
HUGO BARRA: Thanks, Chris.

00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:59.790
We hope you guys liked
everything you saw here today.

00:46:59.790 --> 00:47:03.940
We talked about 900 million
Android, 48 billion app

00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:07.640
installs, a bunch of new tools
and developer services that

00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:11.260
help you build awesome apps,
find more users around the

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:15.080
world, and, of course, monetize
your hard work.

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:19.800
You also saw the new Google Play
Store as well as a taste

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:22.490
of All Access, the brand new
music experience that's

00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:24.570
powered by Google.

00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:28.520
One thing we haven't talked
today about yet are devices.

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:30.400
Now, this is not a
device give away.

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:33.080
But I do have a pretty
cool announcement to

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:35.336
share with you guys.

00:47:35.336 --> 00:47:39.370
The Android ecosystem is truly
amazing, great hardware and

00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:43.510
software experiences, a range
of form factors, and lots of

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:47.080
choice for users including, by
the way, Google's own devices

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:50.040
with the Nexus family that I'm
sure you know quite well.

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:54.140
We continue to be blown away by
the great new devices that

00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:56.450
are coming out from our
partners, like, for example

00:47:56.450 --> 00:48:00.360
the HTC1 or the Samsung Galaxy
S4, for example.

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:04.130
In fact, just like this
one right here.

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:05.870
Now, there's actually something
a little bit

00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:09.790
different about this particular
GS4, for this

00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:13.830
particular Galaxy S4 from
Samsung, something that is not

00:48:13.830 --> 00:48:17.150
available yet but I want
to show you anyways.

00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:20.324
So why don't you take a look
at my home screen?

00:48:20.324 --> 00:48:28.620
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:29.910
HUGO BARRA: So that's
my home screen.

00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:33.200
I've got my Google Apps here
in my Google folder.

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:37.650
If you scroll to the left,
that's my music widget, my

00:48:37.650 --> 00:48:40.590
calendar on the other screen.

00:48:40.590 --> 00:48:42.840
Go into notifications, a pretty
clean notification

00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:48.112
shade and quick settings also
right at your fingertips.

00:48:48.112 --> 00:48:51.550
I'm pretty sure you guys are
getting this, right?

00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:54.100
What you're seeing
here is real.

00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:58.990
This is a Samsung Galaxy S4
running Android 4.2 Jelly Bean

00:48:58.990 --> 00:49:01.560
with the same software
experience that was shipped on

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:02.930
our Nexus devices.

00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:05.840
It's Google's take on Android.

00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:09.232
And it feels really awesome
on the Galaxy S4.

00:49:09.232 --> 00:49:14.424
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:14.424 --> 00:49:17.640
HUGO BARRA: In fact, this
version of the Samsung Galaxy

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:22.170
S4 will be available directly
through Google Play in the US.

00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:26.570
We're selling an unlocked model
that works on both AT&amp;T

00:49:26.570 --> 00:49:31.460
and T-Mobile with LTE support,
16 gigabytes of memory,

00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:34.380
expandable with a SD
card, of course.

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:37.560
And also it is bootloader
unlocked.

00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:38.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:41.100
HUGO BARRA: I knew
you'd like that.

00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:45.560
And it will receive system
updates promptly with every

00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:47.534
Android platform update.

00:49:47.534 --> 00:49:53.390
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:56.760
HUGO BARRA: This version of the
Samsung Galaxy S4 will be

00:49:56.760 --> 00:50:04.050
on sale starting on June 26
on Google Play for $649.

00:50:04.050 --> 00:50:05.760
So that's what we have.

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:08.430
It is a spectacular device.

00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:10.610
So I want to thank you guys
for your support.

00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:13.150
I look forward to talking with
many of you over the next

00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:15.340
three days and seeing you
all in the sessions.

00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:17.670
And with that, let
me ask Sundar to

00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:18.630
come back to the stage.

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:19.436
Thank you.

00:50:19.436 --> 00:50:24.396
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:24.396 --> 00:51:18.316
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:51:18.316 --> 00:51:25.160
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:26.930
SUNDAR PICHAI: We're going to
switch from Android to talk

00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:30.100
about our other important
platform, another open

00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:32.790
platform, Chrome.

00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:36.710
As I said earlier, Chrome
started with the goal to help

00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:39.870
make the web better, both
as a platform and as an

00:51:39.870 --> 00:51:41.640
experience for users.

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:43.420
It's been an incredible
journey.

00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:46.450
We've had amazing adoption
from our users.

00:51:46.450 --> 00:51:52.930
And last year at Google I/O we
had reached 450 million or 450

00:51:52.930 --> 00:51:54.860
million monthly active users.

00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:56.410
We had reported weekly
users before.

00:51:56.410 --> 00:51:58.310
But we are switching to monthly
to be consistent with

00:51:58.310 --> 00:52:01.490
the rest of this presentation
and industry metrics.

00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:05.920
Since then we've had amazing
momentum, and we've added over

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:10.260
300 million new users just in
the last 12 months alone.

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:13.640
And so today we are at
over 750 million

00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:15.087
active users of Chrome.

00:52:15.087 --> 00:52:20.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:23.040
SUNDAR PICHAI: Chrome
increasingly is

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.500
being used on mobile.

00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:27.540
What excites us is a lot of this
new growth is coming on

00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:28.990
phones and tablets.

00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:32.180
We launched Chrome both
for Android and iOS.

00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:34.240
And we are just beginning
to start pushing

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:35.770
the mobile web forward.

00:52:35.770 --> 00:52:38.170
A lot of what you'll hear today
is about how we can push

00:52:38.170 --> 00:52:39.560
the mobile web forward.

00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:41.000
It is in its early days.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.240
But we think we can do to the
mobile web what we did for the

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:46.060
desktop web.

00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:49.190
Chrome also serves as the
foundation for Chrome OS, a

00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:51.750
computing system designed
for and but

00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:53.820
entirely around the web.

00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:56.790
And we brought a lot of it
together last October by

00:52:56.790 --> 00:52:59.600
launching the Samsung
Chromebook, what we viewed as

00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:02.430
the perfect additional computer
for everyone.

00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:06.350
At $249, it was thin,
light, portable.

00:53:06.350 --> 00:53:08.840
And people are buying it as
the second, third, fourth

00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:10.640
computer in their homes.

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:13.470
It's been over 200 days
since launched.

00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:17.450
And it's been number one on
Amazon in laptops for 190

00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:20.380
consecutive days in
that time window.

00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:25.090
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:25.090 --> 00:53:27.140
SUNDAR PICHAI: It is an
ecosystem play, and we have

00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:29.510
many more partners joining
our journey.

00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:32.680
Acer, Lenovo, HP are all
shipping Chromebooks now.

00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:35.710
And we're expanding our
presence in retail.

00:53:35.710 --> 00:53:37.630
Two months ago we
also announced

00:53:37.630 --> 00:53:39.250
the Chromebook Pixel.

00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:43.010
The goal behind the Pixel was
literally to design the best

00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:45.640
laptop out there possible.

00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:48.440
The screen on this laptop
is gorgeous.

00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:50.740
It's the highest resolution
display that's ever

00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:51.960
shipped on a laptop.

00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:53.940
And it has full touch enable.

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:56.580
Its precision engineered with
the best custom components

00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:57.870
available out there.

00:53:57.870 --> 00:54:00.330
Our goal with the Pixel was
to get it in the hands of

00:54:00.330 --> 00:54:03.095
developers so that they can
build the next generation of

00:54:03.095 --> 00:54:05.130
web experiences.

00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:07.360
We're going to have a lot more
to talk about Chrome OS later

00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:11.230
this year, and we are really
investing a lot in this area.

00:54:11.230 --> 00:54:13.580
But I want to come back to
Chrome for a minute.

00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:18.300
We talked about how in this
multi-screen world people are

00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:19.910
using different types
of devices,

00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:21.690
including phones and tablets.

00:54:21.690 --> 00:54:25.160
With Chrome, our goal has been
to make sure it's your web.

00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:29.400
You sign into Chrome, you get
your experience consistently

00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:32.390
across all your devices,
your web everywhere

00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:34.190
personalized for you.

00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:36.160
And to do that well,
we really need to

00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:38.020
take mobile web forward.

00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:41.690
So we're going to show you an
example of how the mobile web

00:54:41.690 --> 00:54:43.270
is evolving.

00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:46.870
What we are about to show you
is a preview which Warner

00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:49.850
Brothers and the developers
at North Kingdom have put

00:54:49.850 --> 00:54:53.320
together for the upcoming
"Hobbit" movie.

00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:55.950
And Kan is going to
help me with this.

00:54:55.950 --> 00:54:58.150
We're going to get this
up on screen.

00:54:58.150 --> 00:55:00.500
This is running on a
Pixel right now.

00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:04.330
And as you can see, this is
what the web shines for.

00:55:04.330 --> 00:55:05.250
They want a trailer.

00:55:05.250 --> 00:55:07.020
They want a preview
for their movie.

00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:08.720
You're not going to write an
app and get everyone to

00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:11.500
install an app on every
one of their devices.

00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:13.930
You write a web experience and
you expect people to use it

00:55:13.930 --> 00:55:16.080
independent of the
device they have.

00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:17.900
So it's on a Pixel.

00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:22.000
Thanks to HTML 3D CSS, you
can see it works great.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.330
Kan can touch and move around.

00:55:23.330 --> 00:55:24.900
The clouds look great.

00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:26.640
And it works really well.

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:28.840
So far, not that surprising.

00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:30.690
But we're going to
switch now from a

00:55:30.690 --> 00:55:33.570
Chromebook Pixel to a tablet.

00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:36.910
And we're going to show Chrome
running on Nexus 10.

00:55:36.910 --> 00:55:41.700
And you can see there is no
difference in the experience.

00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:44.570
A lot of what we're going to
talk about today is the same

00:55:44.570 --> 00:55:47.290
capabilities which you're used
to on the Chrome on desktop

00:55:47.290 --> 00:55:49.440
are all coming to Chrome
on Android.

00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:54.420
So it feels exactly the same way
you would see on a Pixel

00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:56.320
on a Nexus 10 as well.

00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:58.270
Let's dive in deeper.

00:55:58.270 --> 00:56:01.080
Kan is going to start playing
a game on the Nexus 10.

00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:07.120
And I guess the goal of this
game is for hobbits to avoid

00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:09.300
being eaten by the trolls.

00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:11.530
It's a new game upcoming.

00:56:11.530 --> 00:56:13.400
It is a 3D game.

00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:16.860
And it's based on WebGL.

00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:20.430
Can we get the game
up on screen?

00:56:20.430 --> 00:56:21.690
We can see it there.

00:56:21.690 --> 00:56:26.320
And we are running this, again,
on Chrome on Nexus 10.

00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:28.430
And the reason we are able
to play this game

00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:30.780
is thanks to WebGL.

00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:35.250
This wasn't possible on
the web last year.

00:56:35.250 --> 00:56:37.330
And you will hear the
search team--

00:56:37.330 --> 00:56:39.900
OK, so we have it up
and running now.

00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:42.770
Kan's goal is to avoid the
trolls and not be eaten for

00:56:42.770 --> 00:56:44.840
dinner as a hobbit.

00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:46.860
I guess he lost very,
very quickly there.

00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:49.331
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:49.331 --> 00:56:53.140
SUNDAR PICHAI: Look, Web GL is
something new to Chrome, and

00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:55.240
it makes this experience
possible.

00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:57.780
You will say Google Maps team
talk later in the presentation

00:56:57.780 --> 00:56:59.620
about how they're using WebGL.

00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:00.760
Let's show you one more thing.

00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:03.700
We're going to zoom in the map
in Middle Earth in a place

00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:06.190
called Rivendell.

00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:10.000
All this is happening on mobile,
Chrome on mobile.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.300
Kan is going to start swiping
his way through.

00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:17.680
Thanks to web audio APIs, as
he gestures around on his

00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:20.000
touch screen, the
music changes.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:23.090
And you can see how the
experience is very

00:57:23.090 --> 00:57:23.820
interactive.

00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:26.590
There's touch and web
audio APIs working

00:57:26.590 --> 00:57:30.280
together on the web.

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:33.130
I think you can really start
creating powerful experiences

00:57:33.130 --> 00:57:36.540
on the web and increasingly run
it on phones and tablets.

00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:38.940
And we are making a lot
of progress there.

00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:42.490
So I'm going to invite Linus
Upson onto the stage to talk

00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:45.070
in detail about all the
APIs we are adding

00:57:45.070 --> 00:57:46.170
to the mobile web.

00:57:46.170 --> 00:57:47.350
Linus.

00:57:47.350 --> 00:57:54.224
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:03.310
LINUS UPSON: So just a few weeks
ago the web celebrated

00:58:03.310 --> 00:58:05.290
its 20th birthday.

00:58:05.290 --> 00:58:09.000
And the unique properties that
transformed desktop computing

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.400
from the web, the fact that
everything is a link,

00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:15.110
everything is searchable by
default, makes it possible

00:58:15.110 --> 00:58:18.370
with just a few key strokes
for anyone in the world to

00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:20.990
find billions of different
web pages.

00:58:20.990 --> 00:58:24.580
Applications, video content is
instantly discoverable and

00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:27.220
shareable, no need to
install software, no

00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:29.400
need to update software.

00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:32.130
And on the Chrome team, our
goal is to make the web

00:58:32.130 --> 00:58:36.720
better, both on desktop and on
mobile, better for users and

00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:37.980
better for developers.

00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:39.630
But that doesn't mean
loading the

00:58:39.630 --> 00:58:42.560
browser up full of features.

00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:44.610
The browser's a means,
not an end.

00:58:44.610 --> 00:58:46.630
And so we're always trying to
figure out how to make the

00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:48.650
browser smaller and faster.

00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:51.490
So we focus on three
things, speed

00:58:51.490 --> 00:58:53.550
simplicity, and security.

00:58:53.550 --> 00:58:56.850
And we're bringing that
same focus to mobile.

00:58:56.850 --> 00:58:59.470
Let's take a look at speed
to start with.

00:58:59.470 --> 00:59:04.640
When we first launched Chrome,
it's JavaScript engine V8 was

00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:07.150
20 times faster than anything
else out there.

00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:09.600
And in the four and a half years
since, we've continued

00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:11.500
to make it faster still.

00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:15.310
Just in the last year you can
see we've improved performance

00:59:15.310 --> 00:59:18.910
of V8 by almost 25%
on the desktop.

00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:22.030
But the games on mobile
are even bigger.

00:59:22.030 --> 00:59:25.300
In the last year we've seen
the performance improve by

00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:28.250
more than 50% on mobile.

00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:29.880
These are the kinds
of things--

00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:35.750
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:37.120
LINUS UPSON: These are the kinds
of things that enable

00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:39.590
the next generation of the
mobile web and of mobile web

00:59:39.590 --> 00:59:41.130
applications.

00:59:41.130 --> 00:59:44.270
Of course, the V8 team is always
looking to optimize new

00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:47.300
use cases because people are
always pushing JavaScript in

00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:48.770
new directions.

00:59:48.770 --> 00:59:52.475
Recently Mozilla introduced a
very clever way to compile C

00:59:52.475 --> 00:59:57.460
or C++ code down into a subset
of JavaScript called ASM.js.

00:59:57.460 --> 00:59:59.460
And this has gotten a lot of
attention recently because it

00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:02.880
allows you to then access all of
that code that you have in

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:05.590
C and C++ and be able to
run it on the web.

01:00:05.590 --> 01:00:08.040
And this is JavaScript that's
not written by humans.

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:09.140
It's written by compilers.

01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:11.160
So it looks very different than
the kind of JavaScript

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:13.830
we've optimized for
in the past.

01:00:13.830 --> 01:00:18.330
And in the last month alone,
we've gotten over 2.4 times

01:00:18.330 --> 01:00:22.040
speed boost running this
ASM.js code in V8.

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:25.290
And there's tons more
optimization to come.

01:00:25.290 --> 01:00:29.700
But, of course, JavaScript is
only one component of speed.

01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:33.230
When you download a web page,
more than 60&amp;% of the bytes

01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:36.030
that come across your internet
connection are images.

01:00:36.030 --> 01:00:37.820
And it's growing.

01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:40.400
So we've developed an open
source royalty free

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:41.960
compression technology
called WebP.

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:47.370
So these two images here, you
see the one on the left as

01:00:47.370 --> 01:00:49.190
JPEG, the one on the
right is WebP.

01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:51.540
They're both at the
same quality.

01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:54.130
But let's take a look
at the sizes.

01:00:54.130 --> 01:00:57.360
The WebP image is 30%
smaller than a JPEG

01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:59.620
image at the same quality.

01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:03.430
The benefits of this for image
rich websites is compelling.

01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:04.850
It saves on bandwidth.

01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:06.630
It saves on power, particularly
on mobile

01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:07.490
computing devices.

01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:11.830
And we're seeing it adopted by
properties like Google+, like

01:01:11.830 --> 01:01:14.035
Facebook, particularly
on their mobile apps.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.130
Oh.

01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:25.610
So WebP supports not only
lossless compression, but also

01:01:25.610 --> 01:01:28.920
lossy compression, transparency,
color profiles,

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:35.330
metadata and, unfortunately,
animated images as well.

01:01:35.330 --> 01:01:38.165
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:38.165 --> 01:01:42.770
LINUS UPSON: So you can use WebP
to replace JPEGs, PNGs,

01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:45.370
as well as animated GIFs.

01:01:45.370 --> 01:01:46.620
I'm sorry.

01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:53.240
Of course, videos are a
big part of the web.

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:56.370
By the end of 2012, over
half of mobile

01:01:56.370 --> 01:01:58.620
internet traffic was video.

01:01:58.620 --> 01:02:01.350
We need to make videos
smaller.

01:02:01.350 --> 01:02:05.910
With WebM, we've created an open
royalty free container

01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:08.350
media file format for the web.

01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:11.260
So let's take a look
at two videos.

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:15.940
One of these is encoded in 264,
which is probably what

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:17.610
you're seeing today
on the web.

01:02:17.610 --> 01:02:21.690
The other is encoded in WebM's
next generation codec, VP9.

01:02:21.690 --> 01:02:23.680
The bar charts show you
the real time bit

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:26.930
rate of the two videos.

01:02:26.930 --> 01:02:30.340
When we get to the end, we'll
see what the sizes of each are

01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:32.230
and how much smaller VP9 is.

01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:33.700
For this particular video--

01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:39.849
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:39.849 --> 01:02:40.980
LINUS UPSON: For
this particular

01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:44.400
video, VP9 was 63% smaller.

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:47.230
Running across a wide range of
videos and a wide range of

01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:50.810
resolutions, we see about a
50% reduction in size with

01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:53.790
VP9, which is a huge
bandwidth savings.

01:02:53.790 --> 01:02:56.380
So if you're paying money for
your mobile data plan, this is

01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:58.020
enormous for you.

01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:01.530
And it's great to see that
YouTube is going to be rolling

01:03:01.530 --> 01:03:05.250
out support for VP9
later this year.

01:03:05.250 --> 01:03:08.140
Now, of course, we want all
websites to take advantage of

01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:09.730
these new technologies.

01:03:09.730 --> 01:03:12.980
But until they're everywhere,
what we've done is we've built

01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:16.660
a data compression proxy
for Chrome for mobile.

01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:19.240
And you can see here it's
easy to turn on.

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:20.305
You can go to bandwidth
management

01:03:20.305 --> 01:03:22.650
to reduce data usage.

01:03:22.650 --> 01:03:25.990
And it shows you how much data
you're actually saving.

01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:28.790
So let's take a look at the real
data for one user here.

01:03:28.790 --> 01:03:32.370
They save 46% of their data over
the course of a month.

01:03:32.370 --> 01:03:34.630
And when we've been running
this in the Android beta

01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:37.180
channel-- and many of you can
try it out right now--

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:40.460
we see an average of about
50% data compression.

01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:44.280
We rewrite the HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript to make it smaller.

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:46.640
We transform images into WebP.

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:49.980
And we speak the SPDY network
protocol to get you fewer bits

01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:53.480
faster but get you all the bits
from the web page that

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:54.730
you're looking for.

01:03:56.630 --> 01:04:01.130
So beyond just making web pages
faster, we want to make

01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:04.030
things faster and simpler
for users.

01:04:04.030 --> 01:04:07.230
One of the hardest things you
can do on your phone today is

01:04:07.230 --> 01:04:08.960
buy something.

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:12.200
The average checkout
process is about 21

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:13.820
steps on your phone.

01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:17.590
So it's no surprise that the
abandonment rate of shopping

01:04:17.590 --> 01:04:21.710
carts on mobile phones
is around 97%.

01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:24.030
We can do much better
than this.

01:04:24.030 --> 01:04:28.580
So by building on the existing
HTML5 auto complete spec,

01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:30.840
we've built something in Chrome,
both on desktop and in

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:33.600
mobile, that collects all of
your payment information when

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:37.880
you enter it anywhere, syncs it
across all of your devices.

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:42.600
So now when you come to check
out on a website, you press

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.560
check out, you see this form.

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:46.660
Chrome already knows all of
your payment information.

01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:47.880
It shows it to you in a form.

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:50.820
You can look at it and you say,
yep, that's what I want.

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:53.140
And you click Submit
and you're done.

01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:55.990
So this is going to make
shopping from your phone much,

01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:57.138
much easier.

01:04:57.138 --> 01:05:03.840
[APPLAUSE]

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:05.870
LINUS UPSON: And there's a
session, if you want to learn

01:05:05.870 --> 01:05:09.330
more about this, later today.

01:05:09.330 --> 01:05:10.580
It's called--

01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:14.710
I bet it has payments
in the name.

01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:15.590
I forgot what it is.

01:05:15.590 --> 01:05:17.400
But it's on the calendar
for today.

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:20.420
Standardizing payments
on the web.

01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:25.860
OK, so not just programs, not
just users, but we also want

01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:28.940
to make developers more
productive and make life

01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:30.920
simpler for them as well.

01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:33.820
So for the last couple of years
we've been working on

01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:36.610
some new fundamental technology
in the web platform

01:05:36.610 --> 01:05:38.520
called web components.

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:41.670
For the first time you're going
to be able to build your

01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:43.680
own HTML tags.

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:46.440
You can build your own HTML tags
by taking smaller bits of

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:49.590
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and
putting them into a first

01:05:49.590 --> 01:05:50.870
class component.

01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:53.950
And that component can be
reshared between applications,

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:57.300
between phones, between tablets,
between desktops so

01:05:57.300 --> 01:05:59.510
that you can be much more
productive and have

01:05:59.510 --> 01:06:02.690
applications that are much more
delightful for users.

01:06:02.690 --> 01:06:06.000
We're also working on the first
tool kit to natively

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.670
take advantage of
web components.

01:06:08.670 --> 01:06:11.580
And in this tool kit it really
captures the modern, elegant

01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:14.180
design philosophy you've been
seeing in a lot of the recent

01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:17.910
Google applications,
particularly the mobile ones.

01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:19.890
This tool kit project actually
has been open

01:06:19.890 --> 01:06:21.290
source since the beginning.

01:06:21.290 --> 01:06:24.500
And some of you have stumbled
upon it and found it.

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:26.560
But it's still very early.

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:28.010
But the vision for
it is clear.

01:06:28.010 --> 01:06:30.620
We want this elegant UI
framework that works across

01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:33.690
all form factors, all devices.

01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:36.470
And we put together a short
video to give you an idea

01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:38.620
about where we're going
with the toolkit.

01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:39.930
Let's play the video.

01:06:39.930 --> 01:06:41.930
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:07:27.930 --> 01:07:29.820
LINUS UPSON: So you can see our
goal here really is to be

01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:33.080
able to allow developers like
you create your own tags,

01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:35.240
reuse them in a way that makes
sense on a phone, be able to

01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:37.750
take that same component, reuse
it on a tablet, combine

01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:40.510
them in different ways for
desktop applications.

01:07:40.510 --> 01:07:42.830
And it's something that's
tremendously exciting.

01:07:42.830 --> 01:07:44.320
It's still early, as I said.

01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:47.270
It's not ready for consumption
by regular developers.

01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:49.030
But if you're interested in
learning more about where

01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:51.590
we're going and help us to find
the vision of the future,

01:07:51.590 --> 01:07:54.010
please come to the web
components in action session

01:07:54.010 --> 01:07:55.260
on Thursday.

01:07:57.220 --> 01:08:01.060
Now, we've been talking today a
lot about Chrome across all

01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:02.480
of your different screens.

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:05.624
So why not build a fun
experience to show that off?

01:08:05.624 --> 01:08:12.740
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:15.340
LINUS UPSON: So Racer is a
multiplayer, multi-screen

01:08:15.340 --> 01:08:15.980
experiment.

01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:17.740
And all you need to
play is Chrome.

01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:21.529
Regardless of device Android or
iOS, phone or tablet, you

01:08:21.529 --> 01:08:23.660
just need to click a link
and get started.

01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:26.930
So we've got some volunteers to
come help us show it off.

01:08:31.850 --> 01:08:34.050
So while they're coming up,
why don't we take a closer

01:08:34.050 --> 01:08:35.300
look at the devices here?

01:08:49.290 --> 01:08:50.450
We have a ring around
the team.

01:08:50.450 --> 01:08:53.600
This is Arno Weber who manages
the Chrome Mobile team.

01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:55.859
He's an actual race
car driver.

01:08:55.859 --> 01:08:59.000
We'll see how he does in
the electronic form.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.880
So this game is a simple
little racing game.

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:04.740
I don't know if you remember
the little slot car racing

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:05.800
games when you were a kid?

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.899
You pull the trigger, zoom
around the track.

01:09:07.899 --> 01:09:10.470
But if you go too fast,
the car spins out.

01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:11.990
That's essentially what these
guys are going to

01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:13.240
be trying to do.

01:09:15.490 --> 01:09:17.450
So are we ready to switch
to the overhead?

01:09:17.450 --> 01:09:19.819
Thanks.

01:09:19.819 --> 01:09:21.792
So, Ken, take it away.

01:09:21.792 --> 01:09:22.284
KEN LIU: Great.

01:09:22.284 --> 01:09:23.268
Thanks, Linus.

01:09:23.268 --> 01:09:26.200
OK, so this game is
really simple.

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:28.520
Once I start the game, all you
have to do is press down to

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:31.920
accelerate and let
go to decelerate.

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:33.870
Basically, when you go around
the corners, you don't want to

01:09:33.870 --> 01:09:34.750
be going too fast.

01:09:34.750 --> 01:09:36.919
So I'm going to start a race
here and I'm going to join it

01:09:36.919 --> 01:09:38.169
from these devices.

01:09:41.914 --> 01:09:45.810
OK, let me click Start.

01:09:45.810 --> 01:09:47.210
You know, you guys look
like professionals.

01:09:47.210 --> 01:09:50.790
So I'm going to click
Ridiculous.

01:09:50.790 --> 01:09:52.630
We're going to go ridiculous
on this one guys.

01:09:52.630 --> 01:09:56.140
LINUS UPSON: I predict lots of
cars will fly off the track.

01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:57.480
KEN LIU: All right,
so pick your cars.

01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:58.350
Are you going to use this one?

01:09:58.350 --> 01:09:58.590
OK.

01:09:58.590 --> 01:10:00.280
Then I'm going to use
the iOS device.

01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:02.800
And tap when you're ready.

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:04.050
Let's get this game started.

01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:10.588
You might not want
to hold on yet.

01:10:10.588 --> 01:10:13.640
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:14.240
KEN LIU: Getting a little
ahead of ourselves.

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:15.490
LINUS UPSON: Ready, set, go.

01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:22.698
Oh, the first car goes
spinning off.

01:10:22.698 --> 01:10:28.530
[SOUND EFFECTS]

01:10:28.530 --> 01:10:29.988
LINUS UPSON: Now, this
game is running on

01:10:29.988 --> 01:10:30.474
Google Compute Engine.

01:10:30.474 --> 01:10:32.850
And it's able to keep all the
different devices in sync

01:10:32.850 --> 01:10:34.850
using WebSockets.

01:10:34.850 --> 01:10:36.820
KEN LIU: No, stop
running into me.

01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:39.100
LINUS UPSON: And it uses Web
Audio as the sound transitions

01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:42.280
between all of the different
devices.

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:44.224
Oh, someone's made it
around a full lap.

01:10:44.224 --> 01:10:46.609
[SOUND EFFECTS]

01:10:46.609 --> 01:10:47.563
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, shoot.

01:10:47.563 --> 01:10:51.856
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:51.856 --> 01:10:52.520
KEN LIU: I'm going to win.

01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:53.730
Come on.

01:10:53.730 --> 01:10:55.690
I didn't practice all these
days for nothing.

01:10:55.690 --> 01:10:57.405
LINUS UPSON: This is just as
hard as I remember those

01:10:57.405 --> 01:10:59.610
little racing games as a kid.

01:10:59.610 --> 01:11:00.860
KEN LIU: Yes.

01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:04.300
That was a close one.

01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:09.732
[APPLAUSE]

01:11:09.732 --> 01:11:11.690
KEN LIU: Are you
guys giving up?

01:11:11.690 --> 01:11:12.780
Still two people are
not finished.

01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:14.050
LINUS UPSON: There's still
two people out there?

01:11:14.050 --> 01:11:14.690
KEN LIU: That's all right.

01:11:14.690 --> 01:11:15.120
It's all right.

01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:15.410
I think we got enough.

01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:16.220
We got the point.

01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:18.064
LINUS UPSON: Who
came in first?

01:11:18.064 --> 01:11:19.760
Ken.

01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:20.540
Congratulations.

01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:21.790
He's been practicing
this all week.

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:28.587
Anyway, thank you all for
helping with that.

01:11:28.587 --> 01:11:34.191
[APPLAUSE]

01:11:34.191 --> 01:11:36.990
LINUS UPSON: Anyway, we hope
you're all excited, as we are,

01:11:36.990 --> 01:11:39.400
about where the mobile
web is headed.

01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:42.670
And to celebrate the first 20
years of the wen, we've put

01:11:42.670 --> 01:11:45.517
together this short film showing
how far we've come.

01:11:45.517 --> 01:13:17.620
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:13:17.620 --> 01:13:18.670
SUNDAR PICHAI: It's inspiring
to see the 20 year

01:13:18.670 --> 01:13:19.515
story of the web.

01:13:19.515 --> 01:13:21.780
It's truly one of the most
amazing software platforms

01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:23.750
we've seen in our lives.

01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:27.550
Before we move on, let's get a
picture of the Pixel back up

01:13:27.550 --> 01:13:28.960
on the screen.

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:30.650
I'm also going to
go pick one up.

01:13:30.650 --> 01:13:33.750
As I said earlier, the goal
behind the Pixel was to

01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:37.480
literally build the best laptop
possible out there.

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:39.520
You guys have any idea why we
have it up on the screen and

01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:41.365
I'm holding one up in my hand?

01:13:41.365 --> 01:13:51.550
[APPLAUSE]

01:13:51.550 --> 01:13:54.140
SUNDAR PICHAI: We're going to
give each and every one of you

01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:55.630
a brand new Pixel.

01:13:55.630 --> 01:13:58.100
I've been asked to say it's
not ready until 2:00 PM.

01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:01.790
So please don't leave in the
middle of the Keynote.

01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:02.930
But we're very excited.

01:14:02.930 --> 01:14:06.630
Our goal behind the Pixel was
to make sure that developers

01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:09.120
had a chance to get the web
ready for the next generation

01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:11.730
experience with full touch
and high resolution.

01:14:11.730 --> 01:14:14.025
So I can't wait to see what
you all to do with it.

01:14:14.025 --> 01:14:15.390
We're incredibly excited.

01:14:15.390 --> 01:14:17.830
A lot of us use it as our
day to day computer.

01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:26.000
[APPLAUSE]

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.260
SUNDAR PICHAI: So we've talked
about Android and Chrome.

01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:30.470
And our goal behind these
platforms is to make sure

01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:32.520
developers can build amazing
experiences on

01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:34.450
top of these platforms.

01:14:34.450 --> 01:14:37.110
We want to now give you a real
life example of how this all

01:14:37.110 --> 01:14:38.400
comes together.

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:39.890
And we're going to do
that by talking

01:14:39.890 --> 01:14:42.050
about education briefly.

01:14:42.050 --> 01:14:44.890
A lot of us at Google are
deeply passionate about

01:14:44.890 --> 01:14:49.280
education because it's an area
where we can really see the

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:52.640
impact technology can have on
people's lives, especially the

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:54.200
lives of children.

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:56.830
And so we are investing
a lot in education.

01:14:56.830 --> 01:15:01.160
And for us, the journey started
with Google Apps.

01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:03.710
Google Apps are incredibly
popular in

01:15:03.710 --> 01:15:05.530
schools around the world.

01:15:05.530 --> 01:15:09.180
There are over 25 million users
of Google Apps in over

01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:13.170
200 countries all around the
world, in schools, in

01:15:13.170 --> 01:15:15.510
universities, and so on.

01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:20.150
Just in the United States, 74
of the top 100 universities

01:15:20.150 --> 01:15:22.380
fully run on Google Apps.

01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:26.230
Seven of the eight Ivy
League universities--

01:15:26.230 --> 01:15:28.730
for those of you who are from
Dartmouth, you may want to

01:15:28.730 --> 01:15:30.970
start nudging your IT
administrator there.

01:15:30.970 --> 01:15:32.720
But seven of the eight
Ivy League

01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:34.790
schools use Google Apps.

01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:37.920
Large public school systems
like Chicago, et cetera,

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:39.950
completely run on Google Apps.

01:15:39.950 --> 01:15:42.320
And the momentum
is incredible.

01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:44.540
But we want to take
it a step further.

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:48.100
What we want to do is to bring
both Android and Chrome into

01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:50.960
educational institutions around
the world so that both

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:54.250
Google and all of you can build
applications to really

01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:57.270
change how computing and
technology is used in schools.

01:15:57.270 --> 01:16:00.550
We are beginning to invest a lot
for Android in education.

01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:01.980
And we want to give
you an update.

01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:03.250
To do that, I'm going
to invite Chris

01:16:03.250 --> 01:16:05.060
Yerga back on stage.

01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:12.560
[APPLAUSE]

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:14.025
CHRIS YERGA: Thanks, Sundar.

01:16:14.025 --> 01:16:17.480
So as we've heard, Android is
growing incredibly fast.

01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:20.020
And its momentum is changing
everything.

01:16:20.020 --> 01:16:22.950
But there's still a big part
of all of our lives and the

01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:25.510
lives of our kids that
mobile technology

01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:27.190
hasn't really touched.

01:16:27.190 --> 01:16:29.700
When I go visit my kids'
classrooms, it looks pretty

01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:32.800
much exactly like it did
when I went to school.

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:35.520
So a bunch of us in Android
asked educators why is there

01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:39.480
so much talk about technology
in schools

01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:40.960
but so little impact?

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:42.520
And what we heard was
really interesting.

01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:45.780
Teachers told us that in
education there's a huge gap

01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:48.410
between what's possible with
technology and what's

01:16:48.410 --> 01:16:51.740
practical, especially with
mobile technology.

01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:55.410
And then they told us it was
Google's job to fix this.

01:16:55.410 --> 01:16:57.560
[LAUGHTER]

01:16:57.560 --> 01:16:59.500
CHRIS YERGA: Google should make
it affordable to give

01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:00.590
every student a tablet.

01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:03.380
And Google should make it so
that it's not so crazy to

01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:04.740
manage all those devices.

01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:08.290
And Google, finally, should make
it way easier to find the

01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:11.420
best tools and content from
a really diverse set of

01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:15.140
developers and get that content
to the right students.

01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:16.000
We agreed.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.950
So today I'm really excited to
announce a new initiative,

01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:21.500
which will make it easy and
affordable for schools to put

01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:24.710
Android tablets in the hands of
all their kids and to load

01:17:24.710 --> 01:17:27.790
them up with powerful
educational content and tools.

01:17:27.790 --> 01:17:30.070
And I want to give you a sneak
peak of one of the key parts

01:17:30.070 --> 01:17:33.280
of this effort, Google Play for
Education, built from the

01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:37.090
ground up to meet the unique
content needs of educators.

01:17:37.090 --> 01:17:38.367
Let's take a look.

01:17:38.367 --> 01:17:45.680
[APPLAUSE]

01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:47.330
CHRIS YERGA: So the first thing
you'll notice is that

01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:49.890
Google Play for Education is
organized by categories

01:17:49.890 --> 01:17:52.040
educators care about,
namely subject

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:53.790
matter and grade level.

01:17:53.790 --> 01:17:57.160
For example, say I'm the K-6
math subject matter expert in

01:17:57.160 --> 01:17:58.150
my school district.

01:17:58.150 --> 01:17:59.820
And I want to find an
educational app that my

01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:02.130
incoming kindergartners can use
to sharpen their problem

01:18:02.130 --> 01:18:03.260
solving skills.

01:18:03.260 --> 01:18:06.230
So I click on Math,
Kindergarten.

01:18:06.230 --> 01:18:09.360
And immediately I see a bunch of
apps from a diverse set of

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:11.640
partners, including
NASA and PBS.

01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:14.890
Also, each app has been
recommended by a group of

01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:17.750
educators as useful for teaching
kindergarten math.

01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:21.440
This is key because teachers
trust other teachers.

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:26.260
So Kids Numbers and Math from
Intellijoy looks really good.

01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:27.390
I'll start with the
free version.

01:18:27.390 --> 01:18:29.800
Remember, I'm not shopping
for myself here.

01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:32.430
Because this school is using
Google Apps for Education and

01:18:32.430 --> 01:18:35.360
every student has a Google
account, I can just enter the

01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:38.040
name of the Google group of
these students and, bam, all

01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:40.850
500 kindergartners in my
district will instantly get

01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:42.100
this app on their tablets.

01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:49.270
[APPLAUSE]

01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:51.080
CHRIS YERGA: Now say a few weeks
have gone by and I'm

01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:53.460
really impressed with the math
skills that kids are learning

01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:54.530
from Kids Numbers and Math.

01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:56.590
So I want to upgrade to
the paid version so

01:18:56.590 --> 01:18:58.080
the kids can go deeper.

01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:00.640
Rather than enter a credit card,
which is not how schools

01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:04.530
work, I can just charge these
500 licenses against a balance

01:19:04.530 --> 01:19:07.220
funded by a school
purchase order.

01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:08.880
And one more thing, notice
that the store

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:10.440
doesn't just have apps.

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:13.220
You can discover books and
YouTube educational videos and

01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:16.983
push them to Android tablets
in exactly the same way.

01:19:16.983 --> 01:19:24.880
[APPLAUSE]

01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:27.340
CHRIS YERGA: Pilot sites like
Kipp Bridge Charter School and

01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:30.050
Hillsborough Township Public
Schools are already going

01:19:30.050 --> 01:19:31.290
crazy for this.

01:19:31.290 --> 01:19:35.910
Six elementary schools in New
Jersey used 550 different

01:19:35.910 --> 01:19:38.950
third party apps during a single
day in our pilot, all

01:19:38.950 --> 01:19:41.430
of them discovered and
downloaded by teachers in

01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:43.240
Google Play for Education.

01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:46.200
Multiply that pilot by millions
of classrooms in the

01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:48.960
US and you can see there's a
huge opportunity here for

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:53.240
educators, students, and
for you as developers.

01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:54.500
So this is where you come in.

01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:56.300
We're doing the heavy lifting
of building Play for

01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:59.160
Education, bringing it to the
schools, making it easy for

01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:02.200
them to find great content
and buy it in bulk.

01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:05.380
Now you can focus on what you do
best, creating awesome and

01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:08.040
innovative educational
content.

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:09.420
We're going to be launching
Google Play for

01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:11.030
Education in the fall.

01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:13.190
But starting this summer, we'll
be ready to accept your

01:20:13.190 --> 01:20:14.040
app submissions.

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:15.970
Check out our developer
micro site at

01:20:15.970 --> 01:20:20.210
developer.android.com/edu where
we've posted guidelines

01:20:20.210 --> 01:20:22.520
on how to build awesome
K-12 apps.

01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:26.170
Also, come find us at the
education sandbox here at I/O.

01:20:26.170 --> 01:20:27.299
Thanks, everyone.

01:20:27.299 --> 01:20:37.090
[APPLAUSE]

01:20:37.090 --> 01:20:40.290
SUNDAR PICHAI: It's great to see
Android making it's foray

01:20:40.290 --> 01:20:40.960
into education.

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:42.420
We're going to invest a lot.

01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:44.900
We've already been doing
this with Chromebooks.

01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:48.070
Chromebooks are really ideally
suited for education because

01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:51.200
this literally no set up,
no administration.

01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:53.520
You open the device, you're good
to go, and you have the

01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:55.710
power of web within you.

01:20:55.710 --> 01:20:59.660
Just last year alone, we had
over 1,000 schools in the

01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:02.450
United States running
Chromebooks.

01:21:02.450 --> 01:21:05.850
In the four months this year,
we've added 2,000 new schools

01:21:05.850 --> 01:21:08.330
and Chromebooks are going
mainstream in education in

01:21:08.330 --> 01:21:11.500
schools in the United States
just like Google Apps.

01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:13.300
And the area where this
all came together

01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:14.980
beautifully is Malaysia.

01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:16.910
So I want to talk about
that for a minute.

01:21:16.910 --> 01:21:20.130
Malaysia has a nationalized
education system.

01:21:20.130 --> 01:21:23.590
They have 10,000 schools in
the country distributed,

01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:27.070
several of them in poor,
rural areas.

01:21:27.070 --> 01:21:29.640
So they really wanted to provide
for 4G connectivity

01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:31.770
throughout to all 10,000
schools to

01:21:31.770 --> 01:21:33.360
level the playing field.

01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:36.900
And they're deploying Google
Apps along with Chromebooks in

01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:39.220
primary and secondary schools
so that they can bring

01:21:39.220 --> 01:21:40.740
computing in their schools.

01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:44.710
So let's take a look at
what they're doing.

01:21:44.710 --> 01:21:46.210
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:21:46.210 --> 01:21:49.170
-Malaysia has so
much to offer.

01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:52.060
There's so much untapped
potential.

01:21:52.060 --> 01:21:54.960
Just to walk into one of these
small villages and look at the

01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:58.710
eyes of those children in that
school, you see that spark,

01:21:58.710 --> 01:22:01.762
little fire in their eyes.

01:22:01.762 --> 01:22:05.850
There's this whole world out
there that would allow you to

01:22:05.850 --> 01:22:08.930
experience learning
beyond what you

01:22:08.930 --> 01:22:11.780
ever thought possible.

01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:14.620
-And a lot of our students don't
have internet access.

01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:17.940
A lot of them were
just left behind.

01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:21.890
-In Malaysia we place a huge
investment in the education of

01:22:21.890 --> 01:22:23.430
our young children.

01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:27.440
-We're providing 4G connectivity
to all schools

01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:28.920
across the country.

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:32.090
And the fact that we can
spread it across 10,000

01:22:32.090 --> 01:22:35.480
schools is amazing.

01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:38.188
-Learning had to be
anytime, anyplace.

01:22:38.188 --> 01:22:41.670
You didn't have to be in a state
of the art classroom.

01:22:41.670 --> 01:22:44.130
But you could be with a
chromebook sitting in a field

01:22:44.130 --> 01:22:47.190
and experiencing world
class learning.

01:22:47.190 --> 01:22:48.990
-It is so exciting
to be a part of

01:22:48.990 --> 01:22:51.240
education in Malaysia today.

01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:55.050
This power that you place in a
child's hand and you say, the

01:22:55.050 --> 01:22:56.800
web is your school.

01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:58.050
Go and learn.

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:07.588
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:23:07.588 --> 01:23:15.560
[APPLAUSE]

01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:17.140
SUNDAR PICHAI: Look, to me and
to a lot of us, this is what

01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:19.220
the journey of computing
is about.

01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:22.010
What we are doing in eduction
on top of platforms like

01:23:22.010 --> 01:23:25.770
Android and Chrome, we can do
it for users everywhere,

01:23:25.770 --> 01:23:29.390
including the other five billion
people on the planet.

01:23:29.390 --> 01:23:32.470
Android and Chrome are designed
for not just Google,

01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:35.200
but for you all to create
amazing experiences.

01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:38.010
We're going to switch now and
talk about what we are doing

01:23:38.010 --> 01:23:41.740
on Google, what we call as the
best of Google on top of

01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:42.950
Android and Chrome.

01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:44.990
You're going to hear from three
teams, from the Google+

01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:48.410
team, from the Search team,
and from the Maps team.

01:23:48.410 --> 01:23:52.274
And we'll get things started
with Vic Gundotra and Google+.

01:23:52.274 --> 01:23:52.771
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:23:52.771 --> 01:23:55.753
-Among the most basic of human
needs is the need to connect

01:23:55.753 --> 01:23:57.741
with others.

01:23:57.741 --> 01:24:00.580
With a smile or laugh, we
connect with people every

01:24:00.580 --> 01:24:03.640
single day.

01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:06.560
But the meaning of our real
world connections often gets

01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:08.580
lost online.

01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:12.020
And so began the Google+
project to help make

01:24:12.020 --> 01:24:16.540
connecting online more like
we do in real life.

01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:19.180
So you can share the things you
love with the people you

01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:23.310
love and get closer to the
people you care about, make

01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:28.376
discoveries, explore the stuff
you're into, and get together.

01:24:36.859 --> 01:24:38.356
-So everybody say hi.

01:24:38.356 --> 01:24:39.853
That's the whole world.

01:24:39.853 --> 01:24:41.103
-Hi.

01:24:44.344 --> 01:24:45.342
-Can I hug you?

01:24:45.342 --> 01:24:46.592
-Yeah.

01:24:48.835 --> 01:24:50.332
-We're the first ones that
are doing it like this.

01:24:50.332 --> 01:24:51.330
It's history.

01:24:51.330 --> 01:24:53.825
-Look, you guys have the
greatest technology at your

01:24:53.825 --> 01:24:56.320
fingertips.

01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:58.815
-We have a boy.

01:24:58.815 --> 01:25:00.065
-Thanks, everybody.

01:25:07.797 --> 01:25:08.795
-This a celebration.

01:25:08.795 --> 01:25:10.791
Y'all is invited.

01:25:10.791 --> 01:25:14.783
[END VIDEO PLAY BACK]

01:25:14.783 --> 01:25:19.790
[APPLAUSE]

01:25:19.790 --> 01:25:21.670
VIC GUNDOTRA: We are incredibly
grateful to the

01:25:21.670 --> 01:25:25.720
hundred and millions of you out
there who joined Google+

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:29.020
in just under two short years.

01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:31.860
And we can think of no better
way to say thank you than to

01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:35.310
continue to innovate and to
build a product that people

01:25:35.310 --> 01:25:36.820
truly love.

01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:39.300
And so I'm here to show you
what's next with Google+.

01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:44.900
Today we're introducing 41 new
features across three major

01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:46.170
areas of Google+.

01:25:46.170 --> 01:25:52.460
First, a newly designed
stream, a new Hangout

01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:55.710
application, and a fundamentally
new photos

01:25:55.710 --> 01:25:57.010
experience.

01:25:57.010 --> 01:25:58.190
We have a lot to talk about.

01:25:58.190 --> 01:25:59.050
Let's get started.

01:25:59.050 --> 01:26:01.250
Let's begin with the Stream.

01:26:01.250 --> 01:26:03.760
Now, it's no surprise that
mobile devices are

01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:06.740
increasingly prevalent and
important in our lives.

01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:10.190
It's the computer that's
with us all the time.

01:26:10.190 --> 01:26:13.890
And so the Google+ has spent a
lot of time making sure that

01:26:13.890 --> 01:26:19.050
that core stream experience on
mobile absolutely rocks.

01:26:19.050 --> 01:26:21.740
And the feedback has
been fantastic.

01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:25.140
And so today we're taking that
multicolumn design and

01:26:25.140 --> 01:26:27.720
bringing it to lots
more devices.

01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:31.420
Yes, from your phone to your
tablet and even your desktop,

01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:35.170
you're going to see a newly
designed stream.

01:26:35.170 --> 01:26:37.760
We're also fixing a longstanding
problem with

01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:41.700
today's social streams and
that's they're flat.

01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:44.820
It's very easy to see a long
list of things that have been

01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:48.720
shared with you, kind of like
a never ending newspaper.

01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:52.760
But it's nearly impossible to
go deeper on a topic or

01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:54.600
interest that you might have.

01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:56.410
And we think we can fix that.

01:26:56.410 --> 01:26:59.590
So this new design, this
new stream, is

01:26:59.590 --> 01:27:01.810
about design and depth.

01:27:01.810 --> 01:27:05.360
Maybe the best thing to
do is just show you.

01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:09.560
What you're looking
at is Google+ as

01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:11.680
it exists this morning.

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:15.910
What you're going to see start
rolling out later today is the

01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:18.770
new Google+, which
looks like this.

01:27:18.770 --> 01:27:25.350
[APPLAUSE]

01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:27.190
VIC GUNDOTRA: You can see, we've
taken that multicolumn

01:27:27.190 --> 01:27:29.890
design and brought it to the
desktop and really made

01:27:29.890 --> 01:27:31.670
something beautiful.

01:27:31.670 --> 01:27:34.200
It's dynamic, meaning depending
upon the size of

01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:36.730
your screen, it can either be
one column, two column, or

01:27:36.730 --> 01:27:37.820
three columns.

01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:39.910
And we've made sure to
give you choice.

01:27:39.910 --> 01:27:42.480
So if you go into the More menu,
you're always able to go

01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:45.870
to a single column if that's
what you prefer.

01:27:45.870 --> 01:27:49.830
Of course, in this multicolumn
design, we've made sure that

01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:53.890
posts like photos and videos
can span multiple columns.

01:27:53.890 --> 01:27:56.680
So you get something that's
truly immersive.

01:27:56.680 --> 01:28:00.330
And we made sure that it's
fast, fluid, and fun.

01:28:00.330 --> 01:28:02.250
And so we put delightful
animations

01:28:02.250 --> 01:28:03.490
throughout the product.

01:28:03.490 --> 01:28:07.400
For example, a share box that
animates out, menus that slide

01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:11.280
in and out to get out of the
way, and even cards and that

01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:13.410
flip and fade beautifully.

01:28:13.410 --> 01:28:14.902
Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

01:28:14.902 --> 01:28:20.250
[APPLAUSE]

01:28:20.250 --> 01:28:22.390
VIC GUNDOTRA: But it's not
just about the design.

01:28:22.390 --> 01:28:24.250
It's about depth.

01:28:24.250 --> 01:28:27.140
As I mentioned earlier, it's
very difficult to go deeper on

01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:29.810
a topic or interest
you care about.

01:28:29.810 --> 01:28:31.770
We think we've solved
this problem.

01:28:31.770 --> 01:28:35.660
And today we're introducing
related hashtags.

01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:38.930
What we'll do is we'll analyze
the content of a post.

01:28:38.930 --> 01:28:42.270
And Google will put on the
appropriate hashtag.

01:28:42.270 --> 01:28:43.700
How does that work?

01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:44.850
Well, let's take a look.

01:28:44.850 --> 01:28:46.720
Here's a post about
the San Francisco

01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:48.310
Giants baseball team.

01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:49.920
It's not just about
the Giants.

01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:53.460
It's about Buster Posey, a
particular player, as well.

01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:57.230
And note in the top, we've
automatically tagged that post

01:28:57.230 --> 01:28:59.860
and we know it's about
those two topics.

01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:02.500
But that's only half
of the magic.

01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:06.950
We also then rank and
search the entire

01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:09.540
universe of Google+ content.

01:29:09.540 --> 01:29:12.090
And we rank it just for you.

01:29:12.090 --> 01:29:14.090
So when Matt clicks
on one of those

01:29:14.090 --> 01:29:15.750
hashtags, watch what happens.

01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:20.040
We flip the card over and we
then show you related items

01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:22.510
from the most important
sources and social

01:29:22.510 --> 01:29:23.310
proximity to you.

01:29:23.310 --> 01:29:24.702
Amazing, isn't it?

01:29:24.702 --> 01:29:25.952
[APPLAUSE].

01:29:29.166 --> 01:29:32.440
VIC GUNDOTRA: Now, if you think
that's impressive, let's

01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:34.730
take a look at another one
of these problems.

01:29:34.730 --> 01:29:37.470
In this case, one of the noted
photographers on our service

01:29:37.470 --> 01:29:39.740
has posted a picture
of Paris, and

01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:41.400
particularly the Eiffel Tower.

01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:44.610
Nowhere in his post or
in the comments is

01:29:44.610 --> 01:29:46.180
the word Eiffel Tower.

01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:49.920
But if you notice, Google has
automatically hashtaged this

01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:51.010
with the Eiffel Tower.

01:29:51.010 --> 01:29:53.150
How did we do that?

01:29:53.150 --> 01:29:55.640
Well, we did image analysis
and combined with the

01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:56.460
Knowledge Graph that

01:29:56.460 --> 01:29:58.280
recognizes important landmarks.

01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:01.410
And Google knew that this was
about the Eiffel Tower.

01:30:01.410 --> 01:30:05.560
So if you click, why, you can
just go deeper and click

01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:07.850
through other posts about
the Eiffel Tower.

01:30:07.850 --> 01:30:13.240
[APPLAUSE]

01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:15.130
VIC GUNDOTRA: Now, of
course, we deeply

01:30:15.130 --> 01:30:17.130
respect the content producer.

01:30:17.130 --> 01:30:19.880
And so you always have the
option of telling Google,

01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:23.160
either on a particular post or
globally, whether you want

01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:25.020
your content to have
this amazing

01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:26.640
related hashtags feature.

01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:29.310
And if we ever get it wrong and
have the wrong hashtag,

01:30:29.310 --> 01:30:31.690
you could always X it out.

01:30:31.690 --> 01:30:35.140
In either case, we think what
we've built here is a stream

01:30:35.140 --> 01:30:38.700
that's about design and depth,
really allowing you to go

01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:40.550
deeper on your interests.

01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:42.750
Now, we don't have time to show
you all of the features.

01:30:46.430 --> 01:30:48.420
There's just too many
to talk about today.

01:30:48.420 --> 01:30:51.030
But we'll be rolling this
out this afternoon.

01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:54.540
We hope that you'll absolutely
love it.

01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:59.010
OK, now let's talk
about Hangouts.

01:30:59.010 --> 01:31:02.920
You know, at Google we have a
point of view about software

01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:06.990
and technology, namely that it
should get out of the way and

01:31:06.990 --> 01:31:09.320
allow people to do what
they do best, that's

01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:12.620
live, learn, and love.

01:31:12.620 --> 01:31:15.462
That was true even when
we started Google+.

01:31:15.462 --> 01:31:18.570
You know, other sites when we
started often asked you to

01:31:18.570 --> 01:31:21.760
think of your relationships as
either friends or not friends.

01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:25.110
And we argued that was not
reflective of real life.

01:31:25.110 --> 01:31:26.660
In real life you don't
have this.

01:31:26.660 --> 01:31:28.160
You have this.

01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:30.690
And so we built circles as
a core part of Google+.

01:31:30.690 --> 01:31:34.090
And we're happy to report that
today more than half of all

01:31:34.090 --> 01:31:38.830
sharing that's done on Google+
is done to private circles.

01:31:38.830 --> 01:31:41.990
Now, that same dynamic exists
in the world of real time

01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:43.380
communications.

01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:45.500
When you think about a real time
communication, somebody

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:48.770
you want to talk with, you don't
think about wanting to

01:31:48.770 --> 01:31:50.420
talk to a computer.

01:31:50.420 --> 01:31:52.580
You want to talk to a person.

01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:56.170
And yet despite 50 years
of work in real time

01:31:56.170 --> 01:32:00.860
communication products, we still
are stuck with gadgets

01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:03.500
that get in the way.

01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:05.740
Think for a moment about
some of the real time

01:32:05.740 --> 01:32:09.370
communications products, the
choices that you have.

01:32:09.370 --> 01:32:11.210
Some are very nice.

01:32:11.210 --> 01:32:12.890
They work on one platform.

01:32:12.890 --> 01:32:15.600
So if you think about your
friend, you have to ask

01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:18.440
yourself are they on a
particular operating system?

01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:20.270
Why you should OS's matter?

01:32:20.270 --> 01:32:21.730
People matter.

01:32:21.730 --> 01:32:24.500
Or think about other choices
that are very popular on

01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:26.940
mobile, fantastic ways to
communicate on mobile.

01:32:26.940 --> 01:32:31.180
But if your brother is at work
on a desktop or a laptop, why

01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:32.750
should he be left out?

01:32:32.750 --> 01:32:36.240
Or there are other solutions
that do group video very, very

01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:37.900
well and messaging.

01:32:37.900 --> 01:32:40.500
But it's very difficult
to do photos.

01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:46.360
Frankly, even Google's own
services have been fragmented

01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:48.600
and confused at times.

01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:51.810
What we want to do is fill
in all the boxes.

01:32:51.810 --> 01:32:54.090
Because when we fill in all
the boxes, we believe,

01:32:54.090 --> 01:32:59.590
finally, technology can just go
away and people can focus

01:32:59.590 --> 01:33:02.260
on what makes them
the happiness.

01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:04.500
And that's just hanging out.

01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:08.140
So we're introducing today a
new application, Hangouts.

01:33:08.140 --> 01:33:10.560
And we think we've built
a product that is about

01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:15.100
conversations that last with
people that you love.

01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:16.990
Let me show you the product.

01:33:16.990 --> 01:33:19.890
Now, as Matt goes to the demo
here, the first thing you'll

01:33:19.890 --> 01:33:22.850
notice on Matt's Android
phone is the new icon,

01:33:22.850 --> 01:33:25.330
a standalone app.

01:33:25.330 --> 01:33:27.680
And Matt will go ahead and click
on Hangouts and open up

01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:29.010
the application.

01:33:29.010 --> 01:33:31.200
Now, you're looking
here at a list of

01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:35.080
conversations, not contacts.

01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:37.340
Some of those conversations
or one on one.

01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:39.880
Some of those conversations
are group conversations.

01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:42.520
But the primary pivot,
the focus is on those

01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:43.590
conversations.

01:33:43.590 --> 01:33:46.580
Now, if Matt wants to get his
contacts, maybe he wants to

01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:48.890
add someone, it's
one tap away.

01:33:48.890 --> 01:33:51.590
You can see Google will rank the
important people that he

01:33:51.590 --> 01:33:54.370
normally talks to and make
that easily available for

01:33:54.370 --> 01:33:56.100
either a message or
a video call.

01:33:56.100 --> 01:33:58.060
But let's go back to
the conversations.

01:33:58.060 --> 01:34:01.250
There's several attributes about
these conversations that

01:34:01.250 --> 01:34:02.360
I want to talk about.

01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:04.170
The first is my favorite.

01:34:04.170 --> 01:34:04.860
And that is these

01:34:04.860 --> 01:34:07.610
conversations can be long lasting.

01:34:07.610 --> 01:34:11.290
So as Matt goes back in time,
you're able to see that

01:34:11.290 --> 01:34:13.160
conversation.

01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:15.120
Imagine that you have your
family in a conversation for

01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:16.750
many months or a year.

01:34:16.750 --> 01:34:18.530
There's the holiday party.

01:34:18.530 --> 01:34:20.500
There's the vacation
you took together.

01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:24.170
There's important moments like
the birth of a child.

01:34:24.170 --> 01:34:27.980
All those things are stored with
you even as you change

01:34:27.980 --> 01:34:30.910
devices in those long running
conversations.

01:34:30.910 --> 01:34:33.510
Of course, we give you the
ability to turn off history.

01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:34.990
Of course, we give you
the ability to

01:34:34.990 --> 01:34:36.520
delete those things.

01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:39.960
But having the ability to save
those conversations is, I

01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:42.130
think, delightful and amazing.

01:34:42.130 --> 01:34:43.880
Another aspect is that
the conversations

01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:45.770
are rich and alive.

01:34:45.770 --> 01:34:47.970
Your photos are stored
in albums.

01:34:47.970 --> 01:34:49.040
This is amazing.

01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:50.880
This baby's not even three
months old and he's already

01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:53.720
learned how to face pump.

01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:57.250
But all the images that you've
shared as a family are all

01:34:57.250 --> 01:34:58.680
right there.

01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:01.140
In addition to beautiful images
that are easily stored

01:35:01.140 --> 01:35:04.410
and saved, the conversation
feels alive.

01:35:04.410 --> 01:35:05.740
Look at the bottom.

01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:08.890
You can there see as people
join, they show up.

01:35:08.890 --> 01:35:11.530
As they're typing,
they animate out.

01:35:11.530 --> 01:35:14.580
You can see exactly where
someone has read to.

01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:18.240
It really feels like you're
in the same room together.

01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:21.830
And we think that's
delightful.

01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:23.990
By the way, you're looking at
it on the way web, you're

01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:27.130
looking at it on Android, and
you're looking at it on iOS,

01:35:27.130 --> 01:35:29.030
all available today.

01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:38.160
[APPLAUSE]

01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:39.620
VIC GUNDOTRA: And, by the
way, two other points.

01:35:39.620 --> 01:35:41.380
One is a point that Hugo made.

01:35:41.380 --> 01:35:42.830
I think you're going
to love how the

01:35:42.830 --> 01:35:44.790
notifications are all synced.

01:35:44.790 --> 01:35:48.180
So if you wipe a notification
from the desktop or on

01:35:48.180 --> 01:35:50.150
Android, it'll go away
on another device.

01:35:50.150 --> 01:35:51.190
It's beautiful.

01:35:51.190 --> 01:35:52.300
I think you'll like that.

01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:54.180
But my favorite feature--

01:35:54.180 --> 01:35:55.190
sorry about that.

01:35:55.190 --> 01:35:56.970
Let's go back to the demo.

01:35:56.970 --> 01:35:59.160
One other feature I didn't talk
about that was pretty

01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:02.280
critical, which is at Google
we always believed that the

01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:04.920
best way to do real time
communications is

01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:07.150
face to face to face.

01:36:07.150 --> 01:36:09.960
And so in that conversation,
Matt can tap on that video

01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:13.800
icon and everyone in that
conversation will be dropped

01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:15.160
into a video chat.

01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:16.410
There, you can see Matt.

01:36:16.410 --> 01:36:18.980
He's into the video chat and
everyone's being dropped in.

01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:21.570
Group video at no charge.

01:36:21.570 --> 01:36:23.165
Isn't that fantastic?

01:36:23.165 --> 01:36:30.620
[APPLAUSE]

01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:31.870
VIC GUNDOTRA: OK, let's
go back to the slides.

01:36:38.540 --> 01:36:40.350
OK, now let's switch topics.

01:36:40.350 --> 01:36:43.870
And, finally, let's
talk about photos.

01:36:43.870 --> 01:36:48.100
Photography can be a very
rewarding experience.

01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:50.460
I know for me it captures
the most important

01:36:50.460 --> 01:36:52.020
moments of my life.

01:36:52.020 --> 01:36:54.570
I remember when I was on the
beach and I asked my kids to

01:36:54.570 --> 01:36:56.630
stand together to
take a picture.

01:36:56.630 --> 01:36:58.460
I didn't know my son was
going to wrap his

01:36:58.460 --> 01:36:59.630
arms around my daughter.

01:36:59.630 --> 01:37:01.170
I didn't know my daughter
was going to reach up

01:37:01.170 --> 01:37:02.440
and hold his hand.

01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:06.130
But for the rest of my life I'm
going to picture them like

01:37:06.130 --> 01:37:09.110
this despite the fact that
he's now taller than me.

01:37:09.110 --> 01:37:11.800
That's how I imagine him.

01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:13.190
I'm not alone.

01:37:13.190 --> 01:37:16.890
You too have amazing images that
are the most important

01:37:16.890 --> 01:37:19.620
precious memories
of your life.

01:37:19.620 --> 01:37:22.900
But if we're honest with each
other, we'll also admit that

01:37:22.900 --> 01:37:26.150
photography is very
labor intensive.

01:37:26.150 --> 01:37:30.370
It takes a lot of time to
organize, edit, enhance,

01:37:30.370 --> 01:37:33.640
upload and share your
photos, time that

01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:36.406
many of us don't have.

01:37:36.406 --> 01:37:41.270
At Google we think we can give
you some of your time back.

01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:45.580
By combining your camera with
our cloud, we can do some of

01:37:45.580 --> 01:37:49.820
those labor intensive tasks
automatically for you.

01:37:49.820 --> 01:37:53.540
In fact, today we'd like to
introduce the notion of

01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:56.890
Google's data centers being
your new darkroom.

01:37:56.890 --> 01:37:58.880
Now, what does that mean?

01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:01.170
Well, when you think of
the cloud, most of us

01:38:01.170 --> 01:38:03.220
think of back up.

01:38:03.220 --> 01:38:05.620
But today we're going to go
beyond back up, and we're

01:38:05.620 --> 01:38:08.870
going to talk about three
exciting new areas that

01:38:08.870 --> 01:38:11.940
combine the data center,
Google's cloud, with

01:38:11.940 --> 01:38:13.090
photography.

01:38:13.090 --> 01:38:15.520
But before I do that, let me
just begin with what you

01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:17.540
already know, back up.

01:38:17.540 --> 01:38:20.700
Now, since we've launched
Google+, we've always backed

01:38:20.700 --> 01:38:24.920
up your photos, unlimited, all
your photos at standard size.

01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:27.570
And a few months ago we
introduced the ability for you

01:38:27.570 --> 01:38:30.670
to choose an option where we
would upload your photos, not

01:38:30.670 --> 01:38:33.220
at standard size, but
at full resolution.

01:38:33.220 --> 01:38:35.300
And we offered 5
gigabytes free.

01:38:35.300 --> 01:38:38.220
This week we announced that
we're going from 5 gigabytes

01:38:38.220 --> 01:38:44.310
to 15 gigabytes free.

01:38:44.310 --> 01:38:48.150
Now, why does full resolution
matter?

01:38:48.150 --> 01:38:49.540
Well, what you're looking
at here is an

01:38:49.540 --> 01:38:52.310
eight megapixel shot.

01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:54.420
An eight megapixel shot--

01:38:54.420 --> 01:38:55.916
you can clap if you
want, go ahead.

01:38:55.916 --> 01:39:02.370
[APPLAUSE]

01:39:02.370 --> 01:39:04.120
VIC GUNDOTRA: I love it when
you clap and I haven't even

01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:05.430
made the point on the slide.

01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:06.440
That's great.

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:08.210
But I think you get it.

01:39:08.210 --> 01:39:10.360
Eight megapixels is
pretty common.

01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:13.980
Some cell phones like the
Galaxy S4 go up to 13

01:39:13.980 --> 01:39:15.030
megapixels.

01:39:15.030 --> 01:39:18.900
And when you have an important
image, you don't want 619

01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:21.740
pixels or 1024 or 2048.

01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:25.300
80 You want all the pixels
because some memories are not

01:39:25.300 --> 01:39:27.030
meant to be downsized.

01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:28.750
And we give you that
ability on Google+.

01:39:28.750 --> 01:39:32.390
Let's move on.

01:39:32.390 --> 01:39:34.860
Now let's talk about
Highlight.

01:39:34.860 --> 01:39:39.070
What you're looking at is 686 of
my vacation photos from my

01:39:39.070 --> 01:39:41.090
trip to New Zealand.

01:39:41.090 --> 01:39:43.340
Now, there are some beautiful
images in there,

01:39:43.340 --> 01:39:45.030
images I want to share.

01:39:45.030 --> 01:39:47.730
But I don't have time to
pick them out because

01:39:47.730 --> 01:39:49.925
my vacation is over.

01:39:49.925 --> 01:39:52.040
[LAUGHTER]

01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:56.290
VIC GUNDOTRA: Now, I suspect
you've been in the same boat.

01:39:56.290 --> 01:39:59.460
It takes time do
all this stuff.

01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:02.650
Google can pick the best
pictures for you.

01:40:02.650 --> 01:40:06.500
We can go from these 686
pictures to these.

01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:09.170
It's remarkably accurate.

01:40:09.170 --> 01:40:09.760
Go ahead.

01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:10.990
You can clap.

01:40:10.990 --> 01:40:14.490
[APPLAUSE]

01:40:14.490 --> 01:40:16.820
VIC GUNDOTRA: Some of you must
be saying, how did Google know

01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:17.940
those were the best?

01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:19.210
Let me tell you.

01:40:19.210 --> 01:40:21.420
We do lots of things
to choose the best.

01:40:21.420 --> 01:40:23.250
Some of things that we
do is we look for

01:40:23.250 --> 01:40:24.420
images that are blurry.

01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:26.180
And they're not going to
make the highlights.

01:40:26.180 --> 01:40:28.380
We look for images that
are duplicates.

01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:30.440
I took four images of
the same mountain.

01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:31.470
We'll pick one.

01:40:31.470 --> 01:40:34.620
We look for images that are not
the greatest exposure and

01:40:34.620 --> 01:40:36.550
they're unlikely to make
your highlights.

01:40:36.550 --> 01:40:39.140
Or we even do amazing
things like we

01:40:39.140 --> 01:40:40.730
recognize the Eiffel Tower.

01:40:40.730 --> 01:40:43.240
We can recognize in your
images if you're at an

01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:44.540
important landmark.

01:40:44.540 --> 01:40:47.380
In this case, this is a
beautiful shot of Queenstown.

01:40:47.380 --> 01:40:50.290
And we boost that image so that
it's more likely to make

01:40:50.290 --> 01:40:51.370
the highlights.

01:40:51.370 --> 01:40:53.670
We also analyze to see if
there are people there.

01:40:53.670 --> 01:40:55.100
Are the people happy?

01:40:55.100 --> 01:40:56.490
Are they smiling?

01:40:56.490 --> 01:40:59.210
Might make the highlights.

01:40:59.210 --> 01:41:01.920
Our machine learning algorithms
have also been

01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:06.050
trained by literally hundreds
of human raters so that the

01:41:06.050 --> 01:41:09.340
machine learning algorithms have
now begun to account for

01:41:09.340 --> 01:41:11.070
aesthetics, for human taste.

01:41:11.070 --> 01:41:13.410
What do people find beautiful?

01:41:13.410 --> 01:41:15.180
And we're able to boost
that image.

01:41:15.180 --> 01:41:17.290
And then my favorite
is affinity.

01:41:17.290 --> 01:41:20.560
We recognize who's important
to you, who's

01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:21.950
in your family circle.

01:41:21.950 --> 01:41:24.660
And we apply appropriate social
boost so that you're

01:41:24.660 --> 01:41:27.170
wife and your children are
in the highlights.

01:41:27.170 --> 01:41:29.120
It's absolutely amazing.

01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:31.470
We think you're going
to love it.

01:41:31.470 --> 01:41:32.998
And it's going to
save you time.

01:41:32.998 --> 01:41:41.310
[APPLAUSE]

01:41:41.310 --> 01:41:42.500
VIC GUNDOTRA: This is
a shot of what we're

01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:43.670
rolling out this evening.

01:41:43.670 --> 01:41:45.610
This is the actual product,
the desktop version.

01:41:45.610 --> 01:41:47.360
You'll note that we'll give
you your highlights.

01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:50.490
And right there at the bottom
you could always click and see

01:41:50.490 --> 01:41:52.670
all the other images as well.

01:41:52.670 --> 01:41:54.600
So it's right there for you.

01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:59.180
Now let's talk about enhancing
your images.

01:41:59.180 --> 01:42:01.460
One of my favorite photographers
famously said,

01:42:01.460 --> 01:42:02.850
you don't take a photograph.

01:42:02.850 --> 01:42:04.050
You make it.

01:42:04.050 --> 01:42:06.080
And if you know a good
photographer, a professional,

01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:08.070
you know that's true.

01:42:08.070 --> 01:42:11.700
Professionals can take a good
image and make it amazing

01:42:11.700 --> 01:42:15.580
because they have access to
tools like this, powerful

01:42:15.580 --> 01:42:19.230
tools that require lots of
skills that run on expensive

01:42:19.230 --> 01:42:22.010
machines that take
lots of time.

01:42:22.010 --> 01:42:24.060
And you can do amazing things.

01:42:24.060 --> 01:42:27.340
The problem is is that for the
average person these tools

01:42:27.340 --> 01:42:31.210
often look like this to them,
like a bewildering set of

01:42:31.210 --> 01:42:33.300
knobs that they don't
understand.

01:42:33.300 --> 01:42:37.170
Today we're introducing
auto enhance.

01:42:37.170 --> 01:42:39.930
Auto enhance is an easy
button to make your

01:42:39.930 --> 01:42:42.560
memories look beautiful.

01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:45.840
We can automatically take an
image that looks like this and

01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:48.320
make it look like this.

01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:50.480
Now, how in the world
do we do that?

01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:54.010
Well, we're going to show you
some of the things that we do,

01:42:54.010 --> 01:42:56.770
things like tonal distribution,
skin softening,

01:42:56.770 --> 01:43:00.510
noise reduction, structure,
vignetting, red eye reduction,

01:43:00.510 --> 01:43:02.360
so much that we do.

01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:03.900
And we don't have time
in his keynote to

01:43:03.900 --> 01:43:05.020
show you all of them.

01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:06.290
But we're going to
highlight a few.

01:43:06.290 --> 01:43:08.270
Let's begin with tonal
distribution.

01:43:08.270 --> 01:43:09.740
All of us have taken
pictures that are

01:43:09.740 --> 01:43:12.100
over or under exposed.

01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:14.870
You might think Google would
find the middle ground.

01:43:14.870 --> 01:43:16.200
We do better than that.

01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:19.360
Remember, our algorithms take
into account human taste.

01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:24.110
So we can take an image like
this and just make it perfect.

01:43:24.110 --> 01:43:26.530
Let me show you another
example.

01:43:26.530 --> 01:43:27.870
Let me show you another
example.

01:43:27.870 --> 01:43:29.310
Let's talk about
skin softening.

01:43:29.310 --> 01:43:31.300
Now, I'm going to apologize in
advance because you're going

01:43:31.300 --> 01:43:33.180
to see a huge photo of me.

01:43:33.180 --> 01:43:35.110
But we thought we'd pick someone
that no one could get

01:43:35.110 --> 01:43:36.130
offended over.

01:43:36.130 --> 01:43:38.440
So we'll start that with me.

01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:43.850
OK, now let's talk about
recognizing people's faces.

01:43:43.850 --> 01:43:48.020
If you have an inexpensive phone
or even an inexpensive

01:43:48.020 --> 01:43:51.230
camera, those devices
can recognize faces.

01:43:51.230 --> 01:43:54.230
But the state of the art today
is to put a rectangle around a

01:43:54.230 --> 01:43:56.560
face and say, we think
there's a face there.

01:43:56.560 --> 01:43:58.850
We've had several breakthroughs
at Google where

01:43:58.850 --> 01:44:01.470
we're now able to deeply
recognize the

01:44:01.470 --> 01:44:03.430
human face and skin.

01:44:03.430 --> 01:44:06.340
We can tease apart exactly
where is the hairline.

01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:07.890
What are the eyes, the teeth?

01:44:07.890 --> 01:44:09.400
Is the person wearing jewelry?

01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:10.690
Do they have glasses on?

01:44:10.690 --> 01:44:13.010
And we can separate
all that out.

01:44:13.010 --> 01:44:16.540
That breakthrough means that
when we do the other effects,

01:44:16.540 --> 01:44:20.400
things like structure, tonal
enhancement, we can do

01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:22.140
something different
on the clouds,

01:44:22.140 --> 01:44:24.140
the water, the mountains.

01:44:24.140 --> 01:44:26.830
And we can treat the human face
completely separately

01:44:26.830 --> 01:44:30.130
like a professional
would in a tool.

01:44:30.130 --> 01:44:31.710
Now, let's talk about one
of those effects.

01:44:31.710 --> 01:44:33.280
Let's talk about
skin softening.

01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:36.030
Now, how many of you like your
passport or your driver's

01:44:36.030 --> 01:44:37.690
license photos?

01:44:37.690 --> 01:44:38.600
No one does.

01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:40.310
Well, why not?

01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:44.180
Because photographs often
exaggerate our flaws.

01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:47.440
In real life when you look at me
or your friends, you don't

01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:49.110
see every one of their flaws.

01:44:49.110 --> 01:44:51.940
But in a picture, you
see all of them.

01:44:51.940 --> 01:44:53.590
In fact, we're going
to make it worse.

01:44:53.590 --> 01:44:57.560
Let's zoom in on this picture
a little bit.

01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:01.540
Like I said, I used my own so I
wouldn't offend anyone else.

01:45:01.540 --> 01:45:03.020
Wrinkles, right?

01:45:03.020 --> 01:45:04.700
But chances are when you're
talking to me, you

01:45:04.700 --> 01:45:05.580
don't stare at them.

01:45:05.580 --> 01:45:09.520
Watch what happens when we apply
skin softening, just

01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:10.830
gently toned down.

01:45:10.830 --> 01:45:11.870
Let's zoom all the way out.

01:45:11.870 --> 01:45:13.440
That's the original image.

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:16.140
That's with skin softening
enhancements.

01:45:16.140 --> 01:45:19.270
Just gently and beautifully
enhanced.

01:45:19.270 --> 01:45:21.980
We think you're going to love
it when we apply this across

01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:23.360
your photographs.

01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:25.690
Let's talk about noise
reduction.

01:45:25.690 --> 01:45:29.150
Maybe you've taken a picture
in low light, particularly

01:45:29.150 --> 01:45:30.560
with a cell phone.

01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:33.270
You get grain, noise
on your image.

01:45:33.270 --> 01:45:35.620
Look at the sky in
this photograph.

01:45:35.620 --> 01:45:38.220
Well, our noise reduction
filters can automatically take

01:45:38.220 --> 01:45:43.220
something that looks like this
and make it look like that.

01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:44.080
Pretty amazing.

01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:47.650
[APPLAUSE]

01:45:47.650 --> 01:45:48.770
Let's talk about structure.

01:45:48.770 --> 01:45:52.550
Here's a picture that I took
when I was in New Zealand.

01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:54.680
I remember that image
having more life.

01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:55.670
It was more vivid.

01:45:55.670 --> 01:45:56.680
Well, what happened?

01:45:56.680 --> 01:45:59.290
Well, the camera palette
balanced everything out so it

01:45:59.290 --> 01:46:00.650
became flat.

01:46:00.650 --> 01:46:03.340
A professional would go into a
tool and they would add a lot

01:46:03.340 --> 01:46:05.130
more structure to the sky.

01:46:05.130 --> 01:46:06.740
We can do that automatically.

01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:09.390
And so we can take an image that
looks like this and auto

01:46:09.390 --> 01:46:11.591
enhance it to look like that.

01:46:11.591 --> 01:46:14.680
[APPLAUSE]

01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:17.020
VIC GUNDOTRA: There's obviously
lots more that we

01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:18.180
don't have time to talk about.

01:46:18.180 --> 01:46:20.200
But what we're going to
bring up a special

01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:21.790
tool, a debugging tool.

01:46:21.790 --> 01:46:24.380
And we're going to tease apart
some of these effects and show

01:46:24.380 --> 01:46:27.540
you how they layer on to
make an image awesome.

01:46:27.540 --> 01:46:32.060
So here's an image, untouched
out of the camera.

01:46:32.060 --> 01:46:33.590
And we're going to start
layering on these

01:46:33.590 --> 01:46:34.480
enhancements.

01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:37.770
Let's begin with tonal
enhancement.

01:46:37.770 --> 01:46:40.190
Let's add some skin softening.

01:46:40.190 --> 01:46:42.780
Before and after on the
skin softening.

01:46:42.780 --> 01:46:45.690
Now let's add some structure
for the clouds.

01:46:45.690 --> 01:46:48.660
Let's add vignette to emphasize
the human face.

01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:52.820
And let's go before and then
auto enhanced by Google.

01:46:52.820 --> 01:46:54.282
Pretty amazing, isn't it?

01:46:54.282 --> 01:46:58.100
[APPLAUSE]

01:46:58.100 --> 01:47:00.430
VIC GUNDOTRA: One
more example.

01:47:00.430 --> 01:47:02.710
A beautiful landscape
photograph of

01:47:02.710 --> 01:47:04.330
Queenstown that I took.

01:47:04.330 --> 01:47:05.530
I think it's pretty great.

01:47:05.530 --> 01:47:07.070
Let's see what Google can do.

01:47:07.070 --> 01:47:09.120
Once again, tonal enhancement.

01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:10.710
Doesn't need any skin
softening here.

01:47:10.710 --> 01:47:11.650
Structure.

01:47:11.650 --> 01:47:13.290
A little bit around the edges.

01:47:13.290 --> 01:47:14.270
Darken the edges.

01:47:14.270 --> 01:47:17.690
Look at the original and
what Google did.

01:47:17.690 --> 01:47:18.656
Amazing.

01:47:18.656 --> 01:47:22.550
[APPLAUSE]

01:47:22.550 --> 01:47:25.330
VIC GUNDOTRA: All you have to
do is upload your images and

01:47:25.330 --> 01:47:29.690
we will apply all of this for
you on all of your photographs

01:47:29.690 --> 01:47:31.820
while still giving
you control.

01:47:31.820 --> 01:47:35.130
This is an actual picture or an
actual shot of the product

01:47:35.130 --> 01:47:37.380
itself that's rolling
out this afternoon.

01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:40.670
If you mouse over any photograph
that's yours, we'll

01:47:40.670 --> 01:47:42.640
show you that enhanced icon.

01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:45.520
And when Matt clicks on that
enhanced icon, we'll go back

01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:46.470
to the original.

01:47:46.470 --> 01:47:48.730
And if you let go, you'll
see the enhancement.

01:47:48.730 --> 01:47:51.390
And if you want, you can click
under the More menu, and you

01:47:51.390 --> 01:47:55.810
can always turn this on or off,
either globally or on an

01:47:55.810 --> 01:47:57.670
individual photograph.

01:47:57.670 --> 01:48:00.900
So we think this is amazing,
and it's going to save you

01:48:00.900 --> 01:48:02.040
lots of time.

01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:05.200
Let's continue on.

01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:06.930
We've talked about backup.

01:48:06.930 --> 01:48:10.480
We've talked about enhancing,
highlighting your photos and

01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:11.630
enhancing your photos.

01:48:11.630 --> 01:48:13.890
Now let's talk about awesome.

01:48:13.890 --> 01:48:17.600
Auto awesome creates a
new image from one

01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:19.960
that did not exist.

01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:21.600
Let me give you an example.

01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:22.310
We have lots of these.

01:48:22.310 --> 01:48:23.560
Let me give you an example.

01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:27.170
We recognize that you've taken
several pictures in burst mode

01:48:27.170 --> 01:48:29.100
or taken around the same
time together.

01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:33.320
We will automatically gift to
you in your album something

01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:36.730
that looks like this.

01:48:36.730 --> 01:48:41.650
[LAUGHTER]

01:48:41.650 --> 01:48:46.080
[APPLAUSE]

01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:47.070
VIC GUNDOTRA: Here's
another example.

01:48:47.070 --> 01:48:49.050
Maybe you've taken lots
of shots of children.

01:48:49.050 --> 01:48:51.020
They're never looking
at the same time.

01:48:51.020 --> 01:48:52.090
Go back to your album.

01:48:52.090 --> 01:48:53.580
You'll see a gift for you.

01:48:53.580 --> 01:48:55.700
You'll have another one of these
auto awesome motions.

01:49:00.010 --> 01:49:03.150
By the way, over the past two
weeks in a dark launch state,

01:49:03.150 --> 01:49:06.150
we've gone through all the
albums you've hosted on Google

01:49:06.150 --> 01:49:07.820
and gifted all of
these to you.

01:49:07.820 --> 01:49:11.250
You'll see them turned
on this afternoon.

01:49:11.250 --> 01:49:11.940
These are five--

01:49:11.940 --> 01:49:16.540
[APPLAUSE]

01:49:16.540 --> 01:49:18.650
VIC GUNDOTRA: We're introducing
five auto awesome

01:49:18.650 --> 01:49:19.580
effects today.

01:49:19.580 --> 01:49:21.750
You saw a demonstration
of motion.

01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:23.710
Let me briefly talk
about the others.

01:49:23.710 --> 01:49:26.730
If we recognize that you have
multiple portraits together of

01:49:26.730 --> 01:49:30.090
people, we will automatically
create a collage.

01:49:30.090 --> 01:49:31.740
HDR is self explanatory.

01:49:31.740 --> 01:49:33.050
We'll do that for you.

01:49:33.050 --> 01:49:37.130
If we see multiple pictures of
the same people in burst moder

01:49:37.130 --> 01:49:39.700
where they're not all smiling,
we will find where they're

01:49:39.700 --> 01:49:42.420
smiling and we will construct
a new image

01:49:42.420 --> 01:49:43.980
with all of them smiling.

01:49:43.980 --> 01:49:44.610
It's amazing.

01:49:44.610 --> 01:49:47.320
[APPLAUSE]

01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:49.210
VIC GUNDOTRA: And,
finally, a pano.

01:49:49.210 --> 01:49:51.870
So if you've taken an image, we
recognize it's at the same

01:49:51.870 --> 01:49:55.260
spot, we'll stitch them together
beautifully and put

01:49:55.260 --> 01:49:57.160
that in your album for free.

01:49:57.160 --> 01:50:02.740
OK, so to summarize, today we've
shown you a new, modern,

01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:06.750
multicolumn stream, a stream
that's about design and depth

01:50:06.750 --> 01:50:09.350
so you can explore your
interests on Google+.

01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:14.110
We've shown you a new Hangouts
application, one that's about

01:50:14.110 --> 01:50:17.370
conversations that lasts with
the people you love.

01:50:17.370 --> 01:50:20.500
And, finally, we've shown you
a new photos experience and

01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:24.740
shown you what can happen when
Google is your darkroom.

01:50:24.740 --> 01:50:27.870
Taken collectively, we
think we just put

01:50:27.870 --> 01:50:29.070
the Google into Google+.

01:50:29.070 --> 01:50:33.100
And we've finally allowed
technology to get out of the

01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:37.920
way and allow you to do what you
do best, live, learn, and,

01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:39.600
yes, even love.

01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:40.612
Thank you.

01:50:40.612 --> 01:50:49.780
[APPLAUSE]

01:50:49.780 --> 01:50:52.840
VIC GUNDOTRA: Now we'd like to
talk about what was possibly

01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:55.360
your first Google
love, Search.

01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:58.170
Join me in welcoming Ahmit
Singhal to the stage.

01:50:58.170 --> 01:50:59.148
Thank you.

01:50:59.148 --> 01:51:04.038
[APPLAUSE]

01:51:04.038 --> 01:51:10.395
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:51:18.776 --> 01:51:20.710
AMIT SINGHAL: Yes.

01:51:20.710 --> 01:51:23.420
It's a provocative
title, indeed,

01:51:23.420 --> 01:51:26.100
especially coming from Google.

01:51:26.100 --> 01:51:30.100
But I believe with
good reason.

01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:31.780
Search is dramatically changing

01:51:31.780 --> 01:51:33.770
right before our eyes.

01:51:33.770 --> 01:51:37.360
And in the next 15 minutes,
I want to show you

01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:41.550
how and in fact why.

01:51:41.550 --> 01:51:45.140
But before we dive in, let me
just tell you why I'm so

01:51:45.140 --> 01:51:47.750
excited to be here.

01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:50.120
I grew up in small
town India in the

01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:51.832
foothills of the Himalayas.

01:51:51.832 --> 01:51:56.080
[CHEERING]

01:51:56.080 --> 01:51:57.330
AMIT SINGHAL: Thank you.

01:51:59.450 --> 01:52:03.100
And, yes, that's me
when I was three.

01:52:03.100 --> 01:52:04.350
Very cute.

01:52:06.610 --> 01:52:11.425
Indeed, my friends asked
me too, what happened?

01:52:15.980 --> 01:52:19.620
Growing up, like many of you,
I was hooked on Star Trek.

01:52:19.620 --> 01:52:23.580
I would watch endless episodes
of Star Trek, captivated by

01:52:23.580 --> 01:52:25.680
the future technology
it showed.

01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:29.490
I mean, a computer you could
talk to and it will answer

01:52:29.490 --> 01:52:32.070
everything you ask it?

01:52:32.070 --> 01:52:35.260
I dreamt of building that
computer one day.

01:52:35.260 --> 01:52:38.320
And little did I know that I
would grow up to become the

01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:41.650
person responsible for building
my dream for the

01:52:41.650 --> 01:52:43.170
entire world.

01:52:43.170 --> 01:52:49.060
[APPLAUSE]

01:52:49.060 --> 01:52:50.700
AMIT SINGHAL: Now, at Google
we are building three

01:52:50.700 --> 01:52:54.720
experiences that are making huge
advances towards building

01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:56.630
that dream.

01:52:56.630 --> 01:53:02.010
The search of future will need
to answer, converse, and

01:53:02.010 --> 01:53:03.590
anticipate.

01:53:03.590 --> 01:53:05.610
And today we have announcements

01:53:05.610 --> 01:53:08.650
across all these areas.

01:53:08.650 --> 01:53:09.910
So let's start answers.

01:53:09.910 --> 01:53:14.320
And let me show you what we
have been up to recently.

01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:18.020
Last year, when we launched the
Knowledge Graph, it was a

01:53:18.020 --> 01:53:22.000
huge advance in search
technology.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.030
Knowledge Graph enabled Google
to move beyond keywords and

01:53:26.030 --> 01:53:31.240
understand real wold entities,
unique people, places, and

01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:35.350
things, and the relationships
between them.

01:53:35.350 --> 01:53:38.680
Knowledge graph allowed us to
answer questions we couldn't

01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:44.150
have answered before like what
are the movies by J.J Abrams?

01:53:44.150 --> 01:53:48.750
Or what's the release date of
one of the most anticipated

01:53:48.750 --> 01:53:51.590
movies of the season?

01:53:51.590 --> 01:53:55.060
Now, we have been continuously
improving the Knowledge Graph.

01:53:55.060 --> 01:54:00.280
With over 570 million entities
and growing, the graph becomes

01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:03.440
more and more powerful
each day.

01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:07.330
And today I am happy to announce
that very soon you

01:54:07.330 --> 01:54:10.290
will start getting important
statistics powered by the

01:54:10.290 --> 01:54:12.110
Knowledge Graph.

01:54:12.110 --> 01:54:14.680
Now you can already find answers
to questions like

01:54:14.680 --> 01:54:16.980
what's the population
of India.

01:54:16.980 --> 01:54:21.620
However, starting today, we will
be anticipating your next

01:54:21.620 --> 01:54:24.990
question, which may very well
be, how does it compare to the

01:54:24.990 --> 01:54:27.770
population of other countries?

01:54:27.770 --> 01:54:31.990
And not only will we give you
the answer alongside the trend

01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:37.210
line, we will show you all that
in comparison to China

01:54:37.210 --> 01:54:42.330
and the United States, the two
countries who are most often

01:54:42.330 --> 01:54:46.660
compared to India
population wise.

01:54:46.660 --> 01:54:49.500
Now, we have launched Knowledge
Graph in English and

01:54:49.500 --> 01:54:51.310
eight other languages.

01:54:51.310 --> 01:54:54.825
And today we are
adding Polish--

01:54:54.825 --> 01:54:56.700
[APPLAUSE]

01:54:56.700 --> 01:55:00.050
AMIT SINGHAL: Yes, my friends.

01:55:00.050 --> 01:55:09.160
Turkish, simplified Chinese, and
traditional Chinese as new

01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:12.060
languages for the
Knowledge Graph.

01:55:12.060 --> 01:55:16.050
And while we are incredibly
excited about our progress

01:55:16.050 --> 01:55:18.330
here, we're just getting
started.

01:55:18.330 --> 01:55:22.310
And we know we can do a whole
lot better because sometimes

01:55:22.310 --> 01:55:25.760
the answer you're looking for
is that song or that video

01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:29.480
that your friend may have sent
you or it's your upcoming

01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:32.160
flight or restaurant
reservation.

01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:35.710
And you should be able to find
those answers from your own

01:55:35.710 --> 01:55:39.240
world without having to dig and
sift through your email,

01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:41.520
your documents, and
your calendar.

01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:46.970
You should simply be able to ask
Google for your upcoming

01:55:46.970 --> 01:55:57.950
flight or your trip plans,
even your restaurant

01:55:57.950 --> 01:56:04.050
reservations or the package
that's about to arrive, and

01:56:04.050 --> 01:56:08.700
even, of course, your
vacation photos.

01:56:08.700 --> 01:56:11.970
Now, people who have opted in
to over Gmail search field

01:56:11.970 --> 01:56:16.380
trial are already enjoying
this powerful experience.

01:56:16.380 --> 01:56:20.910
However, something that is as
important as giving you the

01:56:20.910 --> 01:56:24.720
answers and giving them to you
in the most natural way

01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:34.220
possible is so that you can
pretty much ask Google like

01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:37.930
you would ask a friend and not
by having to type keywords

01:56:37.930 --> 01:56:40.220
into a search box.

01:56:40.220 --> 01:56:42.930
This is why we have been working
hard on technologies

01:56:42.930 --> 01:56:45.440
like voice recognition
and natural language

01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:46.680
understanding.

01:56:46.680 --> 01:56:50.120
Now, we have already launched
conversational search on

01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:52.830
Android and on iOS platform.

01:56:52.830 --> 01:56:56.720
You can tape the mic, ask Google
your question, and you

01:56:56.720 --> 01:56:59.220
can get a spoken
response back.

01:56:59.220 --> 01:57:03.960
And today, for the first time,
I'm happy to announce that all

01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:07.060
this goodness of conversational
search will be

01:57:07.060 --> 01:57:11.027
coming to all your desktops and
laptops through Chrome.

01:57:11.027 --> 01:57:17.500
[APPLAUSE]

01:57:17.500 --> 01:57:19.540
AMIT SINGHAL: While you can
already use the microphone in

01:57:19.540 --> 01:57:24.650
Chrome to search, we will be
bringing conversational search

01:57:24.650 --> 01:57:31.030
and hot wording, a new
interface, or as I call it, no

01:57:31.030 --> 01:57:34.350
interface so that you
don't even have to

01:57:34.350 --> 01:57:35.960
click the mic to search.

01:57:35.960 --> 01:57:40.970
You can sit back, relax,
say OK, Google--

01:57:40.970 --> 01:57:44.330
[LAUGHTER]

01:57:44.330 --> 01:57:49.140
[APPLAUSE]

01:57:49.140 --> 01:57:52.630
AMIT SINGHAL: Ask your question
and have Google speak

01:57:52.630 --> 01:57:55.510
back the answer.

01:57:55.510 --> 01:57:58.930
So we talked about the power of
building these new powerful

01:57:58.930 --> 01:58:02.060
experiences to answer your
questions and letting them ask

01:58:02.060 --> 01:58:05.130
you in the most natural
way possible.

01:58:05.130 --> 01:58:09.630
However, we think that another
essential experience is our

01:58:09.630 --> 01:58:14.250
ability to anticipate and
suggest to you the right thing

01:58:14.250 --> 01:58:19.550
at the right time even before
you ask for them.

01:58:19.550 --> 01:58:23.770
Here, of course, I'm talking
about Google Now.

01:58:23.770 --> 01:58:27.030
Google Now was launched
for Android last year.

01:58:27.030 --> 01:58:31.270
And within a short amount of
time, it has become a must

01:58:31.270 --> 01:58:33.660
have for its users.

01:58:33.660 --> 01:58:36.830
Recently we launched Google
Now for iPhones and iPads

01:58:36.830 --> 01:58:41.210
through the Google Search app,
and users are loving it.

01:58:41.210 --> 01:58:43.780
It's getting better and
better by the day.

01:58:43.780 --> 01:58:46.720
And the more you use
it, the more useful

01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:49.420
it becomes for you.

01:58:49.420 --> 01:58:53.800
And today we are happy to
announce that very soon you

01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:57.990
will be able to set reminders
for yourself in Google Now and

01:58:57.990 --> 01:59:01.920
they will show up at the right
place at the right time

01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:03.364
whenever you need them.

01:59:03.364 --> 01:59:08.940
[APPLAUSE]

01:59:08.940 --> 01:59:11.640
AMIT SINGHAL: In addition, we're
also launching public

01:59:11.640 --> 01:59:16.190
transit commute time cards
and more cards for music,

01:59:16.190 --> 01:59:19.150
television, TV shows,
and video games you

01:59:19.150 --> 01:59:20.600
are interested in.

01:59:20.600 --> 01:59:24.040
Now, we are confident that all
this momentum in Google Now

01:59:24.040 --> 01:59:28.470
will make Google even more
useful as an assistive tool.

01:59:28.470 --> 01:59:30.720
And we are very excited
about it.

01:59:30.720 --> 01:59:34.160
But what we are really excited
about is how all these

01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:36.250
experiences are coming
together to

01:59:36.250 --> 01:59:38.260
make your life easy.

01:59:38.260 --> 01:59:41.100
And the best way to understand
this is to

01:59:41.100 --> 01:59:44.150
actually see them in action.

01:59:44.150 --> 01:59:47.670
I'd now like to invite Johanna
Wright on the stage to show

01:59:47.670 --> 01:59:50.760
you how all these experiences
are coming together in a

01:59:50.760 --> 01:59:52.092
beautiful way.

01:59:52.092 --> 02:00:04.910
[MUSIC PLAYING]

02:00:04.910 --> 02:00:06.040
JOHANNA WRIGHT: Thank
you, Amit.

02:00:06.040 --> 02:00:09.090
I'm so excited to be here to
bring to life what Amit was

02:00:09.090 --> 02:00:10.420
talking about.

02:00:10.420 --> 02:00:12.250
Let's start with a scenario
that might happen in my

02:00:12.250 --> 02:00:14.850
family, planning a day trip
to Santa Cruz with

02:00:14.850 --> 02:00:17.450
my husband and kids.

02:00:17.450 --> 02:00:19.780
I'm going to walk over
to the computer here.

02:00:19.780 --> 02:00:22.120
And what you see here
is a Chrome browser

02:00:22.120 --> 02:00:23.640
in full screen mode.

02:00:23.640 --> 02:00:26.280
And Amit was talking
about hot wording.

02:00:26.280 --> 02:00:27.860
Now, this is really hot.

02:00:27.860 --> 02:00:30.010
We just took it off the
press this morning.

02:00:30.010 --> 02:00:32.970
And I've actually never tried
hot wording in a room with so

02:00:32.970 --> 02:00:35.820
much ambient noise.

02:00:35.820 --> 02:00:37.640
So no hands.

02:00:37.640 --> 02:00:39.730
OK, Google.

02:00:39.730 --> 02:00:43.720
Show me things to do
in Santa Cruz.

02:00:43.720 --> 02:00:46.976
FEMALE VOICE: Here are popular
attractions in Santa Cruz.

02:00:46.976 --> 02:00:53.450
[APPLAUSE]

02:00:53.450 --> 02:00:54.910
JOHANNA WRIGHT: What you see
here is coming from our

02:00:54.910 --> 02:00:55.870
Knowledge Graph.

02:00:55.870 --> 02:00:58.980
The Knowledge Graph knows the
Santa Cruz is a place and that

02:00:58.980 --> 02:01:02.260
this list of places are
related to Santa Cruz.

02:01:02.260 --> 02:01:03.870
I like the Natural Bridges
State Beach.

02:01:03.870 --> 02:01:06.300
It's a nice place to relax
with my family.

02:01:06.300 --> 02:01:08.270
But I kind of like something
more active.

02:01:08.270 --> 02:01:10.320
What about the boardwalk?

02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:12.010
OK, Google.

02:01:12.010 --> 02:01:13.995
Show me pictures of the
Santa Cruz Boardwalk.

02:01:16.530 --> 02:01:18.730
FEMALE VOICE: Here you go, some
pictures related to the

02:01:18.730 --> 02:01:21.332
Santa Cruz Boardwalk.

02:01:21.332 --> 02:01:27.650
[APPLAUSE]

02:01:27.650 --> 02:01:28.380
JOHANNA WRIGHT: Nice.

02:01:28.380 --> 02:01:30.060
I love a wooden roller
coaster.

02:01:30.060 --> 02:01:31.310
So does my husband.

02:01:31.310 --> 02:01:33.250
It'd be nice to see if
our kids like it too.

02:01:33.250 --> 02:01:36.980
The only question is will
the drive be too long?

02:01:36.980 --> 02:01:38.640
OK, Google.

02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:42.070
How far is it from here?

02:01:42.070 --> 02:01:44.230
FEMALE VOICE: The drive from
your location to Santa Cruz

02:01:44.230 --> 02:01:47.646
Beach Boardwalk is 73.9 miles.

02:01:47.646 --> 02:01:53.020
[APPLAUSE]

02:01:53.020 --> 02:01:54.470
FEMALE VOICE: That was
my favorite search.

02:01:54.470 --> 02:01:55.170
And you know why?

02:01:55.170 --> 02:01:57.060
It's because I barely
said anything.

02:01:57.060 --> 02:02:00.630
It, here, well, somehow Google
knew that it was the Santa

02:02:00.630 --> 02:02:04.520
Cruz Beach Boardwalk and
here was right here.

02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:06.730
Now, the final thing that I'm
going to need to prepare is

02:02:06.730 --> 02:02:07.650
where to eat.

02:02:07.650 --> 02:02:09.240
My kids love seafood.

02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:10.690
My daughter actually
loves muscles.

02:02:10.690 --> 02:02:12.080
And it's pretty funny
to watch a

02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:13.830
four-year-old eating muscles.

02:02:13.830 --> 02:02:16.880
So why don't we try and find
a seafood restaurant?

02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:18.420
OK, Google.

02:02:18.420 --> 02:02:22.930
Show me seafood restaurants
in Santa Cruz.

02:02:22.930 --> 02:02:24.540
FEMALE VOICE: Here are
addresses for seafood

02:02:24.540 --> 02:02:26.600
restaurants near Santa Cruz.

02:02:26.600 --> 02:02:27.870
JOHANNA WRIGHT: Now, I've heard
of this one, Johnny

02:02:27.870 --> 02:02:29.910
Harborside.

02:02:29.910 --> 02:02:32.950
I can click, look at the
details, and even go ahead and

02:02:32.950 --> 02:02:35.320
make reservations right here.

02:02:35.320 --> 02:02:36.650
So there you have it.

02:02:36.650 --> 02:02:39.270
This is the latest voice
experience coming to Chrome

02:02:39.270 --> 02:02:41.591
and Chrome OS.

02:02:41.591 --> 02:02:49.700
[APPLAUSE]

02:02:49.700 --> 02:02:50.770
JOHANNA WRIGHT: Now let's
fast forward to my

02:02:50.770 --> 02:02:52.000
trip to Santa Cruz.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:53.590
Here I am enjoying
the beautiful

02:02:53.590 --> 02:02:55.020
weather with my kids.

02:02:55.020 --> 02:02:56.690
We're going on the
kiddie rides.

02:02:56.690 --> 02:02:58.100
But you know what I'm
thinking about.

02:02:58.100 --> 02:03:00.720
I'm think about how I can get
back to the Giant Dipper, that

02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:03.070
old wooden roller coaster.

02:03:03.070 --> 02:03:04.960
I don't know if my kids are
tall enough to ride it.

02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:06.780
So we can walk over and check.

02:03:06.780 --> 02:03:09.140
Or wouldn't it be more
convenient to just ask Google?

02:03:14.440 --> 02:03:16.875
How tall do you have to be
to ride the Giant Dipper?

02:03:21.210 --> 02:03:23.500
FEMALE VOICE: You must be at
least four feet, three inches

02:03:23.500 --> 02:03:26.518
tall to ride Giant Dipper.

02:03:26.518 --> 02:03:30.410
[APPLAUSE]

02:03:30.410 --> 02:03:31.270
JOHANNA WRIGHT: Nice.

02:03:31.270 --> 02:03:32.530
Looks like my son can go on.

02:03:32.530 --> 02:03:34.870
My daughter's too short so my
husband's going to have to

02:03:34.870 --> 02:03:37.010
wait this one out.

02:03:37.010 --> 02:03:39.510
So the next thing I'm going to
have to check is will I have

02:03:39.510 --> 02:03:41.480
enough time to get to the Giant
Dipper and get back in

02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:43.075
time for my reservation?

02:03:43.075 --> 02:03:46.730
Now, Google Now anticipates
my information needs.

02:03:46.730 --> 02:03:50.710
So when I swipe up into Google
Now, I see the reservation

02:03:50.710 --> 02:03:52.050
right here.

02:03:52.050 --> 02:03:55.270
It's at 2:00 PM and it's
only five minutes away.

02:03:55.270 --> 02:03:58.150
So now I know I can make
it over to the

02:03:58.150 --> 02:03:59.360
roller coaster in time.

02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:01.700
And when I come back, I can
click on this Navigate link

02:04:01.700 --> 02:04:03.570
and get turn by turn directions
right to the

02:04:03.570 --> 02:04:04.820
restaurant.

02:04:06.460 --> 02:04:08.240
So now let's fast
forward again.

02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:09.990
I've ridden the roller
coaster.

02:04:09.990 --> 02:04:10.992
I'm in the restaurant.

02:04:10.992 --> 02:04:12.570
We're eating our muscles.

02:04:12.570 --> 02:04:14.550
And my husband and my
conversation turns to an

02:04:14.550 --> 02:04:17.870
upcoming business trip I have
to New York this week.

02:04:17.870 --> 02:04:20.670
Usually on Wednesdays I take
my daughter to school.

02:04:20.670 --> 02:04:22.210
But I'm not sure if this
Wednesday I'm going to have

02:04:22.210 --> 02:04:24.320
enough time to get her to school
and then make it to the

02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:27.090
airport to get my flight.

02:04:27.090 --> 02:04:29.130
I don't quite remember
when my flight is.

02:04:29.130 --> 02:04:30.760
So wouldn't it be great
to just ask Google?

02:04:34.170 --> 02:04:35.840
When does my flight leave?

02:04:39.010 --> 02:04:42.350
FEMALE VOICE: Delta Airlines
flight 1940 from SFO to JFK

02:04:42.350 --> 02:04:47.910
leaves at 11:30 AM on May 22.

02:04:47.910 --> 02:04:52.320
[APPLAUSE]

02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:54.110
FEMALE VOICE: For those of you
participating in our search

02:04:54.110 --> 02:04:57.770
field trial, this
will work today.

02:04:57.770 --> 02:04:59.770
Now, the last time I was
in New York, I was

02:04:59.770 --> 02:05:00.680
there with my family.

02:05:00.680 --> 02:05:01.680
I wasn't there on business.

02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:04.150
I was there with my family to
take them to see the sites.

02:05:04.150 --> 02:05:05.190
I saw some old friends.

02:05:05.190 --> 02:05:06.780
I had them meet my kids.

02:05:06.780 --> 02:05:09.030
And my friend Katie asked me
to be sure to give her call

02:05:09.030 --> 02:05:12.350
the next time I'm in town, be
sure that we can get together.

02:05:12.350 --> 02:05:17.000
So before I forget, why don't
I get in touch with Katie?

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:18.380
Send an email to Katie.

02:05:18.380 --> 02:05:20.420
I'll be in town on Thursday and
was wondering if you're

02:05:20.420 --> 02:05:21.670
available for dinner.

02:05:26.040 --> 02:05:27.290
OK, sent.

02:05:30.164 --> 02:05:37.090
[APPLAUSE]

02:05:37.090 --> 02:05:38.330
JOHANNA WRIGHT: Now, Katie's
a bit forgetful.

02:05:38.330 --> 02:05:40.070
So I want to make sure to
give her a call right

02:05:40.070 --> 02:05:42.930
when I get to town.

02:05:42.930 --> 02:05:44.570
Remind me to call Katie
next Wednesday.

02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:52.150
What you see here is our
latest voice action,

02:05:52.150 --> 02:05:55.970
reminders, that are launching
in Google Now today.

02:05:55.970 --> 02:05:58.760
Reminders work on times,
dates, and locations,

02:05:58.760 --> 02:06:00.870
including home and work.

02:06:00.870 --> 02:06:03.690
Now, when I set this reminder
Google Now will remind me at

02:06:03.690 --> 02:06:06.890
just the right moment.

02:06:06.890 --> 02:06:08.370
Fast forward again.

02:06:08.370 --> 02:06:09.780
Fly to New York.

02:06:09.780 --> 02:06:11.260
I get out of my plane.

02:06:11.260 --> 02:06:12.850
I go to get my taxi.

02:06:12.850 --> 02:06:14.760
In the past what I would be
doing is rifling through my

02:06:14.760 --> 02:06:17.320
backpack for the reservation so
that I could tell the taxi

02:06:17.320 --> 02:06:21.010
driver where my hotel was.

02:06:21.010 --> 02:06:22.950
But Google Now has just
the right information

02:06:22.950 --> 02:06:24.770
just when I need it.

02:06:24.770 --> 02:06:30.990
So I can swipe in, see my
reservation at the W. I scroll

02:06:30.990 --> 02:06:33.670
down, I see my reminder
to call Katie.

02:06:33.670 --> 02:06:35.430
So I've talked to
the taxi driver.

02:06:35.430 --> 02:06:36.550
I've talked to my
friend Katie.

02:06:36.550 --> 02:06:38.090
I'm just sitting back.

02:06:38.090 --> 02:06:40.030
I'm so excited to be
back in New York.

02:06:40.030 --> 02:06:43.280
I'm remembering the trip I had
last year when I took my kids

02:06:43.280 --> 02:06:45.430
around, when they met
my friend Katie.

02:06:45.430 --> 02:06:49.270
I'd love to show Katie the
pictures from this last trip.

02:06:49.270 --> 02:06:51.770
Now, for my final demo, wouldn't
it be great if I

02:06:51.770 --> 02:06:53.020
could just ask Google?

02:06:55.430 --> 02:06:57.730
Show me my pictures from
New York last year.

02:07:02.600 --> 02:07:04.480
Oh, and those are my pictures
from New York.

02:07:12.250 --> 02:07:14.440
And there's Katie reading
a book to my kids.

02:07:17.810 --> 02:07:20.130
These are the building blocks
and the experiences Amit was

02:07:20.130 --> 02:07:21.410
talking about.

02:07:21.410 --> 02:07:24.330
I hope you are starting to see
how it's all coming together.

02:07:24.330 --> 02:07:27.602
With that, let's welcome
Amit back on stage.

02:07:27.602 --> 02:07:34.680
[APPLAUSE]

02:07:34.680 --> 02:07:36.070
AMIT SINGHAL: Thank
you, Johanna.

02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:40.240
I'm incredibly proud of the
search experience that we are

02:07:40.240 --> 02:07:43.740
building and tremendously
excited to bring it to

02:07:43.740 --> 02:07:47.170
hundreds of millions of people
around the world on the

02:07:47.170 --> 02:07:49.900
devices they rely
on every day.

02:07:49.900 --> 02:07:52.590
It's important to remember,
though, this experience is

02:07:52.590 --> 02:07:54.130
rapidly developing.

02:07:54.130 --> 02:07:56.520
And it will take some time
before it becomes the

02:07:56.520 --> 02:07:58.860
predominant search experience.

02:07:58.860 --> 02:08:03.030
There are several complex and
unsolved scientific problems

02:08:03.030 --> 02:08:06.910
that we will have to solve
before we get there.

02:08:06.910 --> 02:08:10.980
But our investment and
commitment to getting there

02:08:10.980 --> 02:08:14.440
sooner rather than
later is immense.

02:08:14.440 --> 02:08:17.910
The announcements today are
a really good sign of the

02:08:17.910 --> 02:08:20.270
progress we have made.

02:08:20.270 --> 02:08:23.180
With more features in the
Knowledge Graph and more

02:08:23.180 --> 02:08:26.930
languages, conversational voice
search and hot wording

02:08:26.930 --> 02:08:31.230
coming to Chrome on desktops
and laptops, and new Now

02:08:31.230 --> 02:08:34.650
functionality including
reminders and various other

02:08:34.650 --> 02:08:38.610
cards, Search is really
becoming a beautiful

02:08:38.610 --> 02:08:42.740
ubiquitous experience that
intelligently answers your

02:08:42.740 --> 02:08:45.770
questions and assists
you throughout the

02:08:45.770 --> 02:08:49.070
day across all screens.

02:08:49.070 --> 02:08:53.390
The idea of building such a
powerful means of getting

02:08:53.390 --> 02:08:58.920
knowledge to the world is what
inspires us every day.

02:08:58.920 --> 02:09:02.250
With the simple touch of a
mike, from the Queen of

02:09:02.250 --> 02:09:07.600
England to the most humble
farmer in Africa, from the

02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:12.550
developer who just joined the
Glass Explorer program to that

02:09:12.550 --> 02:09:16.840
the mother in a rural village
in India who just got her

02:09:16.840 --> 02:09:23.470
first basic smartphone, everyone
can easily access all

02:09:23.470 --> 02:09:29.880
of humanity's information and
get what they need to improve

02:09:29.880 --> 02:09:32.900
their and their family's
lives.

02:09:32.900 --> 02:09:37.200
That, my friends, is the power
of the new search experience

02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:39.770
that we are building
at Google.

02:09:39.770 --> 02:09:44.240
And it will change how you and
I experience this beautiful

02:09:44.240 --> 02:09:46.870
journey that we call life.

02:09:46.870 --> 02:09:49.187
Thank you.

02:09:49.187 --> 02:09:59.460
[APPLAUSE]

02:09:59.460 --> 02:10:01.120
AMIT SINGHAL: And so we have
talked about the future of

02:10:01.120 --> 02:10:04.650
search and how it's changing
right before our eyes.

02:10:04.650 --> 02:10:08.830
And we know that a perfect map
of the word is foundational to

02:10:08.830 --> 02:10:12.990
delivering exactly what you
want, when you want it, and

02:10:12.990 --> 02:10:14.620
where you want it.

02:10:14.620 --> 02:10:18.050
So I'd like to turn it over to
Brian McClendon to talk about

02:10:18.050 --> 02:10:21.265
the future of Google Maps.

02:10:21.265 --> 02:10:27.930
[MUSIC PLAYING]

02:10:27.930 --> 02:10:31.220
BRIAN MCCLENDON: Thank
you very much.

02:10:31.220 --> 02:10:32.540
Hi.

02:10:32.540 --> 02:10:36.320
I'm Brian McClendon and I lead
the Maps team here at Google.

02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:38.850
Google Maps help you navigate
from place to place.

02:10:38.850 --> 02:10:41.270
But it also helps you explore
and discover the

02:10:41.270 --> 02:10:42.730
world around you.

02:10:42.730 --> 02:10:44.660
Today we're going to talk about
the future of Google

02:10:44.660 --> 02:10:46.800
Maps and where it's going.

02:10:46.800 --> 02:10:48.810
But to talk about the future,
I need to talk a little bit

02:10:48.810 --> 02:10:49.960
about the past.

02:10:49.960 --> 02:10:52.850
Back in 2005 Maps was
a problematic

02:10:52.850 --> 02:10:54.080
experience on the internet.

02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:57.380
It was very slow, 10 to 20
seconds fora a map, multiple

02:10:57.380 --> 02:10:59.330
boxes you had to type
things into.

02:10:59.330 --> 02:11:01.500
Google Maps came up with the
idea of pre rendering the map

02:11:01.500 --> 02:11:04.110
tiles, providing that single
search box, and making a

02:11:04.110 --> 02:11:05.900
smooth, fluid experience.

02:11:05.900 --> 02:11:06.520
And we launched.

02:11:06.520 --> 02:11:08.930
And many people were very
excited about it.

02:11:08.930 --> 02:11:10.500
But Europeans had a
bit of an issue.

02:11:10.500 --> 02:11:11.940
And they sent this
screen shot.

02:11:11.940 --> 02:11:14.070
We had launched with only
part of the world.

02:11:14.070 --> 02:11:16.210
[LAUGHTER]

02:11:16.210 --> 02:11:17.900
BRIAN MCCLENDON: And it shows
the data is very important.

02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:19.390
We worked incredibly hard.

02:11:19.390 --> 02:11:22.430
And by 2008 we had licensed
data and had turn by turn

02:11:22.430 --> 02:11:24.280
directions in 22 countries.

02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:27.290
But we discovered that keeping
data up to date was very hard.

02:11:27.290 --> 02:11:29.920
We created a project called
Ground Truth.

02:11:29.920 --> 02:11:32.360
Ground Truth is taking
authoritative data sources,

02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:35.560
combining with all of the
process and algorithms at

02:11:35.560 --> 02:11:39.020
Google, and making the best data
set we can possibly make.

02:11:39.020 --> 02:11:41.780
Recently we launched two more
countries, Thailand and

02:11:41.780 --> 02:11:45.530
Indonesia, bringing it to a
total of 43 countries overall

02:11:45.530 --> 02:11:47.280
with the Ground Truth data.

02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:48.980
But this doesn't cover
the whole world.

02:11:48.980 --> 02:11:51.140
In many cases, countries
didn't have good maps.

02:11:51.140 --> 02:11:53.180
We created a tool called
map maker.

02:11:53.180 --> 02:11:56.430
Map maker allows users to
contribute their data and make

02:11:56.430 --> 02:11:57.370
the best maps they can.

02:11:57.370 --> 02:12:00.110
And in some cases, those maps
are now the best maps that

02:12:00.110 --> 02:12:01.360
country has anywhere.

02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:05.100
And that's helped us cover 199
countries around the world.

02:12:05.100 --> 02:12:06.680
But there's one country
that was missing.

02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:08.030
We had some of it
in map maker.

02:12:08.030 --> 02:12:10.320
But just very recently
we published North

02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:15.030
Korea, making 200.

02:12:15.030 --> 02:12:17.240
Now, you can take a
look at what North

02:12:17.240 --> 02:12:19.090
Korea looked like before.

02:12:19.090 --> 02:12:23.920
We just had this river
and the city name.

02:12:23.920 --> 02:12:26.780
But adding all of the detail
for Google, actually having

02:12:26.780 --> 02:12:30.220
people tell us the POI's, the
places, the parks, the

02:12:30.220 --> 02:12:33.320
neighborhoods, the street, gives
it so much more depth.

02:12:33.320 --> 02:12:34.960
And there's another thing you
see on this map that was

02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:36.120
really important to us.

02:12:36.120 --> 02:12:38.910
Geocoded photos changed the
experience of everything.

02:12:38.910 --> 02:12:41.640
They allow you to dip into a
place and really get a sense

02:12:41.640 --> 02:12:43.180
of the place exactly.

02:12:43.180 --> 02:12:45.790
And those Geocoded photos
inspired us.

02:12:45.790 --> 02:12:48.840
And in 2007 we launched a
product called Street View

02:12:48.840 --> 02:12:51.080
which actually created
these big panoramas.

02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:54.100
And we launched it in seven
cities in the United States.

02:12:54.100 --> 02:12:56.250
But those seven cities
weren't enough.

02:12:56.250 --> 02:12:57.340
Recently we launched two more

02:12:57.340 --> 02:12:59.100
countries, Hungary and Lesotho.

02:12:59.100 --> 02:13:02.290
And we now have 50 countries
around the world covered with

02:13:02.290 --> 02:13:03.430
Street View imagery.

02:13:03.430 --> 02:13:06.540
We've driven 5 million miles
with these cars.

02:13:06.540 --> 02:13:09.690
But we haven't just taken
Street View on the road.

02:13:09.690 --> 02:13:12.330
We've taken it on trains
up the Swiss Alps.

02:13:12.330 --> 02:13:14.840
We've taken it down the
Amazon on a boat.

02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:17.900
And even added beautiful imagery
from the Great Barrier

02:13:17.900 --> 02:13:20.430
Reef and other places
around the ocean.

02:13:20.430 --> 02:13:23.370
And as you can see here, this
is an incredibly immersive

02:13:23.370 --> 02:13:25.280
experience.

02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:29.300
So being able to go here, unless
you're a snorkeler or

02:13:29.300 --> 02:13:31.430
scuba diver, you'll never
visit this place.

02:13:31.430 --> 02:13:35.020
But you can really get a taste
of how the different places

02:13:35.020 --> 02:13:37.720
look and preview the
place overall.

02:13:37.720 --> 02:13:40.670
This was the imagination that
created Google Earth in the

02:13:40.670 --> 02:13:41.600
first place.

02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:43.430
Imagery is very important
to us.

02:13:43.430 --> 02:13:46.170
And we've been working with
satellite imagery and aerial

02:13:46.170 --> 02:13:47.730
imagery for a long time.

02:13:47.730 --> 02:13:51.610
But in 2012 we started
generating new data from our

02:13:51.610 --> 02:13:53.060
existing aerial imagery.

02:13:53.060 --> 02:13:55.900
Combining oblique images, many
different photographs from

02:13:55.900 --> 02:13:58.440
around a building, we're
actually able to generate 3D

02:13:58.440 --> 02:14:00.240
geometry of large,
urban cores.

02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:03.250
And we're now covering far more
places with 3D buildings

02:14:03.250 --> 02:14:05.090
than we ever had before.

02:14:05.090 --> 02:14:08.570
This idea of generating data
from other data is fundamental

02:14:08.570 --> 02:14:10.120
to what Google does.

02:14:10.120 --> 02:14:12.670
We have so many different
sources of it that there are

02:14:12.670 --> 02:14:15.350
also so many different kinds
of areas you can have.

02:14:15.350 --> 02:14:16.730
We have the base maps.

02:14:16.730 --> 02:14:19.570
We have Street View drivers with
GPS tracks of their cars.

02:14:19.570 --> 02:14:22.940
We have images from Street View,
Satellite, aerial, those

02:14:22.940 --> 02:14:25.100
3D buildings I talked about,
and also terrain

02:14:25.100 --> 02:14:26.460
data that we generated.

02:14:26.460 --> 02:14:28.920
Each one of them is good
but can be improved in

02:14:28.920 --> 02:14:29.640
combination.

02:14:29.640 --> 02:14:31.560
And this combination, it's
called bundle adjusting.

02:14:31.560 --> 02:14:33.820
And it's incredibly important
to improving the quality of

02:14:33.820 --> 02:14:35.220
Maps overall.

02:14:35.220 --> 02:14:37.000
You know, one of the best
examples of this is our local

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:38.250
business data.

02:14:38.250 --> 02:14:40.600
Locating local businesses
precisely is

02:14:40.600 --> 02:14:41.880
actually pretty hard.

02:14:41.880 --> 02:14:44.840
But using Street View,
computer vision, and

02:14:44.840 --> 02:14:47.970
algorithms we now have over 40
million precise geocodes

02:14:47.970 --> 02:14:50.860
locating these businesses around
the world, making ours

02:14:50.860 --> 02:14:54.000
the most comprehensive data set
of precisely located local

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:55.350
businesses.

02:14:55.350 --> 02:14:59.410
So this data is at the basis of
everything that Google does

02:14:59.410 --> 02:15:00.800
with its products.

02:15:00.800 --> 02:15:03.230
But it's also at the basis of
everything that you do.

02:15:03.230 --> 02:15:06.370
In 2005 Google Maps
API launched.

02:15:06.370 --> 02:15:10.620
But in the last year we've had
30% year over year growth.

02:15:10.620 --> 02:15:13.080
And today, I'd like to announce
we have over one

02:15:13.080 --> 02:15:17.320
million websites using Google
Maps in their site and

02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:19.284
improving their site.

02:15:19.284 --> 02:15:24.260
[APPLAUSE]

02:15:24.260 --> 02:15:26.820
BRIAN MCCLENDON: These sites are
visited by over a billion

02:15:26.820 --> 02:15:30.790
people every week and actually
get more use than Google Maps

02:15:30.790 --> 02:15:32.500
does on Google products alone.

02:15:32.500 --> 02:15:34.470
So Google Maps API is incredibly
important to us.

02:15:34.470 --> 02:15:37.810
And it's thanks to people like
you who've added their Google

02:15:37.810 --> 02:15:40.100
Maps to the power of
their application.

02:15:40.100 --> 02:15:42.550
Now, obviously applications
are important to you.

02:15:42.550 --> 02:15:44.910
And you heard about Hugo
introducing the various mobile

02:15:44.910 --> 02:15:46.950
APIs for Android.

02:15:46.950 --> 02:15:50.130
And they have really improved
things with user location and

02:15:50.130 --> 02:15:52.450
the Android SDK for Maps V2.

02:15:52.450 --> 02:15:55.520
We also have Google
Maps SDK for iOS.

02:15:55.520 --> 02:15:59.570
And being able to bring Google
Maps 3D camera motion and

02:15:59.570 --> 02:16:01.810
fluid motion into your
applications, I think, has

02:16:01.810 --> 02:16:03.510
changed a lot of the
applications around.

02:16:03.510 --> 02:16:05.270
And the uptake has
been incredible.

02:16:05.270 --> 02:16:07.660
I'd like to quickly introduce
the 17 sessions that we're

02:16:07.660 --> 02:16:09.270
going to have in the Google
Maps track over the next

02:16:09.270 --> 02:16:12.500
couple of days and highlight
one thing in particular.

02:16:12.500 --> 02:16:14.100
There's a product called Google
Maps Engine that you

02:16:14.100 --> 02:16:17.520
may have heard of, uploading
your data into the cloud.

02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:20.250
If you can do that, you can
serve your data to everybody

02:16:20.250 --> 02:16:22.615
with the same performance and
quality and integrate it with

02:16:22.615 --> 02:16:24.240
the Google Maps experience.

02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:26.750
And with the Google Maps API,
you can actually have your

02:16:26.750 --> 02:16:29.820
applications read and write
that data set and really

02:16:29.820 --> 02:16:31.430
change how things work.

02:16:31.430 --> 02:16:34.100
But now I'd like to introduce
Daniel Graf, who is going to

02:16:34.100 --> 02:16:37.710
talk about the next generation
of Google Maps for mobile.

02:16:37.710 --> 02:16:39.180
Daniel.

02:16:39.180 --> 02:16:50.459
[MUSIC PLAYING]

02:16:50.459 --> 02:16:51.609
DANIEL GRAF: Thank you, Brian.

02:16:51.609 --> 02:16:53.030
Hi, everyone.

02:16:53.030 --> 02:16:56.040
I know when it comes to mobile
phones, everyone in here is

02:16:56.040 --> 02:16:57.870
probably here for Android.

02:16:57.870 --> 02:17:01.990
But as most of you probably
heard last December, we

02:17:01.990 --> 02:17:04.879
launched Google Maps
on the iPhone.

02:17:04.879 --> 02:17:07.110
It has been a tremendous
success.

02:17:07.110 --> 02:17:08.940
The feedback has been
very positive.

02:17:08.940 --> 02:17:12.280
People called it sleek,
simple, beautiful.

02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:14.629
And let's not forget,
accurate.

02:17:14.629 --> 02:17:20.870
[LAUGHTER]

02:17:20.870 --> 02:17:23.389
DANIEL GRAF: So if you're an
iPhone user, you don't have it

02:17:23.389 --> 02:17:25.790
on your phone yet, go
to the app store.

02:17:25.790 --> 02:17:27.200
Download it today.

02:17:27.200 --> 02:17:30.270
Brian talked a lot about the
power of Google Maps data.

02:17:30.270 --> 02:17:33.400
He mentioned we're going beyond
just directions and

02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:34.680
navigation.

02:17:34.680 --> 02:17:38.700
Maps are also about exploring
and discovering places.

02:17:38.700 --> 02:17:40.760
And no where is that
more critical

02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:42.540
than on a mobile phone.

02:17:42.540 --> 02:17:45.330
Today we're going to announce
and we're going to give you a

02:17:45.330 --> 02:17:48.969
sneak preview of the next major
release from Google Maps

02:17:48.969 --> 02:17:54.370
for mobile coming to enjoy
and, of course, iOS.

02:17:54.370 --> 02:17:55.959
For that we're going
to take a little

02:17:55.959 --> 02:17:57.990
stroll through San Francisco.

02:17:57.990 --> 02:18:01.209
I'm going to start here
on my Nexus 4.

02:18:01.209 --> 02:18:06.670
And, as you can see, when I
start this it's a brand new

02:18:06.670 --> 02:18:08.740
design, a new look.

02:18:08.740 --> 02:18:10.870
And actually we're at Moscone.

02:18:10.870 --> 02:18:13.040
I can zoom in.

02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:16.700
I can see all the beautiful 3D
buildings, which we also saw

02:18:16.700 --> 02:18:18.959
in the Android demo before.

02:18:18.959 --> 02:18:22.480
But for now, as I mentioned,
sometimes it's about what is

02:18:22.480 --> 02:18:23.930
the right place to go.

02:18:23.930 --> 02:18:27.510
So at the moment, let's say I'm
in the mood for Burmese

02:18:27.510 --> 02:18:30.480
food and here in
San Francisco.

02:18:30.480 --> 02:18:33.780
So I'm just going to search
for Burmese food.

02:18:33.780 --> 02:18:37.326
And when you look at the
results, the first result we

02:18:37.326 --> 02:18:39.780
get is Burma SuperStar
has a 4.0

02:18:39.780 --> 02:18:42.000
rating, over 1,000 reviews.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:43.930
Well, I want to find out more.

02:18:43.930 --> 02:18:46.219
I actually see my friend,
Salahuddin.

02:18:46.219 --> 02:18:48.389
He rated it five stars.

02:18:48.389 --> 02:18:49.760
I trust his taste.

02:18:49.760 --> 02:18:50.950
So I want to look
a little more.

02:18:50.950 --> 02:18:52.270
I just swipe down.

02:18:52.270 --> 02:18:54.360
I have different imagery
I can look at.

02:18:54.360 --> 02:18:56.730
Of course, once you go there,
you can rate and review.

02:18:56.730 --> 02:18:58.620
You can upload photos.

02:18:58.620 --> 02:19:01.450
And as some of you, here
I have different

02:19:01.450 --> 02:19:02.660
reviews I can see.

02:19:02.660 --> 02:19:05.450
And some of you noticed
here, there's a rating

02:19:05.450 --> 02:19:07.469
scale of 4.0 there.

02:19:07.469 --> 02:19:10.530
So today we're going to announce
a new five point

02:19:10.530 --> 02:19:13.910
rating scale across all Google
Maps products, so if you

02:19:13.910 --> 02:19:17.889
search for a restaurant on
google.com or if you use Maps

02:19:17.889 --> 02:19:20.790
on the desktop or on
a mobile phone.

02:19:20.790 --> 02:19:23.820
Now I want to go to a
different use case.

02:19:23.820 --> 02:19:25.740
And it's actually quite
a common one.

02:19:25.740 --> 02:19:28.139
Now, how often have you
searched for pizza?

02:19:28.139 --> 02:19:29.219
That's what we're going to do.

02:19:29.219 --> 02:19:32.360
And we're going to do it this
time in the Mission District.

02:19:32.360 --> 02:19:36.389
And let's see where we are.

02:19:36.389 --> 02:19:38.660
Let's see what results
we're getting here.

02:19:38.660 --> 02:19:41.360
And no surprise, we're getting
a lot of results.

02:19:41.360 --> 02:19:43.090
And with this new UI,
it's very easy to

02:19:43.090 --> 02:19:43.990
browse through it.

02:19:43.990 --> 02:19:46.370
I can just swipe to
different results.

02:19:46.370 --> 02:19:49.680
I can bring up the details
and look at is this a

02:19:49.680 --> 02:19:50.630
good place to go.

02:19:50.630 --> 02:19:52.240
But something caught
my eye here.

02:19:52.240 --> 02:19:53.530
It's the Zagat badge.

02:19:53.530 --> 02:19:55.020
What does that mean?

02:19:55.020 --> 02:19:57.540
And before we looked
at user reviews

02:19:57.540 --> 02:19:59.410
and my friends reviews.

02:19:59.410 --> 02:20:01.260
But sometimes you want
to have a trusted

02:20:01.260 --> 02:20:02.950
opinion from an expert.

02:20:02.950 --> 02:20:07.120
We integrated a brand new
Zagat experience.

02:20:07.120 --> 02:20:11.910
And, as you know, Zagat is one
of the most trusted brands on

02:20:11.910 --> 02:20:14.840
opinions about restaurants
and places to go.

02:20:14.840 --> 02:20:16.260
Here you see little cart.

02:20:16.260 --> 02:20:19.870
And you see the pizzeria Delfina
is actually on a list

02:20:19.870 --> 02:20:22.680
called restaurants worth the
wait in San Francisco.

02:20:22.680 --> 02:20:25.440
I can also get all the details,
such as the editorial

02:20:25.440 --> 02:20:28.060
review from Zagat and
the Zagat scores.

02:20:28.060 --> 02:20:32.680
So sometimes it's important to
get a trusted expert to tell

02:20:32.680 --> 02:20:35.080
you, hey, this is a
place you can go.

02:20:35.080 --> 02:20:40.290
Now it has been quite a long
morning, an exciting morning.

02:20:40.290 --> 02:20:43.380
But I'm going go back to where
we are right now around

02:20:43.380 --> 02:20:47.130
Moscone and downtown here
in San Francisco.

02:20:47.130 --> 02:20:49.450
And what I'm going to look
for is I'm in the

02:20:49.450 --> 02:20:50.820
mood for some coffee.

02:20:50.820 --> 02:20:53.980
So I'm going to search
for coffee.

02:20:53.980 --> 02:20:56.440
And let's see what the
results are here.

02:20:56.440 --> 02:21:00.820
And, for example, well, first
result, surprise, surprise.

02:21:00.820 --> 02:21:02.530
There's a lot of Starbucks
in town.

02:21:02.530 --> 02:21:03.335
Has a high rating.

02:21:03.335 --> 02:21:07.130
And something else caught
my eye here, an offer.

02:21:07.130 --> 02:21:08.380
Let's have a look at it.

02:21:08.380 --> 02:21:11.440
And actually we have integrated
here a brand new

02:21:11.440 --> 02:21:14.740
offers experience with great
deals from some of the world's

02:21:14.740 --> 02:21:15.710
best brands.

02:21:15.710 --> 02:21:17.390
In this example, this
is Starbucks.

02:21:17.390 --> 02:21:20.000
And as we see, they're
introducing a new drink,

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.780
Starbucks Refreshers
this afternoon.

02:21:22.780 --> 02:21:23.910
Half price off.

02:21:23.910 --> 02:21:24.880
Please don't run there.

02:21:24.880 --> 02:21:26.400
I'm giving you a preview here.

02:21:26.400 --> 02:21:29.610
And if we go in there,
I can get the

02:21:29.610 --> 02:21:31.270
details about the offer.

02:21:31.270 --> 02:21:33.340
And then I can save it
for later as well.

02:21:33.340 --> 02:21:35.640
So we see here the
offer about it.

02:21:35.640 --> 02:21:37.460
I use it later.

02:21:37.460 --> 02:21:40.340
And then I can go this afternoon
if I want to.

02:21:40.340 --> 02:21:42.840
We have many launch partners
beyond Starbucks.

02:21:42.840 --> 02:21:44.790
And there's many more to come.

02:21:44.790 --> 02:21:47.240
This is the new offers
experience in

02:21:47.240 --> 02:21:49.230
Google Maps for mobile.

02:21:49.230 --> 02:21:53.890
So now I want to talk a little
bit about directions.

02:21:53.890 --> 02:21:56.680
And a lot of you are using
public transport.

02:21:56.680 --> 02:21:59.460
I know that when I look
at our numbers.

02:21:59.460 --> 02:22:03.110
We have currently over a million
transit stops in the

02:22:03.110 --> 02:22:04.930
whole world which we cover.

02:22:04.930 --> 02:22:07.900
And for those who are using
cars or ride around with

02:22:07.900 --> 02:22:12.150
bicycles, 50 billion kilometers
of turn by turn

02:22:12.150 --> 02:22:13.330
directions.

02:22:13.330 --> 02:22:16.130
Imagine, 15 billion
kilometers.

02:22:16.130 --> 02:22:19.700
Today we're going to announce
several new key features to

02:22:19.700 --> 02:22:22.540
make your navigation experience
even better.

02:22:22.540 --> 02:22:25.620
For example, we have a revamped
incident experience.

02:22:25.620 --> 02:22:29.460
We're adding live coverage
of incidents from

02:22:29.460 --> 02:22:31.010
all around the world.

02:22:31.010 --> 02:22:33.740
So in traffic view, for example,
you can see in real

02:22:33.740 --> 02:22:35.840
time incident alerts.

02:22:35.840 --> 02:22:40.120
You can just tap on it to see
details and then you know

02:22:40.120 --> 02:22:40.500
what's going on.

02:22:40.500 --> 02:22:44.380
Even cooler, another feature
is dynamic rerouting.

02:22:44.380 --> 02:22:49.020
Let's say you're driving along
your route and something

02:22:49.020 --> 02:22:50.090
happens ahead of you.

02:22:50.090 --> 02:22:51.590
The conditions worsen.

02:22:51.590 --> 02:22:54.460
Google gives you an early
warning and it tells you, hey,

02:22:54.460 --> 02:22:56.480
there's a better
route to take.

02:22:56.480 --> 02:23:00.620
So this was the next generation
of Google Maps for

02:23:00.620 --> 02:23:02.010
smartphones.

02:23:02.010 --> 02:23:03.440
And--

02:23:03.440 --> 02:23:04.388
thank you.

02:23:04.388 --> 02:23:07.740
[APPLAUSE]

02:23:07.740 --> 02:23:13.380
DANIEL GRAF: As we all know,
mobile today is not just about

02:23:13.380 --> 02:23:15.010
smartphones.

02:23:15.010 --> 02:23:16.790
Should we go a little bigger?

02:23:16.790 --> 02:23:18.410
Screen size?

02:23:18.410 --> 02:23:24.520
So I'm very happy to announce
today that we have a brand new

02:23:24.520 --> 02:23:27.900
fully dedicated tablet
Maps experience.

02:23:27.900 --> 02:23:29.380
And we're going to have
a little look here.

02:23:29.380 --> 02:23:31.650
So we're still here
in San Francisco.

02:23:31.650 --> 02:23:33.860
I'm going to scroll around
a little bit.

02:23:33.860 --> 02:23:35.330
And actually we are
here downtown.

02:23:35.330 --> 02:23:37.000
Here's something pretty cool.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:38.850
And, by the way, all the
features you have seen on the

02:23:38.850 --> 02:23:41.080
smartphone and on the tablet,
they work vice

02:23:41.080 --> 02:23:42.760
versa on both platforms.

02:23:42.760 --> 02:23:43.880
Here we're at Macy's.

02:23:43.880 --> 02:23:44.980
We have indoors.

02:23:44.980 --> 02:23:48.070
We have tens of thousands of
places in the world where you

02:23:48.070 --> 02:23:51.750
can see into the buildings and
see what stores are there,

02:23:51.750 --> 02:23:53.410
what you can find out
there, what's

02:23:53.410 --> 02:23:54.710
going on in those buildings.

02:23:54.710 --> 02:23:57.580
But sometimes you don't
really know what

02:23:57.580 --> 02:23:58.400
you're in the mood for.

02:23:58.400 --> 02:24:00.220
You're like entertain
me, show me.

02:24:00.220 --> 02:24:02.080
What can I discover
in San Francisco?

02:24:02.080 --> 02:24:03.320
I'm visiting here.

02:24:03.320 --> 02:24:05.420
So you're not typing
in a search query.

02:24:05.420 --> 02:24:07.760
All you do is-- and this
is a new experience.

02:24:07.760 --> 02:24:09.230
You say let's explore.

02:24:09.230 --> 02:24:11.900
And it's a beautiful explore
experience where you can say,

02:24:11.900 --> 02:24:15.760
I'm in a mood to eat something,
to drink, to shop.

02:24:15.760 --> 02:24:17.020
[APPLAUSE]

02:24:17.020 --> 02:24:19.130
DANIEL GRAF: It's a little
early to sleep right now.

02:24:19.130 --> 02:24:20.970
So I would say, let's play.

02:24:20.970 --> 02:24:22.440
Let's get entertained.

02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:25.580
And when I go through this, I
can go to museums, to public

02:24:25.580 --> 02:24:26.880
parks, and--

02:24:26.880 --> 02:24:30.170
well, let's take one you
probably heard before, the

02:24:30.170 --> 02:24:31.360
Golden Gate Bridge.

02:24:31.360 --> 02:24:33.520
Very high rating, 4.6.

02:24:33.520 --> 02:24:36.540
As you get all the details here
and just at the touch of

02:24:36.540 --> 02:24:39.580
a button, you want to see
how it looks like there.

02:24:39.580 --> 02:24:41.180
You have the Street
View experience.

02:24:41.180 --> 02:24:43.880
And, of course, it's very easy
to go there afterwards.

02:24:43.880 --> 02:24:47.440
So this is a new way to explore
and discover your

02:24:47.440 --> 02:24:49.290
surroundings.

02:24:49.290 --> 02:24:50.300
There you have it.

02:24:50.300 --> 02:24:53.440
So these were just a few of the
new features for Google

02:24:53.440 --> 02:24:55.030
Maps for mobile.

02:24:55.030 --> 02:24:57.030
It's a brand new experience.

02:24:57.030 --> 02:24:59.700
And as I mentioned, we emphasize
a lot on discovery,

02:24:59.700 --> 02:25:03.340
exploration, better navigation,
and a beautiful

02:25:03.340 --> 02:25:05.030
new design.

02:25:05.030 --> 02:25:08.510
We are truly excited about
this new product.

02:25:08.510 --> 02:25:12.890
It's coming to your Android
devices and your iOS devices,

02:25:12.890 --> 02:25:16.410
smartphones, and tablets
this summer.

02:25:16.410 --> 02:25:19.524
It's pretty cool, right?

02:25:19.524 --> 02:25:21.332
[APPLAUSE]

02:25:21.332 --> 02:25:21.784
DANIEL GRAF: Thanks.

02:25:21.784 --> 02:25:25.070
But where are we going to go
next with Google Maps?

02:25:25.070 --> 02:25:29.060
As Brian mentioned earlier on,
Google Maps launched in 2005.

02:25:29.060 --> 02:25:32.820
We currently have over a billion
users every month

02:25:32.820 --> 02:25:34.480
using our products.

02:25:34.480 --> 02:25:36.740
And as you all know,
Google Maps has

02:25:36.740 --> 02:25:39.380
defined modern mapping.

02:25:39.380 --> 02:25:42.740
And we're about to reinvent
it again.

02:25:42.740 --> 02:25:45.560
And for that I want to introduce
Berni and Jonah.

02:25:45.560 --> 02:25:47.790
And they're going to tell you
a little bit more about the

02:25:47.790 --> 02:25:49.380
future of Google Maps.

02:25:49.380 --> 02:25:51.200
Berni, Jonah.

02:25:51.200 --> 02:25:56.000
[APPLAUSE]

02:25:59.370 --> 02:26:01.480
BERNI SEEFELD: Remember
the first time

02:26:01.480 --> 02:26:03.560
you used Google Maps.

02:26:03.560 --> 02:26:07.390
And now imagine that
same feeling again.

02:26:07.390 --> 02:26:09.970
We have been working on
something that we believe

02:26:09.970 --> 02:26:11.980
that's just that.

02:26:11.980 --> 02:26:15.250
We looked at we have today
and we saw there's

02:26:15.250 --> 02:26:17.410
three things missing.

02:26:17.410 --> 02:26:22.250
Number one, you and me and
everybody else, we look at the

02:26:22.250 --> 02:26:24.170
exact same map.

02:26:24.170 --> 02:26:28.350
Wouldn't it be awesome if you
could build billions of maps,

02:26:28.350 --> 02:26:30.610
one for every user?

02:26:30.610 --> 02:26:35.490
And not only that, a map that
adapts to what you do, a map

02:26:35.490 --> 02:26:37.330
built for you.

02:26:37.330 --> 02:26:41.610
And number two, Google has all
this imagery, from satellite

02:26:41.610 --> 02:26:44.950
to streets, indoors, and
even under water.

02:26:44.950 --> 02:26:47.630
Wouldn't it be cool if you could
bring this all together

02:26:47.630 --> 02:26:52.670
into one experience that would
be fun and easy to explore?

02:26:52.670 --> 02:26:56.610
And number three, what if you
could make everything simpler

02:26:56.610 --> 02:26:59.910
and more powerful by coming
up with whole new ways to

02:26:59.910 --> 02:27:01.960
interact with the map
itself, making

02:27:01.960 --> 02:27:04.640
that map-to-user interface.

02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:08.230
With these three principles and
our great data foundation,

02:27:08.230 --> 02:27:14.120
we went ahead and rebuilt Google
Maps on the ground up.

02:27:14.120 --> 02:27:16.020
Jonah, show us how it looks.

02:27:16.020 --> 02:27:18.834
JONAH JONES: This is the
new Google Maps.

02:27:18.834 --> 02:27:24.500
[APPLAUSE]

02:27:24.500 --> 02:27:26.220
JONAH JONES: Focusing the design
and the interactions on

02:27:26.220 --> 02:27:28.210
the map had made everything
simpler and a

02:27:28.210 --> 02:27:29.760
real pleasure to use.

02:27:29.760 --> 02:27:31.810
The map is rich and
beautiful with

02:27:31.810 --> 02:27:35.000
vibrant colors and textures.

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.330
BERNI SEEFELD: So this is a
computer running Chrome.

02:27:37.330 --> 02:27:41.290
And we're using the latest open
standards like WebGL to

02:27:41.290 --> 02:27:44.450
make the experience really
smooth since snappy.

02:27:44.450 --> 02:27:47.990
These are vector maps
in a browser.

02:27:47.990 --> 02:27:50.360
So let me tell you
a little story.

02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:51.620
I just moved here about
a year ago.

02:27:51.620 --> 02:27:52.650
This is a nice neighborhood.

02:27:52.650 --> 02:27:55.680
And it was an exciting time as
I got to explore a new area.

02:27:55.680 --> 02:27:56.900
And I love exploring.

02:27:56.900 --> 02:27:59.080
And so one of the first things
I did was search for

02:27:59.080 --> 02:28:01.820
restaurants.

02:28:01.820 --> 02:28:04.990
And this is our new search
experience, no

02:28:04.990 --> 02:28:06.460
more just ten pins.

02:28:06.460 --> 02:28:09.850
All the results are labeled
directly on the map.

02:28:09.850 --> 02:28:13.100
This makes exploring really
fast and easy.

02:28:13.100 --> 02:28:16.270
And the top results, they come
with a useful description that

02:28:16.270 --> 02:28:18.700
gives you a flavor of the
place so you can make

02:28:18.700 --> 02:28:19.970
decisions very quickly.

02:28:22.810 --> 02:28:25.490
No need for cross referencing
Everything is right

02:28:25.490 --> 02:28:26.590
there on the map.

02:28:26.590 --> 02:28:29.390
The map is the user interface.

02:28:29.390 --> 02:28:31.650
Now, of course, there's this
other way how you can find

02:28:31.650 --> 02:28:32.950
restaurants.

02:28:32.950 --> 02:28:34.660
You can ask your friends.

02:28:34.660 --> 02:28:36.330
And now you can do
that directly in

02:28:36.330 --> 02:28:38.360
the new Google Maps.

02:28:38.360 --> 02:28:41.160
We added a filter.

02:28:41.160 --> 02:28:44.530
And now you see those search
results are the sushi places

02:28:44.530 --> 02:28:47.410
that my friends have reviewed,
like Kiji here that my friend

02:28:47.410 --> 02:28:50.130
Stephanie likes.

02:28:50.130 --> 02:28:52.150
And these are our new cards.

02:28:52.150 --> 02:28:56.020
They summarize everything that
is important about this place.

02:28:56.020 --> 02:28:58.580
But earlier I was talking
about imagery.

02:28:58.580 --> 02:29:01.020
And you see those
three photos.

02:29:01.020 --> 02:29:02.640
And I love this part.

02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:05.074
Let's take a closer look.

02:29:05.074 --> 02:29:13.536
[APPLAUSE]

02:29:13.536 --> 02:29:16.840
BERNI SEEFELD: We just flew into
our new immersive imagery

02:29:16.840 --> 02:29:17.795
experience.

02:29:17.795 --> 02:29:19.400
And it actually looks
like a great place.

02:29:19.400 --> 02:29:22.510
I might go there tonight.

02:29:22.510 --> 02:29:23.090
Let's head back out.

02:29:23.090 --> 02:29:24.380
Clear the search.

02:29:24.380 --> 02:29:27.910
So earlier I was saying this
map is built for you.

02:29:27.910 --> 02:29:30.510
Let me show you how
that works.

02:29:30.510 --> 02:29:32.960
So I've been living in this
area for about a year now.

02:29:32.960 --> 02:29:34.820
And I've done many,
many searches.

02:29:34.820 --> 02:29:37.436
I've reviewed places, starred
places, and I

02:29:37.436 --> 02:29:38.700
made great new friends.

02:29:38.700 --> 02:29:42.090
And my map got better
and better.

02:29:42.090 --> 02:29:45.610
The places you see on this map,
they are my landmarks.

02:29:45.610 --> 02:29:48.940
Like Frances here, that's one of
the first places I went to.

02:29:48.940 --> 02:29:49.680
It's a great restaurant.

02:29:49.680 --> 02:29:51.380
I love it and I keep
going back.

02:29:51.380 --> 02:29:53.880
So it's very important to me.

02:29:53.880 --> 02:29:56.500
And just the other day someone
told me about a bike shop and

02:29:56.500 --> 02:29:58.290
said it's right next
to Frances.

02:29:58.290 --> 02:30:00.100
And I knew exactly
where it is.

02:30:00.100 --> 02:30:03.910
It is a landmark for me and
that's why it's on my map.

02:30:03.910 --> 02:30:05.670
But it's a fairly small place.

02:30:05.670 --> 02:30:07.790
So it might not be
on Jonah's map.

02:30:07.790 --> 02:30:09.580
It might not be on your map.

02:30:09.580 --> 02:30:13.160
But it's a landmark for me,
and so it's on my map.

02:30:13.160 --> 02:30:16.510
And when you are logged in,
you get your map and we'll

02:30:16.510 --> 02:30:20.360
highlight everything that
is important to you.

02:30:20.360 --> 02:30:22.360
Now, it's not just about
all the places

02:30:22.360 --> 02:30:23.800
that I already know.

02:30:23.800 --> 02:30:26.610
A good friend of mine is in town
for I/O. And I thought we

02:30:26.610 --> 02:30:28.940
could try a new restaurant.

02:30:28.940 --> 02:30:32.250
My map is going to help
me with just that.

02:30:32.250 --> 02:30:35.070
See these places here, they
are recommendations.

02:30:35.070 --> 02:30:37.980
Like Bar Tartine shows
up because

02:30:37.980 --> 02:30:39.180
it's similar to Frances.

02:30:39.180 --> 02:30:42.210
And I looked like Frances so
it's a recommendation for me.

02:30:42.210 --> 02:30:44.390
And Foreign Cinema shows
up because my

02:30:44.390 --> 02:30:45.915
friend Anita likes it.

02:30:45.915 --> 02:30:48.910
So these two look like
great options.

02:30:48.910 --> 02:30:52.200
And this is how Google Maps
helps you discover new places

02:30:52.200 --> 02:30:54.640
without even having to search.

02:30:54.640 --> 02:30:58.860
So this is how we can build a
map for you using the same

02:30:58.860 --> 02:31:02.500
data as Google Now so it will
get better and better the more

02:31:02.500 --> 02:31:05.076
you use it.

02:31:05.076 --> 02:31:10.764
[APPLAUSE]

02:31:10.764 --> 02:31:12.110
BERNI SEEFELD: So that's
how we build a

02:31:12.110 --> 02:31:14.140
map for every person.

02:31:14.140 --> 02:31:17.585
Now let me show you how we build
a map for every place.

02:31:17.585 --> 02:31:21.925
So next weekend some friends
of mine from Italy are in

02:31:21.925 --> 02:31:24.060
town, and they have children.

02:31:24.060 --> 02:31:26.060
So I thought we could go
to the Randall Museum.

02:31:26.060 --> 02:31:28.700
It's near my home, and it's
really great for kids.

02:31:28.700 --> 02:31:30.700
But it's a little bit
tricky to get to.

02:31:30.700 --> 02:31:33.630
See, this little road here that
leads up to the museum,

02:31:33.630 --> 02:31:34.970
it's not even labeled.

02:31:34.970 --> 02:31:35.980
And that makes perfect sense.

02:31:35.980 --> 02:31:37.980
It's a very small unimportant
road.

02:31:37.980 --> 02:31:40.600
But it's important for
the Randall Museum.

02:31:40.600 --> 02:31:44.890
So watch what happens
when we click on it?

02:31:44.890 --> 02:31:48.350
Now the street is labeled and
all the other streets that

02:31:48.350 --> 02:31:51.034
lead to this place are
highlighted as well.

02:31:51.034 --> 02:31:56.710
[APPLAUSE]

02:31:56.710 --> 02:31:59.220
BERNI SEEFELD: Let's
have another look.

02:31:59.220 --> 02:32:02.140
Before, a regular map.

02:32:02.140 --> 02:32:06.520
And after the roads are
highlighted and labeled.

02:32:06.520 --> 02:32:08.670
This map makes it so much easier
to understand how to

02:32:08.670 --> 02:32:10.510
get to this place.

02:32:10.510 --> 02:32:13.060
So we can build a unique
map for every

02:32:13.060 --> 02:32:15.230
place on every click.

02:32:15.230 --> 02:32:16.708
Isn't that amazing?

02:32:16.708 --> 02:32:22.190
[APPLAUSE]

02:32:22.190 --> 02:32:23.990
BERNI SEEFELD: But I know my
friend's kids and they will

02:32:23.990 --> 02:32:26.140
definitely want to
explore more.

02:32:26.140 --> 02:32:28.710
Now that's going to be really
easy because now all the

02:32:28.710 --> 02:32:30.720
landmarks you see on
the map are related

02:32:30.720 --> 02:32:32.830
to the Randall Museum.

02:32:32.830 --> 02:32:34.780
And so they're all about
kids and museums.

02:32:34.780 --> 02:32:36.740
You can see the Cartoon
Art Museum.

02:32:36.740 --> 02:32:38.780
You can see the Walt
Disney Museum.

02:32:38.780 --> 02:32:41.600
And when we click on that, we
get a whole new map with new

02:32:41.600 --> 02:32:42.860
places to explore.

02:32:42.860 --> 02:32:44.180
So we can click on the
Exploratorium.

02:32:44.180 --> 02:32:45.220
And when we click on

02:32:45.220 --> 02:32:47.010
Exploratorium, another map appears.

02:32:47.010 --> 02:32:48.680
So we can keep going
and going.

02:32:48.680 --> 02:32:51.638
This is a great way to
explore new places.

02:32:51.638 --> 02:32:56.430
[APPLAUSE]

02:32:56.430 --> 02:32:57.550
BERNI SEEFELD: It's
really east, just

02:32:57.550 --> 02:32:58.670
clicking and clicking.

02:32:58.670 --> 02:33:00.780
So it's simple and powerful.

02:33:00.780 --> 02:33:04.370
The map is the user interface.

02:33:04.370 --> 02:33:06.320
So now let's see how
we can get there.

02:33:06.320 --> 02:33:08.480
So we could click here
on directions.

02:33:08.480 --> 02:33:11.950
But for the most common case
there's an even simpler way.

02:33:11.950 --> 02:33:14.120
See, my home is right
there on the map.

02:33:14.120 --> 02:33:16.390
And it says a 60 minute drive.

02:33:16.390 --> 02:33:18.860
So if I want to get directions
from my home, I can

02:33:18.860 --> 02:33:20.560
just click on that.

02:33:20.560 --> 02:33:23.592
And this is our new directions
experience.

02:33:23.592 --> 02:33:29.260
[APPLAUSE]

02:33:29.260 --> 02:33:31.140
BERNI SEEFELD: A great new
thing is that we directly

02:33:31.140 --> 02:33:34.225
compare driving with public
transit on the map.

02:33:34.225 --> 02:33:36.690
And that's going to be really
useful because this weekend we

02:33:36.690 --> 02:33:39.150
won't have a car.

02:33:39.150 --> 02:33:42.890
And we wanted to make public
transit much, much smarter.

02:33:42.890 --> 02:33:45.890
Before, we showed you the
next three departures.

02:33:45.890 --> 02:33:48.740
But now we are going to look
at every departure, every

02:33:48.740 --> 02:33:50.850
second, for the entire
next week and

02:33:50.850 --> 02:33:52.505
summarize that for you.

02:33:52.505 --> 02:33:55.990
So you can see here that you
can take any of these lines

02:33:55.990 --> 02:33:58.080
and they run every
three minutes.

02:33:58.080 --> 02:34:01.225
So that makes taking public
transit so much easier.

02:34:01.225 --> 02:34:07.400
[APPLAUSE]

02:34:07.400 --> 02:34:09.960
BERNI SEEFELD: And if you want
more details, you can use our

02:34:09.960 --> 02:34:11.795
new schedule viewer.

02:34:11.795 --> 02:34:19.070
[APPLAUSE]

02:34:19.070 --> 02:34:20.200
BERNI SEEFELD: So the
kids, they don't

02:34:20.200 --> 02:34:21.190
want to walk too much.

02:34:21.190 --> 02:34:23.540
So I'm looking for a trip that
has less walking and less

02:34:23.540 --> 02:34:25.810
transfers even if it
takes a bit longer.

02:34:25.810 --> 02:34:29.710
And, here, that looks
like a great one.

02:34:29.710 --> 02:34:33.708
So this is the future of
getting directions.

02:34:33.708 --> 02:34:40.630
[APPLAUSE]

02:34:40.630 --> 02:34:42.590
JONAH JONES: Now, as Brian
talked about earlier, we've

02:34:42.590 --> 02:34:44.370
collected tons of imagery.

02:34:44.370 --> 02:34:46.770
And we made a real focus of the
design to make sure it's

02:34:46.770 --> 02:34:49.610
easy and fun to explore.

02:34:49.610 --> 02:34:51.940
BERNI SEEFELD: So my friends,
they're from Rome, and so they

02:34:51.940 --> 02:34:54.620
insist that next time I
come and visit them.

02:34:54.620 --> 02:34:57.040
So let's take a trip.

02:34:57.040 --> 02:34:58.910
So this is a really nice
3D model of the

02:34:58.910 --> 02:35:00.860
Saint Peter's Basilica.

02:35:00.860 --> 02:35:02.700
But can we have a more
realistic view?

02:35:08.178 --> 02:35:15.660
[APPLAUSE]

02:35:15.660 --> 02:35:16.980
BERNI SEEFELD: No plug-ins.

02:35:16.980 --> 02:35:18.270
No downloads.

02:35:18.270 --> 02:35:20.070
This is the Google
Earth experience

02:35:20.070 --> 02:35:23.366
right here on a browser.

02:35:23.366 --> 02:35:28.156
[APPLAUSE]

02:35:28.156 --> 02:35:29.800
BERNI SEEFELD: And
that's not all.

02:35:29.800 --> 02:35:32.390
You see those row of images
at the bottom.

02:35:32.390 --> 02:35:34.850
These are other great
views of that area.

02:35:34.850 --> 02:35:37.420
That makes it really
easy to explore.

02:35:37.420 --> 02:35:40.290
And the beauty of this place
is really on the inside.

02:35:40.290 --> 02:35:41.540
So let's go on a tour.

02:35:49.799 --> 02:35:56.620
[APPLAUSE]

02:35:56.620 --> 02:35:58.620
BERNI SEEFELD: This is a
3D photo tour that is

02:35:58.620 --> 02:36:01.700
automatically generated from
user uploaded photos.

02:36:01.700 --> 02:36:04.570
So it will only get
better and better.

02:36:04.570 --> 02:36:07.485
So let's head back
to San Francisco.

02:36:07.485 --> 02:36:11.080
So this is the Moscone center
from a skydiver's perspective.

02:36:14.790 --> 02:36:17.740
But before the keynote started
I came up here on stage.

02:36:17.740 --> 02:36:20.510
And with the camera up on my
Android phone, I took a photo

02:36:20.510 --> 02:36:23.210
sphere and submitted
it to Google Maps.

02:36:23.210 --> 02:36:24.460
And there it is.

02:36:28.398 --> 02:36:35.290
[APPLAUSE]

02:36:35.290 --> 02:36:38.176
BERNI SEEFELD: This is how you
guys look from up here.

02:36:38.176 --> 02:36:41.230
So everybody can upload a photo
sphere and submit it to

02:36:41.230 --> 02:36:42.110
Google Maps.

02:36:42.110 --> 02:36:45.350
And so it's like user generated
street view.

02:36:45.350 --> 02:36:46.430
And we also took a
photo sphere out

02:36:46.430 --> 02:36:47.680
there on our geo pod.

02:36:49.940 --> 02:36:52.460
And if you go there tomorrow
morning, we'll have

02:36:52.460 --> 02:36:53.660
[INAUDIBLE].

02:36:53.660 --> 02:36:54.950
And you can get the experience
you just

02:36:54.950 --> 02:36:58.704
saw with elite motion.

02:36:58.704 --> 02:37:02.050
[APPLAUSE]

02:37:02.050 --> 02:37:03.300
BERNI SEEFELD: Let's
get back out.

02:37:05.400 --> 02:37:07.620
So we jump back out.

02:37:07.620 --> 02:37:11.420
And as we're zooming out and
we're leaving the Earth's

02:37:11.420 --> 02:37:17.399
atmosphere, you can see
the whole world.

02:37:17.399 --> 02:37:23.550
[APPLAUSE]

02:37:23.550 --> 02:37:27.234
BERNI SEEFELD: And those clouds,
they're real time.

02:37:27.234 --> 02:37:36.010
[APPLAUSE]

02:37:36.010 --> 02:37:37.671
BERNI SEEFELD: But we
can go further.

02:37:37.671 --> 02:37:42.000
[LAUGHTER]

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:47.070
BERNI SEEFELD: This is the Earth
traveling through space.

02:37:47.070 --> 02:37:49.053
And you can see the stars
and the milky way

02:37:49.053 --> 02:37:51.130
at the right position.

02:37:51.130 --> 02:37:54.170
And as the sun sets behind
the earth, the

02:37:54.170 --> 02:37:56.630
night lights come out.

02:37:56.630 --> 02:38:00.872
And this is the future
of Google Maps.

02:38:00.872 --> 02:38:13.072
[APPLAUSE]

02:38:13.072 --> 02:38:15.150
BRIAN MCCLENDON: Berni, Jonah,
this is beautiful.

02:38:15.150 --> 02:38:16.700
Now, when are we going
to get this?

02:38:16.700 --> 02:38:19.600
How long is it going to take
for you to deliver?

02:38:19.600 --> 02:38:21.300
BERNI SEEFELD: I don't think
these people want to wait.

02:38:21.300 --> 02:38:23.154
BRIAN MCCLENDON: Do you
guys want to wait?

02:38:23.154 --> 02:38:24.120
AUDIENCE: No.

02:38:24.120 --> 02:38:26.410
BERNI SEEFELD: Well, you
can try this today.

02:38:26.410 --> 02:38:28.390
This is the new Google Maps.

02:38:28.390 --> 02:38:30.660
It has a preview
on the desktop.

02:38:30.660 --> 02:38:33.758
So it's the perfect thing to
try to with your new Pixel.

02:38:33.758 --> 02:38:42.954
[APPLAUSE]

02:38:42.954 --> 02:38:45.685
BERNI SEEFELD: So when you pick
it up, check your inbox

02:38:45.685 --> 02:38:47.710
and you will have an invite.

02:38:47.710 --> 02:38:52.290
And everybody else, please go to
maps.google.com/preview and

02:38:52.290 --> 02:38:54.190
sign up and we'll
send the first

02:38:54.190 --> 02:38:57.100
invites tomorrow morning.

02:38:57.100 --> 02:38:58.580
BRIAN MCCLENDON: Thank
you very much,

02:38:58.580 --> 02:39:00.540
Berni, Jonah, and Daniel.

02:39:00.540 --> 02:39:04.470
[APPLAUSE]

02:39:04.470 --> 02:39:06.520
BRIAN MCCLENDON: So that is
the future of Google Maps,

02:39:06.520 --> 02:39:10.540
data, APIs, a beautiful new
Google Maps for mobile coming

02:39:10.540 --> 02:39:13.250
in the summer, and a desktop
Maps coming to

02:39:13.250 --> 02:39:15.500
you in the room today.

02:39:15.500 --> 02:39:17.750
So with that, I'd like to think
the geo team and all the

02:39:17.750 --> 02:39:18.850
people who have worked on
this because it has

02:39:18.850 --> 02:39:20.220
been incredibly hard.

02:39:20.220 --> 02:39:22.570
But with that, the future
of Google Maps.

02:39:22.570 --> 02:39:24.146
Thank you.

02:39:24.146 --> 02:39:53.080
[APPLAUSE]

02:39:53.080 --> 02:39:57.680
LARRY PAGE: It was actually a
while ago I asked for the

02:39:57.680 --> 02:40:00.040
picture of the earth at night.

02:40:00.040 --> 02:40:03.680
And I'm really excited to
finally have gotten it.

02:40:03.680 --> 02:40:05.770
Although, I'm still waiting,
actually, for a higher

02:40:05.770 --> 02:40:07.020
resolution.

02:40:09.510 --> 02:40:11.750
So let's give a big around of
applause to the Maps guys.

02:40:11.750 --> 02:40:13.100
I think this is amazing.

02:40:13.100 --> 02:40:22.430
[APPLAUSE]

02:40:22.430 --> 02:40:23.950
LARRY PAGE: I'm really
excited to be here.

02:40:23.950 --> 02:40:28.530
And first I want to start
with a story.

02:40:28.530 --> 02:40:31.190
I was very, very lucky
growing up.

02:40:31.190 --> 02:40:37.090
And I was thinking about this as
we were preparing for this

02:40:37.090 --> 02:40:39.150
Google I/O.

02:40:39.150 --> 02:40:42.110
My dad was really interested
in technology.

02:40:42.110 --> 02:40:46.360
And I was just remembering he
actually drove me and my

02:40:46.360 --> 02:40:50.060
family all the way across the
country to go to a robotics

02:40:50.060 --> 02:40:51.850
conference.

02:40:51.850 --> 02:40:56.120
And then we got there and he
thought it was so important

02:40:56.120 --> 02:41:00.840
that his young son go to the
conference and one of the few

02:41:00.840 --> 02:41:04.130
times I've seen him really argue
with someone to get in

02:41:04.130 --> 02:41:07.850
someone underage successfully
into the conference.

02:41:07.850 --> 02:41:10.010
And that was me.

02:41:10.010 --> 02:41:14.590
And one of the themes I just
want to talk to you about is

02:41:14.590 --> 02:41:19.630
how important it is for us, all
of the developers here in

02:41:19.630 --> 02:41:22.980
the room and watching, to really
focus on technology and

02:41:22.980 --> 02:41:26.350
get more people involved
in it.

02:41:26.350 --> 02:41:31.410
And also thinking about my dad,
his degree, he was lucky

02:41:31.410 --> 02:41:36.140
enough to get a degree in
communications sciences.

02:41:36.140 --> 02:41:37.520
And you might ask
what the heck is

02:41:37.520 --> 02:41:39.720
communication sciences?

02:41:39.720 --> 02:41:42.440
That's what they called
computer science when

02:41:42.440 --> 02:41:46.590
computers were a passing fad.

02:41:46.590 --> 02:41:49.120
Sounds kind of funny
now, right?

02:41:49.120 --> 02:41:52.401
But there was a time
when that was true.

02:41:52.401 --> 02:41:56.880
And I think everyone today is
excited about technology.

02:41:56.880 --> 02:41:58.960
We don't have to worry about
that so much anymore.

02:42:01.740 --> 02:42:04.290
And I think that Android and
things like that are being

02:42:04.290 --> 02:42:10.180
adopted much faster than
anything else in the past.

02:42:10.180 --> 02:42:13.490
I look at the rate of adoption
of those things, on almost any

02:42:13.490 --> 02:42:16.840
basis they are much,
much faster.

02:42:16.840 --> 02:42:20.170
And it's incredible.

02:42:20.170 --> 02:42:23.576
When I pull out my smartphone,
it's amazing what we have on

02:42:23.576 --> 02:42:25.080
the smartphones.

02:42:25.080 --> 02:42:29.540
We have almost every sensor
we've ever come up with.

02:42:29.540 --> 02:42:34.790
I recently got a scale and it
measures air quality and

02:42:34.790 --> 02:42:36.670
uploads it to the internet.

02:42:36.670 --> 02:42:40.000
I'm sure those things will end
up in your smartphone.

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.140
That's amazing.

02:42:42.140 --> 02:42:46.430
Your phone can talk to anyone
in the world almost anywhere

02:42:46.430 --> 02:42:48.140
in the world.

02:42:48.140 --> 02:42:52.030
And I was kind of remarking, I
was talking to my teams about

02:42:52.030 --> 02:42:57.310
this, if you take out your phone
and hold it out, it's

02:42:57.310 --> 02:43:01.080
almost as big as the TV or
screen you're looking at.

02:43:01.080 --> 02:43:04.660
And it has the same resolution
as well.

02:43:04.660 --> 02:43:08.050
And so if you're nearsighted,
which I see many of you out

02:43:08.050 --> 02:43:09.920
there with glasses--

02:43:09.920 --> 02:43:12.980
and even some Google
Glasses, thank you.

02:43:12.980 --> 02:43:15.510
I think many of you
are near sighted.

02:43:15.510 --> 02:43:17.600
And, you know, smartphone and a
big display are kind of the

02:43:17.600 --> 02:43:21.270
same thing now, which is
amazing, absolutely amazing.

02:43:24.270 --> 02:43:27.240
So I think we also have a lot
more devices that we use

02:43:27.240 --> 02:43:28.960
interchangeably.

02:43:28.960 --> 02:43:34.180
You know, we use tablets,
phones, laptops, and even the

02:43:34.180 --> 02:43:37.840
Google Glass, all those
things we're using.

02:43:37.840 --> 02:43:42.320
And that's why we put so much
focus on our platforms, on

02:43:42.320 --> 02:43:45.630
Android and Chrome.

02:43:45.630 --> 02:43:51.400
It's really important in helping
developers and Google

02:43:51.400 --> 02:43:54.670
build great user experiences
across these different devices

02:43:54.670 --> 02:43:56.950
to have these platforms.

02:43:56.950 --> 02:44:01.200
And I'm tremendously excited
about all the innovation that

02:44:01.200 --> 02:44:03.950
you're bringing to life.

02:44:03.950 --> 02:44:08.090
Technology should do the hard
work so that people can get on

02:44:08.090 --> 02:44:12.830
with doing the things that make
them happiest in life.

02:44:12.830 --> 02:44:15.590
Take Search for example.

02:44:15.590 --> 02:44:18.940
Perfect search engine, as Amit
mentioned, is the Star Trek

02:44:18.940 --> 02:44:19.790
computer, right?

02:44:19.790 --> 02:44:23.990
And understand exactly what you
meant and give you exactly

02:44:23.990 --> 02:44:25.710
what you wanted.

02:44:25.710 --> 02:44:28.860
And our Knowledge Graph, which
you saw, really brings that a

02:44:28.860 --> 02:44:30.110
lot closer.

02:44:32.820 --> 02:44:36.360
I think Google Now, which
Johanna just demonstrated,

02:44:36.360 --> 02:44:40.610
gives you information without
even having to ask and it

02:44:40.610 --> 02:44:45.840
understands the context of what
you talked about before

02:44:45.840 --> 02:44:47.220
so you can use things
like pronouns.

02:44:47.220 --> 02:44:48.860
It's amazing.

02:44:48.860 --> 02:44:52.950
Flight times, your boarding
passes, directions, next

02:44:52.950 --> 02:44:55.500
appointment, all
with no effort.

02:44:55.500 --> 02:44:59.310
Think about a really smart
assistant doing all those

02:44:59.310 --> 02:45:02.520
things for you so you don't
have to think about it.

02:45:02.520 --> 02:45:06.630
You saw how easy some of
those experiences felt.

02:45:06.630 --> 02:45:09.790
And we're just getting
started.

02:45:09.790 --> 02:45:12.095
The opportunities we have
are tremendous.

02:45:12.095 --> 02:45:15.140
You know, we haven't seen this
rate of change in computing

02:45:15.140 --> 02:45:17.930
for a long time, probably
not since the

02:45:17.930 --> 02:45:21.430
birth of personal computing.

02:45:21.430 --> 02:45:25.090
But when I think about it, I
think we're all here because

02:45:25.090 --> 02:45:30.660
we share a deep sense of
optimism about the potential

02:45:30.660 --> 02:45:35.760
of technology to improve
people's lives and the world

02:45:35.760 --> 02:45:38.230
as part of that.

02:45:38.230 --> 02:45:40.190
And I'm amazed.

02:45:40.190 --> 02:45:44.040
Every day I come to work the
list of things that needs to

02:45:44.040 --> 02:45:47.070
be done is longer than
the day before.

02:45:47.070 --> 02:45:49.870
And the opportunity
of those things is

02:45:49.870 --> 02:45:52.770
bigger than it was before.

02:45:52.770 --> 02:45:56.930
And because of that, I think
we, as Google, and as an

02:45:56.930 --> 02:46:01.980
industry, all of you, are really
only at 1% of what's

02:46:01.980 --> 02:46:05.890
possible and probably
even less than that.

02:46:05.890 --> 02:46:10.600
And despite the faster change we
have in the industry, we're

02:46:10.600 --> 02:46:13.480
still moving slow
relative to the

02:46:13.480 --> 02:46:17.520
opportunities that we have.

02:46:17.520 --> 02:46:20.020
And some of that I think is
due to the negativity.

02:46:20.020 --> 02:46:22.980
You know, every story I read
about Google is kind of us

02:46:22.980 --> 02:46:27.090
versus some other company
or some stupid thing.

02:46:27.090 --> 02:46:29.940
And I just don't find that
very interesting.

02:46:29.940 --> 02:46:31.340
We should be building
great things that

02:46:31.340 --> 02:46:33.236
don't exist, right?

02:46:33.236 --> 02:46:41.840
[APPLAUSE]

02:46:41.840 --> 02:46:42.870
LARRY PAGE: You know,
being negative is

02:46:42.870 --> 02:46:44.880
not how we make progress.

02:46:44.880 --> 02:46:49.610
And most important things
are not zero sum.

02:46:49.610 --> 02:46:52.480
There's a lot of opportunity
out there.

02:46:52.480 --> 02:46:57.750
And we can use technology to
make really new and really

02:46:57.750 --> 02:47:01.780
important things that make
people's lives better.

02:47:01.780 --> 02:47:07.310
And if I think back to a long
time ago, a very long time

02:47:07.310 --> 02:47:13.170
ago, all of humanity was
basically our farming or

02:47:13.170 --> 02:47:15.225
hunting all the time.

02:47:17.730 --> 02:47:21.050
And if you lived at that time
you probably hoped that you

02:47:21.050 --> 02:47:23.110
could feed your family.

02:47:23.110 --> 02:47:25.720
And, unfortunately, that's still
true for a lot of people

02:47:25.720 --> 02:47:27.220
in the world.

02:47:27.220 --> 02:47:30.160
But certainly for us we don't
worry about that.

02:47:30.160 --> 02:47:32.400
And the reason for that
is technology.

02:47:32.400 --> 02:47:36.350
We've improved how we
grow food and so on.

02:47:36.350 --> 02:47:40.130
And the technology of that has
allowed people to focus on

02:47:40.130 --> 02:47:42.520
other things if they choose.

02:47:42.520 --> 02:47:45.190
By the way, I think being a
farmer's great if that's what

02:47:45.190 --> 02:47:47.080
you want to do.

02:47:47.080 --> 02:47:49.900
But it's not great if that's
what you have to do.

02:47:49.900 --> 02:47:53.160
And that's what technology
lets us do is free up

02:47:53.160 --> 02:47:56.460
ourselves to do more
different things.

02:47:56.460 --> 02:48:00.620
And I'm sure that people in the
future will think we're

02:48:00.620 --> 02:48:05.340
just as crazy as we think
everyone in the past was at

02:48:05.340 --> 02:48:07.700
having to do things
like farming and

02:48:07.700 --> 02:48:09.920
hunting all the time.

02:48:09.920 --> 02:48:12.520
So to give an example
of this Sergey and I

02:48:12.520 --> 02:48:14.330
talk a lot about cars.

02:48:14.330 --> 02:48:17.130
You know, he's working on
automated cars now.

02:48:17.130 --> 02:48:22.250
And imagine how self driving
cars will change our lives and

02:48:22.250 --> 02:48:23.830
the landscape.

02:48:23.830 --> 02:48:27.220
More green space, fewer
parking lots, greater

02:48:27.220 --> 02:48:32.560
mobility, fewer accidents,
more freedom, fewer hours

02:48:32.560 --> 02:48:36.350
wasted behind the
wheel of a car.

02:48:36.350 --> 02:48:39.670
And the average American
probably spends almost 50

02:48:39.670 --> 02:48:43.540
minutes, five, zero
minutes commuting.

02:48:43.540 --> 02:48:47.130
Imagine if you got most of
that time back to use for

02:48:47.130 --> 02:48:49.150
other things.

02:48:49.150 --> 02:48:52.140
And, unfortunately, even in
other countries commute times

02:48:52.140 --> 02:48:55.380
are still pretty large, not
quite as large as the US, but

02:48:55.380 --> 02:48:58.280
still very significant.

02:48:58.280 --> 02:49:03.940
Now to get there we need more
people, more people like you,

02:49:03.940 --> 02:49:08.950
markets falling in love with
science and math at school,

02:49:08.950 --> 02:49:10.960
more students graduating with
science and engineering

02:49:10.960 --> 02:49:14.540
degrees, and more people
working on important

02:49:14.540 --> 02:49:19.760
technological problems.

02:49:19.760 --> 02:49:23.920
And it's why Google got involved
with the movie "The

02:49:23.920 --> 02:49:26.660
Internship."

02:49:26.660 --> 02:49:28.660
I'm not sure we entirely
had a choice.

02:49:28.660 --> 02:49:31.240
But they were making a movie.

02:49:31.240 --> 02:49:32.990
We decided it would be
good to get involved.

02:49:32.990 --> 02:49:34.780
Lorraine's upfront.

02:49:34.780 --> 02:49:37.210
She's really responsible
for that.

02:49:37.210 --> 02:49:40.280
And I think the reason why we
got involved in that is that

02:49:40.280 --> 02:49:44.110
computer science has a
marketing problem.

02:49:44.110 --> 02:49:46.490
Where the nerdy curmudgeons.

02:49:46.490 --> 02:49:49.640
I don't know about you,
but that's what I am.

02:49:49.640 --> 02:49:54.500
And, well, in this movie the
guy who plays the head of

02:49:54.500 --> 02:49:59.270
search, the Amit Singhal you
just saw, is by far the

02:49:59.270 --> 02:50:01.900
coolest character
in the movie.

02:50:01.900 --> 02:50:05.020
And we're really excited
about that.

02:50:05.020 --> 02:50:11.050
So I think today we're still
just scratching the surface of

02:50:11.050 --> 02:50:13.360
what's possible.

02:50:13.360 --> 02:50:16.390
That's why I'm so excited.

02:50:16.390 --> 02:50:18.930
Google's really working on the
platforms that support all of

02:50:18.930 --> 02:50:20.840
your innovations.

02:50:20.840 --> 02:50:24.970
I cannot wait to see
what comes next.

02:50:24.970 --> 02:50:27.080
I got goosebumps as I was
watching some of the

02:50:27.080 --> 02:50:28.890
presentations here.

02:50:28.890 --> 02:50:33.290
And I really want to thank you
for all of your contributions.

02:50:33.290 --> 02:50:35.550
So with that, I'm going to
do something kind of

02:50:35.550 --> 02:50:39.510
unconventional and try to take
some questions, actually, from

02:50:39.510 --> 02:50:40.180
all of you.

02:50:40.180 --> 02:50:45.060
So I've got two microphones set
up towards the back here.

02:50:45.060 --> 02:50:45.740
And don't be shy.

02:50:45.740 --> 02:50:48.860
Line up and ask some
questions.

02:50:48.860 --> 02:50:50.080
I'm sure some of you
have thought

02:50:50.080 --> 02:50:51.840
of some good questions.

02:50:51.840 --> 02:50:52.990
And we'll get started.

02:50:52.990 --> 02:50:55.489
So thank you so much.

02:50:55.489 --> 02:51:06.610
[APPLAUSE]

02:51:06.610 --> 02:51:07.750
LARRY PAGE: All right, so
we got a few racing up.

02:51:07.750 --> 02:51:10.130
Please line up so we can get
through them quickly.

02:51:10.130 --> 02:51:13.040
And one question per
person, please.

02:51:13.040 --> 02:51:17.150
We have 6,000 people.

02:51:17.150 --> 02:51:20.700
I also want to call out the
one million people.

02:51:20.700 --> 02:51:24.880
It's over one million people
watching this live on YouTube.

02:51:24.880 --> 02:51:26.560
It's just unbelievable.

02:51:26.560 --> 02:51:29.103
So let's thank them
for participating.

02:51:29.103 --> 02:51:35.730
[APPLAUSE]

02:51:35.730 --> 02:51:37.920
LARRY PAGE: OK, yes, sir,
on the left here.

02:51:37.920 --> 02:51:40.650
AUDIENCE: I'm Robert Scobler,
one of the first Glass-holes.

02:51:40.650 --> 02:51:41.830
So thank you.

02:51:41.830 --> 02:51:42.720
LARRY PAGE: Yeah.

02:51:42.720 --> 02:51:43.940
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
getting my glass.

02:51:43.940 --> 02:51:46.820
LARRY PAGE: Robert, I really
didn't appreciate the shower

02:51:46.820 --> 02:51:48.656
picture though.

02:51:48.656 --> 02:51:52.560
[LAUGHTER]

02:51:52.560 --> 02:51:55.940
AUDIENCE: Here at Google I/O
several contextual things

02:51:55.940 --> 02:51:57.270
start coming out.

02:51:57.270 --> 02:52:00.890
We start seeing an API that's
going to tell us whether we're

02:52:00.890 --> 02:52:02.680
walking or running or whatnot.

02:52:02.680 --> 02:52:04.890
Where are you going to take that
in the future now that we

02:52:04.890 --> 02:52:06.250
have more sensors?

02:52:06.250 --> 02:52:08.290
And are you going to talk about
the little sensor inside

02:52:08.290 --> 02:52:12.455
the Google Glass that
watches our eye?

02:52:12.455 --> 02:52:13.730
LARRY PAGE: Yeah, that's
a great question.

02:52:13.730 --> 02:52:15.270
I mean, this is a big
area of focus.

02:52:15.270 --> 02:52:19.710
I think you saw that in
the presentations.

02:52:19.710 --> 02:52:25.190
I think really being able to get
computers out of the way

02:52:25.190 --> 02:52:28.220
and really focused on what
people really need.

02:52:28.220 --> 02:52:31.990
Mobile's been a great learning
experience, I think, for us

02:52:31.990 --> 02:52:33.660
and for all of you.

02:52:33.660 --> 02:52:35.130
You know, the smaller
screens, you can't

02:52:35.130 --> 02:52:37.070
have all this clutter.

02:52:37.070 --> 02:52:41.240
I think you saw on the new
Google Maps how we got all

02:52:41.240 --> 02:52:43.630
sorts of stuff out of the way.

02:52:43.630 --> 02:52:47.460
There's like 100 times less
things on the screen than

02:52:47.460 --> 02:52:49.120
there was before.

02:52:49.120 --> 02:52:51.450
And I think that's
going to happen

02:52:51.450 --> 02:52:53.250
with all of your devices.

02:52:53.250 --> 02:52:55.480
They're going to understand
the context.

02:52:55.480 --> 02:52:58.710
Just before I came on stage,
I had to turn off all of my

02:52:58.710 --> 02:53:02.790
phones so I'm not interrupting
all of you.

02:53:02.790 --> 02:53:04.470
That's crazy.

02:53:04.470 --> 02:53:06.850
That's not a very hard
thing to figure out.

02:53:06.850 --> 02:53:11.040
So all that context that's in
your life, all these different

02:53:11.040 --> 02:53:13.770
sensors are going to now pick
that up and just make your

02:53:13.770 --> 02:53:15.090
life better.

02:53:15.090 --> 02:53:17.780
And I think that we're, again,
only at the very, very early

02:53:17.780 --> 02:53:19.030
stages of that.

02:53:19.030 --> 02:53:20.760
This is very, very exciting.

02:53:20.760 --> 02:53:21.790
All right, let's take
another question.

02:53:21.790 --> 02:53:22.720
Yes.

02:53:22.720 --> 02:53:23.650
AUDIENCE: Hello, Larry.

02:53:23.650 --> 02:53:24.420
My name is Buckner.

02:53:24.420 --> 02:53:28.700
I have the opportunity to work
at Mozilla on a lot of the web

02:53:28.700 --> 02:53:31.410
technologies with you
guys here at Google.

02:53:31.410 --> 02:53:35.490
And I saw a lot of the great web
technologies you had here

02:53:35.490 --> 02:53:36.520
on display.

02:53:36.520 --> 02:53:39.430
And I know people had this
question leading up to Google

02:53:39.430 --> 02:53:43.490
I/O. But are we ever going to
see the web upleveled in

02:53:43.490 --> 02:53:48.090
Android or subsume what is there
now to be the operating

02:53:48.090 --> 02:53:51.930
system of mobile and
your platform?

02:53:51.930 --> 02:53:52.120
LARRY PAGE: Sorry.

02:53:52.120 --> 02:53:54.410
You're asking about the
future or the web?

02:53:54.410 --> 02:53:54.780
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

02:53:54.780 --> 02:53:55.880
Are we going to see it--

02:53:55.880 --> 02:53:57.540
I mean, Android right
now runs on Java.

02:53:57.540 --> 02:53:58.230
It's a native platform.

02:53:58.230 --> 02:54:00.065
It's great in a lot of ways.

02:54:00.065 --> 02:54:02.140
Are we going to see the web
and all the fantastic

02:54:02.140 --> 02:54:04.080
technologies you showed
off here today be

02:54:04.080 --> 02:54:05.960
the center of that?

02:54:05.960 --> 02:54:07.270
LARRY PAGE: Well, I think we've
been really excited

02:54:07.270 --> 02:54:08.930
about the web, obviously,
being birthed

02:54:08.930 --> 02:54:11.650
from it as a company.

02:54:11.650 --> 02:54:13.990
And I think that--

02:54:13.990 --> 02:54:16.150
and we've really invested a
lot in the open standards

02:54:16.150 --> 02:54:17.830
behind all that.

02:54:17.830 --> 02:54:21.540
I've personally been quite sad
at the industry's behavior

02:54:21.540 --> 02:54:24.020
around all these things.

02:54:24.020 --> 02:54:29.240
If you just take something as
simple as instant messaging,

02:54:29.240 --> 02:54:31.770
we've kind of had an offer
forever that we'll

02:54:31.770 --> 02:54:34.440
interoperate on instant
messaging.

02:54:34.440 --> 02:54:37.390
I think just this week Microsoft
took advantage of

02:54:37.390 --> 02:54:42.400
that by interoperating with us
but not doing the reverse,

02:54:42.400 --> 02:54:45.190
which is really sad, right?

02:54:45.190 --> 02:54:47.630
And that's not the way
to make progress.

02:54:47.630 --> 02:54:50.910
You need to actually have
interoperation, not just

02:54:50.910 --> 02:54:54.820
people milking off one company
for their own benefit.

02:54:54.820 --> 02:54:58.130
So I think Google has always
stood for that.

02:54:58.130 --> 02:55:02.050
I've been sad that the industry
hasn't been able to

02:55:02.050 --> 02:55:06.110
advance those things, I think,
generally because of a focus

02:55:06.110 --> 02:55:11.010
on negativity and on
zero sum games.

02:55:11.010 --> 02:55:13.850
So we try to be on the right
side of all those things.

02:55:13.850 --> 02:55:17.300
But we also try to be practical
and look at what

02:55:17.300 --> 02:55:21.760
other people are doing and not
just rely on our principles to

02:55:21.760 --> 02:55:25.930
shoot ourselves in the foot and
our users in the process.

02:55:25.930 --> 02:55:30.260
So I don't know how to deal
with all those things.

02:55:30.260 --> 02:55:34.760
And I'm sad that the web is
probably not advancing as fast

02:55:34.760 --> 02:55:35.930
as it should be.

02:55:35.930 --> 02:55:39.020
We certainly struggle with
people like Microsoft.

02:55:39.020 --> 02:55:43.870
We've had a great relationship
with Mozilla, I think, and

02:55:43.870 --> 02:55:47.000
value that deeply.

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.700
I'd like to see more open
standards, more people getting

02:55:49.700 --> 02:55:54.680
behind things that just work and
more companies involved in

02:55:54.680 --> 02:55:56.015
those ecosystems.

02:55:56.015 --> 02:56:00.860
I think that's why this
conference is so important.

02:56:00.860 --> 02:56:04.570
But I wouldn't grade the
industry well in terms of

02:56:04.570 --> 02:56:06.770
where we've gotten to.

02:56:06.770 --> 02:56:09.790
In the very long term, I don't
think you should have to think

02:56:09.790 --> 02:56:14.920
about as a developer am I
developing for this platform

02:56:14.920 --> 02:56:17.140
or another or something
like that.

02:56:17.140 --> 02:56:20.150
I think you should be able to
work at a much higher level.

02:56:20.150 --> 02:56:25.990
In software you should run
everywhere easily.

02:56:25.990 --> 02:56:29.400
And people like Mozilla should
be able to add meaningfully to

02:56:29.400 --> 02:56:32.710
that and make platforms
and other things.

02:56:32.710 --> 02:56:34.220
So that's how I would
think about.

02:56:34.220 --> 02:56:34.390
AUDIENCE: Thank.

02:56:34.390 --> 02:56:36.260
LARRY PAGE: It's a very,
very complex an

02:56:36.260 --> 02:56:38.480
important question though.

02:56:38.480 --> 02:56:39.350
Yes, yes.

02:56:39.350 --> 02:56:40.230
Yes, mam.

02:56:40.230 --> 02:56:42.780
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm
from Colombia.

02:56:42.780 --> 02:56:47.960
And the only reason because I
didn't quite finish my law

02:56:47.960 --> 02:56:50.490
studies was thanks to Google.

02:56:50.490 --> 02:56:54.970
So I have dreamed in this
question many times.

02:56:54.970 --> 02:57:01.870
And I would like to ask you how
Google will let us protect

02:57:01.870 --> 02:57:05.670
our freedom of speech
through internet.

02:57:05.670 --> 02:57:07.380
Thank you.

02:57:07.380 --> 02:57:08.550
LARRY PAGE: Yeah, that's
a great question.

02:57:08.550 --> 02:57:09.720
I mean, I think--

02:57:09.720 --> 02:57:10.668
yeah.

02:57:10.668 --> 02:57:15.930
[APPLAUSE]

02:57:15.930 --> 02:57:17.210
LARRY PAGE: I mean, this is
part of the area where

02:57:17.210 --> 02:57:18.540
business gets interesting,
right?

02:57:18.540 --> 02:57:23.975
I think we at Google pretty
clearly have a strong desire

02:57:23.975 --> 02:57:28.310
for freedom of speech for free
flow of information.

02:57:28.310 --> 02:57:32.730
And one of the main things we do
is probably translate that

02:57:32.730 --> 02:57:38.160
into practice in hundreds of
countries around the world and

02:57:38.160 --> 02:57:42.040
make sure we're talking to
government leaders and making

02:57:42.040 --> 02:57:43.950
sure we're helping
advance that.

02:57:43.950 --> 02:57:46.920
And our chairman, Eric Schmidt,
has been kind of

02:57:46.920 --> 02:57:49.450
traveling the world talking
about that.

02:57:49.450 --> 02:57:54.720
And I really applaud those
efforts and thinking about.

02:57:54.720 --> 02:57:57.790
So we're working very hard on
that, making sure we're

02:57:57.790 --> 02:58:01.230
protecting your private
information, making sure that

02:58:01.230 --> 02:58:06.580
we're ensuring computer
security, which is required to

02:58:06.580 --> 02:58:09.330
make sure we're protecting your
freedom of speech and

02:58:09.330 --> 02:58:14.540
your private information as part
of that and making sure

02:58:14.540 --> 02:58:17.640
we're being as transparent as
we can about the requests we

02:58:17.640 --> 02:58:19.710
get from government and
things like that.

02:58:19.710 --> 02:58:22.420
So this is a big area
of focus for us.

02:58:22.420 --> 02:58:26.380
And hopefully we can do a lot to
help the world and move it

02:58:26.380 --> 02:58:27.590
along there.

02:58:27.590 --> 02:58:31.580
It's a very difficult and
important issue also.

02:58:31.580 --> 02:58:33.950
Yes, another great question.

02:58:33.950 --> 02:58:35.920
AUDIENCE: I'm Ryan
from Provo, Utah.

02:58:35.920 --> 02:58:39.170
Just recently Google Fiber
was announced for there.

02:58:39.170 --> 02:58:42.340
And part of the marketing
campaign is 100 times the

02:58:42.340 --> 02:58:44.430
speed, 100 times the
possibility.

02:58:44.430 --> 02:58:49.640
What do you see as the
possibilities from that fast

02:58:49.640 --> 02:58:51.100
of internet?

02:58:51.100 --> 02:58:53.410
LARRY PAGE: Well, I think from
an engineering point of view

02:58:53.410 --> 02:58:56.400
it's just kind of
a no brainer.

02:58:56.400 --> 02:58:59.080
I mean, we got started building
data centers.

02:58:59.080 --> 02:59:02.280
And one of the biggest
problems we have was

02:59:02.280 --> 02:59:04.680
networking in the
data centers.

02:59:04.680 --> 02:59:08.790
And so I guess has a computer
scientist I just view it as

02:59:08.790 --> 02:59:13.240
kind of sad we have all these
computers out there and

02:59:13.240 --> 02:59:16.190
they're connected to each other
through like a tiny,

02:59:16.190 --> 02:59:21.310
tiny, tiny, tiny little pipe
that's super slow.

02:59:21.310 --> 02:59:24.080
And so in a sense, all the
computers we have in the

02:59:24.080 --> 02:59:28.320
world, most of them are
in people's houses.

02:59:28.320 --> 02:59:32.220
Most of them can't be used
for anything useful.

02:59:32.220 --> 02:59:37.460
So it's a obviously ways to
go from where we are now.

02:59:37.460 --> 02:59:39.810
We don't really have software
that's designed to use those

02:59:39.810 --> 02:59:41.240
things yet.

02:59:41.240 --> 02:59:45.770
We know if we build that
capacity, we'll be able to use

02:59:45.770 --> 02:59:48.450
those computers for all sorts
of interesting things.

02:59:48.450 --> 02:59:52.360
And even basic things like the
bandwidth of your visual

02:59:52.360 --> 02:59:55.170
system is pretty high
compared to the

02:59:55.170 --> 02:59:56.930
bandwidth most people have.

02:59:56.930 --> 02:59:59.800
And It think it's pretty clear
we want to deliver bits to

02:59:59.800 --> 03:00:03.080
your eyes just as
a basic thing.

03:00:03.080 --> 03:00:06.920
So I'm really excited about what
we'll be able to do and

03:00:06.920 --> 03:00:10.910
what you'll all be able to do
as we get more people with

03:00:10.910 --> 03:00:13.120
super high speed connections.

03:00:13.120 --> 03:00:17.220
And probably gigabits or just
the beginning for that.

03:00:17.220 --> 03:00:20.120
What we really need are low
latency connections that

03:00:20.120 --> 03:00:24.570
operate at computer speed,
whatever that is that you have

03:00:24.570 --> 03:00:26.210
inside your house.

03:00:26.210 --> 03:00:29.280
So I'm really excited
about that.

03:00:29.280 --> 03:00:30.490
So we're just getting started.

03:00:30.490 --> 03:00:32.060
All right, in the middle now.

03:00:32.060 --> 03:00:33.048
Yes.

03:00:33.048 --> 03:00:35.388
The black shirt there.

03:00:35.388 --> 03:00:36.810
AUDIENCE: I'm [INAUDIBLE]

03:00:36.810 --> 03:00:38.560
from Vancouver.

03:00:38.560 --> 03:00:41.990
We've seen Google move into
some physical real world

03:00:41.990 --> 03:00:46.820
products like Google Fiber and
the autonomous self driving

03:00:46.820 --> 03:00:50.130
cars and their renewable energy
cheaper than coal

03:00:50.130 --> 03:00:51.800
initiatives.

03:00:51.800 --> 03:00:54.970
Curious if you can elaborate
on further projects that

03:00:54.970 --> 03:00:58.770
Google is planning to get into
regarding physical world type

03:00:58.770 --> 03:01:00.010
initiatives.

03:01:00.010 --> 03:01:00.710
LARRY PAGE: Yeah.

03:01:00.710 --> 03:01:06.060
Well, my compatriot, Sergey
Brin, who last year arranged

03:01:06.060 --> 03:01:09.110
the sky diving, but
this year did not,

03:01:09.110 --> 03:01:11.490
I mean, he's focused--

03:01:11.490 --> 03:01:16.130
Google X is focused on real sort
of atoms and not bits.

03:01:16.130 --> 03:01:20.650
And part of why I feel there's
a lot of opportunity there.

03:01:20.650 --> 03:01:24.520
And Sergey's having a great
time doing that.

03:01:24.520 --> 03:01:27.400
And that's, I think,
a really, really

03:01:27.400 --> 03:01:29.870
fascinating an amazing job.

03:01:29.870 --> 03:01:34.070
I think that possibilities for
some of those things are

03:01:34.070 --> 03:01:35.320
incredibly great.

03:01:37.830 --> 03:01:40.820
If you look at technology
applied to transportation, it

03:01:40.820 --> 03:01:44.330
hasn't really started yet.

03:01:44.330 --> 03:01:45.480
We haven't really
done that out.

03:01:45.480 --> 03:01:49.230
So I think automated cars are
just one thing you could do.

03:01:49.230 --> 03:01:50.865
You can do many, many
other things.

03:01:50.865 --> 03:01:54.620
So I think we're very excited
about that area.

03:01:54.620 --> 03:01:57.690
And we also think it's a way
that the company can scale.

03:02:00.530 --> 03:02:03.380
I think that to the extent
all of our products are

03:02:03.380 --> 03:02:07.780
interrelated, we actually need
to do a fair amount of

03:02:07.780 --> 03:02:10.440
management of those projects
to make sure you get a

03:02:10.440 --> 03:02:15.360
seamless experience, both as a
user and a developer, that it

03:02:15.360 --> 03:02:17.150
all makes sense.

03:02:17.150 --> 03:02:19.500
When we do some of these other
kinds of things like automated

03:02:19.500 --> 03:02:24.890
cars, they have a longer time
frame and less interaction.

03:02:24.890 --> 03:02:29.420
And so I'd actually encourage
maybe more companies to try to

03:02:29.420 --> 03:02:33.060
do things that are a little bit
outside their comfort zone

03:02:33.060 --> 03:02:36.520
because I think it gets them
more scalability in what they

03:02:36.520 --> 03:02:37.940
can get done.

03:02:37.940 --> 03:02:43.750
And so I think we've been
surprised also even when we do

03:02:43.750 --> 03:02:48.380
things that are kind of crazy
like automated cars, it turns

03:02:48.380 --> 03:02:51.460
out you just saw the mapping
stuff we finished with.

03:02:51.460 --> 03:02:54.370
The technology for doing mapping
and automated cars

03:02:54.370 --> 03:02:56.760
turns out to be the same.

03:02:56.760 --> 03:02:59.740
And so we have a bunch of great
engineers that have just

03:02:59.740 --> 03:03:03.530
moved over from those efforts
and they did it naturally and

03:03:03.530 --> 03:03:05.020
scalability.

03:03:05.020 --> 03:03:06.760
And they're excited about it.

03:03:06.760 --> 03:03:08.530
And so I'm really, really
excited about that too.

03:03:08.530 --> 03:03:12.360
So every time we've done
something crazy--

03:03:12.360 --> 03:03:15.500
Gmail, when we launched it, I
think we had 100 people in the

03:03:15.500 --> 03:03:17.750
company when we launched
Gmail.

03:03:17.750 --> 03:03:18.660
And people said, you're nuts.

03:03:18.660 --> 03:03:20.230
You're a search company.

03:03:20.230 --> 03:03:22.340
Why are you doing Gmail?

03:03:22.340 --> 03:03:24.730
It's because we understand
things about data centers and

03:03:24.730 --> 03:03:29.000
serving and storage that
we applied to email.

03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:31.120
And that was a great
thing we did that.

03:03:31.120 --> 03:03:34.310
And so I think almost every
time we've tried to do

03:03:34.310 --> 03:03:37.935
something crazy we've made
progress, not all the times

03:03:37.935 --> 03:03:39.580
but almost every time.

03:03:39.580 --> 03:03:42.780
So we've become a bit
emboldened by that.

03:03:42.780 --> 03:03:46.120
And the good news is too, no
matter how much money we try

03:03:46.120 --> 03:03:51.580
to spend on automated cars or
Gmail in the early stages,

03:03:51.580 --> 03:03:54.670
they end up being small,
small chunks.

03:03:54.670 --> 03:03:57.830
So they don't really cause
a business issue either.

03:03:57.830 --> 03:03:59.550
So I'm really excited
about that.

03:03:59.550 --> 03:04:03.260
And I tried to talk about
that in my remarks.

03:04:03.260 --> 03:04:07.970
That's why I say I think we're
at 1% of what's possible.

03:04:07.970 --> 03:04:09.290
Yeah, another question.

03:04:09.290 --> 03:04:09.340
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

03:04:09.340 --> 03:04:10.300
Hi, Larry.

03:04:10.300 --> 03:04:12.800
It's Greg with the D-Sky 9.

03:04:12.800 --> 03:04:15.440
We're developing apps
for Google Glass.

03:04:15.440 --> 03:04:19.550
And I was really excited to see
all the new things that

03:04:19.550 --> 03:04:22.960
Google is providing and also
realize that it kind of

03:04:22.960 --> 03:04:25.830
trounced a bunch of existing
businesses.

03:04:25.830 --> 03:04:29.760
I was wondering if you could
speak to what you feel are the

03:04:29.760 --> 03:04:34.050
largest area of opportunities
for developing on Glass

03:04:34.050 --> 03:04:37.330
outside of what Google will
provide naturally.

03:04:37.330 --> 03:04:41.020
And a bonus question, what will
be the production run for

03:04:41.020 --> 03:04:43.262
Glass for consumers.

03:04:43.262 --> 03:04:45.040
LARRY PAGE: Well, I mean, I'd
have to ask Sergey that.

03:04:48.070 --> 03:04:49.850
So I don't know what the
production numbers will be.

03:04:49.850 --> 03:04:52.210
So I think we're more focused
on with Glass--

03:04:52.210 --> 03:04:54.140
Glass is a new category.

03:04:54.140 --> 03:04:58.420
It's quite different than
existing computing devices.

03:04:58.420 --> 03:05:01.020
And so I think it's great that
we've started on it.

03:05:01.020 --> 03:05:04.220
But I think our main
goal is to get

03:05:04.220 --> 03:05:06.680
happy users using Glass.

03:05:06.680 --> 03:05:09.780
And so we've put a bunch
out to developers.

03:05:09.780 --> 03:05:13.190
I see a lot of people with
them in the audience.

03:05:13.190 --> 03:05:16.370
We want to make sure we're
building experiences that

03:05:16.370 --> 03:05:18.310
really make people happy.

03:05:18.310 --> 03:05:21.250
And so the team has tried to
build the minimal set of

03:05:21.250 --> 03:05:24.880
things, just for practical sake,
minimal set of things

03:05:24.880 --> 03:05:27.970
that will provide a
great experience

03:05:27.970 --> 03:05:29.950
and make happy users.

03:05:29.950 --> 03:05:32.470
And then, you know, we can get
going and work on it for the

03:05:32.470 --> 03:05:34.030
next 10 years.

03:05:34.030 --> 03:05:37.840
And every successive one is
going to be better obviously.

03:05:37.840 --> 03:05:42.830
So I think part of the answer
is we don't know.

03:05:42.830 --> 03:05:45.700
I think the basic use
cases we have around

03:05:45.700 --> 03:05:48.570
photography are amazing.

03:05:48.570 --> 03:05:53.700
I love taking pictures my
kids with Glass and

03:05:53.700 --> 03:05:55.420
movies and so on.

03:05:55.420 --> 03:05:58.100
And I find that for
me that's enough.

03:05:58.100 --> 03:05:59.560
I have the young kids.

03:05:59.560 --> 03:06:03.510
For me that's enough reason
to have Glass just there.

03:06:03.510 --> 03:06:06.160
I think if you didn't have young
kids you might not feel

03:06:06.160 --> 03:06:07.860
exactly that way.

03:06:07.860 --> 03:06:08.810
I'm not sure.

03:06:08.810 --> 03:06:12.460
I have young kids,
so I can't tell.

03:06:12.460 --> 03:06:14.700
Communications are also
pretty amazing.

03:06:14.700 --> 03:06:16.600
Navigation is amazing.

03:06:16.600 --> 03:06:18.930
Certainly if you're walking
if you're in

03:06:18.930 --> 03:06:20.690
Manhattan or something.

03:06:20.690 --> 03:06:23.940
Having Glass for navigation
is unbelievable.

03:06:23.940 --> 03:06:25.910
I find it's really,
really nice.

03:06:25.910 --> 03:06:30.120
And so navigations is amazing.

03:06:30.120 --> 03:06:31.792
Some of the core experiences
we have are, I

03:06:31.792 --> 03:06:33.440
think, pretty amazing.

03:06:33.440 --> 03:06:38.800
Communications, phone
calls, SMS, voice.

03:06:38.800 --> 03:06:41.100
You saw the things we're
doing around voice.

03:06:41.100 --> 03:06:44.460
It's amazing to always have the
device there to do that.

03:06:44.460 --> 03:06:46.640
So I think ultimately,
a lot of your

03:06:46.640 --> 03:06:49.920
experiences can move to Glass.

03:06:49.920 --> 03:06:52.560
And we're relying on all of you
to figure all that out.

03:06:52.560 --> 03:06:56.390
We're trying to get the base
thing to make happy users so

03:06:56.390 --> 03:06:58.690
we can get on with it.

03:06:58.690 --> 03:06:59.540
AUDIENCE: We're aligned
with that.

03:06:59.540 --> 03:06:59.770
Thank you.

03:06:59.770 --> 03:07:01.890
LARRY PAGE: You're welcome.

03:07:01.890 --> 03:07:02.710
Yes, over here.

03:07:02.710 --> 03:07:05.900
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name
is Caleb Allen.

03:07:05.900 --> 03:07:10.020
And I was wondering what advice
you would give to the

03:07:10.020 --> 03:07:14.640
rising generation of
technologists?

03:07:14.640 --> 03:07:20.530
What would help technology keep
moving at the pace it's

03:07:20.530 --> 03:07:23.840
been moving at for the last
five or ten years?

03:07:23.840 --> 03:07:27.820
And how would they do
that responsibly?

03:07:27.820 --> 03:07:29.220
LARRY PAGE: Yeah, I mean,
that's a good question.

03:07:29.220 --> 03:07:36.290
I think for me, I actually try
to use Google a lot and I

03:07:36.290 --> 03:07:38.390
research things really deeply.

03:07:38.390 --> 03:07:41.730
So, you know, before we get
something started, I try to

03:07:41.730 --> 03:07:43.240
actually understand it.

03:07:47.130 --> 03:07:49.560
And not just really understand
it, like, understand the crazy

03:07:49.560 --> 03:07:51.700
people in the area.

03:07:51.700 --> 03:07:52.870
And Google's great for that.

03:07:52.870 --> 03:07:56.230
You can find the craziest person
in any given area.

03:08:00.670 --> 03:08:03.910
And I think normally people
do not do that.

03:08:03.910 --> 03:08:06.690
So I think you want to
think about the base

03:08:06.690 --> 03:08:10.510
thing, whatever it is.

03:08:10.510 --> 03:08:13.100
We've been, obviously, working
on smartphones a lot.

03:08:13.100 --> 03:08:15.360
They're relatively
expensive now.

03:08:15.360 --> 03:08:19.435
With Nexus 4 we tried to
improve that a bit.

03:08:19.435 --> 03:08:21.470
But, you know, if you look at
the raw material costs of a

03:08:21.470 --> 03:08:26.070
smartphone, I guess mostly glass
and silicon, tiny bit of

03:08:26.070 --> 03:08:29.180
silicon, a little bit
of fibre glass.

03:08:29.180 --> 03:08:30.710
I don't know, the raw materials
costs of it is

03:08:30.710 --> 03:08:34.640
probably like $1 or something
like that.

03:08:34.640 --> 03:08:40.990
I think Glass is $0.50 a pound
or something like that.

03:08:40.990 --> 03:08:43.790
Certain metals are
$0.20 a pound.

03:08:43.790 --> 03:08:46.320
Phones don't weigh
very much, right?

03:08:46.320 --> 03:08:49.000
And silicon is very,
very cheap.

03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:52.810
So, I think, when I see people
in industries who are making

03:08:52.810 --> 03:08:55.790
things, I ask this question,
like, how far are you off the

03:08:55.790 --> 03:08:57.550
raw materials cost?

03:08:57.550 --> 03:09:01.370
And they never know the answer
to that question.

03:09:01.370 --> 03:09:05.300
So I think kind of as an
engineer or as a technologist

03:09:05.300 --> 03:09:09.890
trying to go to first principles
and say, what is

03:09:09.890 --> 03:09:13.830
the real issue?

03:09:13.830 --> 03:09:15.970
What is the real issue around
our power grids?

03:09:15.970 --> 03:09:18.810
Or what's the real issue
around manufacturing or

03:09:18.810 --> 03:09:20.300
whatever it is?

03:09:20.300 --> 03:09:23.880
I think people usually don't
answer those questions.

03:09:23.880 --> 03:09:28.010
And as a result, most of the
work that's done is very

03:09:28.010 --> 03:09:29.780
incremental.

03:09:29.780 --> 03:09:35.040
And because of that, we don't
make the progress we need to.

03:09:35.040 --> 03:09:37.180
With that said, I mean,
it's very hard.

03:09:37.180 --> 03:09:40.260
If you're going to make a
smartphone for a dollar, $1, I

03:09:40.260 --> 03:09:44.380
mean, that's obviously almost
impossible to do.

03:09:44.380 --> 03:09:47.770
But I think if you took a 50
year time frame or something

03:09:47.770 --> 03:09:51.260
like that, if you took a longer
view, you'd probably

03:09:51.260 --> 03:09:54.010
start to make the investments
you needed to.

03:09:54.010 --> 03:09:56.670
And along the way you'd probably
figure out how to

03:09:56.670 --> 03:09:57.890
make money.

03:09:57.890 --> 03:10:02.170
So I'd just kind of encourage
non incremental thinking and a

03:10:02.170 --> 03:10:06.920
real deep understanding of
whatever you're doing.

03:10:06.920 --> 03:10:08.360
That's what I try to do.

03:10:08.360 --> 03:10:09.640
Yeah, all the way over
on the right.

03:10:09.640 --> 03:10:11.050
And then I'll make
another pass.

03:10:11.050 --> 03:10:13.120
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the future of Android.

03:10:13.120 --> 03:10:17.570
So with Oracle taking control
of Java seven forward.

03:10:17.570 --> 03:10:21.020
How does Google and advance
Android when one of the core

03:10:21.020 --> 03:10:25.590
technical underpinnings is not
necessarily in its control?

03:10:25.590 --> 03:10:27.480
LARRY PAGE: Yeah, I mean,
we've had a difficult

03:10:27.480 --> 03:10:32.600
relationship with Oracle,
including having to appear in

03:10:32.600 --> 03:10:34.060
court as a result of it.

03:10:37.150 --> 03:10:39.120
Again, I think we'd like
to have a cooperative

03:10:39.120 --> 03:10:39.940
relationship with them.

03:10:39.940 --> 03:10:43.280
That hasn't seemed possible.

03:10:43.280 --> 03:10:47.360
And I think, again, probably
money is more important to

03:10:47.360 --> 03:10:51.620
them than having any kind
of collaboration

03:10:51.620 --> 03:10:53.120
or things like that.

03:10:53.120 --> 03:10:55.950
So I think that's been
very difficult.

03:10:55.950 --> 03:10:57.610
I think we'll get
through that.

03:10:57.610 --> 03:11:00.280
And I think, obviously,
Android's very, very important

03:11:00.280 --> 03:11:02.880
to the Java ecosystem.

03:11:02.880 --> 03:11:06.350
And so we'll get through
that just fine, just

03:11:06.350 --> 03:11:08.860
not in an ideal way.

03:11:08.860 --> 03:11:14.085
[APPLAUSE]

03:11:14.085 --> 03:11:15.810
LARRY PAGE: Yeah, another
question.

03:11:15.810 --> 03:11:16.360
AUDIENCE: Hi.

03:11:16.360 --> 03:11:17.510
My name is Prishan.

03:11:17.510 --> 03:11:19.990
I'm an Android developer
from India.

03:11:19.990 --> 03:11:21.130
I'm a heave Google user.

03:11:21.130 --> 03:11:24.346
And most of my opinion,
actually, I can trace back to

03:11:24.346 --> 03:11:25.950
a Google search.

03:11:25.950 --> 03:11:28.740
And as we saw today, it's
become more and more

03:11:28.740 --> 03:11:31.210
personalized and predictive.

03:11:31.210 --> 03:11:34.300
I kind of worry that it kind
of enforce my worldview and

03:11:34.300 --> 03:11:36.540
kind of rule out the
possibility of some

03:11:36.540 --> 03:11:39.616
serendipitous discovery of
other side, you know?

03:11:39.616 --> 03:11:41.470
So any comment on that?

03:11:41.470 --> 03:11:44.500
LARRY PAGE: Yeah, that's a
really great question.

03:11:44.500 --> 03:11:46.100
People have a lot of
concern about that.

03:11:46.100 --> 03:11:50.280
I'm totally not worried
about that at all.

03:11:50.280 --> 03:11:53.585
And it sounds kind
of funny to say.

03:11:53.585 --> 03:11:56.450
But that's totally under
your control and

03:11:56.450 --> 03:11:57.980
our control, as Google.

03:11:57.980 --> 03:12:02.120
So I think it's very important
to have a kind of widened

03:12:02.120 --> 03:12:06.780
world view, to have education,
all those kind of things.

03:12:06.780 --> 03:12:11.080
But the right solution to
that is not randomness.

03:12:11.080 --> 03:12:16.600
So you can't really argue doing
a bad job of returning

03:12:16.600 --> 03:12:19.550
whatever you wanted is the
right way to educate you.

03:12:19.550 --> 03:12:21.330
It's just not.

03:12:21.330 --> 03:12:25.450
It'd be better to return exactly
what you wanted when

03:12:25.450 --> 03:12:30.300
you wanted and use that saved
time to have you read the news

03:12:30.300 --> 03:12:34.770
or read textbooks or books or
other things that might be

03:12:34.770 --> 03:12:36.680
more general.

03:12:36.680 --> 03:12:39.530
And we can put that into
the algorithms.

03:12:39.530 --> 03:12:45.480
So I guess in my very long term
worldview, 50 years from

03:12:45.480 --> 03:12:49.860
now or something, hopefully
our software understands

03:12:49.860 --> 03:12:54.700
deeply what your knowledgeable
about, what you're not, and

03:12:54.700 --> 03:12:58.850
how to organize the world so
that the world can solve

03:12:58.850 --> 03:13:00.720
important problems.

03:13:00.720 --> 03:13:03.320
You know, people are starting
in the world not because we

03:13:03.320 --> 03:13:04.320
don't have enough food.

03:13:04.320 --> 03:13:06.650
It's because we're
not organized

03:13:06.650 --> 03:13:08.640
to solve that problem.

03:13:08.640 --> 03:13:11.400
And our computers aren't
helping us do that.

03:13:11.400 --> 03:13:14.470
So I think if you think about
it that way, if you think

03:13:14.470 --> 03:13:18.280
about we need to make computer
software and the internet that

03:13:18.280 --> 03:13:23.240
helps people solve important
problems in the world, that

03:13:23.240 --> 03:13:27.440
will cause, as a side effect,
for people to be educated

03:13:27.440 --> 03:13:31.020
about the things they should
get educated about.

03:13:31.020 --> 03:13:33.180
And that's not the
same as a demand.

03:13:33.180 --> 03:13:37.290
I'm asking for a particular
thing I'm searching for.

03:13:37.290 --> 03:13:38.770
Those are different modes.

03:13:38.770 --> 03:13:41.920
So just kind of make sure we're
serving both modes and

03:13:41.920 --> 03:13:44.340
that computers can
help you do that.

03:13:44.340 --> 03:13:48.940
So I can not be more optimistic
about that.

03:13:48.940 --> 03:13:53.240
I think computers and software
and things that you all write

03:13:53.240 --> 03:13:57.360
and we all write are going to
help us solve those problems

03:13:57.360 --> 03:14:02.260
for people rather than just
doing it at random.

03:14:02.260 --> 03:14:03.530
All right, next question.

03:14:03.530 --> 03:14:04.310
AUDIENCE: Hi, Larry.

03:14:04.310 --> 03:14:08.890
I'm Asman from GBG
[INAUDIBLE].

03:14:08.890 --> 03:14:12.180
It's great that Google has
developed a lot of new

03:14:12.180 --> 03:14:17.740
technologies and allows
us to live in a better

03:14:17.740 --> 03:14:19.540
way that we are today.

03:14:19.540 --> 03:14:21.140
My question is not
about technology.

03:14:21.140 --> 03:14:23.370
It's just a basic question for
the developers and the

03:14:23.370 --> 03:14:27.440
countries that I came from
in the Far East.

03:14:27.440 --> 03:14:30.740
We developers have been
developing, trying to develop

03:14:30.740 --> 03:14:31.300
applications.

03:14:31.300 --> 03:14:35.990
But one of the main issue for us
in many of the GDGs is that

03:14:35.990 --> 03:14:37.580
we can't sell.

03:14:37.580 --> 03:14:38.670
That's one part.

03:14:38.670 --> 03:14:43.740
The other thing is that I have
been asked many times why

03:14:43.740 --> 03:14:47.230
can't we buy paid apps?

03:14:47.230 --> 03:14:50.700
That's my simple questions.

03:14:50.700 --> 03:14:54.860
It's a great opportunity to
voice this one out to you.

03:14:54.860 --> 03:14:58.260
And I hope things can be done
because I don't see any reason

03:14:58.260 --> 03:15:01.930
why because people
want to buy.

03:15:01.930 --> 03:15:03.810
And they can use their
credit cards.

03:15:03.810 --> 03:15:05.320
Thank you very much.

03:15:05.320 --> 03:15:06.430
LARRY PAGE: Yeah, I mean,
that scenario we've

03:15:06.430 --> 03:15:07.620
had huge focus on.

03:15:07.620 --> 03:15:11.820
So I think we've made
a lot of progress.

03:15:11.820 --> 03:15:13.420
I think we'll make a
lot more progress.

03:15:13.420 --> 03:15:16.370
But hopefully that's a very
temporary problem and we'll

03:15:16.370 --> 03:15:17.750
get through that quickly.

03:15:17.750 --> 03:15:20.340
But thanks for bringing it up.

03:15:20.340 --> 03:15:21.460
Yes.

03:15:21.460 --> 03:15:24.810
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name is Kevin
Nielson from New Jersey.

03:15:24.810 --> 03:15:28.770
And I was intrigued about your
comment about the positivity

03:15:28.770 --> 03:15:30.140
and the negativity.

03:15:30.140 --> 03:15:34.560
And I'm very interested in
helping other people be

03:15:34.560 --> 03:15:37.540
positive about technology,
as you are.

03:15:37.540 --> 03:15:41.980
And I'm interested in what your
advice would be to help

03:15:41.980 --> 03:15:45.150
us sort of reduce the negativity
and focus on

03:15:45.150 --> 03:15:49.770
positive and focus on
changing the world.

03:15:49.770 --> 03:15:56.910
[APPLAUSE]

03:15:56.910 --> 03:15:59.860
LARRY PAGE: Yeah, that's
a really good question.

03:15:59.860 --> 03:16:03.330
I think people naturally are
concerned about change.

03:16:03.330 --> 03:16:05.640
And certainly not all
change is good.

03:16:05.640 --> 03:16:09.130
And I do think the pace of
change in the world is

03:16:09.130 --> 03:16:10.380
increasing.

03:16:12.240 --> 03:16:15.200
Part of what I would think
about, I think, is I think

03:16:15.200 --> 03:16:19.450
that we haven't adapted
mechanisms to deal with that.

03:16:19.450 --> 03:16:24.990
And maybe some of our old
institutions, like the law and

03:16:24.990 --> 03:16:28.540
so on, aren't keeping up with
the rate of change that we've

03:16:28.540 --> 03:16:30.555
caused through technology.

03:16:33.060 --> 03:16:35.900
If you look at different kinds
of laws we make or things like

03:16:35.900 --> 03:16:37.730
that, they're very old.

03:16:37.730 --> 03:16:43.260
I mean, the laws when we went
public were 50 years old.

03:16:43.260 --> 03:16:46.590
The law can't be right if it's
50 years old, like, it's

03:16:46.590 --> 03:16:47.900
before the internet.

03:16:47.900 --> 03:16:51.760
That's a pretty major change
in how you might go public.

03:16:51.760 --> 03:16:58.260
So I think maybe some of you
or maybe the million people

03:16:58.260 --> 03:17:02.620
watching who love technology,
maybe more of us need to go

03:17:02.620 --> 03:17:06.910
into other areas and help
those areas improve and

03:17:06.910 --> 03:17:08.920
understand technology.

03:17:08.920 --> 03:17:10.270
And I think that's not
happened at the

03:17:10.270 --> 03:17:11.770
rate it needs to happen.

03:17:11.770 --> 03:17:14.172
Yeah, thank you.

03:17:14.172 --> 03:17:20.920
And the other thing in my mind
is we also haven't, maybe,

03:17:20.920 --> 03:17:24.770
built mechanisms to allow
experimentation.

03:17:24.770 --> 03:17:27.930
There's many, many exciting and
important things you could

03:17:27.930 --> 03:17:31.430
do that you just can't do
because they're illegal or

03:17:31.430 --> 03:17:33.620
they're not allowed
by regulation.

03:17:33.620 --> 03:17:34.750
And that makes sense.

03:17:34.750 --> 03:17:38.550
We don't want our world
to change too fast.

03:17:38.550 --> 03:17:42.490
But maybe we should set aside
a small part of the world.

03:17:42.490 --> 03:17:45.285
You know, I like going to
Burning Man, for example,

03:17:45.285 --> 03:17:47.533
which I'm sure many of
you have been to.

03:17:47.533 --> 03:17:49.505
[APPLAUSE].

03:17:49.505 --> 03:17:51.790
LARRY PAGE: Yeah, a few
burners out there.

03:17:51.790 --> 03:17:53.870
That's an environment
where people can try

03:17:53.870 --> 03:17:55.180
out different things.

03:17:55.180 --> 03:17:57.690
But not everybody has to go.

03:17:57.690 --> 03:17:59.570
And I think that's a
great thing too.

03:17:59.570 --> 03:18:04.060
I think as technologists we
should have some safe places

03:18:04.060 --> 03:18:08.020
where we can try out some new
things and figure out what is

03:18:08.020 --> 03:18:12.350
the effect on society, what's
the effect on people, without

03:18:12.350 --> 03:18:16.100
having to deploy it kind of
into the normal world.

03:18:16.100 --> 03:18:19.200
And people who like those kinds
of things can go there

03:18:19.200 --> 03:18:21.070
and experience that.

03:18:21.070 --> 03:18:23.200
And we don't have mechanisms
for that.

03:18:23.200 --> 03:18:26.700
So those are the kind of things
I would think about.

03:18:26.700 --> 03:18:28.060
I also think we need
to be honest.

03:18:28.060 --> 03:18:31.200
And we don't always know
the impact of changes.

03:18:31.200 --> 03:18:33.380
And we should be humble
about that.

03:18:33.380 --> 03:18:36.770
I'm not sure getting up on stage
and saying everything is

03:18:36.770 --> 03:18:40.290
amazing and so on is
the right thing.

03:18:40.290 --> 03:18:42.870
Maybe we should launch things
in a little more humble way

03:18:42.870 --> 03:18:48.210
and see what the effect
is an adapt as we go.

03:18:48.210 --> 03:18:52.060
So those are kind
of my thoughts.

03:18:52.060 --> 03:18:53.310
Yeah, way on the side here.

03:18:55.850 --> 03:18:57.940
AUDIENCE: Larry, Ben Schacter,
Macquarie.

03:18:57.940 --> 03:19:01.630
Health care impacts the society
in so many profound

03:19:01.630 --> 03:19:03.090
ways and impacts the economy.

03:19:03.090 --> 03:19:06.300
What are the strengths of Google
that you can bring to

03:19:06.300 --> 03:19:08.330
help improve health care?

03:19:08.330 --> 03:19:10.300
LARRY PAGE: Yeah, that's a
great, maybe, segue from the

03:19:10.300 --> 03:19:11.950
previous question.

03:19:11.950 --> 03:19:14.460
I think it's been difficult.

03:19:14.460 --> 03:19:16.180
We had Google Health.

03:19:16.180 --> 03:19:18.550
We didn't make much
progress on it.

03:19:18.550 --> 03:19:21.870
And I think primarily we found
that all the issues were

03:19:21.870 --> 03:19:23.120
regulatory.

03:19:24.880 --> 03:19:28.660
It's very hard to get
technological leverage there.

03:19:28.660 --> 03:19:32.050
So I was talking about we're
1% of where we can be.

03:19:32.050 --> 03:19:35.235
That's by doing real amazing
technological things.

03:19:38.050 --> 03:19:39.840
We found, certainly, in the
kinds of things we were

03:19:39.840 --> 03:19:44.210
working on in health care, we
weren't able to move beyond

03:19:44.210 --> 03:19:48.370
that due to all the constraints

03:19:48.370 --> 03:19:50.060
that we were under.

03:19:50.060 --> 03:19:54.280
And so I think we'll see amazing
things in health care.

03:19:54.280 --> 03:19:57.020
But I think they'll be things
that have technological

03:19:57.020 --> 03:20:00.100
leverage like DNA sequencing.

03:20:00.100 --> 03:20:02.130
You know, we're clearly all
going to have that.

03:20:02.130 --> 03:20:04.390
It's going to cost
$1 or whatever.

03:20:04.390 --> 03:20:07.110
You're all going to have your
sequence and something amazing

03:20:07.110 --> 03:20:08.820
will happen.

03:20:08.820 --> 03:20:13.830
You know, I just disclosed
yesterday my voice issues.

03:20:13.830 --> 03:20:16.480
I got so many great
emails from people

03:20:16.480 --> 03:20:18.720
and thoughtful advice.

03:20:18.720 --> 03:20:21.810
And I realized, you know, I had
the kind of notion, like,

03:20:21.810 --> 03:20:23.980
this stuff should
be very private.

03:20:23.980 --> 03:20:25.370
And at least in my
case, I feel I

03:20:25.370 --> 03:20:28.300
should've done it sooner.

03:20:28.300 --> 03:20:30.050
And I'm not sure that
that answer is not

03:20:30.050 --> 03:20:31.530
true for most people.

03:20:31.530 --> 03:20:35.890
So I ask, like, why are people
so focused on keeping your

03:20:35.890 --> 03:20:38.160
medical history private?

03:20:38.160 --> 03:20:40.900
And the answer is probably
insurance.

03:20:40.900 --> 03:20:41.950
You're very worried
that you're going

03:20:41.950 --> 03:20:44.560
to be denied insurance.

03:20:44.560 --> 03:20:46.190
And that makes no sense.

03:20:46.190 --> 03:20:50.240
And we should change the rules
around insurance so that they

03:20:50.240 --> 03:20:51.950
have to insure people.

03:20:51.950 --> 03:20:53.180
I mean, the whole point
of insurance is

03:20:53.180 --> 03:20:54.966
that it insures everyone.

03:20:54.966 --> 03:21:00.565
[APPLAUSE]

03:21:00.565 --> 03:21:02.740
LARRY PAGE: So, again, maybe
we have a safe place where

03:21:02.740 --> 03:21:05.850
people can go and live in a
world like that where they'd

03:21:05.850 --> 03:21:07.480
make those kind of changes.

03:21:07.480 --> 03:21:09.040
We can see if they work.

03:21:09.040 --> 03:21:11.700
And then the world can learn
from that and move on.

03:21:11.700 --> 03:21:14.020
But not everybody has to
participate in that because

03:21:14.020 --> 03:21:16.940
I'm worried we're not making
some of the fundamental

03:21:16.940 --> 03:21:20.920
changes we need to
make fast enough.

03:21:20.920 --> 03:21:22.200
All right, maybe one or
two more questions.

03:21:22.200 --> 03:21:23.400
We're going to run
out of time.

03:21:23.400 --> 03:21:24.580
Yeah.

03:21:24.580 --> 03:21:27.126
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I'm John
Sarriugarte with Form &amp;

03:21:27.126 --> 03:21:30.430
reform, one of the Burning Man
artists you invited here

03:21:30.430 --> 03:21:32.570
tonight for the after party.

03:21:32.570 --> 03:21:33.120
Thank you.

03:21:33.120 --> 03:21:35.170
LARRY PAGE: Oh, great,

03:21:35.170 --> 03:21:38.420
AUDIENCE: I'm very inspired to
see that you've reached out to

03:21:38.420 --> 03:21:40.690
the educational aspect.

03:21:40.690 --> 03:21:42.600
I have a six-year-old.

03:21:42.600 --> 03:21:45.580
Glad to see the Google's
moving that direction.

03:21:45.580 --> 03:21:49.270
My question is about women in
the development community.

03:21:49.270 --> 03:21:51.960
I'm looking around and I
don't see a lot here.

03:21:51.960 --> 03:21:53.920
And I'd like to know
what we can do to

03:21:53.920 --> 03:21:55.370
encourage women to be here.

03:21:55.370 --> 03:22:00.280
[APPLAUSE]

03:22:00.280 --> 03:22:02.270
AUDIENCE: It's a simple
question.

03:22:02.270 --> 03:22:04.160
LARRY PAGE: Yeah, I mean, we've
been super focused on

03:22:04.160 --> 03:22:05.410
that forever.

03:22:07.770 --> 03:22:09.730
Sergey and I, when we were
interviewing people, we spent

03:22:09.730 --> 03:22:12.850
a lot of time interviewing women
for that reason, trying

03:22:12.850 --> 03:22:17.090
to make sure our company didn't
end up all male, which

03:22:17.090 --> 03:22:18.655
I think is a really,
really bad thing.

03:22:18.655 --> 03:22:22.960
So I think ultimately the only
answer is we have to start

03:22:22.960 --> 03:22:26.990
early and make sure we're
getting more young women and

03:22:26.990 --> 03:22:30.340
girls really excited
about technology.

03:22:30.340 --> 03:22:33.380
And I think if we do that,
there's no question we'll more

03:22:33.380 --> 03:22:36.730
than double the rate of progress
that we have in the

03:22:36.730 --> 03:22:38.290
technology world.

03:22:38.290 --> 03:22:40.140
So we all need to do that.

03:22:40.140 --> 03:22:42.090
We're trying to help with
that in any way we can.

03:22:42.090 --> 03:22:43.998
And thank you for
the question.

03:22:43.998 --> 03:22:45.252
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

03:22:45.252 --> 03:22:45.670
LARRY PAGE: Yeah.

03:22:45.670 --> 03:22:46.920
All right, one more question.

03:22:49.440 --> 03:22:51.750
AUDIENCE: Jefrey Siegal with
the University of Michigan.

03:22:51.750 --> 03:22:55.250
While you had mentioned that
regulation is usually the

03:22:55.250 --> 03:22:58.210
biggest problem trying to get
technology into health care,

03:22:58.210 --> 03:23:01.060
I'm curious if you're going to
be doing anything with DNA

03:23:01.060 --> 03:23:03.590
sequencing considering you
actually have all the

03:23:03.590 --> 03:23:06.760
horsepower behind it, and also
image analysis, with things

03:23:06.760 --> 03:23:09.470
like surgical slides and whatnot
because it seems like

03:23:09.470 --> 03:23:12.060
that's a really big area that
we could get into to help

03:23:12.060 --> 03:23:13.730
people as a whole.

03:23:13.730 --> 03:23:15.500
LARRY PAGE: Yeah, I think those
are good questions.

03:23:15.500 --> 03:23:16.990
I don't have anything to
announce at the time.

03:23:16.990 --> 03:23:21.120
But we always look
at these areas.

03:23:21.120 --> 03:23:23.920
We have felt it's a difficult
area for us to work in.

03:23:23.920 --> 03:23:26.420
I think it's certainly
worth doing though.

03:23:26.420 --> 03:23:27.210
All right, let's take one more.

03:23:27.210 --> 03:23:28.460
Yes.

03:23:30.530 --> 03:23:32.810
AUDIENCE: I'm Josh Constine,
Techcrunch.

03:23:32.810 --> 03:23:36.030
Could you discuss Google's
plan for bringing the

03:23:36.030 --> 03:23:39.820
developing world online and what
you see as the social,

03:23:39.820 --> 03:23:42.560
cultural, and political impacts
of democratized access

03:23:42.560 --> 03:23:43.780
to the internet?

03:23:43.780 --> 03:23:45.640
LARRY PAGE: That's a really
great question.

03:23:45.640 --> 03:23:48.100
One of the things I always talk
about in the company when

03:23:48.100 --> 03:23:52.610
I talk to the company is that
smartphones are going to

03:23:52.610 --> 03:23:55.340
basically be amazing
in these places.

03:23:55.340 --> 03:23:59.570
And so you don't quite have
smartphones, for example,

03:23:59.570 --> 03:24:02.510
going into India or
Africa because

03:24:02.510 --> 03:24:04.710
they're just too expensive.

03:24:04.710 --> 03:24:10.110
The average cost of a phone in
India is very, very cheap, $50

03:24:10.110 --> 03:24:11.730
or $100 or less.

03:24:11.730 --> 03:24:13.600
I think more like $50.

03:24:13.600 --> 03:24:18.040
And I think that we need to make
sure that the prices of

03:24:18.040 --> 03:24:22.360
what we all are using quickly
make it down to those levels.

03:24:22.360 --> 03:24:23.850
And I think they will.

03:24:23.850 --> 03:24:27.400
That'll be the smartphone you
have today two or three years

03:24:27.400 --> 03:24:31.180
from now will be in
Africa and India.

03:24:31.180 --> 03:24:35.690
And that will be amazing because
I find I try to mostly

03:24:35.690 --> 03:24:38.610
use smartphones now
just to make sure

03:24:38.610 --> 03:24:40.750
I'm living that future.

03:24:40.750 --> 03:24:44.220
I find I can get almost
everything I need done.

03:24:44.220 --> 03:24:46.910
Unfortunately I don't get
to program that much.

03:24:46.910 --> 03:24:50.020
But I can do most things I need
to do to run the company

03:24:50.020 --> 03:24:51.250
on my phone.

03:24:51.250 --> 03:24:55.820
So I think that's pretty amazing
to think that that can

03:24:55.820 --> 03:24:59.470
go to three billion, four
billion, five billion, six

03:24:59.470 --> 03:25:03.830
billion, seven billion plus in
not very long period of time.

03:25:03.830 --> 03:25:09.360
And I think people are
underestimating how fast

03:25:09.360 --> 03:25:11.140
that's going to happen.

03:25:11.140 --> 03:25:14.070
I think it's clearly going to
happen very, very quickly.

03:25:14.070 --> 03:25:16.160
And I'm really, really
excited about that.

03:25:16.160 --> 03:25:18.560
We're trying to help that
happen quicker.

03:25:18.560 --> 03:25:20.250
But I'm very excited
about that.

03:25:20.250 --> 03:25:23.540
So thank you all so much for
spending so much time.

03:25:23.540 --> 03:25:32.790
[APPLAUSE]
