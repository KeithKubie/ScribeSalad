00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.970
In previous videos we've
already talked about the idea

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.990
that there are times
in Earth's orbit

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.740
when it is closer
to the sun and when

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.550
it is farther from the sun.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.926
And when it is
closer to the sun,

00:00:09.926 --> 00:00:12.300
so let's say that this is the
time in the orbit when it's

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.060
closer to the sun,
this is the perihelion.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.710
And when it's
farthest from the sun,

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.240
and I'm exaggerating the
difference, this is aphelion.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.164
This is the aphelion
in our orbit,

00:00:27.164 --> 00:00:28.580
when we are farthest
from the sun.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.355
And maybe our orbit looks
something like this.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.660
I shouldn't have the
bulge over there.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.040
So maybe our orbit looks
something like this over here.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.940
And what I point out in the
first video where we discuss

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.390
this is that this is not
the cause of the seasons.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.872
Even though we are 3% closer
right now, the way our orbit

00:00:53.872 --> 00:00:55.580
is set up, and we'll
see in future videos

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.600
that the difference or
the eccentricity, or how

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.320
elliptical the orbit is,
does change over time,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.180
how much it deviates
from being circular.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.850
That's one way to think
about eccentricity.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.920
That does change over time.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.560
But right now when we
are closest to the sun

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.640
we are 3% closer than when
we are farthest from the sun.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.654
So 3% closer than at aphelion.

00:01:19.654 --> 00:01:22.070
And we point out in the first
video when we discussed this

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.610
that this is not the
cause of the seasons.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.810
And in particular, perihelion
, when we were closest

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.320
to the sun, when we actually
have the most radiation from

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.730
the sun, that's actually when
we have the Northern Hemisphere

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:37.230
winter.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.820
So this occurs right over here.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.730
This occurs in January.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.030
And aphelion occurs in July.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.260
Now, based on this,
this might lead

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.600
to an interesting question,
because let's think

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.100
about January when
we're at perihelion,

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.610
and let's think about July
when we're at aphelion.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.047
Let me draw a quick
globe right over here.

00:02:07.047 --> 00:02:08.380
And let's make that the equator.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.880
And I'll draw it
in both situations.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.510
So January is obviously when
we have the Northern Hemisphere

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.010
winter.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.150
So I'll paint it in
blue right over here.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.070
It is winter.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.440
And July is when we have
the Northern Hemisphere

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.640
summer, or the Southern
Hemisphere winter.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.370
So then we have
winter during July

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.510
in the Southern Hemisphere.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.860
And let me put summer
in a more summery color.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.700
I guess that orange is
a pretty good color,

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.960
but that's not orange.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.110
Here's orange.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.370
All right.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.830
That's orange.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.930
And that's orange.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.095
So these are summer.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.760
So that's the summer in the
Southern Hemisphere, which

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.520
occurs during the winter the
Northern Hemisphere, and vice

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.170
versa.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.680
Summer in the
Northern Hemisphere

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.000
occurs during winter in
the Southern Hemisphere.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.260
And so the question might
be rising in your head,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.870
and I did see a few comments
on that first video asking

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.600
this question, and
it's a good one.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.250
If we are closer to
the sun in January,

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.950
or we are closest to
the sun in January--

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.200
this is the perihelion
right over here--

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.520
and so we are getting more
solar radiation in January,

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.830
does that moderate the winter?

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.862
Does that moderate the winter
in the Northern Hemisphere?

00:03:30.862 --> 00:03:32.570
Or I guess another
way to think about it,

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.660
does it make the summer
in the Southern Hemisphere

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.960
when we are closer to
the sun, does it make it

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.570
more extreme, or hotter?

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.380
And vice versa, in July, when
we are farthest from the sun,

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.050
does that moderate the
Northern Hemisphere winter?

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.620
Because it's hot
out there, but hey,

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.203
we're little bit
farther from the sun.

00:03:53.203 --> 00:03:56.390
And does it make the Southern
Hemisphere winter colder?

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.760
So once again does it
make this more extreme?

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.370
Because it's already winter
and we're farther from the sun.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.652
So maybe we're also
getting less radiation.

00:04:04.652 --> 00:04:06.610
And so there's a couple
ways to think about it.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.000
One, it is true that
when we're farther

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.480
we are getting a little bit
less radiation from the sun

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.010
or we're getting heated
up a little bit less.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.860
But the one reality is that
the Southern Hemisphere climate

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:24.080
as a whole is not more
extreme despite getting

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.790
more solar energy in
the summer and getting

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.670
less solar energy in the winter.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.530
And the reason why it
is not as extreme--

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:31.904
Let me draw the
equator here just

00:04:31.904 --> 00:04:34.090
so we can separate
our hemispheres.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.700
The main reason it is believed
that it is not more extreme

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.247
is that the Southern Hemisphere
has a lot more water in it.

00:04:41.247 --> 00:04:43.330
So just if you look at the
surface of the Southern

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.400
Hemisphere you're looking
at a lot more water

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.415
than the surface of the
Northern Hemisphere.

00:04:47.415 --> 00:04:49.540
And this is, of course,
it's a Mercator projection,

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.831
and so it distorts things so
that things near the poles

00:04:51.831 --> 00:04:54.370
get really kind of built
up to look really huge even

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.010
though they really
aren't that big.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.210
Greenland really isn't
larger than South America.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.150
It just spreads them out so
that you can kind of flatten out

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.339
the map, so to speak.

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:06.130
But the Southern
Hemisphere has more water,

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.088
and as you may have
learned in chemistry class,

00:05:08.088 --> 00:05:11.670
water has a higher
specific heat.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.370
It takes a higher specific
energy, more heat,

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:23.210
to raise water a degree than
it does to raise land a degree.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.810
And so water can
absorb more energy.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.160
Or when there's
less energy, water

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.760
will release more energy
without dropping as much

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.540
of a temperature.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:37.400
So water has a moderating
influence on the climate.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.860
So even though the summers
in the Southern Hemisphere

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.700
actually are getting
more radiation

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.090
than the summers in the
Northern Hemisphere,

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.956
it's moderated on the
actual temperature

00:05:45.956 --> 00:05:47.330
because the water
has the ability

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.270
to absorb more of that
heat without changing

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.670
the temperature as dramatically.

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.980
Now, with that said, it is
true that in general Antarctica

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.730
is colder.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.830
Antarctica is colder
than the North Pole.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.520
But the main reason
why Antarctica

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.680
is colder, besides the
fact that it's on land,

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.920
as opposed to the
North Pole being

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.530
in the center of
the Arctic Ocean,

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.560
is that it's actually a huge,
very high altitude ice sheet.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.920
And so the altitude
for most of Antarctica

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.730
is around 8,000 feet.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.760
So it's kind of like
an alpine altitude.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.380
So the main reason
why it's colder

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.175
is possibly being farther
away from the sun in winter

00:06:27.175 --> 00:06:29.800
might play some role there, but
the main reason why it's colder

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.030
is it is just at a
much higher altitude,

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.390
and it's to some degree
insulated from the water,

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:36.290
or I guess you could
say it's on the land.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.990
So especially during
the long winters

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.830
it's going to get
that much colder.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.440
But I'll leave you there,
and to some degree,

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.900
and this is the other aspect
of it, during the summers--

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.440
And all of this stuff
is super complicated.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.274
So you can't just draw
out one rule of thumb

00:06:50.274 --> 00:06:51.398
and say this is the reason.

00:06:51.398 --> 00:06:52.850
But these are all
the influences--

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.350
is that if you have a
super large ice sheet

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.660
it's also more likely to
reflect more of the energy

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.600
because it's white,
as opposed to a darker

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.410
color like the
ocean or the land.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.410
And so you can think about
all of those factors,

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:08.130
but the general answer
is it's a good question.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.450
But overall, the climate
in the Southern Hemisphere

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:13.020
is not more extreme than
the climate in the Southern

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.196
Hemisphere, even though
Antarctica is colder.
