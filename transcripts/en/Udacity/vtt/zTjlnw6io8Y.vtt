To finish up our last problem, we simply simplify the denominator. The cube

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.910
root of 3 cubed is 3, the cube root of x to the 9th is x cubed, and the cube

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.980
root of y to the 6 is y squared. Remember, the whole idea here was to

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.151
rationalize this denominator. We wanted a denominator that didn't contain a

00:00:17.151 --> 00:00:21.508
radical. So we multiplied by enough factors underneath of a cube root, in order

00:00:21.508 --> 00:00:25.750
to change our denominator to something that we could simplify. For our

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.215
numerator, we just had 1 time this cube root, and then we simplified the cube

00:00:29.215 --> 00:00:34.352
root, 3 squared is 9, and then I have my variables x squared y squared. We know

00:00:34.352 --> 00:00:36.914
we can't simplify this cube root of all, since all the factors only appear

00:00:36.914 --> 00:00:41.571
twice. And it's okay that we can't simplify the numerator, because our ultimate

00:00:41.571 --> 00:00:46.697
goal was to rationalize this denominator. We wanted to get rid of this radical

00:00:46.697 --> 00:00:48.383
symbol here.
