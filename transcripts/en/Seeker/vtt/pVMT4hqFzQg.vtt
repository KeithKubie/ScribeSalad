00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.790
Helicopters kinda look like fat bugs lying
on their backs flailing their legs around…

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:15.009
so how exactly can they fly with more precision
than an airplane?

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:18.500
Airplanes fly because their wings are curved
on the top and flat on the bottom, allowing

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.890
them to harness the Bernoulli Principle.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.250
With speed, the air passing over the wing
is less dense than the air under it, creating

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.250
lift.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.190
Helicopters have rotor blades that also create
lift.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.330
As the blades spin they move the air.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.470
Less dense air passes over the blades with
denser air passing underneath it.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.480
Put that way it sounds simple, but it’s
far more complicated, because while airplanes

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.629
get lift naturally by moving through the air
helicopters have to constantly generate it

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:45.629
themselves.

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.580
This is how they can takeoff and land vertically,
and also fly backwards, sideways, and hover

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.590
in place.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.129
But they can’t glide if something goes wrong;
they aren’t aerodynamic like planes.

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.489
Helicopters fly by sheer brute force, which
is really incredible, but gives them some

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.489
limits.

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.239
Planes can fly upside-down — the fixed wing
means that as long as air is moving over the

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.100
wing, usually by tilting the nose upwards
slightly, it still has lift.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.720
As a helicopter’s rotor spins, the generated
thrust moves upwards with the direction of

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.159
lift, so flying upside-down would demand redirecting
the blades so the thrust is the opposite way,

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.460
supporting an upside-down vehicle.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.729
That said, a helicopter could fly a barrel
roll if it was moving fast enough, but that’s

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.729
a stunt you’re more likely to see at an
airshow than from a news helicopter over a

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:30.729
city.

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.740
Speaking of helicopters over cities, you always
know when one is out there.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.740
Because they’re loud.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.659
They’re loud not because of the engine,
but because the blades are running into turbulence

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.540
from each other, properly called the blade–vortex
interaction: the tips of the rotor blades

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.430
vibrate against the air as they whip around.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.509
Airplane wings have changed overtime to have
flaps and malleable shapes that react to flight

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.869
conditions.

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.520
Helicopters have done this too; different
blade shapes, tip shapes, and even materials

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.439
have shown to decrease the noise of a helicopter.

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:04.899
One kind of blade has flaps on edge of that
move 15 to 40 times a second to reduce the

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.400
noisey blade-vortex interaction.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.760
Even NASA is looking into developing better
blades for a quieter helicopter, looking to

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.270
a future where larger, versions can carry
a sizable passenger load between cities.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.400
Without runways, commuter chopper flights
could limit air traffic congestion.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.400
But helicopters with one rotor can only lift
so much.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.310
Which is why bigger choppers like the Chinook
have two.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.290
More blades can provide more lift, but it
also adds weight and complexity.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.459
For a heavier helicopter the extra lift from
the added blades is sometimes vital.

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.930
Not only do those look cool, but they’re
useful.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.760
Just like a helicopter should be.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.310
