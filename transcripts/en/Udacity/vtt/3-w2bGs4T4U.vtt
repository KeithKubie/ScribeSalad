&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now that we have our equation in this form, factored and everything, I'd like

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.429
you to tell me at what values of x does this parabola cross the x-axis. I'll

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.781
write an x equals here outside of the box to remind you that we just want values

00:00:12.781 --> 00:00:17.028
of x or x-coordinates of the points where this happens. Now, I'd like you to

00:00:17.028 --> 00:00:21.035
write all the different values you get in this box, separated by commas.
