00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.340
So this pedigree of red-green colorblindness is an example

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.960
of a sex-linked inheritance pattern where the trait itself

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.840
only affects one sex as far as we can

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.840
tell. In this case males. Now although the trait

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.230
only presents in males, the allele theoretically can be

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.900
transmitted through the female line, even though they are

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.400
unaffected. Now, based on what you know about the

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.170
sex chromosomes; two X chromosomes make a female, and an

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.040
X and a Y chromosome make a male. Is the allele that causes this trait on the

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.060
X or Y chromosome? And do you think the

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.640
allele that causes this trait is dominant or recessive?
