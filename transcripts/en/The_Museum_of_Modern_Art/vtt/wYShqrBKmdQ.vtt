Sarah: Oh, my god... I felt like we did 1,800 takes of me

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.060
saying “Hi, my name is Sarah Meister.”

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.120
Sarah: Hi, I'm Sarah Meister.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.910
I'm a Curator of Photography here at The Museum
of Modern Art.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.290
Lee Ann: And I'm Lee Ann Daffner.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.309
I'm the Conservator of Photography at The
Museum of Modern Art.

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.430
Sarah: We have 30,000 photographs or more
in the Museum's collection.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.390
How do we take care of them?

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.460
This raises so many interesting issues, so
we thought it would be fun to do a Live Q&amp;A

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.540
where you can send us your questions and we
can try to answer them.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.460
Lee Ann: One thing that we might touch on
is the difference between a physical photograph

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.400
versus a digital image.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.560
How do we examine photographs?

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.560
What tools do we use?

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.990
Sarah: “How do I figure out what it is that
I have

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.930
how I should display it or take care of it”,
“Are there any photographs that are so sensitive

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.330
that we can't actually display them?”

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.630
The answer is yes.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.460
We'll even get into the nitty gritty of when
we disagree, how do we deal with that.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.080
Sarah: So, please send us your questions.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.510
You can leave them in the comments section
on this video.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.520
Or tune in live next Wednesday and we'll
answer them during the Live Q&amp;A.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.220
Lee Ann: In the meantime, you can check out
some videos either on conservation or on photography.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.120
Sarah: Or, you can take our online course,
“Seeing Through Photographs.”

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.960
Lee Ann: See you on Wednesday.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.009
Sarah: See you on Wednesday.
