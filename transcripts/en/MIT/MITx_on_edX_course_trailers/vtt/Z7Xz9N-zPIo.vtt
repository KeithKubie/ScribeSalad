SPEAKER: Hi.

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.340
Welcome to Unceractuated Robotics.

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.730
Underactuated Robotics is the science
of building robots that reason about

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.250
and exploit their dynamics to make
them more efficiently, more gracefully,

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.320
more aggressively through the world.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.320
The class is going to take a very
computational approach to the problem.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.084
That's because I believe that as the
robots are getting more complicated,

00:00:20.084 --> 00:00:22.000
and the environments
that they're operating in

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.750
are getting more complicated, that
actually algorithms will succeed,

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.095
even when our ability to design a
control system with a pencil and paper

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:30.176
will fail.

00:00:30.176 --> 00:00:34.140
We're going to see examples from very
simple mathematical models of robots.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.500
From walking robots, hopping
robots, basic manipulation,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.080
and basic flying robots.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.559
These simple models are easy for
us to understand analytically.

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.350
But we're also going to see examples
of the same algorithms applied

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.035
to very complex robots
on our research robots

00:00:50.035 --> 00:00:54.650
here at MIT, including walking
robots, a quadruped robot that

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.720
can walk over rough terrain, a humanoid
robot that can perform manipulation

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.830
tasks, even an airplane
that can land on a perch.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.170
The problem sets are going to force
you to write some of the algorithms

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.710
yourself.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.650
But we're also going to give you a
fairly substantial open source software

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.970
distribution, which has relatively
mature implementations on most

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.300
of these algorithms.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.720
So you can apply the best
versions of these algorithms

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.230
that we have to your robots right
away, if you have them at home.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.010
So I hope you decide to take the course.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.750
We're looking forward to a fun term.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.900
