00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.070
We've already spoken to you about
the importance of user feedback.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.640
Learning from and responding to
feedback is incredibly important.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.390
But now, let's hear from the expert
about their real world experience using

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.340
feedback to learn about their customer's
needs and to better their product.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.327
&gt;&gt; So
I am VP of mobile a UserTesting, and

00:00:17.327 --> 00:00:20.870
UserTesting is a company that let's
you get really, really fast turn

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.431
around videos of normal people
using your application or website.

00:00:24.431 --> 00:00:28.238
So you come to us, you define the test
you need, the demographics, and

00:00:28.238 --> 00:00:30.940
you get videos back often
in as little as an hour.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.560
So it's a really fast turnaround.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.500
So what you can learn on the marketing
side is getting more insights into

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.340
what's going on in the heads of your
customers and how well are you matching

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.090
what's happening in what
they're thinking about.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.150
So it can be early stages when you're
working on your marketing materials,

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.980
testing it out on people, finding out
what sorts of things they respond to

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.060
well and which things they don't like.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.060
Or it can be later on,

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.178
after you've launched when
you're looking at analytics or

00:00:55.178 --> 00:00:57.997
things like that and trying to get
more insights on the behaviours that

00:00:57.997 --> 00:01:00.210
you're seeing in what
customers are doing.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.740
So times when you can use user tests
just alone, there are two categories.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.790
One is when you're really interested
just in understanding emotional context,

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.910
because analytics won't
give you that stuff at all,

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.830
it's like how are they feeling about it,
are they feeling engaged,

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.700
are they interested, are they feeling
like they're making progress?

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.560
And sometimes when I watch the videos,
I actually just look for

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.100
tone of voice more than anything else.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.321
So for example, if you're testing an app
and at some point during the test,

00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:36.717
the user sighs, they do this [SOUND],
you know you're in deep, deep trouble.

00:01:36.717 --> 00:01:39.590
I mean,
it could be a in foreign language.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.920
If you just hear, or the tone of voice
is, well, you kind of get that trailing

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.319
off tone of voice, what that is telling
you is that you are failing to grab them

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.718
emotionally which means you are not
creating the motivation which will cause

00:01:52.718 --> 00:01:55.763
them to come back in the future
to use your app again and

00:01:55.763 --> 00:01:59.042
you've really got a problem
that you need to go dig into.

00:01:59.042 --> 00:02:02.745
I think the second place where
the user test can stand alone is when

00:02:02.745 --> 00:02:07.186
the conclusions are so clear that, hey
we don't need [LAUGH] analysis on this,

00:02:07.186 --> 00:02:09.985
it's really obvious what's going on.

00:02:09.985 --> 00:02:15.570
And one class of these is when you find
that there's particular language or

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.930
maybe an icon design or something like
that that just doesn't work for them.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.230
And a lot of times, because the team
has been working on the app for

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.810
a long time, you get this kind
of group think situation where

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.580
because it's become clear to you over
time that this is how it should work, or

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.600
this is what the context
of this stuff means,

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.580
this phrase is very meaningful to
the team for describing the application,

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.500
therefore, it's gotta mean
the same thing to the users.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.040
And what you'll find very often is it
is not intuitive to them and actually,

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.390
you need to step back and
get inside their head and

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.840
the user test can show you that
sort of stuff very quickly.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.590
If the icon is not intuitive,
they'll just look at it and

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.290
say, what the heck am
I supposed to do here?

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.140
And that's the point where you need to
think about, okay, either redraw it or

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.950
maybe add a text label,
which is not sexy,

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.440
it doesn't look beautiful, but we're
after usability more than we are beauty.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.070
I mean,
it's great if you can get both, but

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.760
I'd rather have it be usable first and
then pretty it up as much as you can.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.660
The user test can be a great way to
very rapidly get those insights, so

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.110
you can fix them right in the moment.
