00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:06.030
So if we put BRCA1 in the context of how we actually get a breast tumor. The

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.440
epidemiological data shows that if you have a

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.680
normal BRCA1, there's about a 12% risk of having

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.420
breast cancer. Whereas if you have this 5382

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.370
insertion of cytosine in the BRCA1 coating region, you

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.230
end up with about a 60% risk of

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.770
breast cancer. Now what's actually happening here, BRCA1 when

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.400
there's a fully functional protein is able to

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.500
repair DNA damage, right we said its normal function

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.660
is actually maintain genetic stability in a cell

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.440
and it helps to fix certain kinds of mutations.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.820
This insertion of a cytosine causes a frameshift

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.130
which does change a lot if amino acids but

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.660
it also probably is going to end up. With a

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.770
stop codon earlier than expected which would truncate or

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.300
shorten the protein and its overall function is

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.490
going to be disrupted. Because it can't carry out

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.650
its function of fixing these mutations inside the cell.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.230
Those mutations can persist, cause other problems, and eventually

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.110
turn into a tumor. So now our risk is elevated to about 60%. So how does a

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.900
BRCA1 protein normally repair mutations that it finds in.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.450
Breast tissue cells. Well you remember from lesson six,

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.410
we learned that there are induced mutations that

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.410
can come from many places including X-ray energy. It

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.240
can actually nick the DNA backward and literally cut

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.580
a DNA strand in half like this. Remember, this

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.390
is bad news bears. This is like separating

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.010
a chromosome. This is not good, a cell needs

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.780
to fix this quickly. BRCA1 is a critical protein

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.450
that's able to get these two broken strands of

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.150
DNA back together again. Of course it has the help of

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.060
a lot of other proteins as well. But as long as

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.350
BRCA1 is functioning efficiently with all the other proteins. Then we

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.600
can actually fix this mutation and get our DNA strand glued

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.880
back together. So although there were other back up repair mechanisms,

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.470
without a fully functioning BRCA1 the DNA has a higher chance

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.310
of going unrepaired and eventually enough mutations occur, it could cause

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.600
the cells to grow out of control and form a tumor,

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.400
thus, your risk for breast cancer with the BRCA1

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.490
mutation. Is much higher. So based on this function

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.000
for BRCA1, what would you expect, this 5382 insertion

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.550
of cytosine, the frameshift mutation to be? Dominant? Or recessive?
