00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.440
We're on problem 17.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.850
And it asks us which expression
shows the complete

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:15.310
factorization of 12x
squared minus 147?

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:16.920
Let's see, first of all,
can we factor out?

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.750
147 is a strange
looking number.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.690
Let's see if we can factor
out something.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.390
It's definitely not divisible
by 12, because

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.490
12 goes into 144.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.460
Is it divisible by 3?

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.230
1 plus 4 is 5, 5 plus 7 is 12,
and 12 is divisible by 3.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.409
And I don't know if you've
seen that before.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:35.420
You just add up the digits and
if that is divisible by 3,

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.120
then the number's
divisible by 3.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.100
So 147 is the divisible by 3.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.700
Let's see what it is.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.570
Let's work it out.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.460
It's 4 times 3 is
12, 27, it's 49.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.960
So we can factor
3 out of this.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.761
So then it becomes 3 times--
what's 12 divided by 3-- 4x

00:00:55.761 --> 00:01:00.410
squared minus-- 147 divided
by 3, which we just

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.070
figured out, was 49.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.340
And now this, once again, looks
just like a squared

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.250
minus b squared, where a would
be 2x and b would be 9.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.320
So now we can factor
that more.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.910
And I'll just switch
colors arbitrarily.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:25.690
That becomes 3 times a plus b,
so that would be 2x plus 7

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.420
times a minus b.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.380
2x minus 7.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.030
And that is choice D.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.780
In choice D, they wrote the 2x
minus 7 first, but it's the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:36.315
same difference.

00:01:36.315 --> 00:01:38.140
So it's choice D.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.930
Problem 18.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.780
Let me see if I can get
problem 18 going.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.720
Problem 18.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.310
Well, maybe I should
cut and paste it.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.260
Why not?

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.650
So I copied it and then
let me paste it here.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.140
That's the problem.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.900
I'll rewrite it because I don't
if that's big enough for

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.390
you to see.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:08.479
So it says x plus 3 over x plus
5 plus 6 over x squared

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.040
plus 3x minus 10.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.170
So when you add fractions,
whether you're doing it with

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.030
algebraic fractions or regular
fractions, you have to find a

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.510
common denominator.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.260
And let's see, we have to find
the least common multiple of

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.960
the denominators here, but I
have a suspicion that this x

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.260
plus 5 goes into this.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.150
So let's see if I
can factor this.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.000
What two numbers, when I
multiply them, equal minus 10,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.710
and when I add them
equal plus 3?

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:34.030
Let's see.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.930
Well, 5 times what
is minus 10?

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.730
It's 5 times minus 2 and 5 plus
minus 2 is 3, so that

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.870
works. x minus 2.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.060
So this is actually our
least common multiple.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.110
This expression right here.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.880
So let me write it that way.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.570
So that is equal to-- I'm just
going to rewrite this as x

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.200
plus 5 over x minus 2.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.420
Now, x plus 3 over x plus 5, if
we were to multiply both of

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.680
those times x minus 2 to get
something in this form, this x

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.250
plus 3 over x plus 5 is the same
thing as x plus 3 times x

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.480
minus 2 over x plus 5 times
x minus 2, right?

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.680
You could just cancel this
out right here and

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.260
you'd get back to that.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.970
And now we're adding that.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.120
We're adding this term
to this term.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.420
6 over this, well, this is the
same thing as this, so that's

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.780
just plus 6.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.836
And now we just get into
simplification mode.

00:03:33.836 --> 00:03:39.122
So x times x is x squared.

00:03:39.122 --> 00:03:43.380
x times minus 2 is minus 2x.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.940
3 times x is plus 3x.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.340
3 times minus 2 is minus 6, so
that's this term right here.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.880
Got us that.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.120
And then we have the plus 6.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.030
And then all of that
is over this stuff.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.580
And I look at the choices and it
seems like they have it in

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.830
this form, so I'll just
write it in that form.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.060
x squared plus 3x minus 10.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.920
And let's see, the minus 6 and
the plus 6 cancels out, and

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.240
we're left with minus
2x plus 3x.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:22.540
So that's x squared-- minus 2
plus 3-- plus x over x squared

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.760
plus 3x minus 10.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.590
And that is choice A.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.180
Choice A.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.030
Next problem.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.020
I'm almost out of space.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.980
I'll draw a line here, just so
you don't get distracted.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:41.720
What is the simplified form of,
and they write 3a squared

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:48.570
b to the third, c to the minus
2, all of that over--

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:57.180
interesting-- a to the minus 1
b squared c, and all of that

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.090
is to the third power.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.660
So let's get in simplification
mode.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.820
So this bottom part, we can
re-simplify as-- let's see,

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:06.770
maybe I wrote too big.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.630
3a squared, b to the third,
c to the minus 2.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.610
All of that, it's a to the
negative 1, b squared, c to

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.220
the third power, that's
each of these items

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.090
to the third power.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.070
So a to the minus 1 to
the third power.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.470
You can multiply
the exponents.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.050
That becomes a to the minus 3.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.200
I just took the negative
1 times the 3.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.360
b squared to the third power.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.500
That's b to the 2 times 3.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.200
That's b to the sixth power.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.990
And then finally c.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.770
Well, that's just c to the first
of the third power, so

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.020
that's c to the third.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.740
And now we can just say, well,
this is the same thing.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:42.790
Let me switch colors.

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.890
This color's getting mundane.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:53.750
This is equal to 3 times a to
the 2-- we're dividing by a to

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.900
the negative third-- so
it's 2 minus minus 3.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.090
Let me write that, just so you
understand-- 2 minus minus 3

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.160
power-- that's where I got the
2; that's where I got the

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:09.170
minus 3, and I subtracted
because I'm dividing-- times b

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:18.300
to the 3 minus 6, times c
to the minus 2 minus 3.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.200
Once again, if we were
multiplying these two, I would

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.890
add the exponents.

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.020
But anyway, let's
simplify this.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:30.850
This equals 3a, 2 minus minus,
so that's plus, 3a to the

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:36.330
fifth, b to the minus
3, c to the minus 5.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:44.050
And this is the same thing
as 3a to the fifth.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.120
b to the minus 3 is the same
thing as 1 over b to the

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.875
third, so over b to the third.

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:53.390
And this is the same thing
as 1 over c to the fifth.

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:56.290
And that is choice A.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.650
Choice A.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:58.900
Next problem.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.280
Next problem.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.830
Oh, we already finished
that page.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.670
All right.

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:09.990
Let me copy and paste
what they wrote.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:19.730
Let me put it at the top of this
right there and paste it.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.600
That's what they're asking
and I'll write it.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.630
20x to the minus fourth
over 27y squared

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:27.590
divided by this fraction.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.620
So first of all, when you divide
by a fraction, that's

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.120
the same thing as multiplying
by the inverse, right?

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.520
So let's do that.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.130
I want to get rid of this
pesky-looking division sign.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:44.130
So let's rewrite this as 20x to
the minus fourth over 27y

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.770
squared times-- instead of
dividing by this, let's

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:49.070
multiply by the inverse.

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.600
So what's the inverse?

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:57.570
15y to the minus 5 over
8x to the minus 3.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:59.340
I just flipped it.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:00.500
All right?

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.600
So let's see what
we can do here.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.890
It seems like a lot of these
numbers have common factors.

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:11.530
Let's see, if we divide 15
by 3 and 27 by 3, so

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.910
this becomes 5.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.960
27 divided by 3 becomes 9.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.380
And just so you can think,
you can view this as one

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.760
continuous denominator or
one continuous fraction.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.020
20x to the minus 4 times-- well,
now it's 5y to the minus

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.780
fifth divided by 9y squared.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.440
Because when you multiply
fractions, you just multiply

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.230
the numerator times the
numerator divided by the

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:32.140
denominator times
the denominator.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.950
Anyway, let's just
keep simplifying.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:39.669
If you divide this
by 4, you get 5.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:42.190
If you divide this
by 4, you get 2.

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:44.450
Let's see, I don't want to do
too many steps all at once.

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:51.480
You get 5x to the minus fourth
times 5y to the minus fifth,

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:58.040
all of that over 9y squared
times 2x to the minus 3.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:58.290
So let's see.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:59.420
Let's get all the numbers out.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:09.220
So that is equal to 5 times 5
is 25 over 9 times 2 is 18

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:15.590
times x-- let's do the x-- x to
the minus 4-- minus because

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.950
we're dividing-- minus 3.

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:29.050
Minus minus 3 times y to the
minus 5 minus 2, because we're

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:30.420
dividing by that one.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:34.850
And that is equal to 25/18.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:39.010
Let's see, a minus minus,
so that becomes a plus.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:44.010
Minus 4 plus 3, x to the
negative 1, and then minus 5

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:47.170
minus 2, y to the minus 7.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.270
This is the same thing
as 1 over x to the 1.

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:54.830
This is the same thing
is 1 over y to the 7.

00:09:54.830 --> 00:10:01.006
So this is equal to
25 over 18x, 1

00:10:01.006 --> 00:10:04.460
over x, y to the seventh.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.050
y to the seventh in the
denominator is the same thing

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.300
as y to the minus seventh
in the numerator.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.390
Anyway, that is choice--
let's see, 25 over 18--

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:13.630
that is choice D.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.020
Choice D.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.080
And I'm out of time.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.800
See you in the next video.
