00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.895
Oh, hey.

00:00:04.895 --> 00:00:06.520
Are you lost?

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.975
Hi, how are you?

00:00:07.975 --> 00:00:09.040
Oh, come here.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.540
Come here.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.580
Let's have a look at you.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.700
Oh hi.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.780
What have we here?

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.340
You've got a QR
code on your collar.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.960
Wow, high tech dog.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.000
So let's see.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.450
Let's scan that.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:21.550
So your name is Cheyenne.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:22.410
Hi, Cheyenne.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.950
How are you?

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.640
And wow, we got your
mommy and daddy's address,

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.931
so you're not going to be lost.

00:00:25.931 --> 00:00:27.465
We can find your way home.

00:00:27.465 --> 00:00:29.420
And you got a website?

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.670
You've got a favorite TV show?

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:31.670
You like "Defiance"?

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.430
Yeah, I like "Defiance"
too, but don't tell anybody.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.530
I got a thing for Stahma.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.930
And what's this?

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.630
Dog gets homicidally crazy
when it sees the color red?

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.220
Oh, stacko!

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:49.190
[GROWLING]

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.710
Barcodes and QR codes can
hold amazing amounts of data.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.080
And having a mobile
device in their pocket

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.550
giving access to this
data can be greatly

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.200
empowering to your users.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.610
I'm Laurence Moroney.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.500
And I'm here today to talk
about the barcode APIs

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.240
that ship with
Google Play services

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.440
and how you can use them.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.290
To the untrained eye, you might
think that there are really

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.950
only two types of barcode, the
one dimensional and the two

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.200
dimensional.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.830
But within these, there
are lots of subformats.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.640
And you might find that,
if you roll your own API

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.050
or use an off-the-shelf
one, that the format you

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.140
need, or you want to
use, isn't supported.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.550
So with the Vision APIs,
we've built support

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.590
for lots of different types.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.460
No, I'm not going to
try to say them all.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.750
They typically store
a number, which

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.240
could then be used as an ID in
looking up data about an item.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.000
However, with the 2D barcode
types, lots of additional data,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.370
instead of just an
ID can be stored.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.560
And using these, you don't
need domain specific knowledge

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.760
to map the ID to some data.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.490
So for example, you could have
a URL, like our lost puppy had.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.860
And that URL can be a website
with data about the item

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.040
that you're tagging.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.460
It can be a link to
an app in the store.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.340
It can really be anything
you want it to be.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.090
And by the way, as you've
been watching this video,

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.569
some QR codes of
"valuable extra features"

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.610
have been popping up at
the bottom of the screen.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.710
Check them out.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.070
Indeed, when using
QR codes in PDF 417,

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.230
you have lots of data
types that they can store.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.980
Here's just a few.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.520
You've got URL, contact info,
calendar event, email, phone,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.490
SMS, Wi-Fi, geolocation,
even driver's license.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.750
And to use this in code
is very, very simple.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.600
You just create a
barcode detector.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.850
And you use a builder to
build that for your context.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.350
Now by default, it will look
for the major types of barcodes

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.730
that are shown here.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.530
You don't need to explicitly
set a barcode type.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.870
The barcode detector is smart
enough to manage it itself.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.520
But if you do want to set a
specific format to be detected,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.770
the detector has a
set format method

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.690
that allows you to do this.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.050
When it detects a
barcode, it will return

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.370
a barcode graphic object.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.170
And methods on
this will allow you

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.640
to draw the bounding
box for your barcode

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.580
as well as a preview
of its value.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.490
When using the Vision
API barcode detection,

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.580
the orientation
doesn't even matter.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.650
So you can read your
barcode if it's like this

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.660
or even like this.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.750
Now also, importantly,
all barcode interpretation

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.270
is done locally, so it's
really fast, not requiring

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.480
round trips to any server.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.020
Accessing data in the barcode is
as simple as reading a property

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.760
on the barcode object.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.630
So for example, to get the
little lost puppy's website,

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.790
I was simply able to use
barcode.urlbookmark property

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.290
as shown here.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.200
And that's how simple it is
to use barcodes in your app

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.810
with the Vision API.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.920
You can start programming for
this today with Google Play

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.620
services on Android.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.040
You can find more details
on the Google Developer site

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.540
at the link shown here.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.915
Thank you, and don't forget
to build better apps.
