00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.726
For this first problem, I plug in 3 for x, 3 squared is 9, and 5 times 3 is 15.

00:00:06.726 --> 00:00:13.494
Summing up these numbers I get 30. For g of zero, I let x equals zero, and that

00:00:13.494 --> 00:00:20.578
leaves me with 6. For g of negative 2, I substitute negative 2n for x. Negative

00:00:20.578 --> 00:00:27.233
2 squared is positive 4. And then 5 times negative 2 is negative 10. If I add

00:00:27.233 --> 00:00:34.062
these numbers up, I get zero. For g of 4, I substitute 4 in for x. 4 squared is

00:00:34.062 --> 00:00:40.575
16. And 5 times 4 is 20. This sum is 42. So when my input was 4, my output is

00:00:40.575 --> 00:00:45.365
42. Excellent work if you got all those right.
