took us a little longer last time we
 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.810
took us a little longer last time we
will spend the first hour discussing

multivariate calculus which we didn't
 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:03.799

will not do statistics today i know i

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549
will not do statistics today i know i
 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.310
will not do statistics today i know i
had promised that to you and i'm sure

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320
had promised that to you and i'm sure
 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.740
had promised that to you and i'm sure
you're terribly disappointed but most of

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750
you're terribly disappointed but most of
 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.620
you're terribly disappointed but most of
the statistics that you will need is

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630
the statistics that you will need is
 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.620
the statistics that you will need is
covered in the primer that i distributed

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630
covered in the primer that i distributed
 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.290
covered in the primer that i distributed
over the summer and what i will do

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300
over the summer and what i will do
 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.780
over the summer and what i will do
before we get if you're taking my

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790
before we get if you're taking my
 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.170
before we get if you're taking my
economics class before we get to the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180
economics class before we get to the
 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.360
economics class before we get to the
topic where you really need to know the

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370
topic where you really need to know the
 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.800
topic where you really need to know the
statistics i'll have an extra recitation

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810
statistics i'll have an extra recitation
 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.250
statistics i'll have an extra recitation
session after one of those classes to

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260
session after one of those classes to
 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.270
session after one of those classes to
give you a a primer on statistics so

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280
give you a a primer on statistics so
 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.450
give you a a primer on statistics so
that'll probably be 8pm to 10pm some

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460
that'll probably be 8pm to 10pm some
 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.609
that'll probably be 8pm to 10pm some
monday night okay so multivariate

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619
monday night okay so multivariate
 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.310
monday night okay so multivariate
calculus we're going to do multivariate

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320
calculus we're going to do multivariate
 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.780
calculus we're going to do multivariate
functions and talk about partial

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790
functions and talk about partial
 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.760
functions and talk about partial
differentiation which you'll see is an

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770
differentiation which you'll see is an
 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.449
differentiation which you'll see is an
analog of differentiation so let's just

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459
analog of differentiation so let's just
 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.910
analog of differentiation so let's just
jump into that remember that when we

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920
jump into that remember that when we
 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.089
jump into that remember that when we
were talking about univariate functions

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099
were talking about univariate functions
 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:28.039
were talking about univariate functions
then we said that we would look for the

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049
then we said that we would look for the
 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.449
then we said that we would look for the
derivative we would look for a point on

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459
derivative we would look for a point on
 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.519
derivative we would look for a point on
the function where the derivative of

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:34.529
the function where the derivative of
 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:35.420
the function where the derivative of
that function

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430
that function
 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.170
that function
was equal to zero alternatively the

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180
was equal to zero alternatively the
 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.110
was equal to zero alternatively the
point on the function where the tangent

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120
point on the function where the tangent
 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.520
point on the function where the tangent
line to that function at that point is

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530
line to that function at that point is
 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.559
line to that function at that point is
horizontal and if we had a convex

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569
horizontal and if we had a convex
 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.929
horizontal and if we had a convex
function then such a point would be a

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:56.939
function then such a point would be a
 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:59.899
function then such a point would be a
local minimum and if we have a concave

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909
local minimum and if we have a concave
 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:03.530
local minimum and if we have a concave
function such a point would be a local

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540
function such a point would be a local
 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.860
function such a point would be a local
maximum everybody recall this everybody

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870
maximum everybody recall this everybody
 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.179
maximum everybody recall this everybody
remember that this is the concave

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189
remember that this is the concave
 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:16.940
remember that this is the concave
function ok ok so what a multivariate

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950
function ok ok so what a multivariate
 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.780
function ok ok so what a multivariate
function so far we've had f of X as a

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790
function so far we've had f of X as a
 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.690
function so far we've had f of X as a
function of one variable X now suppose

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700
function of one variable X now suppose
 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.970
function of one variable X now suppose
we have a multivariate function sum

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980
we have a multivariate function sum
 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.979
we have a multivariate function sum
function that depends on two variables

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989
function that depends on two variables
 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.709
function that depends on two variables
you would think that most functions are

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:30.719
you would think that most functions are
 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:32.720
you would think that most functions are
probably like that most real world

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730
probably like that most real world
 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.280
probably like that most real world
functions depend on a number of

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290
functions depend on a number of
 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.990
functions depend on a number of
variables for example you might think of

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000
variables for example you might think of
 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.319
variables for example you might think of
agricultural yield as a function of

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329
agricultural yield as a function of
 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.869
agricultural yield as a function of
labor input as well as fertilizer input

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879
labor input as well as fertilizer input
 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:49.309
labor input as well as fertilizer input
and maybe soil quality and irrigation or

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319
and maybe soil quality and irrigation or
 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.429
and maybe soil quality and irrigation or
rainfall and so on so in principle it

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:52.439
rainfall and so on so in principle it
 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:57.830
rainfall and so on so in principle it
could be many different X variables ok

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840
could be many different X variables ok
 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.089
could be many different X variables ok
in this case the x1 and x2 variables are

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099
in this case the x1 and x2 variables are
 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:06.439
in this case the x1 and x2 variables are
B and Z and so we have yield as a

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:06.449
B and Z and so we have yield as a
 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:13.030
B and Z and so we have yield as a
function of Labor b + Z fertilizer input

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040
 
 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.949
 
for a variable of two functions you can

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959
for a variable of two functions you can
 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.349
for a variable of two functions you can
display it on a three dimensional graph

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359
display it on a three dimensional graph
 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.930
display it on a three dimensional graph
just like for a function sorry I think I

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940
just like for a function sorry I think I
 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.330
just like for a function sorry I think I
switch that round right for a function

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340
switch that round right for a function
 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.310
switch that round right for a function
of two variables you can display the

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320
of two variables you can display the
 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.850
of two variables you can display the
graph of that function on a

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860
graph of that function on a
 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.310
graph of that function on a
three-dimensional Cartesian surface just

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320
three-dimensional Cartesian surface just
 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.370
three-dimensional Cartesian surface just
like for a one variable function we

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380
like for a one variable function we
 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.770
like for a one variable function we
displayed the graph on a two-dimensional

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780
displayed the graph on a two-dimensional
 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:55.190
displayed the graph on a two-dimensional
asian plane this is yield as a function

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200
asian plane this is yield as a function
 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.900
asian plane this is yield as a function
of labor input and fertilizer so I've

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910
of labor input and fertilizer so I've
 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:06.080
of labor input and fertilizer so I've
got fertilizer on this axis and labor on

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090
got fertilizer on this axis and labor on
 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.720
got fertilizer on this axis and labor on
that axis with yield going up vertically

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730
that axis with yield going up vertically
 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.240
that axis with yield going up vertically
you can't really read the labor there

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250
you can't really read the labor there
 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.100
you can't really read the labor there
too well so if you think about this

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110
too well so if you think about this
 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.860
too well so if you think about this
surface it looks like a hill that starts

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870
surface it looks like a hill that starts
 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.930
surface it looks like a hill that starts
out at zero where labor input is zero

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940
out at zero where labor input is zero
 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.600
out at zero where labor input is zero
and fertilizer input is 0 so yield is

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610
and fertilizer input is 0 so yield is
 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.470
and fertilizer input is 0 so yield is
zero the units of yield would be in

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480
zero the units of yield would be in
 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:39.370
zero the units of yield would be in
terms of bushels of corn and so on

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380
terms of bushels of corn and so on
 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.500
terms of bushels of corn and so on
whistles of corn per acre yes since we

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510
whistles of corn per acre yes since we
 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.710
whistles of corn per acre yes since we
haven't included land in this okay and

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720
haven't included land in this okay and
 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:57.730
haven't included land in this okay and
then as you increase labor while keeping

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740
then as you increase labor while keeping
 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.250
then as you increase labor while keeping
if you were to increased labor while

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260
if you were to increased labor while
 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:08.930
if you were to increased labor while
keeping fertilizer zero in essence you

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940
keeping fertilizer zero in essence you
 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:16.190
keeping fertilizer zero in essence you
would have very little output but if you

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200
would have very little output but if you
 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.340
would have very little output but if you
were to increase labor and fertilizer so

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:19.350
were to increase labor and fertilizer so
 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.430
were to increase labor and fertilizer so
if you were to move out this way then

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440
if you were to move out this way then
 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.350
if you were to move out this way then
you can see yield is going to rise

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360
you can see yield is going to rise
 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.580

sharply till it'll reach some maximum

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590
sharply till it'll reach some maximum
 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.100
sharply till it'll reach some maximum
beyond which adding more fertilizer and

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110
beyond which adding more fertilizer and
 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.180
beyond which adding more fertilizer and
labor that is going out this way will

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190
labor that is going out this way will
 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:45.529
labor that is going out this way will
actually reduce yield okay so clearly so

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:45.539
actually reduce yield okay so clearly so
 

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:48.890
actually reduce yield okay so clearly so
11 use of this function might be simply

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900
11 use of this function might be simply
 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.950

to ask for a certain number of units of

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960
to ask for a certain number of units of
 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.460
to ask for a certain number of units of
fertilizer and labor what's the yield

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:55.470
fertilizer and labor what's the yield
 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.250
fertilizer and labor what's the yield
right and you would simply plug that in

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:58.260
right and you would simply plug that in
 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.649
right and you would simply plug that in
so let's say if you wanted two units of

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:00.659
so let's say if you wanted two units of
 

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:01.780
so let's say if you wanted two units of
Labor and three

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:01.790
Labor and three
 

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.870

one of the inputs only how would the

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:29.270
one of the inputs only how would the
 

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:33.580
one of the inputs only how would the
yield very as you varied the other input

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:33.590
yield very as you varied the other input
 

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:38.350
yield very as you varied the other input
so you hold constant one input and you

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:38.360
so you hold constant one input and you
 

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:43.630
so you hold constant one input and you
ask how would yield very as you vary the

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:43.640
ask how would yield very as you vary the
 

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.740

well for particular values of x y&amp;z what

00:12:25.879 --> 00:12:25.889
well for particular values of x y&amp;z what
 

00:12:25.889 --> 00:12:28.789
well for particular values of x y&amp;z what
is the rate of heat loss and so if X

00:12:28.789 --> 00:12:28.799
is the rate of heat loss and so if X
 

00:12:28.799 --> 00:12:31.489
is the rate of heat loss and so if X
were equal to 100 + y was equal to 70

00:12:31.489 --> 00:12:31.499
were equal to 100 + y was equal to 70
 

00:12:31.499 --> 00:12:33.530
were equal to 100 + y was equal to 70
and Zed we're equal to 50 what's the

like a you know i'd have the map of the

00:19:01.169 --> 00:19:01.179
like a you know i'd have the map of the
 

00:19:01.179 --> 00:19:03.620
like a you know i'd have the map of the
u.s. laid out horizontally on the ground

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:03.630
u.s. laid out horizontally on the ground
 

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:08.669
u.s. laid out horizontally on the ground
with the hill starting down here and

00:19:08.669 --> 00:19:08.679
with the hill starting down here and
 

00:19:08.679 --> 00:19:11.190
with the hill starting down here and
rising up to this top here the hottest

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.200
rising up to this top here the hottest
 

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:17.750
rising up to this top here the hottest
point in the US okay everybody see that

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760
point in the US okay everybody see that
 

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:22.140
point in the US okay everybody see that
okay so how do I get here's another

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:22.150
okay so how do I get here's another
 

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:28.470
okay so how do I get here's another
place here's another function here I've

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:28.480
place here's another function here I've
 

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:33.620
place here's another function here I've
got f as a function of x and y you

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:33.630
got f as a function of x and y you
 

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:37.260
got f as a function of x and y you
should get used to using different

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:37.270
should get used to using different
 

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:40.830
should get used to using different
letters for the different input

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:40.840
letters for the different input
 

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.750
letters for the different input
output variables so you notice for

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:42.760
output variables so you notice for
 

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.330
output variables so you notice for
example that I've used f as a function

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:45.340
example that I've used f as a function
 

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:50.399
example that I've used f as a function
of x1 and x2 y as a function of B and z

00:19:50.399 --> 00:19:50.409
of x1 and x2 y as a function of B and z
 

00:19:50.409 --> 00:19:54.090
of x1 and x2 y as a function of B and z
now I've got f as a function of x and y

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:54.100
now I've got f as a function of x and y
 

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.640
now I've got f as a function of x and y
so suddenly here y is an input variable

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:56.650
so suddenly here y is an input variable
 

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:59.370
so suddenly here y is an input variable
not an output variable okay so you need

00:19:59.370 --> 00:19:59.380
not an output variable okay so you need
 

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:02.610
not an output variable okay so you need
to look at the context of the problem to

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:02.620
to look at the context of the problem to
 

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:05.820
to look at the context of the problem to
determine what an input variable and

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:05.830
determine what an input variable and
 

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:10.169
determine what an input variable and
what's an output variable this is the

00:20:10.169 --> 00:20:10.179
what's an output variable this is the
 

00:20:10.179 --> 00:20:12.710
what's an output variable this is the
function it is x squared plus y squared

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720
function it is x squared plus y squared
 

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.360
function it is x squared plus y squared

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:15.370
when you draw level curves of this
 

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:17.460
when you draw level curves of this
function they'll just be concentric

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:17.470
function they'll just be concentric
 

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:23.820
function they'll just be concentric
circles around the origin okay okay a

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:23.830

inputs labor and capital that yield the
 

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:04.200
inputs labor and capital that yield the
same quantity of output okay so this is

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:04.210
same quantity of output okay so this is
 

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:09.000
same quantity of output okay so this is
is the function and that's the height of

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:09.010
is the function and that's the height of
 

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:31.510
is the function and that's the height of
that function so here 60l

the one that I solve for okay say I want
 

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.380
the one that I solve for okay say I want
well actually I guess I did it the other

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:54.390
well actually I guess I did it the other
 

00:22:54.390 --> 00:23:03.260
well actually I guess I did it the other
head say i want capital on the y-axis

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:03.270
head say i want capital on the y-axis
 

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:06.920
head say i want capital on the y-axis
and labor on the x-axis so I'm drawing

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:06.930
and labor on the x-axis so I'm drawing
 

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:11.270
and labor on the x-axis so I'm drawing
this is I'm looking down on the

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:11.280
this is I'm looking down on the
 

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:15.290
this is I'm looking down on the
production function from above this is a

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:15.300
production function from above this is a
 

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.590
production function from above this is a
map of all combinations of labor and

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:18.600
map of all combinations of labor and
 

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:25.220
map of all combinations of labor and
capital such that output is equal to six

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:25.230
capital such that output is equal to six
 

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:28.700
capital such that output is equal to six
hundred so I have to solve this equation

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:28.710
hundred so I have to solve this equation
 

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:31.340
hundred so I have to solve this equation
my production function set equal to six

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:31.350
my production function set equal to six
 

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:36.320
my production function set equal to six
hundred i solve that for k so i'm just

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:36.330
hundred i solve that for k so i'm just
 

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:39.950
hundred i solve that for k so i'm just
putting dividing both sides by 60 l to

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:39.960
putting dividing both sides by 60 l to
 

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.710
putting dividing both sides by 60 l to
the three three quarters

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:43.720
 
 

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:48.270
 
and then taking it to the fourth power

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:48.280
and then taking it to the fourth power
 

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.850
and then taking it to the fourth power
which is why it's 10 to the fourth power

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:50.860
which is why it's 10 to the fourth power
 

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:53.960
which is why it's 10 to the fourth power
and this to the fourth power so I get a

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:53.970
and this to the fourth power so I get a
 

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:58.580
and this to the fourth power so I get a
level curve that looks like this and the

00:23:58.580 --> 00:23:58.590
level curve that looks like this and the
 

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:05.610
level curve that looks like this and the
equation for this curve is 10,000 over L

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:05.620
equation for this curve is 10,000 over L
 

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:14.310
equation for this curve is 10,000 over L
cubed okay so there will be times when

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:14.320
cubed okay so there will be times when
 

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.250
cubed okay so there will be times when
you have to when you know the production

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:17.260
you have to when you know the production
 

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:20.850
you have to when you know the production
function of some technological process

00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:20.860
function of some technological process
 

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:28.169
function of some technological process
and you have to solve for the level

00:24:28.169 --> 00:24:28.179
and you have to solve for the level
 

00:24:28.179 --> 00:24:32.490
and you have to solve for the level
curve at a particular quantity of output

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:32.500
curve at a particular quantity of output
 

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:36.000
curve at a particular quantity of output
or you may not know the the

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:36.010
or you may not know the the
 

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:38.430
or you may not know the the
technological process and you may simply

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:38.440
technological process and you may simply
 

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:42.090
technological process and you may simply
observe these econometric relationships

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:42.100
observe these econometric relationships
 

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:44.700
observe these econometric relationships
in the data and you may be trying to

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:44.710
in the data and you may be trying to
 

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:50.159
in the data and you may be trying to
estimate the production function okay

00:24:50.159 --> 00:24:50.169
estimate the production function okay
 

00:24:50.169 --> 00:24:53.060
estimate the production function okay
and so they will be related in this way

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:53.070
and so they will be related in this way
 

00:24:53.070 --> 00:25:00.510
and so they will be related in this way
and here is the graph i just drew
