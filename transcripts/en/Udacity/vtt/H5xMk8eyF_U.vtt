00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.081
Semantic similarity used with conceptual similarity between the target problem

00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:08.555
and the source case. If we recall the original exercise that David had answered,

00:00:08.555 --> 00:00:12.688
in that exercise, a woman climbing up a ladder is conceptually similar,

00:00:12.688 --> 00:00:16.036
semantically similar to a woman climbing up a step ladder.

00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:20.270
The same kind of concepts occur in both situations. Woman, and step ladder or

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.630
ladder. Pragmatic similarity concerns with external factors.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.580
Factors external to the presentation, such as goals. As an example,

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.660
in the Dunker radiation problem, the physician had a goal of killing the tumor,

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.087
which was similar to the goal of capturing the fort in case of the rebel army

00:00:39.087 --> 00:00:43.826
and the king. Pragmatic similarity refers to similarity of external factors,

00:00:43.826 --> 00:00:48.082
factors external to the representation, such as similarity of goals. The Dunker

00:00:48.082 --> 00:00:51.900
radiation problem for example, the physician had the goal of killing the tumor,

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.230
which was similar to the goal of capturing the fort in case of the rebel army in

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.760
the king example. The third measure of similarity is structural similarity.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.560
Structure here refers to the structure of presentations,

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.070
not to physical structure. Now structural similarity of the first two,

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.640
similarity between the representational structures of the target problem and

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.360
the source case, and we'll look at an example of this in just a few minutes.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.110
Know that one can assign different kinds of weights to these three measures of

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.500
similarity. So some queries of analogy focus on structural similarity.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.190
Other theories of analogy focus on semantic and

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.380
pragmatic similarity. That is also why you may have given slightly different

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.420
answers to the questions in the first exercise than David did.
