00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.600
We have more things in common than
differences. Culture is one of them.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.940
I thought that a trip like this could
benefit both countries. There is no place

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.080
in the world that you travel and you
don't find musicians imitating American

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.000
music, Brazilian music, and Cuban music. For me it's mandatory to come to the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.750
island and go into the countryside, into
the clubs, go in to the theatre, it's

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.500
something special that I wanted to share
with my students at Harvard. I wanted

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.580
them to breathe the culture of that.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.380
Yes we learn from all the books that we
read, we learned from all the lectures

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.650
that we take, but it's only with
experience that we can actually grow.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.570
So many times during that performance I was
just like, how did I get here? It's unlike

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.770
anything I've ever seen. I don't think I
expected this at all, you know, Yosvany

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.460
he'll play the chekere every once in a
while so I guess you get a little bit of

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.149
a hint what something like this is
actually like but, nothing really

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.660
compares to this right there.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.040
This is the Ethiel Faílde

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.200
Today we got the amazing opportunity to
go to a concert hall and learn from Miguel

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.830
Faílde's danzon group and we
also got invited up on stage to play

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.320
with the group.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.520
By the very nature of Professor Terry
being from Cuba it's been a remarkable

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:40.110
experience to tour this enigma of a
country with someone so invested and

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.100
familiar with the country.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.580
The first 24 hours
I would say was a little bit of a

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.850
culture shock for me simply because it
is my first trip internationally. It's

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.900
really hard not having been out of the
United States to really understand how

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.700
different other cultures are. We have
been fortunate to have some of the best

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.190
artists collaborating with us because
when you normally go to a concert, they

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.530
never stop the show to say this is what's
happening, this is the deity that this

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.060
person is dancing for. When we went to
Guines and we have the opportunity to

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.220
see as some of the members of the
National Folkloric Troupe, at the end of

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.000
the show you saw the students trying to
learn the clave, trying to learn some

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.880
of the rhythmic pattern, trying to
learn some chants, trying to dance so

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.270
that they could understand the beats, the
rhythm, how to feel them, and how to feel

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.920
it with their body which is important. In
all of the stops that we have made there

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.690
has been this engagement with learning,
this engagement with taking something

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.100
home, taking something with you forever.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:42.220
Music has a unique power and it's the
power of healing and the power of

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:47.090
transformation, and I know that this is
really important for all the students, I

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.370
know I can see the students transformed.
This trip has probably taught me more

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.020
than I've learned in a lot of classrooms
over the past couple of years. There's

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.120
something about being in a different
country in a different cultural setting,

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.910
having the kind of access and the
different connections that Yosvany

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:10.460
has brought us has just really opened my
eyes to basically a whole new world, and

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.919
I think "life changing" might be a bit
cliché, but I don't think there's any way

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:19.460
that I'll go forward with the rest of my
Harvard career or even probably with the

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:25.210
rest of my life having experienced what
I have over the past week.
