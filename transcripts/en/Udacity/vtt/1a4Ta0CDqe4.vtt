00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
For this question, the second and the fourth options are true.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Taking a look at these, the first one is not true because in the Diffie-Hellman scheme a is public,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and so in no way does the security of the scheme depend upon a.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The second one is true.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
To solve for x is the discrete log problem, which in lecture we discussed

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
to show that this is hard.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So the security of the Diffie-Hellman scheme depends on this being difficult.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The third one is an incorrect statement.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We can see that this statement is correct regardless of g.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So even if g is not a generator, the two participants will produce the same key.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The fourth statement is correct.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The security of Diffie-Hellman is related to the difficulty of solving the discrete log problem.

00:00:43.000 --> 99:59:59.000
For some non-prime numbers the discrete log is not hard, but yet it would still be correct.
