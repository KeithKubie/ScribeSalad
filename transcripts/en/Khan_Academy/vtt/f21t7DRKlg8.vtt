00:00:00.776 --> 00:00:02.361
- [Voiceover] So you may have
been hearing a lot of talk

00:00:02.361 --> 00:00:04.962
about this thing called
singular they recently

00:00:04.962 --> 00:00:08.294
not knowing entirely what
it is or whether or not

00:00:08.294 --> 00:00:11.835
it's okay to use in a
sentence or in formal writing.

00:00:11.835 --> 00:00:15.097
Um, it's been in the news
a lot lately, you know

00:00:15.097 --> 00:00:17.721
we're seeing publications
like The Washington Post

00:00:17.721 --> 00:00:21.680
and The Economist putting
it into their style guides.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.434
It was the American Dialect Society's

00:00:23.434 --> 00:00:27.052
Word of the Year in 2015

00:00:27.052 --> 00:00:31.572
but like what is it,
and is it okay to use?

00:00:31.572 --> 00:00:33.661
I know that I got dinged all the time

00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:35.937
for using "they" as a singular pronoun

00:00:35.937 --> 00:00:38.921
in papers in high school, along with "is,"

00:00:38.921 --> 00:00:40.373
I got in a lot of trouble for using "is,"

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:41.754
which would always be circled.

00:00:41.754 --> 00:00:43.716
Some teachers of mine
just really hated "is."

00:00:43.716 --> 00:00:46.958
I get it now, it's kind of weak but

00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.590
anyway we're not talking about that today,

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.511
we're talking about they, singular they.

00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:54.976
So they is more commonly known as

00:00:54.976 --> 00:00:58.193
the plural third person pronoun in English

00:00:58.193 --> 00:01:00.124
so if we say, you know,

00:01:00.124 --> 00:01:05.044
Rolando and Phil

00:01:06.434 --> 00:01:10.796
go to the park we can switch out

00:01:10.796 --> 00:01:13.379
Rolando and Phil and say

00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:16.479
they go to the park,

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.255
and that's one usage of they but you may

00:01:18.255 --> 00:01:21.233
have also seen sentences
that look like this.

00:01:21.233 --> 00:01:23.958
Like, "When a journalist files
a story they should always

00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:26.212
"make sure their sources check out,"

00:01:30.052 --> 00:01:31.978
or "Anyone will tell you the truth if you

00:01:31.978 --> 00:01:34.333
"ask them the right questions,"

00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:36.437
and you may have noticed
that these sentences

00:01:36.437 --> 00:01:40.338
use the word "they" to
agree with a singular

00:01:40.338 --> 00:01:42.753
antecedent like journalist or anyone.

00:01:42.753 --> 00:01:44.378
Now for some of you, you
might not have noticed

00:01:44.378 --> 00:01:46.016
and for some of you, you
might have, your immediate

00:01:46.016 --> 00:01:48.477
reaction might have been, oh
wait, eh, let me get my red pen

00:01:48.477 --> 00:01:52.913
but before you do, in order to explain

00:01:52.913 --> 00:01:55.943
the context and the history

00:01:55.943 --> 00:01:58.694
around this usage, around singular they,

00:01:58.694 --> 00:02:02.412
I would like for a moment
to talk about "you."

00:02:04.452 --> 00:02:06.519
Not you the person, you the person

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:10.591
are a vast unknowable ocean
but I mean you the pronoun

00:02:13.401 --> 00:02:16.422
and how weird and transgressive

00:02:16.422 --> 00:02:19.835
and transformative it is.

00:02:19.835 --> 00:02:21.518
In many languages today there are

00:02:21.518 --> 00:02:23.341
second person pronouns for both

00:02:23.341 --> 00:02:26.058
singular and plural usage.

00:02:26.058 --> 00:02:29.541
In French, for example,
we'd say tu for singular you

00:02:29.541 --> 00:02:31.840
and vous for plural you.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.615
Tu to one person, vous to many.

00:02:34.615 --> 00:02:36.693
There's also a social distinction here

00:02:36.693 --> 00:02:38.515
that was once more pronounced,

00:02:38.515 --> 00:02:41.511
where you'd say vous to social superiors

00:02:41.511 --> 00:02:43.636
and tu to close friends.

00:02:43.636 --> 00:02:48.093
Now in those languages
the vous form is formal

00:02:48.093 --> 00:02:50.470
and the tu form is informal.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.280
You're addressing someone you don't know

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.650
very well, you use vous.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.112
You're addressing your
best buddy, you use tu.

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:03.071
All of this is to say
that English used to have

00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:06.194
the same distinction so this kind of

00:03:06.194 --> 00:03:10.141
lines up with tu and vous.

00:03:10.141 --> 00:03:12.556
Once upon a time the
singular second person

00:03:12.556 --> 00:03:16.155
subject form was thou, the object form

00:03:16.155 --> 00:03:19.232
of the singular was thee.

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:22.358
The plural second person subject form

00:03:22.358 --> 00:03:27.254
was ye or ye and the object form was you.

00:03:27.254 --> 00:03:28.972
This is where you comes in, all right,

00:03:28.972 --> 00:03:32.038
and so we, it's funny because we think

00:03:32.038 --> 00:03:34.499
of thee and thou as being more fancy

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:37.740
and formal but really
it was the opposite way,

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.114
this was the informal

00:03:41.114 --> 00:03:43.854
and ye and you was the formal.

00:03:45.704 --> 00:03:47.467
Now you may recall from our video on

00:03:47.467 --> 00:03:50.498
who versus whom that I said whom

00:03:50.498 --> 00:03:54.027
was on its way out of the language.

00:03:54.027 --> 00:03:57.928
Its usage is being overtaken by who,

00:03:57.928 --> 00:04:01.306
it is now usually permissible
to use who as an object,

00:04:01.306 --> 00:04:04.417
as in the song Who Do
You Love by Bo Diddley.

00:04:04.417 --> 00:04:07.308
Well the same thing
that's happening to whom

00:04:07.308 --> 00:04:10.280
happened to ye.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.585
Over the years its
function decreased as "you"

00:04:13.585 --> 00:04:16.585
took over, it took on a
subject and object role

00:04:16.585 --> 00:04:19.244
as well as singular and plural functions

00:04:19.244 --> 00:04:22.808
but it was still reserved
for the highborn,

00:04:22.808 --> 00:04:24.386
it was the polite form of address

00:04:24.386 --> 00:04:26.639
used for addressing social superiors.

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.381
So even though there's only one king

00:04:28.381 --> 00:04:30.958
you would refer to that king as "you"

00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.362
because apparently he was better than you.

00:04:33.362 --> 00:04:35.498
He wasn't, but we'll get to that.

00:04:35.498 --> 00:04:37.820
But something marvelous
happened in English,

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.839
the social distinction
between you and thou

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:44.367
fell away and you overtook thou and its

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:47.862
subject form thee so now
for both the singular

00:04:47.862 --> 00:04:51.740
and the plural, for the
informal and the formal,

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.283
for the subject and the
object, all we have here

00:04:54.283 --> 00:04:57.801
is you, you, you and you.

00:04:57.801 --> 00:05:01.980
It would be as if I, me
and we were all replaced

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.603
by us, I cannot emphasize
how revolutionary this is!

00:05:05.603 --> 00:05:08.005
In English you address
a king and a peasant

00:05:08.005 --> 00:05:12.545
with the same address, under
the language they are equal.

00:05:12.545 --> 00:05:15.540
Mind you the existence of a single form

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.757
of direct address did not annihilate class

00:05:17.757 --> 00:05:21.287
distinctions or prejudice in
the English-speaking world

00:05:21.287 --> 00:05:23.841
but it is no longer possible to encode

00:05:23.841 --> 00:05:26.047
a power relationship in English

00:05:26.047 --> 00:05:29.948
in the very specific way it once was.

00:05:29.948 --> 00:05:32.026
I cheer this development, I think it's

00:05:32.026 --> 00:05:33.617
awfully democratic and affirming

00:05:33.617 --> 00:05:36.264
of the principle that all human beings

00:05:36.264 --> 00:05:41.048
are worthy of respect,
which brings us to "they."

00:05:41.048 --> 00:05:42.770
This didn't really used to be a problem

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.018
in English composition,
people were writing

00:05:45.018 --> 00:05:48.223
sentences like, "Everybody
has their failing,

00:05:48.223 --> 00:05:50.324
"you know, and everybody has a right to do

00:05:50.324 --> 00:05:52.739
what they like with their own money,"

00:05:52.739 --> 00:05:54.747
which is a Jane Austen quote by the way

00:05:54.747 --> 00:05:56.514
from Northanger Abbey.

00:05:56.514 --> 00:05:58.637
Austen used this construction, Chaucer

00:05:58.637 --> 00:06:01.505
used this construction,
Shakespeare used this construction,

00:06:01.505 --> 00:06:04.024
C.S. Lewis used this
construction, these are the people

00:06:04.024 --> 00:06:08.342
that we look to as paragons of correctness

00:06:08.342 --> 00:06:10.723
and of style in English literature,

00:06:10.723 --> 00:06:14.937
and they used this form
without any compunctions.

00:06:14.937 --> 00:06:17.723
There is a class of
grammarians who thought

00:06:17.723 --> 00:06:20.881
it would be a great idea
to make English adhere

00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:23.226
to Latin grammar rules, which is where

00:06:23.226 --> 00:06:25.723
we get silly language superstitions like

00:06:25.723 --> 00:06:27.964
the prohibition on ending sentences

00:06:27.964 --> 00:06:31.319
with prepositions, making it ungrammatical

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:35.045
to say a sentence like,
"He's a guy you can rely on,"

00:06:35.045 --> 00:06:37.182
or spreading the spurious rumor

00:06:37.182 --> 00:06:39.643
that you couldn't split
an English infinitive,

00:06:39.643 --> 00:06:43.161
as in, you know, to boldly go.

00:06:43.161 --> 00:06:46.284
These are falsehoods
and they are confusing

00:06:46.284 --> 00:06:49.186
and they are needless,
pompous class markers

00:06:49.186 --> 00:06:51.067
and defeating them, and making you feel

00:06:51.067 --> 00:06:52.809
more comfortable with English is why

00:06:52.809 --> 00:06:55.782
I got into this profession
in the first place.

00:06:55.782 --> 00:06:59.229
Anyway, that group of
grammarians, that group

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:02.073
decided that when speaking
of a generic person

00:07:02.073 --> 00:07:05.371
we should say "he," a
hypothetical person in

00:07:05.371 --> 00:07:07.657
a sentence was always
"he" on the grounds that

00:07:07.657 --> 00:07:11.678
according to 16th century
grammarian William Lily,

00:07:11.678 --> 00:07:15.390
"The masculine gender is more
worthy than the feminine,"

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:17.735
so you'd be, you'd get
sentences that began

00:07:17.735 --> 00:07:19.530
"Any judge worth his salt,"

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.832
or "Anyone that would say
that is out of his mind,"

00:07:22.832 --> 00:07:25.897
which presumably was
supposed to refer to anyone.

00:07:25.897 --> 00:07:28.056
Now for centuries arguments raged over

00:07:28.056 --> 00:07:30.193
whether or not the generic "he" erased

00:07:30.193 --> 00:07:32.515
women from consideration and now with

00:07:32.515 --> 00:07:34.477
the benefit of hindsight we can say

00:07:34.477 --> 00:07:37.658
of course it did!

00:07:37.658 --> 00:07:40.503
The generic "he" isn't generic.

00:07:43.483 --> 00:07:45.611
When referring to a person whose gender

00:07:45.611 --> 00:07:48.618
is unknown or undefined by he or she,

00:07:48.618 --> 00:07:53.594
it is elegant to call
such a person "they,"

00:07:53.594 --> 00:07:57.134
as opposed to the ungainly "he or she"

00:07:58.614 --> 00:08:03.601
or she, like s/he,

00:08:03.601 --> 00:08:05.440
which on their own look alright

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.564
but in context and especially when they're

00:08:07.564 --> 00:08:11.559
repeated tend to get a little
clunky and distracting.

00:08:11.559 --> 00:08:14.844
What happened to the word "you"

00:08:14.844 --> 00:08:16.818
is happening to "they," the plural

00:08:16.818 --> 00:08:20.115
is expanding into the realm
of the singular again.

00:08:20.115 --> 00:08:21.879
The language is changing because that's

00:08:21.879 --> 00:08:24.155
what languages do, and
now this is something

00:08:24.155 --> 00:08:26.519
that's already done unconsciously,

00:08:26.519 --> 00:08:28.579
you see it in literature,
you see it in the Bible,

00:08:28.579 --> 00:08:31.702
in formal as well as informal speech.

00:08:31.702 --> 00:08:33.859
But formalizing this understanding is what

00:08:33.859 --> 00:08:35.986
undergirds the decisions of The Economist

00:08:35.986 --> 00:08:37.182
and The Washington Post

00:08:37.182 --> 00:08:40.700
to start using singular they formally.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.139
Like if you had to ask me right now,

00:08:42.139 --> 00:08:44.380
"David, is singular they grammatical?"

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.643
I'd say it's as grammatical as "you"

00:08:47.643 --> 00:08:50.854
but yeah, this is some of
the context of singular they.

00:08:50.854 --> 00:08:52.727
This is where it comes from, this is why

00:08:52.727 --> 00:08:54.945
it's used, this is what it's replacing,

00:08:54.945 --> 00:08:57.429
it's replacing this generic "he" and this

00:08:57.429 --> 00:09:00.123
kind of a clunky "she or he."

00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:02.790
You can learn anything, David out.
