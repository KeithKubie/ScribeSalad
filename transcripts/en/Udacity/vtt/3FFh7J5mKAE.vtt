00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.721
Now that we've found one zero, which we know is now at x equal 2, let's see if

00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:08.724
we can find some more. In order to do that, we're going to need to divide this

00:00:08.724 --> 00:00:13.794
polynomial by some factor that's associated with this route we just found. So

00:00:13.794 --> 00:00:19.304
please tell me then, what linear factor produces a zero at x equals 2? Type

00:00:19.304 --> 00:00:21.930
your answer in this box.
