00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.009
IKAI LAN: Sometimes people tell
you not to wear a suit.

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:04.250
And I got into an argument with
one of my coworkers about

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.720
whether or not it
was appropriate.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.490
And I don't think
it's ever wrong.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:08.590
I don't think it will
ever hurt you.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.300
But usually you don't have to.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.420
That's where this came from.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.190
ARUN NAGARAJAN: I thought you
were going to say you dressed

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:14.630
up for this special show.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:15.530
IKAI LAN: I dressed
up for you.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:16.670
ARUN NAGARAJAN: All
right, good.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.810
So let me actually continue
with the intro.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.620
This is the inaugural episode
of a new series we're doing

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.500
called "Script It!"
with Apps Script.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.980
And the idea is that we will
demonstrate interesting

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.480
creative ways you could hook
Apps Script up with other

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.250
ecosystems within Google
and outside of Google.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.330
And we actually did a bunch of
this last quarter as well with

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.640
BigQuery, Analytics, Twilio,
Salesforce a bunch of

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.210
different APIs.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.820
So we're going to call it
"Script It!" and you'll know

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.700
that when that tagline comes up,
you'll expect to see the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.170
Apps Script team along with
folks from the other products

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.960
that we have.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.960
And the folks that don't know,
Ikai Lan is now on YouTube.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.120
IKAI LAN: I am on YouTube now.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.780
That's why you haven't been
seeing me on these shows.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.790
By the way, Arun was just
talking about some of the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.519
shows we did a couple
months ago.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.810
And I highly recommend the
Twilio and Salesforce shows.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.170
Those are both very
good shows.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.510
And Salesforce, especially if
you're using Salesforce and

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.950
Google Apps in your
organization, this is

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.560
something that we see a lot.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.130
Because a lot of times you see
organizations they pretty

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.980
much, when they go cloud,
they go all cloud.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.050
So it's a really good mix.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.360
And you'll see Arun doing a
bunch of integration between

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.850
Salesforce and Google Apps.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.550
So definitely check that
show out if you've

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.830
never seen it yet.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:30.950
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:31.770
Thanks for the plug.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.960
IKAI LAN: But I'm on
YouTube team now.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.920
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah, I
was going to ask you.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.990
So YouTube, people know it as a
great content platform, fun,

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.810
informative, just whimsical with
cat videos, sort of the

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.240
canonical example of
how to waste time.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.150
So what do developer relations
do with YouTube?

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.690
IKAI LAN: So on YouTube, we
don't want people just to

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.070
think of us as a destination
site.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.320
We want people to think of
YouTube as a content platform.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.990
So YouTube, we do provide
video hosting.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.460
But we really want the value
of YouTube to be video

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.150
discovery and to just find and
learn and explore new things.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.190
We joke about cat videos, but
YouTube is an absolutely

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.590
killer resource for when you
want to learn something new.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.480
Like for me, before YouTube, I
would go to a cooking website,

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.940
and someone would say, saute.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.590
And I go, I don't know
what that means.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.060
So I have to go look up
what saute means.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.410
After YouTube, I just
kind of copy and--

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.200
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So
you start your

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.680
discovery through YouTube.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.620
IKAI LAN: Absolutely, yeah.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.740
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And as a
constant author, are there

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.000
things that YouTube offers
that make the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.290
development APIs important?

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.220
IKAI LAN: There are.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.350
So we're trying to expose--
we're looking at ways we can

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.550
expose functionality from the
YouTube site to developers so

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.570
that you could programmatically
manage your,

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.680
what we call, channels
and your content.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.050
So for right now, we have the
YouTube Data API, which lets

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.540
you upload videos, post
bulletins, just manage things.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.300
And that's really nice.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.400
In addition, we recently
launched the YouTube Analytics

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.430
API, which is very cool, because
YouTube has this

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.000
function called Analytics that
allows you to go in and see,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.300
who's watching my videos?

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.670
Where are they from?

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.320
What are their general
age groups?

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.430
And we try to infer this date
and let you know, this is when

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.050
you added 5,000 subscribers.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.910
This is when you lost
1,000 subscribers.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.350
Maybe you were posting
too many videos.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.040
What's the average minutes
people watch your video?

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.230
That's a very useful metric,
because you want to know, are

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.310
people watching your
whole video?

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.070
Should they be shorter?

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.160
Should they be longer?

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.160
And in addition, we also have
the Android SDK, which allows

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.800
you to do in app videos, whereas
before, you would have

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.540
to use a web view
and an iframe.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.050
And now the experience
is much nicer.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.640
And you'll see this on
apps like Buzzfeed--

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.620
we did a show with them
a few weeks ago--

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.720
Flipboard and a few other pretty
cool Android apps.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.480
So what we do in YouTube
developer relations is we talk

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.840
to these companies, anybody that
wants to do cool things

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.240
with video.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.860
So this could be mobile apps.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.700
We work a lot with
game companies.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.690
So you play a game, and you
want to show your sweet--

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:59.890
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Moves?

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:00.525
On the soccer field.

00:04:00.525 --> 00:04:01.150
IKAI LAN: Moves in your game.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.290
Yeah, whatever.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.630
You automatically upload
to YouTube.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.340
So very cool stuff.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.450
So that's what we work on.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.570
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Got it.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.120
So I'm actually going to put
just the documentation site.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.310
So what are some of the things
that the developer should be

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.880
really looking at?

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.560
So on the
developers.google.com/youtube

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.149
site, you can see that there's
a bunch of services.

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:23.010
So what are some of the
highlights that folks should

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.070
really get excited about?

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.720
IKAI LAN: So folks should
be looking at--

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.120
the core of everything is
the YouTube Data API.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.330
And we really want to encourage

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.570
people use Version 3.0.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.150
It's tagged experimental, but
that's because we're still

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.530
trying to bridge some
of the feature gap.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.655
And we're going to
be filling in--

00:04:37.655 --> 00:04:38.930
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So it's
pretty stable.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.160
Maybe there are some gaps.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.540
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.756
There's a couple of things that
you can't quite do yet in

00:04:42.756 --> 00:04:42.970
Version 3.0.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.960
We're still going to identify
these things to make sure you

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.370
can do everything you could do
in Version 2.0 in Version 3.0.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.980
Version 3.0 uses OAuth 2.0 for
authentication, and it's based

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.640
on our new API infrastructure.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.460
So this is the infrastructure
that serves off the API

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.830
console where you would go to
register-- say you want to use

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.310
BigQuery or the Calendar
API, and you toggle

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.170
these things on.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.660
So it uses that infrastructure.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.450
Very cool stuff.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:09.230
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.710
IKAI LAN: In addition, the other
API here you want to

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.950
care about is the YouTube
Analytics API, which uses the

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.470
same authentication
infrastructure.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.880
So especially for people that
are doing stuff with Version

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.280
2.0 right now, I think it's
really important to move to

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.620
Version 3.0, because you use
the same authentication.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.850
And you can essentially
recycle that same

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.790
authentication code between
the v3 Data API and the v1

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:30.580
Analytics API.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.390
So don't get too
confused there.

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.880
All of our new APIs for YouTube
are going to be using

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.010
OAuth 2.0 and JSON.

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.750
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Cool.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.590
And JSON is great, because Apps
Script-- bringing it back

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.660
into Apps Script-- it's
all JavaScript.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.530
And JSON just becomes very
quickly a native object that

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.810
we can build and integrate with
various APIs that Apps

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.760
Script provides, very quickly
iterate through these objects

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.980
and be able to update a
spreadsheet or a calendar or a

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.750
lot of interesting things that
we'll hopefully demonstrate

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:58.750
very quickly.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.640
IKAI LAN: Apps Script also
parses XML, right?

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.160
ARUN NAGARAJAN: It does.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.550
It does.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.910
XML is a first class item,
but I prefer JSON.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.350
I'm a little lazy when it
comes to parsing things.

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.550
And if I can just say, JSON dot
parse and pass it a string

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:19.110
that, to me, wins over building
a lot more complex

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.860
parsing algorithms that the
XML services require.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.780
So what we'll do is actually,
we'll dive into and talk

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.990
through some of the examples
that we had

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.680
cooked up for this session.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.940
The hope is that at the end of
it, you'll see interesting

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.710
capabilities where the data
comes from the YouTube Data

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.390
API and the Analytics API.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.330
And then you can do something
very cool and useful from the

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:45.350
apps side of things.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.310
So apps means Gmail, calendar,
spreadsheets, and so on.

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.140
And there's actually a few
folks that have done some

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.380
interesting things with the
YouTube API already.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.520
The first one that I think is
noteworthy is this example

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.030
library here by James Ferrara.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.240
You can find this very easily.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.240
Just search for James Ferrara
script examples.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.270
I think this is the label
that he uses.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:08.590
And you can find it here.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.030
And you can open an
issue with him if

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.230
there are any questions.

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:17.610
But what they've done is taken
the v2 API of the YouTube API,

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.200
the v2 version, and sort
of wrapped it around

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.170
and created a service.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.620
So they can say, YouTube app
dot get standard feed.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.580
YouTube app dot get
user uploads.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.640
I think there's a slight
typo in this example.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.850
It's capital T and uppercase
A, I've noticed.

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.700
So just kind of keep that
in mind as you're

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:34.510
looking through it.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:37.330
But James does share the entire
source code as well.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.170
So you can take a look at it
and get started with it.

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:42.610
But for most of the demos today,
we're going to be using

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:46.730
the v2 version, which I think
is interesting and exciting.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:48.390
And we're going to get
started with that.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:50.840
So the first example, Ikai,
that I thought would be

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.690
interesting is--

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:55.610
a lot of things that we do with
the Google Developers

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.770
videos is very time based.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:05.850
So on Wednesdays, the APAC
Android team does a video.

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:09.640
On Tuesdays and Fridays, the
Drive team does videos.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.510
So I figured it would be a nice
way to take the data from

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:15.550
those playlists, the video
data, and then

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:16.630
plot it on a calendar.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:17.420
IKAI LAN: OK.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.620
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So we'll get
started with that example.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.000
So the first thing that--

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.050
Ikai mentioned this already--

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:26.240
is that you have to create an
API project, because we're

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.770
going to be using OAuth 2.0 and
the API tokens from there.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.510
And I've logged into
a sample account.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.490
All the keys that I'll create
will be thrown away.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:35.179
So you should be
able to use it.

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:37.260
I'll go ahead and
start Create.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.010
We'll call this YouTube
Project.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:58.380
And I'm going to see that there
is a simple API token.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.120
And we'll get started
with that.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:08.580
So I'm going to go to my
script.google.com and start

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.010
with a blank project.

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.530
And what we're going to do is I
have some pre-built samples,

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:18.130
because I think this is
a lot of typing to do.

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:20.710
And I'm going to paste
this in, and I'm

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:22.570
going to copy my code.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:24.670
Everything will be shared,
of course, as always.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.320
This code will be up on
GitHub shortly after.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.940
I'm going to copy that
API key here.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:36.070
I'm going to call this calendar
GDL Calendar.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:39.130
And we'll call this Create
GDL Calendar.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.610
And you can see that what this
does is it uses the v3 version

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:51.810
of the activity stream and then
looks through the channel

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.410
that I was able to determine,
the channel ID for the Google

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:56.160
Developers account.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.940
Get, I think for now I'm using
the last 20 items, and then

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:04.690
I'm just filtering based on ones
from yesterday onwards to

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:06.090
keep it a little bit
more succinct.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.850
But then you can batch this
through and do a lot of

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.650
interesting things.

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:13.890
The key point here is
line number five,

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:15.570
which is URL fetch.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.440
So URL fetch, if you're not
familiar, is actually one of

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:23.010
the very prominent ways that
you use to integrate Apps

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:24.250
Script with other systems.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:25.930
So it's actually your friend.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:28.540
It allows you to do a lot of
interesting things including

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.186
OAuth 1.0 baked in.

00:10:30.186 --> 00:10:32.460
For OAuth 2.0, you do have to
do a little bit more of the

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:33.610
call back handling.

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:35.160
But that's actually really
straightforward once

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.040
you set it all up.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.680
And then you can actually send
posts and do all sorts of

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.770
interesting things with
it with a lot of

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:43.800
addons that we provide.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.880
So in this example, I'm
going to get that.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.980
And then this is the
line I was saying.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.980
Line number seven, I now have a
JavaScript object that I can

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.450
just do dot notation on and
iterate through all of the

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:56.640
items in an array,
and really very

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.110
straightforward to get started.

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:00.610
And you can see that all I'm
doing here is creating a

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:04.590
calendar called the GDL
Calendar, getting the data for

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:08.900
that particular channel, and for
each item, I'm creating an

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.300
event in that calendar.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.110
And at the very end, I'm going
to create a link that I can

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:16.750
publish or just have myself up
on a big board somewhere.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:17.920
And this is a very
simple, one time

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.190
function that I've written.

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:22.210
But you can see that you could
write this to run on a trigger

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:24.770
and see if you find new things,
email me and alert me

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:26.320
and all sorts of good things.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.042
I'm going to save
this and run it.

00:11:30.042 --> 00:11:31.520
It's going to make
me authorize.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.310
That's always something
that is typical of

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:35.950
an Apps Script app.

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:39.140
You have to give it some
identity and some privileges.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:39.550
I'll run this.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:41.450
So this is going to take
a few seconds.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:44.550
It's going to create a calendar
for you dynamically.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:47.910
It's going to get the response
back, parse it, and then

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.610
iterate through it and create,
I think, at least

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:51.150
20 different items.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:53.360
And then for now, I
don't have any UI.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:58.260
If I go to the logger, I have
this URL that, if I pop open a

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:02.580
new window, should give me
something that's quite useful.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:06.190
So hopefully you guys can
see that on the monitor.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:08.390
So you can see that there's
"State of the Script" that we

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:12.340
did two weeks ago
and uploaded it.

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:16.700
There's the GDL women-focused
Hangout that we did.

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:20.425
One for Maps and Drive
SDK and so on.

00:12:20.425 --> 00:12:22.590
IKAI LAN: And if you included
today, there would have been a

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:24.330
lot of interesting shows.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:27.530
I know that, for those of your
watching this right now, go to

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:30.230
developers.google.com/live,
there are a

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:33.360
lot of special shows.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.250
There are a lot of special shows
that you should check

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.790
out, a lot of very cool
things happening

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:37.610
today that we announced.

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:38.660
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Excellent,
yeah.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:41.920
I actually did filter it out
because it was too many items

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.380
to show, I thought.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.540
But this is an interesting
way that you can keep

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:46.860
up with your GDLs.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:47.985
This doesn't have to be GDLs.

00:12:47.985 --> 00:12:51.300
It could be an episode that you
watch on the internet that

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.625
you're tracking or a music
video launch or whatever.

00:12:53.625 --> 00:12:55.560
IKAI LAN: The only thing that I
will point out is that, one

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.040
thing I noticed is that
you did this for

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.090
videos in the past.

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:01.330
So you're adding items to the
calendar in the past.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.340
ARUN NAGARAJAN: You could
theoretically schedule for,

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.400
have it run every day and check
for events that are

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.050
happening on the day of.

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:10.740
And if you have it scheduled
ahead of time, I think you can

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.870
actually grab that as well
from the activity stream.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:15.790
I'm not very familiar with that
API, but you can see all

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:19.880
that documentation actually
really well enumerated here.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:26.080
This page highlights what is
that that you are requesting

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.280
back, and then a whole
bunch of inputs that

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.450
you can send in--

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:34.010
max results, published after,
published before.

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:37.640
And you can really window
in on the exact set of

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:38.840
items that you want.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.320
Does that make sense?

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.150
IKAI LAN: Makes sense.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.530
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So that's kind
of an interesting mash up of

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:46.360
taking the YouTube API, getting
the data back, and

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.410
then showing it on a Google
Apps calendar.

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:53.170
So the second example that
we will do is actually a

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:54.110
spreadsheet focused one.

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:59.400
So what we'll do is grab the
data back from a playlist.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.010
And then we'll populate all
the items to the playlist.

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:04.370
And then we'll then maybe
look at the view counts

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.490
for it and so on.

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:10.290
So for this, I'll create
a spreadsheet.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:15.770
We'll call this YouTube
View Count.

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:19.510
I'm going to say, Tools,
Script Editor.

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:23.470
And again, I cheated a little
bit and got the code ready.

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:25.980
YouTube.

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.840
This one's actually written
by one of our

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.340
colleagues, Eric Koleda.

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.090
And I tweaked it a little bit
to make it more appropriate

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:33.080
for the sample.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.260
We do use this internally
to track our own

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:36.770
videos that we put out.

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:39.440
So I'm going to past this in.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:43.620
Put in the API key again.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.160
Copy this guy.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.630
And one thing that is worth
noting here is that this is

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:51.300
all unauthenticated.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:54.150
All we're doing is the API key
is getting passed in, but then

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:56.240
there's no user level
identity going on.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:56.780
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.490
So there's something that's
really important I should

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:00.890
point out here.

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:03.080
This is using what we call
simple API access.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.550
And simple API access in the
API lets you do a lot of

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:10.760
things that you wouldn't require
a user to be logged in

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:11.790
on YouTube to do.

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:14.440
So for instance, you would be
able to search YouTube.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.940
And you would be able
to search channels.

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.670
You would be able to use what we
call a topics API, which is

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:20.250
the way we integrate
with Freebase.

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:21.590
So you could search
your topics.

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:25.210
And let's say you search
for the word, bird.

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:28.200
When you search on YouTube, how
do you know if I'm looking

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.715
for Tweety Bird or Larry Bird?

00:15:30.715 --> 00:15:31.770
They're very different.

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:33.600
So when you use a topics API--

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.270
there's a sample.

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:36.320
One of our code samples
shows how to do this.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.810
When you search for bird,
one of the things

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:38.810
may be Larry Bird.

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:41.060
And you might say, I want to
look for Larry Bird, not

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:41.600
Tweety Bird.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.660
And we'll return YouTube videos
that are related.

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:46.530
So this is what they talk about
when they say object

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:48.090
graph and smarter search.

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:48.380
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Right.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.390
The Knowledge Graph as well.

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:51.610
IKAI LAN: So that's very cool.

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:53.120
And you can do all that without

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.810
authenticating as a user.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:55.780
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's
really good.

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:56.050
Yeah.

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:58.040
So in this example,
still, we'll be

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.910
grabbing public data still.

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:01.700
But the API key is still
important, because we want to

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:06.010
make sure that there's some
known entity that we can

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:07.770
attribute that usage to.

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:11.520
That way we can meter that and
make sure that the service is

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.800
available for everybody.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.230
IKAI LAN: That's one big
difference between v2 and v3

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:18.690
is that in v3, everything
requires an API key, whereas

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:21.400
in v2, you can get away with
not using an API key.

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.880
So that's one thing to
look out for when

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.010
migrating from v2 to v3.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:25.830
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Good point.

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:28.040
So one of the things I did when
I pasted this in as well

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:32.030
is I imported in a library for
Underscore.js, which is a

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:34.700
great open source project.

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.210
IKAI LAN: You too, huh?

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:37.710
I know Eric has been
evangelizing this.

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:39.960
ARUN NAGARAJAN: In fact, I've
actually lifted this straight

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.000
from Eric's examples.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.120
So he wrote this great
blog post where he

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.580
explained how to use it.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:48.035
And he, in fact, made it
available for everybody to

00:16:48.035 --> 00:16:49.230
just import that in.

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:51.700
So that's the library key that
you can just very quickly pull

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.600
that in and be able to do it.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.850
And you can do--

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:57.330
we'll dive into the code a
little bit, but it allows you

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:00.270
to make the code so much
more succinct.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:02.555
So I ran the code.

00:17:02.555 --> 00:17:04.210
So I'll actually manually
run it for now,

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:08.060
this is on open hook.

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:11.510
So now, when I go in here,
there's this new menu item.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:14.160
Nothing too surprising, that's
been around for a while.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.410
What that's going to ask is--
the first thing it's going to

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:18.010
say is, sync with playlist.

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:22.349
When I click on that, it gives
me the playlist ID.

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:25.730
So I've kind of cheated and
saved a couple of playlist IDs

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:28.930
that I'll use throughout here.

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:32.920
And these are the
Musicians@Google videos that

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:36.600
we post and share to the world,
and also the Gone

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:40.840
Google videos, so businesses
and other enterprises and

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:44.250
institutions going with the
Google Apps ecosystem.

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:47.050
So I'm just going to pick
that one, and I hit OK.

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:53.440
And what that's going to do is
go and look at that playlist,

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.790
find out what the items
in that playlist are,

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:56.775
and load them up.

00:17:56.775 --> 00:17:59.990
I can sort them whichever way
I want to and save the ID

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:03.890
here, which it will use to go
and look up the view count.

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:06.240
And then it's also linked, so
I can click on it and go see

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.520
the actual video
if I wanted to.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.400
And then, when I click on Update
View, it's going to go,

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.740
look through those IDs, find the
actual view count for each

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.500
of them, and then show
it very quickly.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.220
So you can see that it's
actually kind of a fun way to

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.320
bring data in.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.790
And there's a lot of things you
can do with it once it's

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:26.240
in a spreadsheet as in being
able to plot it, being able to

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.970
run a lot of historical
analytics,

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:29.110
and things like that.

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:31.070
It's actually pretty cool,
because you can just go into a

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:34.890
new sheet and do this for
the other playlist.

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:37.170
I'll just grab this guy.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:40.810
And this one should have 30
or so number of videos.

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:42.390
And then you can see that at
the very end, it actually

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:43.470
sorts it as well.

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:45.870
It loads the data in and then
runs a sort function on it.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:48.060
And I'll go and Update Views.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.800
And that Update Views is sort of
a secondary thing, because

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:52.730
you may just want to Update
Views after the video's

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:53.990
already loaded.

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:56.970
So you can see that it's
actually a nice view to be

00:18:56.970 --> 00:19:00.420
able to see what the different
view counts are.

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:03.700
And you can see the one that's
quite popular, which is, I

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:05.150
think, Lady Gaga.

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:06.480
IKAI LAN: Lady Gaga.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.750
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And you
can see that one.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.630
I believe that's in
here as well.

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:11.030
IKAI LAN: That was
a very fun one.

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:11.290
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yep.

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:12.560
IKAI LAN: I couldn't attend.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:13.550
ARUN NAGARAJAN: You weren't
actually here for that?

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:13.740
IKAI LAN: No.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:15.870
I was going to go to-- this
is what back I was in the

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:17.090
California offices.

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:18.760
I was going to go to Mountain
View, but I had an emergency

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:19.610
meeting at a different office.

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:20.670
I went, no!

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:21.660
So I ended up watching
the stream.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.160
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Well,
it's on YouTube now.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:23.250
IKAI LAN: Yeah.

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:24.065
It was livestreamed too.

00:19:24.065 --> 00:19:24.940
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Oh, perfect.

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:26.050
IKAI LAN: If I remember
correctly.

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:27.250
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So you can
watch it to your heart's

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:28.220
content even on your phone.

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:29.410
IKAI LAN: Yeah.

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:32.710
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So that's a very
quick and nifty example,

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:36.950
we think, of being able to load
in a playlist or channel

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:39.820
level set of videos into your
spreadsheet and then be able

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:44.000
to look at it and do analytics
around it and

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.630
all the other things.

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:48.000
But when you think about it,
this still just gives you the

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.010
view count.

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:50.630
That's sort of the only thing.

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:53.580
Which really, when you go into
the UI, you have it right

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:54.540
there as well.

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.710
So it's not anything special.

00:19:56.710 --> 00:20:01.010
So one of the things Ikai
alluded to was the Analytics

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:05.440
API that YouTube offers
to the content owner.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.460
They get to see a lot more.

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:06.990
Is that right?

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:07.540
IKAI LAN: Absolutely.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:11.010
It's the same thing as if you're
running a website.

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:13.840
The view count is like
a hit counter.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.230
It is some kind of--

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:16.410
usually, it's a vanity metric.

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:19.290
And it's not terribly useful
for tuning your content.

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:20.665
And that's why we have to
have something like

00:20:20.665 --> 00:20:21.930
an Analytics API.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:24.730
So a while back, YouTube rolled
out this feature called

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:27.180
View Analytics, where you can
go to a video that you own--

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:28.860
and that's the important
distinction here.

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.210
You have to own the video.

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:32.420
And you could say, show me
what countries people are

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:33.330
coming from.

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:35.490
Show me how long they're
watching my video.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:38.560
And show me, historically, for
all time, or for a 30 day

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.790
series, what might view count,
how many subscribers I got,

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.490
how many likes I got, how many
shares I got, and what were

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:45.850
people sharing through?

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:49.310
So it's a lot of really good
content for people that are

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:51.770
producing videos,
like you and me?

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:52.150
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Right.

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:52.500
Yeah.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:56.280
So we put out these videos, and
we would like to know, how

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:57.620
are people engaging with it?

00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:59.200
What are the type of folks
that spend the

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.270
most time on it?

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:03.580
What are some of the localities
that we're not

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:07.080
serving well enough, and be able
to tweak our content and

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.770
our approach accordingly?

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:12.640
So in order to do that, this
requires authentication.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.190
And like you mentioned before,
it's OAuth 2.0.

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:17.460
So what I'm going to do
is actually create--

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:20.650
and this, I think, will be a
great example that you'll be

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:23.980
able to use with other OAuth 2.0
enabled APIs integrating

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:25.860
with Google Apps Script.

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:27.790
So everything that I'll be
showing here will be hopefully

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:31.510
reusable and applicable
in another API

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:32.590
that you want to connect.

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:35.300
So I'm going to say,
Create this API.

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.170
IKAI LAN: And the scope of
OAuth, if you're new to OAuth,

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.940
it's a little bit outside of
this video, because it's kind

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:41.200
of a hairy topic at points.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.150
So basically, one way to
describe OAuth is it's

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:45.300
like a valet key.

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.080
It's a valet key for
your application.

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:50.710
So a valet key, I realize it's
a very American concept.

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:53.020
If you have a car and someone
parks the car for you, you

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.160
don't want them to be able
to open your trunk.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.610
Because I guess Arun,
that's where

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:58.290
you'd store your diamonds.

00:21:58.290 --> 00:21:59.510
You'd store all your diamonds
in your car.

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:00.640
ARUN NAGARAJAN: I'm
not that rich.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.770
IKAI LAN: You don't want
the valet to go

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:04.500
and pilfer your diamonds.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.310
So you give him a key that can
access parts of your car.

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:08.800
And he can still drive your
car, but he can't get

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.580
into the lock box.

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:12.280
So that's more or less
what OAuth is.

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.870
It's not your main key.

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:15.280
It's a separate key
you give out.

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.460
The difference being you can
still revoke it at any time.

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:17.803
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yep.

00:22:17.803 --> 00:22:20.080
So I'm going to go through
this process.

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:23.480
So this is sort of the example
that I just built out of

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:24.620
sample branding.

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:27.270
So you're going to leave these
URLs there for now.

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:29.280
And we'll come back
and tweak it.

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.300
I'm going to say, Create ID.

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:31.960
OK.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:36.190
So that's going to create
us an OAuth client

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:37.370
ID and client secret.

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:39.710
So I'll be deleting this
right after this.

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:45.340
And what I'll do now is go back
into my example and pull

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:48.240
out some of the other
examples.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:52.260
Let's go down here and grab
all of this stuff.

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:55.110
That's quite a bit of stuff
here, but it'll be pretty easy

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:56.400
to demonstrate.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.120
I didn't really walk down this
set of samples, but you can

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:02.220
see that it's actually really
nicely written, and you should

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.670
be able to figure out what it's
doing just by looking

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:05.330
through it.

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:07.940
In the interest of time, we'll
skip through that.

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:13.280
And I'm going to now scroll
through and make sure that the

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.400
client ID here is
going to have to

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.310
match what I have here.

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:20.170
So I'm going to copy that.

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:21.150
Paste that there.

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:23.800
So the right place to store it
is your ScriptProperties.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:27.380
But for this demo, since it's a
throwaway example, I'm going

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:31.460
to put that right in the code
and trust that you guys will

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.406
do the right thing.

00:23:33.406 --> 00:23:34.900
And I'm going to paste
that in here.

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.890
OK.

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:40.260
Great.

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:43.170
And then I'm going to actually
add a couple of other menu

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:48.690
items to my menu list.

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:51.400
So I'm going to say, getAuth.

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:52.650
So we'll just say--

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.380
go in here.

00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:07.830
And we'll say, do OAuth,
which is getAuth.

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:14.100
And then the next one that I'll
add is load analytics.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:16.700
And you could actually weave
that in in a way better way.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:21.150
So I'm just kind of cheating
here and using a really simple

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:25.420
method of using a menu item
rather than some sort of a

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:28.360
nice flow that gets
the point across.

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:30.410
Save this.

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:33.150
Run my on open again.

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:34.210
Close this.

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:36.665
Make sure that I have those
menu items there.

00:24:36.665 --> 00:24:38.650
I have to refresh this guy.

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:40.660
IKAI LAN: You have to run it
again, because you were just

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:41.550
authenticating.

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:42.770
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Gotcha.

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:44.320
IKAI LAN: See, I still remember
my Apps Script.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.050
I remember this.

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:46.550
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Well, hopefully
since I reloaded

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:49.830
this, that'll come
through as well.

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:51.710
Give a second.

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:54.940
Tools, Script Editor.

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.000
It should be there.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:57.290
All right.

00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:58.960
Well, I'll run it for now.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.440
Maybe I screwed something up.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.571
Run this guy.

00:25:03.571 --> 00:25:04.610
And there it is.

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:05.450
OK.

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:09.030
And what I'm going to do first
is publish this as a web app.

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:13.230
So that is the end point that
we will actually call back.

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:15.090
Because that's very
important here.

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:17.790
Anyone and run as the user.

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:18.813
Deploy it.

00:25:18.813 --> 00:25:20.250
IKAI LAN: Now, that's very,
very important.

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:21.760
It's got to run as the user.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:22.510
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Right.

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:25.400
And I'm going to go back here
and tell it what the call back

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.110
is, because it's going
to restrict to that

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:29.220
known set of things.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:29.570
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:31.260
And if you don't do this,
you will be an

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:34.080
error that says, 403.

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:35.150
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Unknown
redirect URL.

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:36.410
IKAI LAN: Unknown
redirect URL.

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:38.180
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's
exactly what it says.

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:39.670
So I'll save this.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:41.150
And I think we're
good to go now.

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:43.100
So let's go take a look.

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.440
Actually, I'm going to have
to copy one other piece of

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.350
information, which I
think is important.

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:51.680
And I don't think I copied
it over before.

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:56.420
So I'm going to cheat and just
copy this from here into this

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:59.142
other spreadsheet.

00:25:59.142 --> 00:26:00.470
Paste that in.

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:01.140
OK, great.

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.370
So I'm going to go here.

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:03.350
And I'll explain that
in a second.

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:04.600
It's going to say DooAuth.

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:08.680
It's going to create a URL.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.270
IKAI LAN: Already have token.

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:12.380
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:15.070
You know what, let me
clean that up a

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:16.500
little bit real quick.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:19.080
I forgot that I was
in my testing.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.430
I didn't actually save that.

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:24.900
So you can see that I'm
storing that here.

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:25.860
IKAI LAN: Hey, that's cool.

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:28.850
You still have all the
civic app in here.

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:31.410
So what you're looking at is
project properties, which

00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:34.740
shows all of the user
properties.

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:39.660
And use properties are
stored per user but

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:40.630
across all your scripts.

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:41.120
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's right.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:44.690
So what I did here is just
erased my token so that I can

00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:46.910
pretend as if I'm coming
in for the first time.

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:49.130
I'm going to click
here to start.

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:53.330
I want to pick the account
that owns the analytics.

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:55.270
And you can see that that's
the icon that I gave it.

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:56.140
And it's going to say
it's going to be

00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:57.540
able to view my reports.

00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:58.180
OK?

00:26:58.180 --> 00:26:59.200
And I trust it.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.730
I'm just going to
hit OK there.

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:02.640
And you can close that up.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.190
Not necessary.

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:06.400
Better air handling would
be nice there.

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.216
And in fact, I'll fix it right
now so that when I post it on

00:27:09.216 --> 00:27:11.830
the internet, it
won't do that.

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:13.635
Get rid of that guy.

00:27:13.635 --> 00:27:16.610
You don't need that.

00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:16.690
All right.

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:17.090
Cool.

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:18.510
So what I'll do now--

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:20.410
IKAI LAN: So let's verify that
you've gotten a token.

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:21.340
So let's do that again.

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:21.900
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Oh good call.

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:24.340
IKAI LAN: If this has worked
correctly, it'll--

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:25.310
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Good call.

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:25.690
There it is.

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:26.400
IKAI LAN: There it is.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:26.940
OK.

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.020
You've got your auth token.

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:28.730
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Excellent.

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:32.560
So what I'll do now is say,
YouTube, load analytics.

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:35.640
And what that's going to do is
take these parameters that we

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:40.750
have written out here and
then be able to load

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:42.750
it into a nice report.

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:44.330
IKAI LAN: Let's do this the way
we were doing it earlier

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:45.710
where I can read these
off to you.

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:46.190
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yes.

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:48.820
IKAI LAN: So when you do YouTube
Analytics, you have to

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:51.740
understand that there's a
certain combination of things

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:54.680
you have to use-- dimensions,
metrics, and filters.

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.640
And there's a whole page
of these when you go

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.220
to Available Reports.

00:27:58.220 --> 00:27:59.920
And we'll show you how
to use this in a bit.

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:00.160
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Right.

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.820
So I just pulled it
up on the screen.

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.670
So there's dimensions
and metrics.

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:09.490
Think of dimensions as columns
and metrics as rows.

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:10.280
Is that right?

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:10.510
IKAI LAN: Yeah.

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:11.990
That's a pretty good
way to think of it.

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:13.600
And filters, that's kind
of a where clause.

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.410
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's right.

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:19.430
And let me actually show you how
this looks like with just

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:20.250
the ones I've picked up.

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:23.320
So this is the window for
start and end date.

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:26.830
Then I'm going to say, I want
the viewer percentage broken

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:28.680
out by age group.

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:30.590
So I'm going to say,
go load it.

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:32.790
IKAI LAN: So what we're
showing here is--

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:35.160
what are we showing here?

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.610
What is view percentage
by age group?

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:39.570
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Something
was not happy there.

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.595
IKAI LAN: I'm going to take this
time to say that I was

00:28:41.595 --> 00:28:44.290
getting really excited to break
open my laptop, which,

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:46.340
as you guys can see,
is a Chrome Pixel.

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:49.600
Now, this is one amazing
delight.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.830
I love this thing.

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:52.900
But it looks like Arun's got
this completely under control.

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:54.390
So I'm just to put this away.

00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:56.950
It's kind of funny, but one of
my favorite features of this--

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:58.050
it's very, very silly--

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:00.210
is that there's a light
bar at the bottom.

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:02.690
And when you close the
tab, it becomes

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:04.340
the four Google colors.

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:04.750
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's right.

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:06.840
IKAI LAN: I love that
attention to detail.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.020
ARUN NAGARAJAN: It is a nice
laptop, and I really should

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:12.130
have done my demos off of it
today, but I didn't get a

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:13.200
chance to bring it over.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:13.935
I know what I did.

00:29:13.935 --> 00:29:18.410
I think this needs to be
formatted as plain text.

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:20.686
So what we're doing there--

00:29:20.686 --> 00:29:23.990
get my right zoom level here.

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:26.090
And I think the format is--

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:27.670
what was it?

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:31.640
Going back to this guy here, I
believe the format is-- it has

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:39.040
a specific requirement for the
format for begin and end date.

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:39.970
IKAI LAN: There is.

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:45.095
Isn't it year in four digits,
month in two digits, and day

00:29:45.095 --> 00:29:45.920
in two digits?

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.910
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That is
likely my issue here.

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:50.160
So what I did was, in
this example, just

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.610
pasted in some text.

00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:54.520
And it immediately tried to help
me out and formatted it.

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:57.080
And I'll just go ahead
and tweak this in.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:58.500
So we have this example here.

00:29:58.500 --> 00:29:59.930
Sorry for all the scrolling.

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:02.830
But you can see that down here,
it tells me what format

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:03.970
it wants it.

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:04.330
All right.

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:06.040
So I'll go ahead and fix that.

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:10.040
So we'll say 2013.

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.540
Give me everything from the
beginning of the year, and

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:17.850
then 2013 until yesterday.

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:18.740
OK.

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:24.080
I'll go ahead and find my
script, hook that up.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:27.895
So all my OAuths should
still be applicable.

00:30:27.895 --> 00:30:31.310
I'm going to run this,
hook that up,

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:32.570
and say, load analytics.

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:33.360
IKAI LAN: So you don't actually

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:34.470
have to run that again.

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:37.150
So the menu item will always
dynamically call the newest

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:38.490
version that script in there.

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:39.450
This is one thing
I discovered by

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:40.680
accident when I was debugging.

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:41.370
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That
must have been it.

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:42.290
IKAI LAN: Yeah.

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:43.290
ARUN NAGARAJAN: But
there it is.

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:46.920
So you can see that very
quickly, some interesting data

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:48.000
got loaded up.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.840
And that's actually useful
for me to know.

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:54.510
So what I can also do then is
say, let's change it to a

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:57.550
different dimension,
of gender.

00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:59.140
IKAI LAN: This should
be interesting.

00:30:59.140 --> 00:30:59.950
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah.

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:00.960
Load analytics.

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:04.150
And that's going to say, this
is the viewer percentage

00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:05.490
across all different--

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:06.160
IKAI LAN: So what is this?

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:09.120
89% male, 10% female.

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:11.000
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's
actually as you

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:11.540
would expect it.

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:13.790
But we're doing a lot of work
to make that a lot more

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:15.460
interesting and better with
Google Developers.

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.636
IKAI LAN: Yeah, I've seen
the "Women in Tech" show

00:31:17.636 --> 00:31:19.250
is a very good show.

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:20.560
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And I can
actually add in some

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:21.400
interesting filters.

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:24.470
I can say, country.

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:25.820
Let's just say Italy.

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:27.610
I think I'm missing
an R there.

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:29.720
And now if I say,
load analytics.

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:32.110
IKAI LAN: Now this becomes
really interesting, because

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:34.750
now we can see, are we doing
better or worse with women in

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:36.850
Italy and men in Italy?

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:37.650
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And
you can see that.

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:39.010
You can slice and
dice that here.

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:41.660
And all that's just getting--
and we went with a really

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:45.390
simple approach of just adding
it to a spreadsheet.

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:47.350
But you can, as you can imagine,
if you build a nice

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:51.310
UI around this and have these
available as inputs in a nice

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:54.210
UI app or HTML service, you
can do a lot of really

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:55.670
interesting things.

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:57.720
And we talked about this
a little bit before.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:04.640
One of the benefits of having
this in a spreadsheet is being

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:05.970
able to do this.

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:09.430
The zoom level is not agreeing
with me here.

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:10.380
IKAI LAN: It's also--

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:11.970
ARUN NAGARAJAN: I think
I selected--

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:14.305
IKAI LAN: We want to pick
not all those rows.

00:32:14.305 --> 00:32:14.560
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah.

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:19.770
IKAI LAN: And this will create a
chart, which is really nice.

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:20.810
What are we doing here?

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:23.216
ARUN NAGARAJAN: It's not happy
with something here.

00:32:23.216 --> 00:32:26.200
Well, we'll just pick this guy,
see if that is happier,

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:28.270
something a little bit
more succinct.

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:29.000
Oh, you know why?

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.110
Because the formatting--

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:37.630
it doesn't know what the formats
are, which is OK.

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:40.790
You can see that it should
be able to do a--

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:42.816
IKAI LAN: A pie chart, yeah.

00:32:42.816 --> 00:32:44.540
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Oh, that's
not what I want to do.

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:50.100
It doesn't like that.

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:52.490
I think it's because I've
changed the type.

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:53.690
But you get the idea.

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:55.370
I should be able to
copy this over.

00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:57.010
Let's see if that picks
it up here.

00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:59.100
IKAI LAN: And this is one thing
we mentioned on the

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:01.770
Google Analytics show we did a
couple months ago, which is

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:02.980
the nice thing about
building this into

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:05.300
Apps Script is that--

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:07.495
if you type number, you want
to go ahead and change the

00:33:07.495 --> 00:33:08.060
type to number.

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:09.905
ARUN NAGARAJAN: I thought when
I copy pasted it, it

00:33:09.905 --> 00:33:10.550
should change it.

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:10.920
IKAI LAN: Not always.

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:14.460
ARUN NAGARAJAN: But if not,
let's just say normal.

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:17.610
IKAI LAN: Is that you can grant
access to a wider group

00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:20.120
of people for your analytics
that you may not want access

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:20.790
to your YouTube channel.

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:21.360
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Right.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.490
IKAI LAN: So if I give you
access to my YouTube channel,

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:24.590
you can do everything.

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:25.670
You can edit videos.

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:26.900
And I might not want that.

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:28.380
I might just want you to be
able to read the data.

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:28.560
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Right.

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.840
IKAI LAN: So by doing it this
way, you can still get the

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:33.030
analytics, and you can still
make decisions without

00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:34.280
necessarily having
write access.

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:34.750
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Exactly.

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:40.630
So this data, as you can see, at
no point did I have access

00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:44.620
to-- if I have it run as myself
rather than the user

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:47.360
accessing it, at no point would
I have to share the

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:51.520
password for the account or
even decide exactly what

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.160
reports they want to see.

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:56.600
Maybe the analytics API is too
robust, and there's just too

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:57.550
many options.

00:33:57.550 --> 00:33:58.750
You can filter it down.

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:00.390
And that's a useful thing.

00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:02.430
IKAI LAN: And it's useful
too for just general--

00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:05.070
YouTube, you can grant what's
called read only scope.

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:06.620
So in OAuth, you have this
concept of scope.

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:09.199
So if I really didn't trust
Arun, I would only give him

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:11.820
read only scope, because then
even when he does have my

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:13.800
developer key, he can't
make changes.

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:17.219
Because all that developer key
is authorized to do are reads

00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:18.719
and not writes.

00:34:18.719 --> 00:34:19.178
ARUN NAGARAJAN: All right.

00:34:19.178 --> 00:34:22.090
I'm going to try this one last
time, and if it doesn't work,

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:23.320
you guys will just
have to trust me.

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.174
IKAI LAN: It's the
law of demos.

00:34:24.174 --> 00:34:26.690
That's what it is.

00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:28.139
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah, it doesn't
want to pick it up.

00:34:28.139 --> 00:34:30.110
Something is funky about it.

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:31.580
But you get the idea.

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:32.520
IKAI LAN: We'll dig
into this later.

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:32.730
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah.

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:35.645
It should be able to pick up
this data and be able to plot

00:34:35.645 --> 00:34:36.900
it in a nice way.

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.884
So hopefully there's three
examples that we showed, all

00:34:39.884 --> 00:34:41.580
of which we'll have up.

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:43.670
IKAI LAN: So let's expand a
little bit more into what some

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:44.770
of the other dimensions are.

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:46.679
We've shown age and gender,
which are very, very cool.

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:49.739
But a lot of people sometimes
ask us, what's the break down

00:34:49.739 --> 00:34:51.510
by country?

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:54.179
We purposely didn't show that
one the show, because right

00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:57.390
before the show, we ran the
country report, and it goes

00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:58.590
through every country
in the world.

00:34:58.590 --> 00:34:59.660
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And
it takes a while.

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:03.020
So let's actually wrap on that,
because if it takes

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:04.590
forever, who cares?

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:07.790
So let's see what the right way
to specify that would be.

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:08.710
If I go down to--

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:09.630
IKAI LAN: Again, you
want to go to the

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:11.260
available reports page.

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:12.210
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Right.

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:13.590
IKAI LAN: And you'll
see all of these.

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:15.160
You'll see you have
lots of different

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.015
dimensions and metrics.

00:35:16.015 --> 00:35:17.080
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So how
should I do this?

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.130
I should do it by month?

00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:21.510
IKAI LAN: We could
do it by country.

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:24.340
Will you do it by country
and see views?

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:25.230
We can do comments.

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:27.410
And you can see that we also
get subscribers gained,

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:28.235
subscribers lost.

00:35:28.235 --> 00:35:31.630
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So let's do
country and comments, yeah?

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:32.890
Dimension of country.

00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:34.850
IKAI LAN: We don't get that many
comments, I don't think,

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:35.550
but what the heck.

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:36.280
This'll be fun.

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:38.080
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And the
metric is comment.

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.130
IKAI LAN: Let's see
where all these

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:40.080
comments are coming from.

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:40.760
ARUN NAGARAJAN: OK.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:43.030
And then we can say,
load analytics.

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:45.920
And for that, you can see that
these are the abbreviated

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.080
standard form.

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:48.160
IKAI LAN: So there's Mexico.

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.620
And CA I believe is Canada.

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:50.230
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Canada.

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:50.980
Very active.

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:52.390
IKAI LAN: That's the
land of Dan.

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:53.860
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Very
active there.

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:55.265
Well, we're actually quite
active as well.

00:35:55.265 --> 00:35:56.040
IKAI LAN: US, very active.

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:59.510
ARUN NAGARAJAN: We tend to
leave yes or up or down

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:01.580
comments quite a bit.

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:03.410
And also Great Britain.

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:04.220
IKAI LAN: Great Britain, yeah.

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:04.940
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So useful
information.

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:06.400
And you can see how easy--

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:11.640
once the hard work is done about
being able to load the

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.700
parameters, you can see that
you can do a lot of

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:14.880
interesting things
pretty quickly.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.210
IKAI LAN: And I'm curious
to see minutes

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:18.490
watched on this metric.

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:19.850
And we probably won't
run that now because

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:20.600
that'll take too long.

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:23.390
But for instance, if you are a
channel owner, one thing that

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:26.670
we would learn from this is,
hey, all of our content is

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:30.620
very English-speaking
-language-centric.

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:33.520
Maybe we should offer captions
with translations.

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:36.390
Or maybe we should think about
offering local content for

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:39.080
some underserved but important
developer populations.

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:39.550
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Right.

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:43.410
So we can actually do that,
I believe, pretty quickly.

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:46.030
We have quite a few countries
that people--

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:48.310
IKAI LAN: It's just going
to keep going, man.

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:48.680
ARUN NAGARAJAN: All right.

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:50.640
So we'll do that real
quick, and then I

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:51.870
should be able to do--

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:52.320
what is it?

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.510
Minutes watched.

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:55.470
IKAI LAN: Minutes watched.

00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:58.010
And you'll notice that now
country is an option as a

00:36:58.010 --> 00:37:01.440
filter, which is the third
rightmost column.

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:04.410
So when you go to minutes
watched, we can do, for

00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:06.760
instance, the last 30 days,
minutes watched.

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:09.240
Estimate minutes watched, and
you can filter by country.

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.620
You see it in the third row?

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:11.870
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Gotcha.

00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:16.640
So dimensions is minutes
watched, yeah?

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:16.960
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:17.790
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Or
was it metric?

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:19.670
No, metric was minutes
watched.

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.950
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:23.250
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And the
dimension was nothing.

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:25.860
IKAI LAN: Dimension is-- we'll
pick 30 days or something.

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:27.750
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Let's
do 30 day totals.

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:29.790
IKAI LAN: Yeah.

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:31.610
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And you can have
this all in a drop down.

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:34.370
It doesn't have to be
this complicated.

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:36.980
And then filter.

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:37.953
IKAI LAN: And the
filter syntax is

00:37:37.953 --> 00:37:38.500
a little bit different.

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:41.580
You do the filter name, equals,
equals, and the

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:42.220
country code.

00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:44.950
So let's take a look
to see how often--

00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:48.750
and it's giving us everything
for the last 30 days.

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:50.020
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah.

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:52.230
And this is not really sorted
in any useful way.

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:57.080
But you can see that this is
going to give me the minutes

00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:00.590
watched and should roll this up
to dollars, because we're

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:02.110
quite popular, some of
these videos are.

00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:05.330
And you should be able to see
what days are the best for

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:06.040
viewership and so on.

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:06.730
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:09.250
And what's really great is that
you can slice and dice

00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:12.230
the data and draw useful
information.

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:14.380
Google is a very data
driven company.

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.100
I think that we sometimes
go on intuition.

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:19.010
My intuition is that when we do
English language content,

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:21.320
it will be more popular in
English speaking countries.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:21.640
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Right.

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:26.390
IKAI LAN: But then again, we
really want to see where are--

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:28.890
one thing that, again, you could
just draw a correlation.

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:30.900
Maybe there's a place with a
lot of views, but with very

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:32.190
low minutes watched.

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:33.730
And we want to figure
out, why is that?

00:38:33.730 --> 00:38:36.590
How can we better tune our video
content to serve those

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:37.540
populations?

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:40.630
So you can do a ton of cool
stuff with YouTube Analytics

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:44.850
if you're running any kind of
video site or video channel.

00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:47.160
There's one thing I forgot to
mention, which is that there's

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:48.380
something called the
Partner API.

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:50.990
So let's say that you're using
the Partner API because you

00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:52.320
are a content owner.

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:55.270
And what you can do is you can
claim copyright on videos.

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:57.340
And what you'll be able to do is
you'll also be able to run

00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:59.390
analytics on those videos,
even if you

00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:00.530
didn't upload them.

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:03.950
But you have to claim that I own
the rights to this video.

00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:04.880
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's
really cool.

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:05.490
I didn't know about that.

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:06.630
IKAI LAN: That is really cool.

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:09.610
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So I think that
we're approaching time.

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:12.480
And so hopefully this was a very
useful session of being

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:15.010
able to take the pieces
that are available.

00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:18.000
And we didn't build any
infrastructure here, no SDKs.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.320
IKAI LAN: That is something I
forgot to mention, which is

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:25.300
that if you are a channel owner
and a content creator,

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:26.270
you might not have

00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:28.150
infrastructure to run reporting.

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:30.150
And with Apps Script
you have--

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:31.940
I don't want to call it
lightweight because it's very

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:36.050
powerful-- you have very
agile, very nimble

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:39.560
infrastructure to go ahead and
build reporting or dashboards

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:40.540
for your content.

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:40.920
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Right.

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:43.950
And so at the end of it, you
have a couple examples that

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:44.820
you can walk away with.

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:45.980
We'll put it all on GitHub.

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:49.990
And thank you, Ikai Lan, very
much for being on our first,

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:51.720
inaugural "Script It!"
series video.

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.210
IKAI LAN: No problem.

00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:53.820
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And hopefully
there'll be

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:54.870
a lot more to come.

00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:57.190
And I learned a lot about
the YouTube APIs.

00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:58.950
Thank you very much for
all the pointers.

00:39:58.950 --> 00:40:01.050
And I hope you enjoyed this.

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:02.700
IKAI LAN: And for those of you
guys that are here from the

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:06.100
YouTube side of things, we are
doing weekly YouTube shows.

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:09.050
So developers.google.com/live,
and you'll

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:10.080
find our YouTube shows.

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.480
I think we're doing
one tomorrow.

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:12.010
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Excellent.

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:13.180
IKAI LAN: And we're
talking about--

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:14.410
tomorrow's show is going
to be really-- we're

00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:15.780
talking about WebM.

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:16.720
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Oh, excellent.

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.590
That's the new open standard
that Google's behind.

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:20.490
IKAI LAN: Yeah.

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:21.410
It's going to be a deep dive.

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:24.360
It's going to be very technical,
very, very nerdy,

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:25.030
very geeky.

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:26.150
I'm going to be watching it.

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:27.670
I'm going to watch it over and
over until I understand it.

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:29.540
ARUN NAGARAJAN: I'll try
to join in as well.

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:32.045
Well, with that, thank you
very much, and I hope you

00:40:32.045 --> 00:40:32.370
enjoyed the show.

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:33.070
IKAI LAN: Thank you guys.

00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:33.940
And we'll see you next time.

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:35.190
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Thank you.
