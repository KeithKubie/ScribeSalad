13 times.

00:01:13.906 --> 00:01:15.775
All for alcohol convictions.

00:01:15.808 --> 00:01:19.278

00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:20.880
Uh--

00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:23.416
When I was 17 years old,
I was at a house party.

00:01:23.449 --> 00:01:24.984
And I was
a really insecure kid,

00:01:25.017 --> 00:01:26.619
so I would do anything to
get people to like me.

00:01:26.652 --> 00:01:29.756
So it's shocking
that I became a comic.

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:33.326
And when I was a kid,
I was at this house party.

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:34.660
And my friend Nick goes,

00:01:34.693 --> 00:01:36.662
hey, Dave,
you should bong a fifth.

00:01:36.695 --> 00:01:41.634
And I was like,
you're right.

00:01:41.667 --> 00:01:44.804
So, my friend Anthony
held out a beer bong,

00:01:44.837 --> 00:01:47.640
and my friend Nick poured in
and entire fifth

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:50.143
of Absolut Vodka.

00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:53.112
And then Nick goes,
dude, this is really stupid.

00:01:53.145 --> 00:01:57.850
Poured in some Sprite.

00:01:57.883 --> 00:02:01.954

what happens

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:04.790

You tap dance for four minutes.

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:18.804
You tell your girlfriend,

00:02:18.837 --> 00:02:20.673
who you love more
than life itself,

00:02:20.706 --> 00:02:24.644
that she has
orangutan titties.

00:02:30.015 --> 00:02:34.487
You light a cigarette
by the filter.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.724
And you pass out
through a glass table.

00:02:38.757 --> 00:02:40.660
You wake up the next day
to the police,

00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:41.994

'Cause all my friends
just took off, you know.

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:50.303
The party dispersed,
the parents came home,

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:54.307
and were like, there's a dead
kid in my living room.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.542
So they walk in
and they're like, hey, Dave.

00:02:56.575 --> 00:02:58.678
And I'm like,
hey, hey, fellas.

00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:00.346
How are you?

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:01.647

you're gonna go to real jail.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.249
And you're a teenager.

00:03:03.282 --> 00:03:05.051

arrest, the judge hates you,

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:07.420
you're gonna go
to actual prison.

00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:08.821

right now.

00:03:10.556 --> 00:03:13.259
If you agree to go to a rehab
and change your life,

00:03:13.292 --> 00:03:14.527
we will drive you there.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.661
And we will let you do that.

00:03:15.694 --> 00:03:17.363
We will call your parents,

00:03:17.396 --> 00:03:19.165
figure out how you're gonna pay
for it, but that's it.

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:21.200
Right now, what's your choice,
jail or rehab?

00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:24.370
And I was like, uh...

00:03:24.403 --> 00:03:28.374
He goes, are you seriously
thinking about it?

00:03:28.407 --> 00:03:30.543
I was like, okay, uh--

00:03:30.576 --> 00:03:34.513
do they
butt-fuck you in rehab?

00:03:34.546 --> 00:03:36.082
He goes, no.

00:03:36.115 --> 00:03:37.950
And I was like,
well, then, let's do that one.

00:03:37.983 --> 00:03:41.887
So they handcuff me to
the inside of an ambulance,

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.889
and they drove me to a rehab.

00:03:43.922 --> 00:03:45.191
But on the way there,
they found out

00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:46.959
there were
no beds available.

00:03:46.992 --> 00:03:50.696
So I had to be detoured
to a mental hospital,

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:52.698
which was their
sister hospital,

00:03:52.731 --> 00:03:54.967
until a bed opened up.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.802
So we get to this hospital.

00:03:56.835 --> 00:03:59.639
I'm getting walked in
by three cops, handcuffed,

00:03:59.672 --> 00:04:01.574
and they take me
to meet my counselor,

00:04:01.607 --> 00:04:04.076
and then my counselor
takes me to meet my roommate.

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:05.911
I'm like,
roommates and counselors.

00:04:05.944 --> 00:04:08.080
This is gonna be like camp.
This is incredible.

00:04:08.113 --> 00:04:10.750
So we walked to this back room.
There's two beds.

00:04:10.783 --> 00:04:15.755
And on one bed, this kid's just
kinda sitting there staring.

00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:17.657
Counselor goes, Dave,
this is Reese.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.659
Reese, Dave.
Get to know each other.

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:21.260
You're gonna be roommates.

00:04:21.293 --> 00:04:24.130
And Reese goes,
what're you in for?

00:04:24.163 --> 00:04:26.132
I go, uh...

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:28.067
I bonged a fifth?

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.770
I think I'm an alcoholic
of some kind.

00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:33.472
I'm like, what about you?
He goes, who, me?

00:04:33.505 --> 00:04:36.209
I'm a werewolf.

00:04:42.548 --> 00:04:44.817
Is he for real?

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.952
I go, you don't look
like a werewolf, man.

00:04:46.985 --> 00:04:50.223
He goes, yeah, I'm not
a werewolf right now.

00:04:51.657 --> 00:04:53.459
There's not a full moon.

00:04:53.492 --> 00:04:57.263
If there was a full moon,
I'd transform into a werewolf.

00:04:57.296 --> 00:04:58.631
And I attack people.

00:04:58.664 --> 00:04:59.665
I don't remember it.

00:04:59.698 --> 00:05:01.133
Last week, I blacked out,

00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:04.003
and they told me
I almost killed my dad.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.342
Neat.

00:05:09.375 --> 00:05:13.546
Uh, hey, counselor,
I'm gonna need my own room.

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:15.614
This dude thinks
he's a werewolf.

00:05:15.647 --> 00:05:17.016
And he goes,
oh, he's not a werewolf,

00:05:17.049 --> 00:05:19.919
you're gonna be fine.

00:05:24.423 --> 00:05:28.828
Okay, uh, I think he doesn't
know he's not a werewolf.

00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:31.230
I'm kind of all set on that.

00:05:31.263 --> 00:05:32.732
And he goes, I don't know
what you're not getting.

00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:35.034
He's not a werewolf, okay?

00:05:35.067 --> 00:05:39.505
He's a delusional schizophrenic
with rage issues.

00:05:39.538 --> 00:05:42.141
Okay, well, that's good.
But, um--

00:05:42.174 --> 00:05:44.543
I just bonged a fifth.
I'm not a crazy person.

00:05:44.576 --> 00:05:46.912
So if I could just get my
own room till I go to rehab--

00:05:46.945 --> 00:05:49.715
He goes, you got
brought in by cops, handcuffed.

00:05:49.748 --> 00:05:51.183
You're probably
more dangerous than him.

00:05:51.216 --> 00:05:52.752
Everybody gets a roommate.

00:05:52.785 --> 00:05:53.819
That's your roommate.

00:05:53.852 --> 00:05:55.521
And he just walked away.

00:05:55.554 --> 00:05:57.757
Now, being in a mental hospital
is not that bad.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:58.824
I'm there two days.

00:05:58.857 --> 00:06:00.359

00:06:00.392 --> 00:06:01.927

You can't eat anything

00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:06.665
'cause people get shanky.

00:06:06.698 --> 00:06:09.435
And they take your shoelaces
on account of the hangings.

00:06:09.468 --> 00:06:14.039
But other than that,
totally normal hospital.

00:06:14.072 --> 00:06:16.208
And one night I'm going to bed,

00:06:16.241 --> 00:06:18.444
and all of a sudden,
from the next bunk,

00:06:18.477 --> 00:06:19.779

rips all of his clothes off,

00:06:48.173 --> 00:06:51.710
walks to the edge of the bed,
and starts barking at me.

00:07:08.994 --> 00:07:11.096
I grab a lamp
to hit him with it,

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:14.033
and it's fucking glued down.

00:07:16.702 --> 00:07:20.506
So now this dude's on top of
me, trying to bite my face off,

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:25.144
which didn't bother me,
'cause dude was naked.

00:07:25.177 --> 00:07:29.615
So the whole time I could feel
his cock and balls

00:07:29.648 --> 00:07:32.251
slamming against my thighs,

00:07:32.284 --> 00:07:34.920

bust in the door,

00:07:41.326 --> 00:07:43.796
see him naked on top of me,
and I swear to God,

00:07:43.829 --> 00:07:45.698
one looks at the other one
and goes,

00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:47.132
uh, do we let 'em finish?

00:07:47.165 --> 00:07:49.301
Like, I don't know
what you wanna do.

00:07:49.334 --> 00:07:51.837
I'm like, we're not having sex,
he wants to murder me.

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.173
Please.
He thinks he's a wolf, please.

00:07:54.206 --> 00:07:56.308
They hit him in the ass
with a syringe.

00:07:56.341 --> 00:07:58.444
It's filled with something
called "booty juice,"

00:07:58.477 --> 00:08:01.547
which they--swear to God--they
give it to mental patients

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.182
when they go violent.

00:08:03.215 --> 00:08:06.619
And this dude goes limp.
All of him, instantaneously.

00:08:06.652 --> 00:08:08.687
They pull him off.
I stood up, I'm in tears.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.657
I'm like,
I don't wanna be here!

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:13.392
I'm an alcoholic.

00:08:13.425 --> 00:08:15.327
I'm so scared.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.296
You have me rooming
with monsters.

00:08:17.329 --> 00:08:20.499
I would've rather
gone to prison.

00:08:20.532 --> 00:08:22.568
I don't want--I'm--
I don't wanna be here.

00:08:22.601 --> 00:08:25.070
I don't wanna be--oh, my God.
Take me home.

00:08:25.103 --> 00:08:26.839
Please, no more roommates.

00:08:26.872 --> 00:08:32.344
Oh, my, there's a wolf dick
mushroom print on my thigh.

00:08:32.377 --> 00:08:36.882
No more roommates.
No!

00:08:36.915 --> 00:08:39.519
So then I go to bed.

00:08:41.119 --> 00:08:45.525
With the help
of anti-psychotics.

00:08:47.593 --> 00:08:51.096
And after a kind of a still
tossy-turny night sleep,

00:08:51.129 --> 00:08:53.832
I wake up.
Next day.

00:08:53.865 --> 00:08:56.168
And they bring in
my new roommate.

00:08:56.201 --> 00:08:58.871
They're like,
hey, Dave, this is Keith.

00:08:58.904 --> 00:09:00.172
Keith, Dave,
get to know each other.

00:09:00.205 --> 00:09:01.407
You're gonna be roommates--

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.209
[screaming]
Yeah, hi, Keith.

00:09:04.242 --> 00:09:05.444
Whoa, dude,
what's your problem?

00:09:05.477 --> 00:09:07.546
What's my problem?

00:09:07.579 --> 00:09:09.448
Last night,

00:09:09.481 --> 00:09:11.250
I got attacked

00:09:11.283 --> 00:09:16.055
by a goddamned werewolf.

00:09:19.157 --> 00:09:21.427
And then Keith looks at
the counselor and goes,

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.964
hey, man,
I'm gonna need my own room.

00:09:26.298 --> 00:09:30.769
And that's how
they make crazy people.

00:09:30.802 --> 00:09:34.073
[cheers and applause]

00:09:40.846 --> 00:09:43.415
And I tell you that story
to tell you this one.

00:09:43.448 --> 00:09:46.585
I was not a good student,
if you can believe it.

00:09:46.618 --> 00:09:48.287
I spent five years
in high school,

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.790
which I'm told is too many.

00:09:51.823 --> 00:09:54.493
And I always--like, again--
I always wanted attention.

00:09:54.526 --> 00:09:56.161
I always wanted people
to like me.

00:09:56.194 --> 00:09:58.163
And I had a class
called Humanities.

00:09:58.196 --> 00:09:59.565
I don't know if
you ever had it.

00:09:59.598 --> 00:10:01.100
I don't know
what the fuck it is.

00:10:01.133 --> 00:10:02.935
But I had the class.

00:10:02.968 --> 00:10:05.938
And one day, I came into class
and the teacher wasn't there.

00:10:05.971 --> 00:10:07.606
And there's a blank chalkboard,

00:10:07.639 --> 00:10:10.643
so I'm like, well, I should,
you know, draw a dick.

00:10:13.645 --> 00:10:15.581
So I just drew a dick,
you know.

00:10:15.614 --> 00:10:17.449
And the teacher comes in,
and she's like,

00:10:17.482 --> 00:10:20.519
ugh, fuck, just--

00:10:20.552 --> 00:10:23.155
The next day I come in,
there's no teacher,

00:10:23.188 --> 00:10:26.759
so I'm like,
yeah, I'll draw a dick.

00:10:26.792 --> 00:10:29.762
Day number three, I'm like,
is this a miracle?

00:10:29.795 --> 00:10:31.030
More dick.

00:10:31.063 --> 00:10:34.600
Now, this goes on
for three months.

00:10:34.633 --> 00:10:36.802
And I'm not just drawing it
on the chalkboard.

00:10:36.835 --> 00:10:38.971
I'm hiding it in books.

00:10:39.004 --> 00:10:40.639
I'm putting it on,
like, the door.

00:10:40.672 --> 00:10:41.874
Balls on the knob.

00:10:41.907 --> 00:10:43.442
Like, it's just ridiculous.

00:10:43.475 --> 00:10:45.477
And I'm putting it,
like, on her desk.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.312
Just drawing dicks.
Dicks, dicks, dicks.

00:10:47.345 --> 00:10:49.515
And this goes on
for three months.

00:10:49.548 --> 00:10:51.784
Then one day
she comes into class,

00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:54.186
and there's
an overhead projector set up.

00:10:54.219 --> 00:10:57.489
She walks up, and expecting
a dick--no dick.

00:10:57.522 --> 00:10:59.792
She breathes a sigh of relief.

00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:04.196
And then, she turns around
and pulls down the screen.

00:11:06.031 --> 00:11:08.634
Boom.
Permanent marker dick.

00:11:08.667 --> 00:11:12.838
Two different colors.
I even had purple for the vein.

00:11:12.871 --> 00:11:18.510
Here's a thing, though.
She loses her fucking mind.

00:11:18.543 --> 00:11:21.313
She goes,
who is doing this?

00:11:21.346 --> 00:11:23.649
Which one of you
are doing this?

00:11:23.682 --> 00:11:25.217
Who is doing this?

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:30.255
Which one of you
are the penis master?

00:11:30.288 --> 00:11:33.092
Who is the penis master?

00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:35.561
Where is the penis master?

00:11:35.594 --> 00:11:38.697
I wanna meet the penis master.

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.366
At this point, there's people
coming out other classrooms,

00:11:41.399 --> 00:11:44.269
like, "someone's yelling
penis master."

00:11:44.302 --> 00:11:46.071
There's janitors going by,

00:11:46.104 --> 00:11:47.539
like,
I'll be your penis master.

00:11:47.572 --> 00:11:49.374
I don't give a--

00:11:49.407 --> 00:11:51.176
Who is the penis master?

00:11:51.209 --> 00:11:55.114
She is on her knees crying,
mascara running down her face.

00:11:55.147 --> 00:11:57.282
I felt so horrible.

00:11:57.315 --> 00:11:59.885
I finally stood up,
and I'm like,

00:11:59.918 --> 00:12:04.590
I am the penis master.

00:12:05.791 --> 00:12:09.261
She goes,
all hail the penis master.

00:12:09.294 --> 00:12:12.097
I'm like,
this is fucking weird.

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:14.299
She goes, come down to
the office with me right now.

00:12:14.332 --> 00:12:16.235
We go into
the principal's office.

00:12:16.268 --> 00:12:18.904
She walks me in.
She goes, tell him.

00:12:18.937 --> 00:12:22.174
Tell him who you are.

00:12:28.013 --> 00:12:31.216
I, uh, I'm the penis master.

00:12:31.249 --> 00:12:32.918
He goes,
that's great, Dave.

00:12:32.951 --> 00:12:34.586
So she tells him what happened,

00:12:34.619 --> 00:12:36.221
and he writes down on
a suspension slip,

00:12:36.254 --> 00:12:37.756
"Dave is suspended for one week

00:12:37.789 --> 00:12:39.925
"because he likes drawing
male genitalia

00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.126
all over his classroom."

00:12:41.159 --> 00:12:42.828
He hands it to me.

00:12:42.861 --> 00:12:44.830
He goes, don't come back until
your parents sign it.

00:12:44.863 --> 00:12:46.431
And I am suspended.

00:12:46.464 --> 00:12:48.934
When I come back,
I get suspended again.

00:12:48.967 --> 00:12:50.335
Because when I handed in
the slip,

00:12:50.368 --> 00:12:53.438
I did not have
my parents sign it.

00:12:53.471 --> 00:12:57.309
Instead, I drew a dick.

00:13:00.812 --> 00:13:02.281
I come back a week later,

00:13:02.314 --> 00:13:04.016
and I finally go back
to the class,

00:13:04.049 --> 00:13:06.118
and the teacher's gone.

00:13:06.151 --> 00:13:07.119
And I'm like,
whoa, this is weird.

00:13:07.152 --> 00:13:08.854
Like, What happened?

00:13:08.887 --> 00:13:11.791
And they're like, yeah,
Dave, she's--she went insane.

00:13:13.625 --> 00:13:15.460
I'm like, wait, what do you
mean she went, like--

00:13:15.493 --> 00:13:17.930
They're like, dude, she didn't
think you acted alone.

00:13:17.963 --> 00:13:21.033
There were so many dicks.
Like, she thought--

00:13:21.066 --> 00:13:24.870
She thought there was another
gunner on the grassy knoll.

00:13:24.903 --> 00:13:29.842
She just started asking kids
if they were the penis master.

00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:33.145
And they had to let her go
to get psychiatric care.

00:13:33.178 --> 00:13:37.216
Like, you drove her nuts
with dicks.

00:13:37.249 --> 00:13:40.152
Which means,
that at some point,

00:13:40.185 --> 00:13:43.155
in a mental hospital,
in Michigan,

00:13:43.188 --> 00:13:44.823
in the late '90s,

00:13:44.856 --> 00:13:48.126
my teacher could've walked up
to a kid, and said,

00:13:48.159 --> 00:13:49.995
are you the penis master?

00:13:50.028 --> 00:13:52.331
And he was like,
who, me? Nah.

00:13:52.364 --> 00:13:54.900
I'm a werewolf.

00:13:54.933 --> 00:13:57.402
Thank you guys very much.

00:13:57.435 --> 00:13:58.904
