00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.929
- [Voiceover] Given all
of the recent talk about

00:00:01.929 --> 00:00:05.962
the United Kingdom deciding
to leave the European Union,

00:00:05.962 --> 00:00:10.156
often referred to as Brexit,
short for British exit

00:00:10.156 --> 00:00:12.300
from the European Union.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.862
I thought it would be
interesting to do a primer on

00:00:14.862 --> 00:00:17.966
what exactly is the European Union?

00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:21.028
This is gonna be a high
level primer, the topic can

00:00:21.028 --> 00:00:23.590
get quite complex, quite fast.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.557
But to understand what the
European Union even is,

00:00:27.557 --> 00:00:31.777
I will draw a little lines
to represent the spectrum

00:00:31.777 --> 00:00:35.172
of, I guess you could say
national organizations,

00:00:35.172 --> 00:00:36.908
or organizations of nations.

00:00:36.908 --> 00:00:39.229
So at this end right over here, I'll draw,

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:43.155
this is a trade block, this
is when a group of nations

00:00:43.155 --> 00:00:46.257
get together and say,
"Hey, let's have free trade

00:00:46.257 --> 00:00:47.164
"between our countries".

00:00:47.164 --> 00:00:49.144
Let's make it, if we make
something in one country,

00:00:49.144 --> 00:00:52.195
we want to sell in the next,
that there's no tariff on them.

00:00:52.195 --> 00:00:54.553
And it might include things
like, it's easy to move money

00:00:54.553 --> 00:00:56.885
between one country to another,
and sometimes it will even

00:00:56.885 --> 00:00:59.408
include it's easy to move
people between one country to

00:00:59.408 --> 00:01:01.720
another, and a good
example of a trade block,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.527
especially from a North
American point-of-view is NAFTA,

00:01:05.527 --> 00:01:08.582
North American Free Trade Agreement.

00:01:08.582 --> 00:01:11.018
This is the United States,
Mexico, and Canada having

00:01:11.018 --> 00:01:12.140
a free trade agreement.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.340
You make something in
one of those countries,

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.160
you want to sell it in the
other one, you don't have to

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.284
have, you don't have any
tariffs, it makes it reasonably

00:01:19.284 --> 00:01:22.144
easy to transport goods
from one country to another.

00:01:22.144 --> 00:01:24.542
There's even some provisions
around investments

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:27.272
and the movement of people.

00:01:27.272 --> 00:01:29.255
Why would a country ant to do this?

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:32.685
There's many economic
arguments and theories that it

00:01:32.685 --> 00:01:35.750
increases the prosperities
of all of the parties.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.118
Now some folks will disagree
with that, but they might

00:01:38.118 --> 00:01:40.108
say on average it might, but
there's definitely going to be

00:01:40.108 --> 00:01:42.252
some losers in different
countries depending on which

00:01:42.252 --> 00:01:45.891
industries go where, but
that's the rational for why

00:01:45.891 --> 00:01:47.673
free trade agreements exist.

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:50.192
That it would increase the
economic growth of all involved

00:01:50.192 --> 00:01:52.840
and it'll make them all
be able to participate in

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.507
a larger economic shared market.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.578
Now at this side of the spectrum,
I'm gonna talk about when

00:01:59.578 --> 00:02:02.760
states get really close to
each other to really form

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.069
a meta-state, to really
form a country made up of

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.997
those states, and I will
call this a federation.

00:02:09.997 --> 00:02:13.681
Maybe the most famous
federation, especially from

00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:17.239
an American point-of-view
would be the United States.

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.589
United States of America,
it is made up of 50 state.

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:25.018
It literally stands for
United States of America.

00:02:25.018 --> 00:02:28.780
Those 50 states have become
so integrated that they act as

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.248
one country, they act as one
nation, they act as one people.

00:02:33.248 --> 00:02:35.978
Each of those states,
they are semi-autonomous,

00:02:35.978 --> 00:02:38.866
they do have their own
governor, their own legislator,

00:02:38.866 --> 00:02:42.533
their own courts their
own laws, but they...

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.501
There's also a federal government,
there's a federal army,

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:50.522
federal courts, there's a president,

00:02:50.522 --> 00:02:53.873
there is a federal legislature.

00:02:53.873 --> 00:02:57.593
They are so integrated
as to be one country.

00:02:57.593 --> 00:03:00.153
Now in between you'll
sometimes hear words like

00:03:00.153 --> 00:03:03.403
confederation, or confederacy, con-fed,

00:03:05.524 --> 00:03:06.691
confederation.

00:03:09.328 --> 00:03:13.919
And this is more of a lose
term, there's not a strict,

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:16.276
this is a confederation, or
that is not a confederation,

00:03:16.276 --> 00:03:20.504
but it's generally viewed
as looser than federation.

00:03:20.504 --> 00:03:22.602
That the states, or the
countries that are members

00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:25.701
of a confederation can opt-in or opt-out.

00:03:25.701 --> 00:03:27.938
That they might be
integrated in some ways,

00:03:27.938 --> 00:03:30.749
and not integrated in other ways.

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:34.708
When we think about the
European Union, which involves,

00:03:34.708 --> 00:03:37.606
which for sure involves
aspects of a trade block.

00:03:37.606 --> 00:03:39.879
It has free trade, it involves free trade

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:42.042
between its members.

00:03:42.042 --> 00:03:44.517
It talks about the movement of people,

00:03:44.517 --> 00:03:46.017
so free, movement.

00:03:47.536 --> 00:03:50.558
But it goes further than
a traditional trade block,

00:03:50.558 --> 00:03:53.001
it goes further than something like NAFTA.

00:03:53.001 --> 00:03:56.846
It has, in Brussels, it
has rotating leadership,

00:03:56.846 --> 00:04:01.388
it has regulations and laws
that often apply to things

00:04:01.388 --> 00:04:04.526
like free trade, and free
movement, but it can also apply

00:04:04.526 --> 00:04:06.302
to things outside of that.

00:04:06.302 --> 00:04:09.779
There's even some integration
between militaries,

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:12.660
or I guess at minimum you
could say cooperation.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.939
Each of the members have their
own military, and they are

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:17.868
independent states in there
own right, but there is more

00:04:17.868 --> 00:04:21.340
integration than you would
see in something like NAFTA.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.518
So the European Union, I would
put it some place in this

00:04:25.518 --> 00:04:29.156
spectrum right over here, and
depending on whom you talk

00:04:29.156 --> 00:04:31.467
to you will get different
options, and different people

00:04:31.467 --> 00:04:34.191
will debate, some people
say, "It's more about trade,

00:04:34.191 --> 00:04:37.574
"and having a large shared
common market, and maybe being

00:04:37.574 --> 00:04:39.478
"able to have a little
more clout on the world,

00:04:39.478 --> 00:04:41.627
"even from a foreign
policy point-of-view."

00:04:41.627 --> 00:04:44.315
While some people will say,
"No, it seems to be moving

00:04:44.315 --> 00:04:46.545
"in this direction where
it's becoming a tighter

00:04:46.545 --> 00:04:50.757
"confederation of some kind,
albeit with still a lot of

00:04:50.757 --> 00:04:53.955
"independence from each
of the member states."

00:04:53.955 --> 00:04:56.395
And the people who think it's
more on the right hand side,

00:04:56.395 --> 00:04:58.911
they'll point things like,
look its got its own flag.

00:04:58.911 --> 00:05:02.634
It's got it's own anthem,
you have some military,

00:05:02.634 --> 00:05:05.691
more than cooperation, you
even have some integration.

00:05:05.691 --> 00:05:08.418
The trend seems to be
moving from left to right.

00:05:08.418 --> 00:05:12.389
It's not only is it about
trade, it's also about currency.

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:14.788
That's where I'm going to
introduce this other concept,

00:05:14.788 --> 00:05:18.473
called the Eurozone, which
is often confused with

00:05:18.473 --> 00:05:21.244
the European Union, that's
because there's a lot of overlap

00:05:21.244 --> 00:05:22.279
between the two.

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:26.407
The Eurozone is a subset of the
European Union that uses the

00:05:26.407 --> 00:05:30.747
same currency, and then that
currency is called the Euro.

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:35.328
This is about currency, and
this is, about the Euro.

00:05:35.328 --> 00:05:38.095
Once again, this would
move it a little bit more

00:05:38.095 --> 00:05:40.040
to the right, not only
do you have free trade,

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.672
and free movement of people,
and you have some regulations.

00:05:43.672 --> 00:05:45.700
And of course the member
states have representation

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.600
in determining what those regulations are,

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.614
but you also have most of the
European Union has a shared

00:05:51.614 --> 00:05:54.670
currency, which of course
facilitates free trade and free

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.353
movement, but this is more
than what you see in NAFTA.

00:05:57.353 --> 00:06:00.079
Mexico, the United States
and Canada do not have

00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:02.110
a shared currency.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.878
What this map shows us is both the total,

00:06:04.878 --> 00:06:07.608
the European Union, but it
also shows that it's not

00:06:07.608 --> 00:06:10.334
exactly the same thing as the Eurozone.

00:06:10.334 --> 00:06:15.127
Everything we see in blue
and this pink color combined,

00:06:15.127 --> 00:06:17.606
that is the European Union.

00:06:17.606 --> 00:06:20.164
The difference between
the blue and the pink,

00:06:20.164 --> 00:06:23.261
is that the blue are European
members that also use

00:06:23.261 --> 00:06:25.831
the Euro as their currency,
so they are members of

00:06:25.831 --> 00:06:29.427
the Eurozone, so Spain, and
France, and Germany and Italy,

00:06:29.427 --> 00:06:31.817
and the Republic of Ireland.

00:06:31.817 --> 00:06:35.829
The are members of both the
European Union and the Eurozone.

00:06:35.829 --> 00:06:39.587
While countries like the
United Kingdom, and Denmark,

00:06:39.587 --> 00:06:42.318
and Sweden, and Poland, and
I could keep going on and on.

00:06:42.318 --> 00:06:46.485
They do not currently have
the Euro as their currency.

00:06:47.485 --> 00:06:48.848
They have their own currency,

00:06:48.848 --> 00:06:51.320
they have their own central banks.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.919
The UK, which is where we
started this conversation,

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:56.935
they have the British Pound sterling.

00:06:56.935 --> 00:07:00.575
Now in terms of whether, or
how, or whether they're gonna

00:07:00.575 --> 00:07:03.351
move to the Euro, it's different
from country to country.

00:07:03.351 --> 00:07:05.370
Countries like,

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:09.140
countries like the UK and
Denmark have official opt-outs.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.200
They've never had any intention,
they've opt-outs of going

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.235
to the Euro.

00:07:13.235 --> 00:07:16.332
Countries like Sweden, it's
not as official, but it doesn't

00:07:16.332 --> 00:07:19.228
look like they have any
intention of going to the Euro,

00:07:19.228 --> 00:07:21.588
while other countries, it's
just a matter of time before

00:07:21.588 --> 00:07:24.277
they do go to the Euro, and
it's more of them meeting

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:27.379
certain economic and fiscal
thresholds so that they

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:30.151
can enter into the Eurozone.

00:07:30.151 --> 00:07:32.172
Once again, why would you want to become

00:07:32.172 --> 00:07:33.333
part of the Eurozone?

00:07:33.333 --> 00:07:35.803
If you're a country
with a smaller economy,

00:07:35.803 --> 00:07:38.154
or a smaller currency,
or less stable currency,

00:07:38.154 --> 00:07:40.631
you say, "Well, I could become
part of a larger economic

00:07:40.631 --> 00:07:42.781
"zone, I'm already part of
free trade and all that,

00:07:42.781 --> 00:07:46.672
"but the currency makes
it even a stronger thing."

00:07:46.672 --> 00:07:47.956
Why would you not want to do it?

00:07:47.956 --> 00:07:50.390
Well you say, "I have a strong
enough current, I don't want

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:54.484
"to give monetary policy
to folks in Frankfurt."

00:07:54.484 --> 00:07:58.784
Once again, good people can
argue very good arguments

00:07:58.784 --> 00:08:01.056
on either side of that.

00:08:01.056 --> 00:08:03.581
When you look at this map
here, you might also notice

00:08:03.581 --> 00:08:06.435
that Kosovo and Montenegro
are colored in in this

00:08:06.435 --> 00:08:09.232
little pink color, and
this is interesting because

00:08:09.232 --> 00:08:12.575
they are not members of the
European Union, but they have

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:16.251
decided to use the Euro as
their official currency anyway.

00:08:16.251 --> 00:08:18.779
So they're not even official
members of the Eurozone,

00:08:18.779 --> 00:08:20.476
but they still use the Euro.

00:08:20.476 --> 00:08:23.877
So that's why they get their
own special color here.

00:08:23.877 --> 00:08:26.976
So if we go back to Brexit,
if we go back to the

00:08:26.976 --> 00:08:30.894
United Kingdom leaving, what
are the implications here?

00:08:30.894 --> 00:08:33.747
Well, the first clear implication
is that their currency

00:08:33.747 --> 00:08:36.561
is not going to change, and the
future of their currency is,

00:08:36.561 --> 00:08:38.591
is not going to change.

00:08:38.591 --> 00:08:40.993
They were never planning,
they don't use the Euro,

00:08:40.993 --> 00:08:43.015
and they were never planning
on going to the Euro.

00:08:43.015 --> 00:08:46.450
And so, they are using the
Pound sterling, and they will

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:48.559
continue to use the Pound sterling.

00:08:48.559 --> 00:08:50.542
That's kind of a no-brainer
and the Brexit doesn't

00:08:50.542 --> 00:08:51.533
impact that.

00:08:51.533 --> 00:08:52.700
Same currency.

00:08:55.833 --> 00:08:59.300
They're using the Pound
regardless of which way the

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.082
Brexit vote went.

00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:03.765
What the Brexit vote does
by taking them out of the

00:09:03.765 --> 00:09:07.487
European Union, is it puts
these things in question,

00:09:07.487 --> 00:09:09.802
things like free trade and free movement,

00:09:09.802 --> 00:09:13.071
and what regulations they
will adopt or not adopt.

00:09:13.071 --> 00:09:15.054
It doesn't mean that
there won't be free trade,

00:09:15.054 --> 00:09:17.078
or there won't be free
movement, or that regulations

00:09:17.078 --> 00:09:18.607
will change dramatically.

00:09:18.607 --> 00:09:20.833
It also doesn't mean that
that's not going to happen.

00:09:20.833 --> 00:09:25.001
What it means is it's all going
to be called into question.

00:09:25.001 --> 00:09:27.933
These are now going to have
to be separate negotiations

00:09:27.933 --> 00:09:29.586
between the United Kingdom

00:09:29.586 --> 00:09:32.503
and the rest of the European Union.
