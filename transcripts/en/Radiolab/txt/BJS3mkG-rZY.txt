Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radiolab radio from W N Y s e. Okay. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab and today, well, today, yes, the story of an ax wielding nun coming through a window to smack some staphylococcus and take you back to the future. Exactly the story it goes, I'm not getting a sense. I don't know if you will. Okay, well the story comes in two parts, both from our producer Latif Nasser, and here's part one.

Speaker 2:          00:34          So the way the story goes, it starts in 1928

Speaker 1:          00:39          1928 Alexander Fleming, the story goes, who knows if it's apocryphal or not, is growing staph staphylococcus in his lab. That's Maryn Mckenna. She's a science writer and staff is a bacterium. It lives on our skin and especially like parts of the body that are warm and damp. So it likes to be just up our noses or on our genitals or in our armpits, places like that. And generally it's no big deal. It doesn't really do us any harm, but if it gets into a scratch or a cut and makes its way inside our bodies, staff goes from being this benign companion to being

Speaker 3:          01:19          potentially deadly. Anyway,

Speaker 1:          01:23          London 1928 Fleming has growing staff in his lab in these little petri dishes and he was a slob

Speaker 2:          01:31          basically, and he goes on a vacation. He leaves his petri dishes covering bacteria just around leaves his window open and something blows across his lab plates. Some tiny little spec of a thing just floats in through the window and comes to arrest on one of those petri dishes. And so a few weeks later, Fleming finally back from vacation. He needs to use those lab plates again and he and his assistant go to clean them off. Yeah, I mean you'd imagine that he would seed some real lush, nice furry lawn of staff just over flowing

Speaker 1:          02:11          right out of the plate because it's been sitting there for so long. It's been a staff party, but on one of the plates that they pick up, they realize that,

Speaker 3:          02:18          cool,

Speaker 1:          02:19          it's almost polka dot. It's got little dead zones all over it. Little patches where the staff is dead, dead, dead. Something blew through the window, landed in the dish and starts killing the bacteria.

Speaker 2:          02:34          Yeah, and so when Fleming looks down at his plate, he sees that at the center of these, you know, staff dead zones, uh, there's a tiny speck of natural mold. Oh, mo. And they realize that that mold is expressing a compound that is killing the staff around it. It's like emanating rays of death. What was the compound? That compound was called

Speaker 3:          02:59          [inaudible],

Speaker 1:          03:00          the first true antibiotic infectious diseases that had been killing people for as long as we had been. People suddenly could be stopped and it just blew in through the window. That is the, that is the story that's always been told. However it got there, it was, it was amazing. It was a miracle. It was called a miracle drug. Right? I mean, it was just, it was, it really was a moment when the world changed when Fleming was put on the cover of Time magazine. This is 1944 height of World War II. It was a picture of his face and the, the banner on the cover said his penicillin will save more lives than we're can spend.

Speaker 3:          03:44          [inaudible] but,

Speaker 2:          03:45          and this is, um, I had no idea about this. Virtually at the exact same time when Fleming's faces on the cover of Time magazine, like two months later, um, this Stanford researcher publishes that he has found five different streams of staff.

Speaker 1:          04:01          The do not respond to penicillin. Really? Yeah. This is happening while he's on the cover, virtually the exact same moment. And it's the first sign that staff has responded to the penicillin in the world by developing resistance to almost like a separate history. So in wheeler, the era of penicillin was over before it began, almost before it began, before it's even released to the general public. Wow. And that penicillin resistant staff

Speaker 2:          04:30          moves across the globe. And in 1957 in Cleveland, some scientists gather together and they are in a panic. They have no idea why they've lost the antibiotic miracle so quickly. So scientists across the globe put their brains together and try to come up with a new drug next amazing thing. And in 1960 they get methicillin.

Speaker 3:          04:53          Oh

Speaker 1:          04:53          and it works for about 11 months, 11 months.

Speaker 2:          04:59          And so we started this arms race. There was a bug and then there was a drunk that took care of it, and then there was a better bug drug bug drug bugs. Right, exactly. I actually found this list. Do you want to hear it? Yeah. Okay. So streptomycin 1943 resistance, 1948 methicillin 1960 resistance in 1961 clindamycin. 1969 resistance. 1970 wow. You can think of it as leap frog or you can think of it as a game of whac-a-mole, ampicillin, 1961 then 1973 so that's a little carbenicillin released. 1964 resistance. 1974 they're getting better. They're getting better. There were always more trunks. Drug development was doing really well for a really long time. Hyper Cillin introduced 1980 resistance, 1981 but after the year 2000 drug companies begin to realize it's not really in their best interest to make antibiotics anymore. And the end I have on this list is linezolid, which is introduced 2000 resistance, 2002 wow. There are a few more, but you get the idea antibiotic approvals, the entry of new drugs to the market just kind of fell off a cliff. Why? Well to it takes 10 years and $1 billion to get to the point where the drug is marketable. But as soon as you get the drug on the market, the resistance clock is running. So you probably won't make your money back. And as you've probably heard, we now have these situations,

Speaker 1:          06:24          well, frightening new warning from the Centers for disease control about the spread of a string of germ where literally nothing works so called super bugs are now turning up in hospitals and patient dies. There are nail bugs that can resist all of our drugs. I have seen physicians breakdown weeping over this. It's not the way that medicine is supposed to fail anymore, but it does.

Speaker 2:          06:48          I mean I know that that possibly the, the origin story of penicillin, this is apocryphal. So this is all a little suspect, but you know, just do enjoy imagining for a moment. Like it just seems like if that happened, let's just open up a bunch more windows, just something out of blow in and we can wait a long time. Right. I mean, we had staff had been around for Millennia before 1928 but you know, the whole reason I wanted to do this story is because kind of there is a new window. It's a different kind of window though. Not to not a window nexus and petri dishes, not a window nexus and petri dishes. Kind of a window next to somebody, few dishes, but a totally different kind of window. What kind of window is it? Well, I'm about to tell you that it's something blow into the window. Yeah, but it's not mold. It's way more fun than mold it. It carries an ax. How about that? So it's a person maybe I don't even know what I'm referring to anymore.

Speaker 2:          09:22          Uh, part two. Yep. Okay. Hey, I'm Jad I boom. Rod. Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab. We're ready now for part two. Now remember when part one ended, there was a window open and something was going to come through. We don't know what to do. We know it's not mold. Yeah, we know it's not mold. So whatever it is, whatever it was, whatever it will be, we will hear about it. Now from our reporter Latif Nasser, well, actually there is this story about these two women who did open a window, uh, to, to an alien and distant land. Um, and actually in a way it's a story about re-imagining the past, but to me it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a story about a friendship. Hey everybody. Hello again. Hello again. It's a story about an unlikely friendship. Um, it's a bloody field. It's a buddy.

Speaker 2:          10:07          Yeah, it's a buddy movie. Okay. So, yeah, tell us, maybe just walk us through it. Right. So, okay, so you have, um, hello, I'm Dr. Christina Lee, Christina and I'm an associate professor in Viking studies at the school of English at the University of Nottingham. She's a historian. And then you also have, hi, I'm Freya Harrison. Freya. I'm a research fellow in the center for biomolecular sciences at the University of Nottingham and free up free as a microbiologist. She studies bacteria. We'll start with her. Okay. So most of my work is about, so we're looking at how bacteria, if all of during very, very long lived infections, but like my big hobby is Anglosaxon Viking reenactment [inaudible] interest in the history and uh, mainly in dressing up as a warrior and going to fight club every Wednesday night and learning to use the weapons. Yeah. So this is actually not free as group. This is a group in New Jersey, but basically they do the same thing. Hundreds of people go out into, you know, some field with some dulled weapons, everything from swords, spears, axes, and we give each other a jolly good fashioning and have a good time.

Speaker 2:          11:24          I only mentioned this cause it, it actually plays into the story. Well it was, it was really a nice sort of coincidence really. So 2012 a few years after finishing her doctorate, Freya goes off to work at the University of Nottingham. Nottingham is one of the places in the UK, not only for, for microbiology, but for sort of Anglo Saxon in Viking history. And she goes there to study microbes, but she figures, hey, why not while I'm here, brush up on my old English with her h m will here, it's [inaudible]. I'd studied some old English to a level where I could sort of read and fat and speak a little bit. Let's stand on Nif Nikita. She figured, Hey, she could, she could be better. And if she did, she would get deeper into the whole reenactment thing. So I rather cheekily emailed the school of English, his old English reading group.

Speaker 2:          12:12          That's where she met Christina, the historian. And I thought one point Christina, the historian asks freer like what do you do? And Fred said, you know, my day job is that I'm a microbiologist, but on evenings and weekends I'm a history nerd. And Christina said the moment she heard that and just kind of thought I found my kindred spirit here because she was like, wow, I'm like your mirror image because I'm a historian by day, but by night I'm a microbiology nerd. I've been interested in infectious disease for quite a long time. Which um, I don't, I don't find any kind of friends in my department. She told me she's the kind of person who would, you know, watch Ebola coverage on the news and not be able to stop watching. So eventually they start talking about historical diseases. So like how would people back then have treated something like, you know, Ebola, Freya is especially interested in this because she, for her struggle, reenactment is developing this nun character who goes off and heels people.

Speaker 2:          13:14          But anyway, so they're talking back and forth. And then to cut a long story short, they find themselves both interested in this one particular book. It's known as boat's leach book. This is about 1100 years old. What's it called? Bolt balls. What? Bolds leach book as nothing to do with no hat. Oh, even though it just spelled as B Zeno d it is indeed leach like leach like a, like a leach, like a little worm. It grabs onto your, your blood? No, no. It comes from the old English word legend, which is actually a healer or a doctor. So is it that little squeaky animals are called leaches because they're medicinal, not the other way around. So the doctor wasn't named for the leads. The lead was named for the doctors. And Bald is the, as a man the guy wrote, we think it's a guy, we think it's like a nice name.

Speaker 2:          14:01          And what is this book? So it's kind of like this old healers handbook. It's filled with these potions and cures. The original manuscript is in the British library locked away, but 21st century very kind. People have digitize the original old English text and put it online. So Christina and Freya bring it up and they start going through all the remedies. And you know, as it describes to you remedies for stuff that is a little bit different. You know, things like phone Odell vote for no money on possession by the devil, which according to this leach book, the remedy for someone who is possessed by the devil is you view the rank and Lutheran make this kind of like foul brew. You make them drink it and it'll make them vomit out the devil. And then there's another remedy for warts. This shale we at our new auto zone and all I'm going to say about that one is that it involves Helen's urine and mouse blood.

Speaker 2:          14:56          And then things like Muncie, I taught around a, how should we say, make your husband more physically attentive or less physically attentive, whichever you, whichever direction you need to moderate it or towed blood drink on [inaudible] Nestea actually it's just you boil boiler, plant and some water and give it to the guy. Oh yeah. Anyway, so free and Christina are going through this Veatch book looking for some kind of wounds thing. It was clearly an infection, some posse, uh, something we could clearly say that that's bacteria. And eventually they, they find an entry at the end of the recipe. It says an old English, say Beth's de la [inaudible] still nudged them. The best medicine. The best medicine. Yeah. Move over. Laughter. Yeah. And we thought, how can we not try this one? What was the best medicine for? So it said it was for a lump in the eye.

Speaker 2:          15:54          It's anticoag when in holding these days if you get a course like that could be something like a watch. Right? But there is a suggestion by archeologists that eye infection was, was rife amongst the Anglo Saxons because you lived in buildings where you, you had smoke going on, you look crammed together. So that could also be a sty. What is a STI? It's an infection of an eyelash follicle. You Rub, it itches and then it gets scrolling. Causes quite a nasty red lumps of STI in your eyes. Stay in your eye. Now it just so happens that the bacteria that causes the signer I is staphylococcus Aureus staph. Oh, the same stuff as the mister window man. Penicillin man. Exactly. And we just thought, wouldn't it be nice to have a bit of spare time and add a couple of hundred quid to buy the ingredients and just give this a go?

Speaker 2:          16:43          Yes, let's give it a try. You know, why, why the hell not? And matter of fact we thought that two video recently producer Matt Kielty and I went to my tiny apartment in the city and we tried to cook it up to, are you ready to cook? Oh, I'm ready to cut. I've got this recipe here. Please read it. Go for it. Okay. It goes like this with one name crop. That's the first line of the recipe. And right off the bat for Christina and Freya, there's a problem. That first ingredient would crop the ouch crop latch. Christina said it was quite difficult to translate and nobody quite knows what it is, but luckily just a couple of words over was a clue. Then Garlia they May 2nd ingredient garlic, which is an allium spaces and crop latch. We know this was another allium. That's what the dictionary of old English, um, tells us significant probably what they were dealing with as an onion or leak.

Speaker 2:          17:41          We didn't know which one. So we thought, okay, we'll try one that has onion and one that has leak. Now you knew the recipe doesn't cover this, but we did it anyway. Um, peel the onion, chop it up. The same for the Gar. Like the recipe doesn't tell you how much it just tells you mine's off. So you take out the measuring cup. So you measure it in equal amounts? Yeah. You call them mounts and there's a pestle and then after that, okay. It says it canoe hounded well together. Okay. We really pounded and pounded. Freya did lots and lots of time with a mortar and pestle. Muscles built up from wielding a sword for pounding the ingredients, starting to be more of a mush third ingredient. The next one was definitely something you wouldn't have knocking around in your kitchen and fe, rs. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          18:35          Lung Bay. I am Fairleigh school ox girl, bovine bio from a, from a cow's gallbladder. What do you have to kill the cow and then go reach it. It's actually a very standard ingredient in microbiology labs. Ox Bile today in 2015 you can but should not just buy it on the Internet. Here we go, here we go. And so you take the ox bile added to the onion and garlic and then the fourth ingredient they name a win wine and wine, red wine, white wine like Whoa, why are we talking about, this is the thing. So we had quite a discussion about what type of wine should we use and we don't know really, did they have red wine that they have white wine? What was the alcohol content? But I did a bit of a bit of detective work and you figured out that the monastery where this Leech book was written, well they, she figured out where their vineyard was just down the road.

Speaker 2:          19:18          This is modern organic vineyard. So they used that wine. Can we kill Dave Yolie and [inaudible] I just want to point out how difficult it is to find English line. We had to use Italian, but it mainly with sue [inaudible] on artifact. Once you get all that stuff together, you're under the final ingredient, the fifth ingredient. It was actually that you're specifically told that you have to mix these ingredients together in a brass or a bronze pot. Um, I don't have one. Um, so we had to sort of add pieces of, you know, of copper that would've been available to people at the time. So they had to do some research, but they figured out that the copper of today that is most like the copper of a millennium ago was actually taught trench brass, which is what's used to standard in plumbing fittings. Pennies in there. We actually use penny's worth, couldn't show it looks and smells like quite a nice, quite a nice summer suit. It looks awful. Oh, that's so gross. Clearly we botched this whole thing not to stand the neonics on them, RF fatter. And uh, finally we're going to cover it. Okay. We're covering it. The directions say we have to let the whole thing sit for awhile. That has to be stored for nine days and nights.

Speaker 3:          20:32          Okay. That's it. One day goes by, two days, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, nine days later.

Speaker 2:          20:43          All right, here we go. You Ready? All. Alright, here we go. And nipped on them. Our Arvato outer ring through Cla. Then you have to strain it through a cloth. The liquid that comes off, you apply to the person's eye or the liquid and [inaudible] say bets. Lunch. Now, clearly we didn't have any staff to try this out on, but Freya in her lab, she made these mock wounds with these little plugs of, of, of Collagen, so it's a bit like Jelly. Basically it's like a, like a goopy substance made to be kind of like a flesh wound and we infect these wounds with bacteria, with the staff. Then they put this thousand year old recipe that had been standing there for nine days. They put it on the bacteria that was in the fake wound. We'd obviously where we didn't think this was going to work. Nope. We thought, you know, we'll given the ingredients, we might see some small killing effect on the bacteria, but it won't be anything to write home about. They thought maybe you'd killed 10% 20% of the bacteria. But then when they came back the next day, it was a staff massacre. It went on a rampage and went on a staff rampage. It was killing, you know, 99.99999% of these bacterial cells. Yeah. First we thought we made some sort of mistake and this was some kind of fluke, you know, we'd, we'd accidentally mixed up our plates or mislabeled something. So

Speaker 6:          22:11          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          22:11          we run the entire experiment again. They grab ingredients, Mash them up, put them on some bacteria and it happens again. Just absolutely wiped out the bacteria and held them dead. And he tried a third time and a fourth and fifth and it works every time. And this is this, this is just something you, you really don't see in your career. Some test. And eventually they escalated from just regular staff to, to Murcia

Speaker 2:          22:37          to the methicillin-resistant stuff. And this is one of the bad ones. Super Bug, new government data estimate that about 2000 people are dying of community-based Marissa every year. This one is very dangerous. It's so Christina and Freya, they sent some of bald brew to one of their collaborators in the states. Oh, collaborator, Kendra Rimbaud in Lubbock in Texas. Kendra took this stuff, put it on some Murcia bacteria, and then a week later sent free and Christina and email. And I think it was actually a three word response. I thought. I think she just simply said, what the fuck, what the ball's best medicine had just wreaked havoc on the Mercer. It killed 90% of them. This is beyond their wildest dreams now free. And Christina made very clear that this is not yet a miracle drug. I mean, it's not even been tested in humans. So absolutely do not do this at home.

Speaker 2:          23:35          They don't even know if this is safe. It might be the, if you don't do it in exactly the way we did, nasty fungus could grow in it, give you a worse infection. So, uh, we should not have done this, this, Masonite, we dumped ours down the drain. But the thing about this whole story that is so intriguing and so cool to me is this time travel thing, which is so strange. Like it's like the idea that something a thousand years ago, uh, like a bullet forge a thousand years ago, we could, we could use it now and then it could work that, that the time travel dimension of that is so weird to me.

Speaker 2:          24:25          It kind of makes you think differently about, I don't know, progress. So without further ado, Dr. Christina Lee and Dr Fred Harrison, and they're going to talk to us about some ancient biotechs. For example, just a few weeks ago, uh, Freya and Christina got up in front of the Royal Society of chemists. Thank you very much. And it is an absolute pleasure to be here. Large Hotel conference room a hundred or so people up free actually, uh, got up on stage dressed as a nun. Okay. So this is one interpretation of water and Anglo Saxon scientist may have look likes and they presented the results. Next ingredient is particularly the cooking demo. And then at some point Christina said something really interesting. She was like, okay, sure we want to write this off because it has demons and dragons and elves in it, but are we sure that we know what they meant by those words?

Speaker 2:          25:23          Like for example, I'll run the days which asks, you sing for Avid Marias and we would say, oh, that's so superstitious. This is all in their heads. But there again, we should also remember this is a period when people do not have watchers. You do not have your nurse, you know, so that's got the watch. Everybody knows the album. Maria, everybody knows the length of an album, Maria, so maybe it's, maybe it's take this medicine and wait 20 minutes and I know how to standardize 20 minutes, which is three of them. Maria's four other Maria's may even, that's fast. It may appear one way and it's in fact could be a totally different way. It suggests that the, in order to time travel, you have to somehow, God, it's like we don't even have the language people to understand what they were doing. There's the effective, there's a phrase that the past is a foreign country

Speaker 7:          26:14          like boys. We need to learn the language of the doctors of that time. We need to kind of be a little bit less, um, dismissive and learn a little bit more, you know, stuff from them. I learned a bit of humility this way. Here's the reason why this is

Speaker 2:          26:32          whole confusing to me. So 1100 years is a crazy long time for humans and for bacteria. That's like an exponentially crazy long time. So how is it that something that this man bald was doing to these bacteria then like, like it's not even the same bacteria? How could that even work? That's a, that's an awesome question. So, so one thing we've got to think about is, well, why did these medicines drop out of use? And maybe it's because when the week used the bacteria of old resistance, but now a thousand years later when these medicines have not been used, you'd expect that resistance to be lost. This is something that Marin Mckenna mentioned to Zorn and I

Speaker 8:          27:21          that sometimes when you take a drug out of circulation, sometimes resistance will decline. That doesn't always work, but sometimes the resistance does decline. So if we had been using this compound through the ensuing thousand years, then maybe it wouldn't work. So this is an interesting discovery there. Like what worked once and then was resisted. You give it a rest, it can work again and it will be resisted and you put it to rest and if you had enough different, if you could go to different places and the different paths, did you go to China where they now got all these people studying Chinese cures and Arab cures? You could come up with a, with a rich historical cocktail of armamentarium that will work if you bring them in, take them out, bring them in, take them out and the whole world, the whole world of the past then becomes the food of your future sort of.

Speaker 9:          28:19          So it's also a positive. Like now I have a suddenly an image that it's possible that that, this is Soren wheeler by the way, in conversation with Mary Mckenna Latif that a thousand years ago these folks went through what we went through with penicillin and that they, this guy wrote something in the book and it's actually called the best medicine. He probably got on the cover of whatever their version of time was, their Nobel prize and everybody celebrated and then years later sties were coming back and the garlic wine didn't work anymore and they stopped using it and it got put away and then here we are and we discover it and it's been put away long enough that like then, then now I'm thinking about future some future. It's civilization digs up and old medical textbook that was in some dusty whatever and discovers penicillin

Speaker 10:         29:26          producer, lots of Nasser with hope and Soren Wheeler and a produced by Matthew Kielty. Special thanks to Sarah too. Steve Diggle, Andrew, Alexandra rider, and Justin Parker, who came down from Yale to be our old English readers, to Jean Moreau from the Gotham early music scene at the Marcia young on the medieval harp column, Monroe of Tadcaster, and on the rest of the barren eve iron buck. Not totally sure what that is, but I know they helped us out and I guess we should help ourselves out of the door quickly through the window. I'm Chad, I'm Robert Krulwich. Thanks for listening.
