00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.870
Please can I have some advice for dealing with poor leaders at work they have

2
00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:05.890
little respect for,

3
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.000
and the question as a subordinate,

4
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.630
how do you handle a leader who leads from a place of ego

5
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.380
<v 1>and isn't transparent with information?
Yeah,</v>

6
00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:24.240
so these were a couple of questions actually that I got and I just kind of

7
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:28.200
bunched them together because my answer's going to be very similar for each of

8
00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:28.351
them.

9
00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:32.950
And it's actually very similar to a situation that I'm dealing with right now.

10
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.560
The guy that I'm helping out.
And I wrote,
um,

11
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.020
something to him recently.

12
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.860
And what happened was he's in a situation where a leader had come in that didn't

13
00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:49.560
have the knowledge inside the industry they were working in.

14
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.510
So you came from another industry,

15
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.110
got put into a leadership position and that guy,

16
00:00:55.111 --> 00:00:59.850
that new leader was resisting change and not giving support to the new

17
00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:02.790
procedures that the guy who was coaching was trying to implement.

18
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.690
So he was kind of,
you know,

19
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.580
at a loss for what to do.

20
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.700
You know you've got this new manager that's coming in that's inexperienced and

21
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.310
Eva and the Guy I'm coaching obviously doesn't respect him because he doesn't

22
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.410
have a lot of knowledge in this industry.
And so here's the advice I gave him.

23
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:23.783
I said,

24
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.290
you need to set this up to make the new manager look good.

25
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.250
Make some adjustments to the words you are choosing,

26
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.370
the tack you are taking and the focus you are using to ensure that your changes

27
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.470
make him look good,
not bad.

28
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.500
Now let's just so counterintuitive for people.

29
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.590
It's so counterintuitive cause they get to a person that's above them and the

30
00:01:46.591 --> 00:01:48.300
chain of command that doesn't know as much as them,

31
00:01:48.301 --> 00:01:50.190
that's not as smart as them and what do they want to do?

32
00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:51.270
They want to bring them down.

33
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.110
They want to prove to everybody that they're better.
I'm better than that guy.

34
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.410
They'd either war on that guy.
I deserve that guy's job.

35
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.190
That's what everybody's instinct is to do and it's wrong.

36
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.893
It's wrong.

37
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.980
Somehow let the ideas come from him or make him the approver or the driver of

38
00:02:11.941 --> 00:02:15.960
some of the s aspects that he can handle.
So I'm actually saying,

39
00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:18.960
go out of your way to make this easier for this guy.

40
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.280
Make him look good.
Give him credit.

41
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.900
It's your ego that wants to pull him down.
Put your ego in check,

42
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.690
help him without being condescending or acting like you know more than him.

43
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.620
He shouldn't even know you are helping him.
Have you ever been,

44
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.130
this is so fun to do is when,
you know,

45
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.980
Echo doesn't know this section of the equipment.

46
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.350
So I don't say,
Hey,
since you don't know this,
um,

47
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.330
all teach it to you,
right?
This condescending tone of,
you know,

48
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.180
but instead of like,
hey,
have you ever seen the way this one works?

49
00:02:57.181 --> 00:02:59.070
I know your eye.
Have you ever seen this specific equipment?

50
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.780
Because the way it works,
it's a little bit different than,

51
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.270
than some of the other ones is you got to do this,
this,
and this.

52
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.500
And you can sit back and you can accept that knowledge without feeling like you

53
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:10.390
don't know it.
Right?
So I'm teaching you,

54
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:12.520
but I'm doing it in a clandestine manner.

55
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.220
And that's what we're trying to do because we're trying to build,

56
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.380
we're trying to do,
we're trying to build a relationship here.

57
00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:20.380
That's what we're trying to do.
We're trying to build a relationship.
And if I go,

58
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.190
since you don't know how to use this,
I'll show you now what does that do?

59
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.510
Puts you on the defensive,
makes you,
um,
uh,

60
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.410
considered me to be a threat.
Now I'm threatening and that's not good.

61
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
He should even know you are helping him respect what he does and show him that

62
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:42.460
you respect it.
So,
hey,
you know,
I know this is,

63
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:44.890
you probably haven't been down in the weeds on this type of gear in a while,

64
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:47.560
but hey,
this is the way,
you know what I'm saying?
Like you actually,

65
00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:52.040
I actually respect the fact that you're up top in charge and I'm just a front

66
00:03:52.041 --> 00:03:55.720
line guy.
But here's how you do this.
If you ever had to,
you know what I mean?

67
00:03:55.721 --> 00:04:00.721
Just downplay what he doesn't know and subtly help him to learn it.

68
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.170
Right.
You know,
you probably wouldn't ever have to do this,
this,

69
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.890
this new equipment over here.
I mean,
I know was a little bit below your level.

70
00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:11.320
Here's how it works.
If you ever needed it,
boom.
You know what I mean?

71
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.250
Not like you don't know how to do this right?
I do.
You know,

72
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.900
you don't want an adversarial relationship with this new leader.

73
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.530
You want him to support and help you.
He will do that.

74
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.300
If you are making him look good.
This is so easy,
man.

75
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.250
This is so easy and so hard because everybody's ego will get in the way.

76
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.530
Everybody's Eagle will get in the way.

77
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.160
Extreme ownership often requires covert and clandestine indirect actions.

78
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.650
So all these things that I'm talking about helping the guy without him knowing,

79
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.410
um,
uh,

80
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.080
letting him take credit for ideas without him knowing

81
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.870
all these little aspects,
they're indirect actions.

82
00:05:01.871 --> 00:05:05.200
They're not going head to head.
It's like Jujitsu.
It's Jujitsu all the time.

83
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.820
Everything's Jujitsu.
You don't want to,
if you know,
I'm going to do an arm bar,

84
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.800
I am not going to get the arm bar right.
You're going to defend that.

85
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.110
So I have to go take indirect actions and set things up and take my time and be

86
00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:24.070
clandestine and covert.
This is chess,
not checkers.

87
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.240
This is where you need to master your ability to influence,

88
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.290
which as we talked about a couple podcasts ago,
is actually manipulation.

89
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.520
I'm manipulating this guy to think that he's got something over me.

90
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.580
I'm inflating his ego while I'm putting my ego in check.

91
00:05:39.581 --> 00:05:43.510
I'm making him feel like he's even better and that makes him feel good.

92
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:48.220
It makes him want to support me because I make him look good.
This is,

93
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.110
this is just basic.
If you do this wrong,

94
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.930
the new manager will resist you at every turn.

95
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.240
If you do this right,
he will be your biggest supporter.

96
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.460
Now,
this is the same thing with leaders that you quote unquote don't respect.

97
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.290
First of all,
there should be something that you respect about everybody.

98
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.010
Everybody that you meet,
you should have some kind of respect for them.

99
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.360
And by the way,
if you don't respect someone,
what is making you not respect them?

100
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.130
Mm.
It's your ego.

101
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.940
It's your ego that makes you not respect people because you think,
oh,

102
00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:27.920
I'm better than them.
I should have their job.

103
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.460
They don't know what they're talking about.
And I do.
That's all ego,
right?

104
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.780
So put your ego in check and just be like,
okay,
this person's above me.

105
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.610
They seem really inexperienced,
but what can I learn from them?

106
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.440
How did they get there?
If they're so dumb and bad at this job,

107
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.250
how come they outrank me?
Let me learn something from them.

108
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.610
Let me learn something from them.

109
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:55.510
Put your ego in check and this is the key point and anytime I talk about quote

110
00:06:57.231 --> 00:07:01.850
unquote leading up the chain of command,
I will talk about this,

111
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:05.990
that no matter what boss I work for and I work for every different kind of boss,

112
00:07:05.991 --> 00:07:10.250
Egomaniac,
psychopaths,
wonderful guys,
intelligent guys,
brilliant guys,

113
00:07:10.251 --> 00:07:15.251
tacticians I worked for every different kind of boss and I always had the same

114
00:07:15.621 --> 00:07:17.600
relationship with all of them.

115
00:07:17.601 --> 00:07:20.960
That was my job was to build that relationship and that was a relationship of

116
00:07:20.961 --> 00:07:23.120
high trust.
So they trusted me.

117
00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:25.460
They're going to stay out of my way and let me do what I wanted,

118
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.390
and that's how you win.
Which by the way,
when you win,

119
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:33.770
they should never know you when they shouldn't even know that there was a

120
00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:37.820
competition happening and that way you can do what you want.

121
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.870
And so that is how you deal with people above you and the chain of command that

122
00:07:41.871 --> 00:07:44.930
you have little respect for or that lead from a place of ego.

123
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:49.580
You build a relationship with them.
You don't go head to head with them.

124
00:07:49.581 --> 00:07:53.510
You're not gonna win and going head to head with your boss.
They're your boss.

125
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.380
They have rank on you.
If they're an EGOMANIAC,
they're going to use that rank.

126
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.400
If there's someone that you don't respect,

127
00:08:01.401 --> 00:08:02.870
you got to build a relationship with them.

128
00:08:02.871 --> 00:08:04.940
If there's someone that's an Egomaniac,
you got to build really,

129
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.500
regardless of the situation,
the solution is the same.

130
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:13.730
Build the relationship of trust,
help them build them up,

131
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:18.560
take a backseat,
let them get credit.
It's all those things,
and once you do that,

132
00:08:18.561 --> 00:08:19.394
you're going to have,

133
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:22.940
you're going to have much better results than if you try and bang heads with

134
00:08:22.941 --> 00:08:27.770
them,
overcome them,
defeat them,
have an antagonistic relationship with them.

135
00:08:27.771 --> 00:08:29.210
It's never going to work.

136
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.990
So play the game.
