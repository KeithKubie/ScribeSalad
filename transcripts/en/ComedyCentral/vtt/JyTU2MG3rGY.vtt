00:00:01.435 --> 00:00:03.070
- WELCOME BACK
TO CAN I FINISH?

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:05.439
THINGS GOT PRETTY OUT OF CONTROL
ON THAT LAST ROUND.

00:00:05.506 --> 00:00:07.140
THAT CANNOT HAPPEN
AGAIN.

00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:09.276
TODAY, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
THE PROLIFERATION

00:00:09.343 --> 00:00:11.044
OF TALKING HEADS
ON THE NEWS.

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:13.547
IS ALL THIS SQUAWK
ADDING UP TO SQUAT?

00:00:13.614 --> 00:00:16.216
LET'S TAKE IT TO THE PEOPLE
IN THE TINY BOXES.

00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:18.652
[shouting] LUKE BENNETT,
ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT?

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:21.388
- IT'S SIMPLY A GAME
OF MATHEMATICS.

00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:22.689
IF YOU LOOK AT
THE SIMPLE FACT...

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:24.691
- EXCUSE ME.
- OF WHO IS CONTROL...

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:26.326
- EXCUSE ME! EXCUSE ME!
- OF THE MEDIA,

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:28.195
THE CORPORATE--EXCUSE ME.
- MAY I--CAN I TALK?

00:00:28.262 --> 00:00:30.030
- LET ME FINISH.
- LET'S TAKE THIS ONE

00:00:30.097 --> 00:00:31.532
OUT TO SEA.
CAPTAIN JACK!

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:33.767
- WHEN A BOAT SINKS,
EVERYONE BLAMES THE CAPTAIN,

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:35.135
LIKE ON THE TITANIC.

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:36.170
- EXCUSE ME!
- IT'S NOT ALWAYS YOUR FAULT!

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:37.171
- MAY I FINISH PLEASE?
- YES.

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:38.539
YOU CAN FINISH, MARK!

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:39.740
- IT'S GIVE AND TAKE.
- AND STUCK AT SEA

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:40.774
FOR FIVE MONTHS.
- I'VE HEARD WHAT YOU--

00:00:40.841 --> 00:00:42.342
- LET ME FINISH!
- RIGHT, RIGHT.

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:44.244
BUT WHAT IS JOHN Q. PUBLIC
SUPPOSED TO THINK ABOUT THIS?

00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:46.780
GO AHEAD, MEEK WOMAN.
- THANKS, JIM.

00:00:46.847 --> 00:00:49.316
UH, WHAT I WAS TRYING
TO SAY BEFORE, UH, WAS--

00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:51.218
- WHO CARES WHAT THIS DOG WOMAN
HAS TO SAY?

00:00:51.285 --> 00:00:52.819
- EXCUSE ME!
MAY I FINISH? PLEASE?

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:54.588
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK, MARK
CAN'T TAKE YES FOR AN ANSWER.

00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:55.856
[screaming]
MEEK WOMAN, I WANT TO HEAR

00:00:55.923 --> 00:00:57.324
WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY!
- THANKS, JIM.

00:00:57.391 --> 00:00:58.592
WHAT I WAS TRYING
TO SAY BEFORE IS THAT--

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.460
- TIME'S UP.
FLIP THE BOXES.

00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:03.063
- DOG--
- THANK YOU, JIM. FINALLY!

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:04.932

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:07.067
- PENALTY BOX.
THE METS ARE OFF-LIMITS.

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.235
CUT HIS MIC.

00:01:08.302 --> 00:01:11.205
WE GOT A TWEET HERE
FROM @AKABOBBYB.

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:13.707
HE SAYS, "NO DISRESPECT,
BECAUSE I RESPECT YOU,

00:01:13.774 --> 00:01:14.808
BUT CAN I FINISH?"

00:01:14.875 --> 00:01:16.376
WELL,
WHAT ABOUT THAT?

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:17.978
SHOUTMAN, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
AND PLEASE DON'T SHOUT.

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:20.180

00:01:22.316 --> 00:01:23.817
- DR. ARMOND,

00:01:23.884 --> 00:01:25.519

00:01:25.586 --> 00:01:26.753
I HAVE A RIGHT TO SP--

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.988
- OKAY, TIME

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:29.456
MEEK WOMAN, SPEAK!

00:01:29.523 --> 00:01:31.091
- EXCUSE ME, CAN I FINISH?

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:33.393

00:01:43.704 --> 00:01:46.106
- EXCUSE ME, WHY IS THIS GUY

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:47.274

00:01:47.341 --> 00:01:48.675

FORGET IT!
THERE'S NO POINT IN IT!

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.596
SOMEBODY'S JOB'S GOTTA BE
TO FIGURE OUT WHO TALKS WHEN!

00:02:09.663 --> 00:02:11.498
I CAN'T DO IT
'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW!
