the person doing it and I think by

the person doing it and I think by
 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.840
the person doing it and I think by
sharing the stories of how it feels to

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850
sharing the stories of how it feels to
 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.600
sharing the stories of how it feels to
make those mistakes and how it feels to

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610
make those mistakes and how it feels to
 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.109
make those mistakes and how it feels to
to have those successes and and what

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119
to have those successes and and what
 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.969
to have those successes and and what
drives you when you fail and what drives

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979
drives you when you fail and what drives
 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.880
drives you when you fail and what drives
you when you work and there's no

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890
you when you work and there's no
 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.770
you when you work and there's no
progress and and how it is juggling all

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780
progress and and how it is juggling all
 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.780
progress and and how it is juggling all
the other pieces of life while you do

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790

science I

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560
science I
 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.010
science I
think that gives the kind of picture

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020
think that gives the kind of picture
 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.900
think that gives the kind of picture
that people can realistically look at

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910
that people can realistically look at
 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.110
that people can realistically look at
and say I could do that or I could do

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120
and say I could do that or I could do
 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.449
and say I could do that or I could do
that but I wouldn't want to or I want to

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459
that but I wouldn't want to or I want to
 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.479
that but I wouldn't want to or I want to
do that and maybe I could do it so I

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489
do that and maybe I could do it so I
 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.410
do that and maybe I could do it so I
think that's the story that were obliged

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420
think that's the story that were obliged
 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.059
think that's the story that were obliged
to tell if we really believe that we

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069
to tell if we really believe that we
 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.460
to tell if we really believe that we
need more people to embrace science and

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470
need more people to embrace science and
 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.770
need more people to embrace science and
devote their lives to it I think it's

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780
devote their lives to it I think it's
 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.699
devote their lives to it I think it's
very common that scientists or technical

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709
very common that scientists or technical
 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.670
very common that scientists or technical
people have an artistic side sometimes

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680
people have an artistic side sometimes
 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.070
people have an artistic side sometimes
they are very accomplished musicians

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080
they are very accomplished musicians
 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.400
they are very accomplished musicians
sometimes they have very fine

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410
sometimes they have very fine
 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.670
sometimes they have very fine
tastes according to art or design and

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680
tastes according to art or design and
 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.440
tastes according to art or design and
often you know they spent a big chunk of

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450
often you know they spent a big chunk of
 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.360
often you know they spent a big chunk of
their childhood or they're growing up

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370
their childhood or they're growing up
 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.820
their childhood or they're growing up
years trying to get very good at those

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830
years trying to get very good at those
 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.280
years trying to get very good at those
activities and I would encourage people

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290
activities and I would encourage people
 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.890
activities and I would encourage people
to think of that as a latent skill maybe

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900
to think of that as a latent skill maybe
 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.470
to think of that as a latent skill maybe
that isn't called into use every day at

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480
that isn't called into use every day at
 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.449
that isn't called into use every day at
your job but maybe it should be maybe we

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459
your job but maybe it should be maybe we
 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.410
your job but maybe it should be maybe we
are narrowing ourselves I only say that

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420
are narrowing ourselves I only say that
 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.420
are narrowing ourselves I only say that
because I love stories I love to read

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430
because I love stories I love to read
 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.890
because I love stories I love to read
stories and I don't get to talk about my

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900
stories and I don't get to talk about my
 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.030
stories and I don't get to talk about my
favorite novels very often in my job and

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040
favorite novels very often in my job and
 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.610
favorite novels very often in my job and
then I wrote a science book where I

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620
then I wrote a science book where I
 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.559
then I wrote a science book where I
actually talked very specifically about

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569
actually talked very specifically about
 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.390
actually talked very specifically about
my favorite novels and different lines

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400
my favorite novels and different lines
 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.190
my favorite novels and different lines
from them that occur to me while I'm

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200
from them that occur to me while I'm
 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.020
from them that occur to me while I'm
doing science and how doing science

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030
doing science and how doing science
 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.390
doing science and how doing science
actually helped me figure out what these

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400
actually helped me figure out what these
 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.460
actually helped me figure out what these
very ambiguous quotes finally mean and I

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470
very ambiguous quotes finally mean and I
 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.710
very ambiguous quotes finally mean and I
sort of put those two things together

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720
sort of put those two things together
 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.039
sort of put those two things together
and I've gotten a very satisfying

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049
and I've gotten a very satisfying
 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.009
and I've gotten a very satisfying
response that overlapping those

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019
response that overlapping those
 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:04.720
response that overlapping those
interests which I always had has

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730
interests which I always had has
 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.970
interests which I always had has
resulted in something new and special

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980
resulted in something new and special
 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.580
resulted in something new and special
and interesting and I can't help but

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590
and interesting and I can't help but
 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.090
and interesting and I can't help but
think of all the artistic talent that

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100
think of all the artistic talent that
 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.890
think of all the artistic talent that
exists in all the scientists and

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900
exists in all the scientists and
 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.680
exists in all the scientists and
technical people that I know that is got

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690
technical people that I know that is got
 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.469
technical people that I know that is got
to be some kind of untapped resource

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479
to be some kind of untapped resource
 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.570
to be some kind of untapped resource
that could enrich everything they're

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580
that could enrich everything they're
 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.470
that could enrich everything they're
doing and I just want to incur

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480
doing and I just want to incur
 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.660
doing and I just want to incur
people to go back to that part of

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670
people to go back to that part of
 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.180
people to go back to that part of
themselves and and take a chance on

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190
themselves and and take a chance on
 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.940
themselves and and take a chance on
expressing it and and I don't know what

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950
expressing it and and I don't know what
 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.910
expressing it and and I don't know what
the hybridization is for you but I'm

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920
the hybridization is for you but I'm
 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.560
the hybridization is for you but I'm
pretty confident that it's worth

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570
