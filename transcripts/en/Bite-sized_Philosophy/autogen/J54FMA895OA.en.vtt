00:00:00.875 --> 00:00:03.425
 Now I want to tell you a story 

00:00:03.425 --> 00:00:06.695
 It is written for 4 year olds, but I would like to see it 

00:00:06.695 --> 00:00:09.705
 from a different perspective 

00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:12.725
 and see if you can imagine exactly what it really counts 

00:00:18.515 --> 00:00:20.395
 Dragons do not exist 

00:00:21.435 --> 00:00:23.765
 We all know that. One dragon is 

00:00:23.765 --> 00:00:26.755
 a thought-based being. reptilian 

00:00:26.755 --> 00:00:28.955
 horrible, immortal 

00:00:29.105 --> 00:00:30.375
 breathe fire 

00:00:30.945 --> 00:00:32.335
 collects gold 

00:00:32.985 --> 00:00:36.035
 It's a strange collection of features 

00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:39.355
 Why in the world should something terrible and ancient 

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:41.205
 Have a treasure 

00:00:48.065 --> 00:00:50.935
 Billy Bixby was surprised when he woke up 

00:00:50.935 --> 00:00:53.575
 one morning and discovered a dragon in his room 

00:00:53.625 --> 00:00:55.845
 It was a little dragon the size of a kitten 

00:00:57.065 --> 00:00:59.985
 The dragon was happy with his tail 

00:01:00.215 --> 00:01:01.815
 When Billy patted it upside down 

00:01:05.645 --> 00:01:08.025
 In Chinese mythology 

00:01:08.705 --> 00:01:10.565
 Is the dragon a positive figure 

00:01:10.995 --> 00:01:13.335
 In European mythology 

00:01:13.335 --> 00:01:16.585
 is a draw something you confront in battle and 

00:01:16.585 --> 00:01:19.685
 destroy. Or something you confront in battle 

00:01:19.685 --> 00:01:23.185
 and build something out of the remains of the dragon 

00:01:24.965 --> 00:01:27.155
 Billy went down to tell his mother 

00:01:28.745 --> 00:01:31.655
 "Dragons do not exist," Billy's mother said 

00:01:31.655 --> 00:01:33.315
 and she sounded like she meant it 

00:01:34.855 --> 00:01:37.405
 My daughter once had a nightmare 

00:01:37.445 --> 00:01:38.715
 She was about 4 years old 

00:01:39.185 --> 00:01:42.165
 It was at the time when she began to notice graffiti and 

00:01:42.165 --> 00:01:45.105
 and waste on the street, which annoyed her 

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:47.765
 She did not understand the graffiti's motivation 

00:01:47.765 --> 00:01:50.235
 and she did not like the waste 

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:52.885
 There was a mess in the world 

00:01:52.885 --> 00:01:55.975
 The reason she was sensitive to it as a child 

00:01:55.975 --> 00:01:57.405
 was that children are very dependent on order 

00:01:57.405 --> 00:02:00.015
 And the reason is 

00:02:00.015 --> 00:02:03.115
 that their level of competence is quite low 

00:02:03.115 --> 00:02:06.205
 so they do not like things being messed with. So, for example 

00:02:06.205 --> 00:02:09.215
 small children may not like if you play with them and 

00:02:09.215 --> 00:02:12.255
 and changes the rules of the doctor. They may not like it at all 

00:02:12.255 --> 00:02:15.115
 They think it is immoral 

00:02:15.115 --> 00:02:18.195
 to shake around with the game rules 

00:02:18.195 --> 00:02:21.165
 ... She came into our bedroom 

00:02:21.165 --> 00:02:23.945
 and said "dad i had a nightmare" 

00:02:23.945 --> 00:02:26.995
 Nightmares do not exist, like dragons. Dreams are 

00:02:26.995 --> 00:02:29.995
 not real. Which makes one wonder why 

00:02:29.995 --> 00:02:33.245
 why we saw dreams 6-8 hours every night 

00:02:33.245 --> 00:02:36.245
 and why they exist 

00:02:36.245 --> 00:02:39.115
 in all animals right down to the amphibians 

00:02:40.485 --> 00:02:43.455
 she said "I dreamed there was a clean brook" 

00:02:43.545 --> 00:02:46.635
 "but in the brook there was a lot of waste and that made me scared" 

00:02:46.635 --> 00:02:49.415
 "so i woke up" 

00:02:50.335 --> 00:02:53.035
 I said "close your eyes and imagine the brook" 

00:02:53.035 --> 00:02:56.175
 "it's full of waste. What do you want to do about it?" 

00:02:56.175 --> 00:02:59.105
 She said "I have to take the waste out of the creek" 

00:02:59.285 --> 00:03:01.835
 I said "ok, imagine you clean the cymbal" 

00:03:03.355 --> 00:03:06.575
 She settled down and went in to sleep 

00:03:06.575 --> 00:03:09.555
 Why? FOr Dreams focuses on threats. We know that 

00:03:09.555 --> 00:03:12.535
 They present you with threats you have not been able to do something about 

00:03:12.725 --> 00:03:15.545
 There is a part of the brain that follows threats 

00:03:15.545 --> 00:03:18.375
 And that part isn't really that clever 

00:03:18.375 --> 00:03:21.285
 it just says "see here is a problem" 

00:03:21.285 --> 00:03:24.455
 And waiting for the rest of the brain to come up with a solution 

00:03:26.075 --> 00:03:29.125
 and if there is no solution, the problem is only produced again and again and again 

00:03:32.105 --> 00:03:35.105
 So people who, for example, have PTSD 

00:03:35.105 --> 00:03:37.575
 It has been traumatized by the contact with something unexpected 

00:03:37.575 --> 00:03:40.185
 Dreaming of the same tragedy for an eternity 

00:03:40.185 --> 00:03:43.335
 Until they find a solution 

00:03:43.745 --> 00:03:46.705
 and they find a solution by seeing it in the face and living it 

00:03:46.705 --> 00:03:49.445
 repeatedly. Volunteer. 

00:03:49.445 --> 00:03:52.445
 So from that story you might think 

00:03:52.445 --> 00:03:55.185
 that by suggesting to his 4 year old 

00:03:55.185 --> 00:03:58.205
 that her dreams are not real 

00:03:58.205 --> 00:04:01.255
 And what they represent is not genuine because you cannot touch them 

00:04:01.255 --> 00:04:04.625
 Maybe not the best solution to the problem 

00:04:06.465 --> 00:04:09.635
 Billy has got the long end from the start 

00:04:09.635 --> 00:04:12.705
 The dragon whispered when Billy patted it upside down 

00:04:14.365 --> 00:04:17.405
 Billy took down to tell his mother about it. "dragons do not exist" 

00:04:17.405 --> 00:04:20.095
 Said Billy's mother 

00:04:20.095 --> 00:04:21.355
 and she sounded like she meant it 

00:04:23.595 --> 00:04:26.355
 So there's a dragon in this house 

00:04:26.355 --> 00:04:28.235
 Then you might think 

00:04:28.235 --> 00:04:31.275
 How often have you gone into a house with a dragon? 

00:04:31.335 --> 00:04:34.015
 My guess is if you don't take this 

00:04:34.015 --> 00:04:36.825
 history literally and permits itself 

00:04:36.825 --> 00:04:39.505
 to think metaphorically 

00:04:39.505 --> 00:04:42.215
 you have been in dozens of houses with lots of dragons 

00:04:45.045 --> 00:04:48.125
 who have all been ignored with great effort by those who lived there 

00:04:50.085 --> 00:04:52.885
 Billy went up to his room and put on clothes 

00:04:52.885 --> 00:04:55.885
 The dragon came close to Billy in a friendly manner 

00:04:55.885 --> 00:04:58.345
 and it wailed, but Billy did not pat it 

00:04:58.345 --> 00:05:00.825
 For if something does not exist, it is stupid to pat it up 

00:05:03.915 --> 00:05:06.845
 Billy washed himself and went down to the breakfast table 

00:05:06.845 --> 00:05:09.865
 The dragon went along and was bigger now, like a dog 

00:05:15.165 --> 00:05:17.545
 Billy sat down at the table 

00:05:17.925 --> 00:05:20.165
 The dragon sat on the table 

00:05:20.165 --> 00:05:22.095
 That was not allowed 

00:05:22.095 --> 00:05:25.175
 But Billy's mother couldn't do anything 

00:05:25.175 --> 00:05:27.085
 for she had all told that dragons did not exist 

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:31.855
 and if something does not exist, one cannot say that it must not sit on the table 

00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:42.165
 Sometimes I visit friends 

00:05:42.165 --> 00:05:45.055
 for dinner. And the little children are not sitting at the table 

00:05:45.055 --> 00:05:47.875
 They sit on the table or run around the table 

00:05:47.875 --> 00:05:50.595
 or pull things down from the table 

00:05:50.595 --> 00:05:52.875
 or pull things off the shelves 

00:05:52.875 --> 00:05:55.645
 the whole house saw the parents 

00:05:55.645 --> 00:05:58.475
 are so busy that they can't talk together 

00:06:01.245 --> 00:06:03.915
 Under the conditions, one must consider 

00:06:03.915 --> 00:06:06.415
 whether it is a child or a dragon 

00:06:06.415 --> 00:06:09.675
 and you can also consider about the dragon 

00:06:11.675 --> 00:06:13.865
 Is great and unruly 

00:06:13.865 --> 00:06:16.805
 because the parents will not admit it exists 

00:06:21.925 --> 00:06:24.385
 Mom made pancakes for Billy 

00:06:26.045 --> 00:06:28.585
 But devour them all. Mother made more 

00:06:28.585 --> 00:06:31.385
 But it also devoured them. Mother continued 

00:06:31.385 --> 00:06:34.245
 until there was no more dough. Billy only got one 

00:06:34.245 --> 00:06:36.715
 But he said it was exactly what he wanted 

00:06:42.095 --> 00:06:44.885
 One of my acquaintances in Boston 

00:06:44.885 --> 00:06:47.935
 took his son over to our house for baby sitting 

00:06:49.805 --> 00:06:52.145
 His babysitter had just been in an accident 

00:06:52.145 --> 00:06:55.185
 so he was sent from house to house by friends who could look after him 

00:06:55.185 --> 00:06:57.675
 His reputation was not very good. He was about 4 years old 

00:07:02.135 --> 00:07:04.645
 He came to our house in the morning 

00:07:07.595 --> 00:07:09.895
 She said he probably doesn't eat anything all day, but that's okay 

00:07:10.575 --> 00:07:12.575
 I thought "No" 

00:07:13.585 --> 00:07:16.455
 He is 4 years old if he does not eat all day 

00:07:18.105 --> 00:07:20.815
 It is not okay for if children do not eat 

00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:24.175
 If they do not eat and sleep, they are terrible 

00:07:24.175 --> 00:07:27.285
 It's not okay that he doesn't eat 

00:07:27.285 --> 00:07:29.895
 Perhaps there is a dragon associated with him? 

00:07:29.895 --> 00:07:32.905
 that prevents him from eating 

00:07:33.215 --> 00:07:36.245
 So I came home for dinner, my wife had the kids 

00:07:39.315 --> 00:07:42.345
 the 4-5 other children in the house 

00:07:42.345 --> 00:07:45.245
 played while he was standing in the corner 

00:07:45.245 --> 00:07:47.365
 completely isolated 

00:07:47.865 --> 00:07:50.965
 He looked upset. So I pricked him 

00:07:50.965 --> 00:07:53.975
 If you dot a child a little 

00:07:53.975 --> 00:07:56.965
 They do that, though 

00:07:56.965 --> 00:07:59.825
 sooner or later they bleed and smile 

00:07:59.825 --> 00:08:02.885
 not him here. He didn't want to play with me. Basta 

00:08:02.885 --> 00:08:04.905
 He had already learned 

00:08:05.715 --> 00:08:08.255
 that adults should be ignored 

00:08:08.255 --> 00:08:11.215
 or that adults were dangerous. He didn't want to let an adult 

00:08:11.215 --> 00:08:14.215
 into his world. So that was absolutely certain 

00:08:14.215 --> 00:08:17.545
 one dragon with the little boy, and the one eating his pancakes 

00:08:20.205 --> 00:08:22.965
 Billy went up to brush his teeth 

00:08:24.325 --> 00:08:27.285
 The suit that was bigger lay down to sleep in the hallway 

00:08:33.085 --> 00:08:36.115
 When Billy came down, the dragon had grown so big 

00:08:36.115 --> 00:08:38.665
 that it filled the whole time 

00:08:38.665 --> 00:08:41.355
 Billy had to go through the living room to get to his mother 

00:08:41.875 --> 00:08:44.315
 I didn't know that dragons are growing so fast 

00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:47.295
 "Dragons do not exist," said his mother determined 

00:08:50.545 --> 00:08:53.105
 The cleaning took all morning 

00:08:55.005 --> 00:08:57.185
 because the dragon was in the way 

00:08:57.185 --> 00:09:00.675
 so one had to climb out of windows to get from room to room 

00:09:02.355 --> 00:09:04.875
 When you have visited a home with a dragon 

00:09:04.875 --> 00:09:07.545
 hiding under the blanket 

00:09:07.545 --> 00:09:10.465
 and no one says anything about it, and you think 

00:09:10.465 --> 00:09:13.565
 How long does it take to do something quite simply 

00:09:15.135 --> 00:09:18.095
 In a house that is crowded 

00:09:18.095 --> 00:09:20.765
 with unresolved issues? Forever?! 

00:09:20.765 --> 00:09:23.215
 Doing something quite simply in such a house 

00:09:23.215 --> 00:09:26.215
 such as breakfast 

00:09:26.215 --> 00:09:29.695
 or preparing a meal is almost impossible. Why? 

00:09:30.225 --> 00:09:32.595
 Because something is going on 

00:09:32.595 --> 00:09:35.165
 in the house being ignored 

00:09:35.165 --> 00:09:37.765
 with great effort over a long period of time 

00:09:37.765 --> 00:09:39.935
 and that has therefore become enormous 

00:09:39.935 --> 00:09:42.225
 that it fills it all 

00:09:46.545 --> 00:09:48.835
 At midday, the dragon filled the whole house 

00:09:49.395 --> 00:09:51.885
 The head stuck out of the front door, the tail out of the back door 

00:09:51.885 --> 00:09:54.335
 and every room 

00:09:54.335 --> 00:09:56.225
 had some of the dragon in it 

00:10:03.815 --> 00:10:06.145
 When the dragon woke up, it was hungry 

00:10:06.695 --> 00:10:09.555
 a bread truck drove past 

00:10:09.555 --> 00:10:12.425
 fresh bread could not withstand the dragon 

00:10:12.425 --> 00:10:15.355
 it ran down the street after the car truck and the house followed 

00:10:15.355 --> 00:10:16.455
 like a snail house 

00:10:24.825 --> 00:10:27.115
 The postman was on his way 

00:10:27.115 --> 00:10:30.045
 by post when the house passed by 

00:10:31.185 --> 00:10:34.225
 He chased their house a few streets 

00:10:34.225 --> 00:10:36.245
 but couldn't catch it 

00:10:38.775 --> 00:10:41.485
 Then Mr. Bixby came home for breakfast 

00:10:41.485 --> 00:10:44.325
 He first noticed that the house was gone 

00:10:45.385 --> 00:10:48.615
 Fortunately, a neighbor could tell in what direction it had run 

00:10:50.195 --> 00:10:53.225
 This kind of thing also happens quite often 

00:10:53.865 --> 00:10:57.105
 People don't really notice what is happening 

00:10:57.105 --> 00:11:00.185
 and they come home one day and the house is gone 

00:11:00.185 --> 00:11:02.585
 What does it mean? 

00:11:03.385 --> 00:11:05.845
 Perhaps their children have become completely alienated 

00:11:05.845 --> 00:11:09.115
 or their wife has decided "suddenly" 

00:11:09.115 --> 00:11:12.145
 But of course not so sudden 

00:11:12.145 --> 00:11:13.145
 to leave them. Why? 

00:11:13.695 --> 00:11:15.945
 According to this story 

00:11:15.945 --> 00:11:18.605
 is because something you ignored was allowed to grow in the house 

00:11:20.995 --> 00:11:23.535
 Mr. Bixby sat down in the car and drove out looking for the house 

00:11:23.535 --> 00:11:25.965
 He looked at all the houses on the road 

00:11:25.965 --> 00:11:28.385
 Eventually he saw one so familiar 

00:11:28.385 --> 00:11:30.835
 Billy and Mrs Bixby waved from the 1st floor 

00:11:37.835 --> 00:11:40.065
 In the 1890s in India 

00:11:40.065 --> 00:11:43.355
 when building houses, a local would want 

00:11:44.045 --> 00:11:46.915
 priest or equivalent 

00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:49.975
 come and lay the first stone in the foundation. NP he did this 

00:11:49.975 --> 00:11:52.235
 he would take a big pole and 

00:11:52.235 --> 00:11:55.385
 hammer it into the ground. The reason he did this 

00:11:55.455 --> 00:11:58.035
 where the foundation was to be built 

00:11:58.035 --> 00:12:01.025
 was to keep the big dragon lurking underground 

00:12:01.025 --> 00:12:03.875
 hammered down so it couldn't get up 

00:12:03.875 --> 00:12:06.985
 and shattering the house 

00:12:06.985 --> 00:12:08.745
 That means the same as 

00:12:08.745 --> 00:12:10.205
 when in the New Testament stands 

00:12:10.205 --> 00:12:13.175
 that one should not build his foundation on sand 

00:12:13.175 --> 00:12:16.385
 Then it doesn't matter how good the house is 

00:12:16.385 --> 00:12:19.225
 How well constructed or rich 

00:12:19.225 --> 00:12:22.055
 If the foundation is on sand 

00:12:22.055 --> 00:12:24.635
 or on top of a dragon, there is nothing in the house 

00:12:24.635 --> 00:12:27.905
 who ever gets well 

00:12:28.045 --> 00:12:30.325
 and the prosperity the house may look outward to 

00:12:30.325 --> 00:12:32.275
 is just a facade 

00:12:34.965 --> 00:12:37.915
 Mr. Bixby climbed the dragon's head and into the window 

00:12:41.205 --> 00:12:44.645
 How did this happen? He asked 

00:12:45.095 --> 00:12:47.685
 It was the dragon said Billy 

00:12:48.315 --> 00:12:51.105
 They do not exist, Mother began 

00:12:51.105 --> 00:12:54.265
 but there is a dragon insisted Billy. A great one 

00:12:54.465 --> 00:12:56.325
 and Billy patted it upside down 

00:13:00.635 --> 00:13:02.995
 The dragon was happy with the tail 

00:13:03.445 --> 00:13:06.675
 and even faster than it had grown, the dragon became smaller 

00:13:11.885 --> 00:13:13.955
 Soon it was the size of a kitten again 

00:13:17.905 --> 00:13:18.905
 I have nothing against dragons on this size said mother 

00:13:25.945 --> 00:13:27.745
 Why was it so great 

00:13:28.705 --> 00:13:29.995
 I'm not sure Billy said 

00:13:29.995 --> 00:13:32.265
 But maybe it just wanted to be noticed
