00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.990
Today we get to talk about one
of the most relevant, useful,

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.110
and interesting aspects of math.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:06.740
We get to talk about rates.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.310
And when we talk about rates what we're
really talking about is this sign.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.530
And all of the interesting math
underlying both the number and

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.110
the unit associated with that number.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.000
So before we really get started,
I have a question.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.400
How would you read this sign?

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.990
I know that it's 35 and
that the M stands for miles and

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.990
the H stands for hour, but
what does the P stand for?

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.760
Enter your answer here.
