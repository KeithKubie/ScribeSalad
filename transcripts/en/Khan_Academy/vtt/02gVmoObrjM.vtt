00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.550
Where we had left off, we had
expressed our line integral

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.939
over the boundary of our
surface in terms of dt,

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:08.210
in the dt domain.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.634
We expressed what f dot dr
is going to be equal to.

00:00:11.634 --> 00:00:13.050
What I'm going to
do in this video

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.924
is do a little bit of
algebraic manipulation,

00:00:14.924 --> 00:00:17.104
and then we will actually
apply Green's theorem.

00:00:17.104 --> 00:00:19.020
And whether or not we
have time in this video,

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.436
we'll then manipulate
that to show

00:00:20.436 --> 00:00:22.840
that it's the exact same thing
that we saw in the earlier

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.450
part, where we evaluated
the surface integral.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.427
And so let's do that.

00:00:26.427 --> 00:00:28.510
So this integral right
over here is the same thing

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.660
as the integral from a to b.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.159
And then what I'm
going to do is I'm

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.830
going to group the things that
are being multiplied by dx dt.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.050
So if I group them and
then factor out a dx dt,

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.864
so if I take this part right
here and this part right

00:00:42.864 --> 00:00:44.780
over here, I'm essentially
going to distribute

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.260
the R. Let me make it clear.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.750
I'm going to distribute
the R. And so I'm

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.260
going to group that and
that right over there,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.760
I will be left with-- and
I'll factor out the dx dt.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.080
I will be left with P plus
R times the partial of z

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.940
with respect to x times dx dt.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.430
And I'll do the same
thing for the dy dt's.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.270
So that's that part
right over there.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.020
And then the R is going
to get distributed

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.850
in this thing right over here.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:26.436
So it's going to be plus
Q plus R-- the R is going

00:01:26.436 --> 00:01:30.310
to get distributed-- times the
partial of z with respect to y.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.935
And I'm going to
factor out a dy dt.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.240
And then we can't
forget all of that

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.190
is going to be multiplied by dt.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.690
Now, this right over
here is interesting,

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.730
because it's starting to
look very similar to what

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.560
we had up here, where we just
had our theoretical vector

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.210
field.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.630
In fact, let me
copy and paste it.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.390
So actually, I don't know if I'm
on the right a layer of my work

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.660
right over here.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.490
So let me copy and paste.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.750
No, that didn't work.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.960
Let me try it one more time.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.104
So if I try to copy,
I'll go a layer down.

00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:19.520
I'm using an art
program for this.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.940
Copy-- and then I think
this will work-- and paste.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.010
There we go.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.710
So this is a result
that we had before.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.200
This is kind of a
template to look at.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.260
But what is going on
over here if we just

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.750
look at this template?

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.970
We see that we're
in the t domain.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.600
We're integrating over
t right over here.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.850
But then we have these things.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.770
We have some function that's
a function of x and y times dx

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.480
dt, and then some function,
the function of x and y times

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.180
dy dt, and we're integrating
with respect to dt.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.430
Well, that's exactly what
we're doing right over here.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.650
We can distribute
the dt, and we have

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.460
something that looks exactly
like this right over here,

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.590
where M is analogous to
this piece right over here.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.760
Let me make it clear.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.700
M, this piece right over
here, looks a lot like M

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.260
in our example right over here.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.580
It's being multiplied by
dx dt, and then this dt,

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.110
which you can distribute, and
this piece right over here,

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.680
looks a lot like N.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.490
And so, we can
say that, well, we

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:23.990
have something that
looks like this.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.140
We can rewrite it
like this and go back

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.820
into the-- kind of
deparametrize it.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.400
So this thing is going to
be equal to now the line

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.430
integral of C1.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.160
We are in the xy plane.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.320
We started with the curve C,
but now we're going to go to C1.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.850
It's completely analogous.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.650
These are only functions
of x's and y's.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.010
Everything here is.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.250
So now, this is going to be
the line integral over C1--

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.126
and I could even draw it as
that, if I like-- of M dx,

00:04:00.126 --> 00:04:01.000
and that makes sense.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.925
Because if you multiply dt times
dx dt, the dt's cancel out,

00:04:04.925 --> 00:04:06.470
and you're just left with dx.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.620
So M times dx, so let
me write it that way.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.320
So it's going to be P plus
R times the partial of z

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:22.089
with respect to x dx plus n.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:23.910
Let me scroll to the
right a little bit.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.030
Plus n, which is Q plus
R times the partial

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.500
of z with respect to y dy.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.130
And then this is
really interesting,

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.887
because this path that we
are now concerned with,

00:04:36.887 --> 00:04:37.970
it's completely analogous.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.053
I hope you don't think I'm
doing some voodoo here.

00:04:40.053 --> 00:04:42.570
This statement is completely
analogous to this statement,

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.480
where M could be this
and N could be this.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.450
And so, we can revert
it back to now the path

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.190
C1 that sits in the xy plane.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.290
Not our original
boundary C, but now we're

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.740
just dealing with a
boundary in the xy plane.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.000
So it reverts to this.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.420
But what's powerful about
getting it to this point,

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:06.730
is we can now apply Green's
theorem to this to essentially

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.580
turn this into a double
integral over the region

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.240
that this path surrounds,
the original region

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.850
over this region R.
And when we change

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.080
how we manipulate that,
when we play around with it,

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.030
we're going to see that we get
the exact same result that we

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.544
got in earlier videos.

00:05:22.544 --> 00:05:23.960
And I'll leave you
there, and I'll

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.950
see if I can do that
in the next video.
