As we said before, we'll be using template HTML to build our awesome resumes.

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:10.440
&gt;&gt; To do so, we'll be using the string.replace method to find a pattern

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.380
in a string and replace all or some matches of it.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.940
We'll be using the most simple version to find the first instance of a pattern,

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.270
but you can do much more.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.790
Check the instructor's notes for more details.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.360
&gt;&gt; Let's take my email address as an example.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.040
If I wanted to change out my Udacity email address for

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.040
a Gmail email address, I could use a replace function.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.540
In this case, I've got var newEmail.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.310
It goes email, the string with my Udacity email address and

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.940
I'm replacing Udacity with Gmail.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.810
&gt;&gt; And don't forget to check to see if that worked.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:50.680
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:57.668
Let me add console.log email to see my old email address and

00:00:57.668 --> 00:01:03.940
console.log(newEmail) to see my new email address.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:11.730
Okay, we're going to refresh our page, open up the console and there we go.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.510
We can see my old udacity email address showing up on the console as well

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.280
as my new Gmail address on the console as well.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.440
&gt;&gt; Let's have the students try it but

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.780
this time, let's append the new message to the page.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.210
I want you to create a new called funThoughts where you take

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.800
everything that was in awesomeThoughts, but replace the word awesome with fun.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.410
Use .append(funThoughts) and put it on the page.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.910
Check this box when you see your message show up on the page.
