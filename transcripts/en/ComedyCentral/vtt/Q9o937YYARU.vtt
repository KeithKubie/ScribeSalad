- We really had to
produce an actual event

00:00:02.301 --> 00:00:03.136
and then shoot at it.

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:04.437 line:0%
- [Director] Hold.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.471 line:0%
- I...

00:00:05.504 --> 00:00:05.905 line:0%
quit.

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:08.307
(upbeat music)

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.144 line:0%
Hey everybody, welcome to
The Other Show, I'm Sarah.

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:12.311 line:0%
- And I'm Chris.

00:00:12.344 --> 00:00:13.646 align:start size:88% position:13%
- And we're here talking
about episode two

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.948 align:start size:84% position:16%
of The Other Two
with Drew and Helene.

00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:16.816 line:0%
- Yay!

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:19.619 line:0%
(everyone talking
over each other)

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:22.321 align:start size:94% position:6%
- So this episode is
Chase Goes To A Premiere.

00:00:22.354 --> 00:00:24.157
- Hey cuties, I'm about
to hit the red carpet

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.158
with my manager, Streeter.

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:26.426
Say what's up, Streeter.

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:27.927
- Wazzup!

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.662
- So this episode, a lot
of our season takes place

00:00:29.695 --> 00:00:32.498 align:start size:97% position:3%
at big events for Chase and
this is the first one of those

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:34.901 align:start size:88% position:13%
where we had to produce
a movie premiere

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:36.602
and then we shot
our episode at it.

00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:38.137
- It was unbelievable.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.505
- We just wanted it
to feel legitimate,

00:00:39.538 --> 00:00:42.141
Because we wanted to
help legitimize Chase

00:00:42.174 --> 00:00:45.244
and the world that these
two doofs are entering.

00:00:45.277 --> 00:00:47.947
- You know how like in
real life, you're gay?

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.449
- Yes.

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:51.751 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Well, the Ad guys loved
that, in fact one of the guys

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:54.854
wanted me to tell you that
his brother is also gay.

00:00:54.887 --> 00:00:55.855
- Cool?

00:00:55.888 --> 00:00:57.123
- [Agent] But the thing is,

00:00:57.156 --> 00:00:59.358 align:start size:84% position:16%
they think that the
character is straight.

00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:00.960
- More than 12 years ago
I went in for an audition,

00:01:00.993 --> 00:01:02.662
I don't even know
what it was for,

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:04.597
but all I had to do, I
didn't have any lines,

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.167 align:start size:88% position:13%
I just had to pantomime
laying fertilizer.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.270 align:start size:97% position:3%
I just had to mime laying
fertilizer and say no lines,

00:01:11.303 --> 00:01:12.271
and then when I was
done they were like,

00:01:12.304 --> 00:01:13.506
"That was great,
that was great."

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.675
So I think this is sort of like,

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:18.211 align:start size:84% position:16%
a suburban guy, think
he's got a wife,

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:20.379
so I was trying to
get a little more,

00:01:20.412 --> 00:01:22.348
basically saying a
little straighter

00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:23.182
(Drew laughs)

00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:24.817 align:start size:81% position:19%
without saying it,
and I was like,

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.886
how do I mime laying
fertilizer straighter?

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:29.822
Though, I can see was
probably pretty gay.

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:30.723
(everyone laughs)

00:01:30.756 --> 00:01:32.358
So I was like, what do I do?

00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:34.961
So then I just did it again
but I was sort of like...

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:36.462
(Chris grunts repeatedly)

00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:40.399
And I just coughed and cleared
my throat because I was like,

00:01:40.432 --> 00:01:44.003 align:start position:0%
I guess a straight person would
cough more while he did it.

00:01:44.036 --> 00:01:45.738
And then I got it and I've
been in those commercials

00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:47.173
for years, you've seen it.

00:01:47.206 --> 00:01:48.708
(everyone laughs)

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:50.810
It's played for comedy that
you had to re-shoot this

00:01:50.843 --> 00:01:53.379
audition and do it less gay
but then at the very end

00:01:53.412 --> 00:01:56.849
where you feel guilty that you
allowed yourself to do that.

00:01:56.882 --> 00:02:00.853 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Yeah, you kinda see
Cary sort of dealing with

00:02:00.886 --> 00:02:03.656 align:start size:84% position:16%
internalized
homophobia at the end

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.525
with the waiter being like,

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:11.131
oh, no, no, no, for me it was
just, they wanted it louder,

00:02:12.064 --> 00:02:13.199 align:start size:81% position:19%
I've dealt with
that in real life,

00:02:13.232 --> 00:02:16.202
where you're self-hatey.

00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:19.772
Being a queer actor,
you're trying to get,

00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:23.943 align:start size:94% position:6%
navigate this world that's
a very difficult area

00:02:23.976 --> 00:02:26.412 align:start size:84% position:16%
that you make missteps
in and it's like...

00:02:26.445 --> 00:02:28.247
- Well, it's like, what do
other people want you be?

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.384 align:start size:97% position:3%
But then regardless of what
they want, will I allow myself

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:34.120 align:start size:94% position:6%
to change because of
what I think people want?

00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:35.621
- I feel for Cary.

00:02:35.654 --> 00:02:38.057
(Drew stutters)

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.492
I feel for Cary.

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:43.830
He's in a tough, because you're
like, oh, I need this money,

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:48.234 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm gonna throw
myself out the window.

00:02:48.267 --> 00:02:50.469 align:start size:97% position:3%
- No, I like that it never
occurred to him when his agent

00:02:50.502 --> 00:02:51.804
was like, do it again, less gay.

00:02:51.837 --> 00:02:53.139 align:start size:88% position:13%
He's like, okay, that's
what you gotta do

00:02:53.172 --> 00:02:54.974
and then you're like, oh, duh.

00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:55.808
(Chris groans)

00:02:55.841 --> 00:02:57.410
It is...

00:02:57.443 --> 00:02:58.644
rough.

00:02:58.677 --> 00:02:59.812
- It's so sad!

00:03:00.846 --> 00:03:03.049
Your daddy's...

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:04.250
dead!

00:03:04.283 --> 00:03:06.118
(Brylyn weeps)

00:03:06.151 --> 00:03:07.053
- My daddy's dead?

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:08.321
- Kate Simses plays Brylyn.

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:10.156
We really, going into casting,

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:12.058
couldn't tell if we
should cast young

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:13.960
and make them look
older or cast older

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:16.495
and just be like, they're 11.

00:03:16.528 --> 00:03:18.664
I guess we didn't know what
was gonna work comedically.

00:03:18.697 --> 00:03:21.067
- Kate made me laugh so hard,

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.668 align:start size:84% position:16%
it was so hard to
keep a straight face

00:03:22.701 --> 00:03:24.337
when she was going into like,

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.506 align:start size:94% position:6%
bursting into tears
about my daddy being dead

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:30.977
and her face was just so,
like she was so deeply,

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.281
and even in-between takes,
Kate is such a sweet person

00:03:35.314 --> 00:03:37.917
that the whole picture
was just unbelievable.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.586
- Yeah, because the idea of
that character is very broad

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:42.521
or almost sketchy
so we were trying

00:03:42.554 --> 00:03:43.956
to make sure it's
still grounded,

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.626
but she was so good and like,

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.829
so funny but still real even
though it was so preposterous.

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:51.030
She's great, I loved her.

00:03:51.063 --> 00:03:52.365
- Brooke, thank god.

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:53.199
- Here.

00:03:53.232 --> 00:03:55.034
- This party is not fun.

00:03:55.067 --> 00:03:56.168
- Yes it is.

00:03:56.201 --> 00:03:57.670
I'm having fun.

00:03:57.703 --> 00:04:00.773
- This episode also has my
favorite unspoken joke in it,

00:04:00.806 --> 00:04:03.976 align:start size:88% position:13%
which is: you get
drinks for you and Cary

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:07.146
and you guys meet back
together and you give him

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:10.049
the little pink martini glass
and you drink the whiskey,

00:04:10.082 --> 00:04:13.152
which is what Chris and I do
and we often order those things

00:04:13.185 --> 00:04:14.620 align:start size:84% position:16%
and then get delivered
them opposite

00:04:14.653 --> 00:04:16.389
and then we silently switch.

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:20.192
- [Male Voice] Ho ho,
great party, dude.

00:04:20.225 --> 00:04:22.028
- It is a great party.

00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:23.462
Glad you're having fun, man.

00:04:23.495 --> 00:04:24.897
- [Male Voice] Oh, I'm...

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.366
No, no, I'm uh...

00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:29.135
I'm auditioning
for a commercial.

00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:31.637
- The fun thing about
that fart commercial is

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.239 align:start size:84% position:16%
this is the third
time it's been written

00:04:33.272 --> 00:04:36.042 align:start size:94% position:6%
because we tried it
twice at SNL as a sketch.

00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:38.377
We tried it once with Paul Rudd

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.046 align:start size:84% position:16%
and once with Julia
Louis-Dreyfus.

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:41.247
- It went really
well at the table

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.816 align:start size:84% position:16%
and then at dress
rehearsal it ate shit.

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:45.017
- Died.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.086
- Because the whole
sketch was predicated

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:49.689
on him making very
small fart smells,

00:04:49.722 --> 00:04:51.257
so it's very subtle
and small and just

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.659 align:start size:84% position:16%
a huge audience,
it's not gonna work.

00:04:53.692 --> 00:04:54.994
And then we were like, well,

00:04:55.027 --> 00:04:56.262
we'll try it again with
Julia Louis-Dreyfus,

00:04:56.295 --> 00:04:58.064
and it got pulled,
it didn't work again.

00:04:58.097 --> 00:04:59.732
And we were like, you know what?

00:04:59.765 --> 00:05:00.633
You know what this is missing?

00:05:00.666 --> 00:05:02.068
Drew Tarver.

00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:03.869
(everyone talking
over each other)

00:05:03.902 --> 00:05:06.439 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Julia couldn't make it, Paul
Rudd couldn't make it work.

00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:09.309
[Drew] I make it work.

00:05:10.642 --> 00:05:11.642
(upbeat music)
