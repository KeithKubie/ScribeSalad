00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.120
There are currently over 14,000 animals on
the International Union for Conservation of

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.250
Nature’s Redlist of species that are facing
extinction.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.210
So should we let nature take its course or
step in to save them?

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.770
I mean, species come and go over time.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:14.770
Look at the dinosaurs!

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.400
Actually, you can’t, because they went extinct…

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.700
Studies suggest that species are going extinct
faster now than before, and we’re to blame.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.400
We keep cutting down their forests, paving
over their land so they have nowhere to go,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.480
not to mention introducing new predators and
diseases.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.230
So maybe we should preserve them … out of
guilt?

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.120
Or maybe we should keep the incredible variety
of nature around!?

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.449
It’s a puzzle.

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:41.780
The Endangered Species Act of 1973 states
that threatened species are of “aesthetic,

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.249
ecological, educational, historical, recreational,
and scientific value to the Nation and its

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:47.249
people.”

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:51.030
But take away all the things we’re doing
to kill-off species, and all the things nature

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.710
is doing to weed them out, and it’s still
really hard to preserve some species.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.799
Because animals need to mate to make more
animals, and helping them accomplish that

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:01.379
is harder than you’d think…

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.182
For one thing, we’ve got to get the animals
in the mood.

00:01:03.182 --> 00:01:05.729
And that’s not always easy.

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.079
We don’t always know the social factors
they need to become aroused!

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:14.060
For example, in a managed space (like a zoo)
the zookeepers might clean up their enclosure,

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.369
inadvertently removing something that’s
a super turn-on -- like a pheromone signal.

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.299
We can look for physiological issues too,
like if they’re not mating because they’re

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:23.299
sick!

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.960
But, even if they’re healthy, and we’re
not messing with their environment, maybe

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.430
they still don’t mate!

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.829
And often we have no idea why.

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.119
So is it worth the effort?

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.250
That’s not for me to say — I’m an animal
lover so yes, save all the animals!

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.860
But there is another thing to consider…
money.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.840
Captive breeding programs have been in existence
for about half a century.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.020
And some have been really successful!

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.659
But regardless of outcome, the one sure result
of a breeding program is a lot of time and

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.649
energy is spent trying to keep species off
the endangered list.

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.499
The California condor reintroduction program
was one of the most expensive efforts ever,

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:02.710
costing a total of more than 35 million dollars
since 1987.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.460
And giant pandas can cost upwards of 2 million
dollars a year for a zoo to host.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.690
But there’s an upshot.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.380
Having a rare species like pandas in a zoo
for breeding will attract visitors, particularly

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.580
if and when there’s a BABY to come see.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.750
That’s revenue that can go a long way to
fixing their habitat and figuring out how

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.420
to get those pandas to mate.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.500
On the other hand, some would argue that the
money spent on zoo enclosures and breeding

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.780
programs would be better spent preserving
natural habitats so the animals aren’t displaced

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:30.860
in the first place.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.030
There might be a loss of revenue from visitors,
but nature preserves are still really fun

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.440
to visit even if you aren’t as likely to
see an exotic and interesting furry friend.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.220
So there’s a lot to consider when we talk
about conserving species… but I still vote

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.250
for saving sweet little (and big) animals.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.390

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.760
Zookeepers sometimes have to go to lengths
to get animals to mate in captivity.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.260
These pandas are watching porn.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.260
Yep.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.260
That's real science!

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.750
Watch it on Wild Sex -- here.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:58.750
And it gets crazier.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.760
Scientists have done in vitro fertilization
to pandas!

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.860
Thanks for watching.
