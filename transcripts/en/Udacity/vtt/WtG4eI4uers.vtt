00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.080
Let us use the assignment of car as the conveyance,

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.500
to illustrate how these different words get assigned to different categories,

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.090
different slots in this frame. Now,

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.650
we know that car was a conveyance because of the role that this preposition, by,

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.770
plays here. That is, an intelligent agent might make use of the structure of

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.000
the sentence to make sense of the story. We have designed human language in such

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.680
a way that there is a particular structure to them. Prepositions, for instance,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.400
play a very important role. Here are some of the common prepositions: by, for,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.770
from, to, with. Each preposition plays certain thematic roles.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.860
By can be an, by an agent, or by a conveyance, or by a location. Similarly for

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.660
the other prepositions. So the moment we see by, here we know that,

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.710
whatever is going to come after by, the care can be a agent, or a conveyance, or

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.950
a location. Note again that the categories we are using here

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.099
are semantic categories, we are not saying noun, or verb or

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:09.110
anything like that, what we are saying here is beneficiary and duration, and

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.060
source which are semantic categories, that allow us to draw inferences. But

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.400
how did we know that car was a conveyance, and not an agent, or a location?

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.380
In general, while the structure of language does provide constraints, these

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.480
constraints do not always definitely determine the meaning of that particular

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.360
word. We'll use additional knowledge to find the exact meaning of the word car.
