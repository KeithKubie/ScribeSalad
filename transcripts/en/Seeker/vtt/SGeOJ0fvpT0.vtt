00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.959
Death by marijuana?

00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:07.380
The first report is now on the books -- but
to be honest, it all seems a liiiiittle suspicious.......

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.850
[MUSIC]

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:15.559
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for Dnews.

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.660
The first reports of a death caused by marijuana
are circulating out of England.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.929
Her name was Gemma Moss, she was 31, and she
reportedly collapsed and died after smoking

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.160
a half a joint to help her sleep.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.650
She was ruled by a British pathologist as
well as a coroner to have died from cannabis

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.300
poisoning after they found moderate to high
levels of thc in her blood.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.290
They found no other issues with her organs
that could have explained the fatal heart

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.350
attack.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.410
Surprised?

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.830
I'm no pro at the effects of cannabis on the
body (that would be Trace) but the idea that

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:50.530
someone could die from smoking half a joint
sounds sensational....if not intentionally

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.750
misleading.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.180
With almost a week since the news broke, scientists
from around the globe are weighing in calling

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.910
the ruling "ridiculous" and "absurd".

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.400
A study published in American Scientist, which
built on decades of medical research, found

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.140
that in order to overdose on marijuana, you
would need to smoke 1000x the amount that

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.550
it takes to get high -- about a third of your
body weight.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.540
Which is why death by marijuana has been declared
virtually impossible by some scientists and

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.500
has never been documented before.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.960
Could this be a case of new evidence of the
dangers of marijuana?

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.040
Or is it just a politicized report on the
tragic story of a young woman who just happened

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.310
to have smoked a joint before her untimely
death?

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.850
Scientists at Icahn Medical School in New
York say that the story would be more viable

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.159
scientifically if the joint had been laced
with another drug.

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.409
But it wasn't.

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.090
Psychopharmacologist David Nutt, who has gained
esteem as a no-bs scientist in the world of

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.310
international drug policy, says that the report
of "death by marijuana" is dishonest --- and

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.140
likely obscuring the true cause of her death.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.750
He suggests it could have been caused by an
underlying cardiac condition that Moss had

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.030
without knowing.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.290
It's also known that she was very depressed,
which raises the risk of sudden cardiac arrest.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.130
Dr. Nutt believes it's possible that the small
additional stress on her heart from the joint

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.310
may be have been the straw that broke the
camel's back.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.569
He notes that this kind of cardiac attack
has been triggered far more commonly in sports,

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.480
having sex, sitting in saunas, even going
to the bathroom.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.099
The jury's still out on what actually happened,
and given that the claim is so extraordinary,

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.690
there's certain to be further investigation.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.510
Either way, it's a tragic situation for her
family I'm sure, and I can't imagine it's

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.170
much comfort that her death is now caught
up in a controversial battle about the dangers

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.170
of marijuana.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.870
What do you guys make of the report?

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.459
