00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.029
For a couple of months in the fall of 1969,
a persistent rumor that Paul McCartney had

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.700
been killed two years earlier and replaced
with a look-alike captured the imaginations

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.619
of Beatles fans and the general public.

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.039
The rumor began in the winter of 1967 when,
after a particularly icy night, reports were

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.420
flying among Britain’s national press that
Paul had been killed in a car crash on January

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.440
7, 1967.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.120
The tale was reported in the February issue
of The Beatles Monthly Book (#43) under the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.129
heading of “False Rumour,” and with a
denial from the Beatles’ press office.

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.969
In fact, it claimed that neither Paul nor
his black Mini Cooper had even left the house

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.030
that day.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.980
Fast-forward to September 1969, about one
week before the release of Abbey Road (9/26/69),

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.450
when the student newspaper of Drake University
in Des Moines, Iowa ran the story Is Beatle

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.960
Paul McCartney Dead?

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.380
In the article, which is written in the same
style with which today’s Ancient Aliens

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.250
posits its wildest theories, Tim Harper opined
that Paul “may indeed be insane, freaked

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.970
out, even dead.”

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.189
Harper supported the statement by examining
Beatle’s album covers and lyrics, and pointed

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.189
to Sgt.

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.200
Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band (6/1/67)
where he found two mysterious symbols (a hand

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.670
over Paul’s head and what is conjectured
to be “an ancient death symbol”), a left-handed

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.390
guitar that “lies on the grave at the group’s
feet,” (Paul was the only lefty), on the

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.200
back cover Paul is the only one not facing
the camera, and in the centerfold Paul is

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.869
the only one wearing a black arm band.

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.049
Continuing with the examination, Harper looked
at the walrus of The Magical Mystery Tour

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.939
(11/27/67) (revealed to be Paul in 1968’s
Glass Onion), which, at least according to

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.119
Harper, was a Viking symbol of death.

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.210
And then turning his attention to The Beatles
(11/28/68), he reported that playing Revolution

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.010
No. 9 backward produced phrases about death.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.130
It’s not clear if Harper was kidding or
not with his story, but it certainly captured

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.960
the imagination of the country.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.540
By October 1969, the Beatles press office
was flooded with questions about Paul’s

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:16.370
health, and on October 12, 1969, DJ Russ Gibb
of WKNR-FM in Detroit, Michigan moderated

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.560
a full hour of an impromptu discussion of
the topic with listeners who were calling

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.560
in.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.050
Inspired, Fred LaBour, a University of Michigan
natural resources student and reporter with

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.449
its student newspaper, Michigan Today, who
was assigned to review the recently released

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:35.950
Abbey Road, penned a satirical piece titled
McCartney Dead; New Evidence Brought to Light

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.300
on October 14, 1969.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.320
Unfortunately, many people failed to realize
he was kidding.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.959
In a 2009 article, LaBour admitted that he
had pulled all of his alleged “clues”

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.320
out of his hat, but because so many didn’t
realize he was joking at the time, several

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.040
of LaBour’s creations became part of the
“Paul is Dead” lore.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.060
These include that the lyric “the walrus
was Paul,” really means “the corpse was

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.570
Paul,” with LaBour claiming “walrus”
is Greek for “corpse,” and that Paul was

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.760
replaced with “a Scottish orphan named William
Campbell.”

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.750
LaBour also claimed that letters on Paul’s
black arm band from Sgt.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.980
Pepper’s, OPD, stood for the British equivalent
of DOA (and meant “Officially Pronounced

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.190
Dead”), and that Paul’s bare feet on the
Abbey Road cover signified that he was a corpse.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:26.190
LaBour also noted that Paul was smoking right-handed,
a sure sign that this was an imposter.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.670
Within a week, the rumor, which now contained
several of LaBour’s fabrications, had reached

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:31.880
the national media.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.030
On October 21, 1969, the story was examined
on New York’s WABC which was picked up (at

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.400
least at that time) in 38 states.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.290
By now, the alleged crash was claimed to have
occurred on November 9, 1966, after Paul had

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.400
angrily left a Beatles recording session.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.160
In addition, at some point, rather than William
Campbell, some people were saying “Billy

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.970
Shears,” was Paul’s replacement, due to
the lyric in Sgt.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:56.970
Pepper’s.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.990
Although the Beatles’ press office continued
to deny the rumor as “a load of rubbish,”

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.940
for many the rumor lived on, even after Paul
did an interview with Life on November 7,

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:06.940
1969.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.280
It all worked out for Paul and the Beatles
though, as a result of the rumor, Beatles’

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.870
albums sales increased significantly and both
Magical Mystery Tour and Sgt.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.759
Pepper’s re-entered Billboard’s top album
charts.

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:24.070
At the end of November 1969, LaBour participated
in a “cross-examination,” televised on

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.490
New York’s WOR, that was hosted by F. Lee
Bailey and which analyzed the rumor.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.450
When LaBour admitted to Bailey before the
show that he had made up his “facts,”

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.500
Bailey reportedly said, “We have an hour
of television to do; you’re going to have

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.500
to go along.”

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:50.120
So, he did.
