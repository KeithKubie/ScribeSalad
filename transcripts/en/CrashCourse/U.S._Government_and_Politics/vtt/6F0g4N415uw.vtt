00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.240
Hello. I'm Craig, and this is Crash Course
Government and Politics, and today, we're

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.940
going to talk about one of my favorite subjects:
the media and its role in politics.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.600
At last, we're finally going to hear a fair
and balanced account of how the lamestream

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.670
media is distorting the American public's
understanding of current affairs!

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.320
Yeah, sure, except for the segment of the
American public that gets all of their information

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.640
from right wing media sources.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.660
Ok, so the media can be a thorny issue, but, we are
talking about politics here, and technically we are a

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.000
part of the media, so we should probably say something
about it. Other than how awesome we are at it.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.560
[Theme Music]

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.800
(deep, growly voice)
I am the media! Ha ha ha ha ha!

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.900
(regular voice)
So, in terms of politics, the main function

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.360
of the media is to provide information so people
can make decisions and get involved in politics.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.600
(deep voice)
Ha ha ha ha!

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.380
(regular voice)
Sorry. For the economically inclined, the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.190
media lowers information costs. Rather than
going out and researching what we might want

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.960
to know, which takes time and effort, various media
outlets tell us stuff that they think we will find useful.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.439
We probably have a sense of what we mean by
media, but it's a good idea to break it down

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.880
into types, because each of the forms of media
work slightly differently, and the role of

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.300
the different types has changed a lot over
the years. There's a lot more beards, for instance.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.800
The oldest form of media, at least, that we
are going to talk about today, is print, which

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.370
means newspapers and magazines. Print is no
longer the main source of information for

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.960
Americans, but it sure used to be. Especially
in the days when some large cities had papers

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.200
that would put out a morning and afternoon
edition.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.060
But just because fewer people are reading
print media doesn't mean that they aren't

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.869
very important. For one thing, most of the
other news media organizations rely on print

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.569
for their news. Newspapers like the New York
Times and the Washington Post still break

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:44.480
most major news stories and provide a lot
of information for television and Internet news.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.200
Print media also tend to offer more detail
and comprehensive news stories, although this

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:52.640
is changing quickly. One aspect of print media that is
often overlooked is that it's still the main source

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.300
of news for educated elites, and these are the people
whose opinions tend to matter a lot in making policy.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.660
If you're skeptical about this, watch a morning
news program or check out an article on a news aggregator website

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.380
and see how often the program article references
the Times or the Post. You might be surprised.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.289
The second oldest, and in some ways still
most important source of political information

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.870
comes from broadcast media. As a Youtuber,
I hate to say this, but television still reaches

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.660
more Americans than any other form of media, and
remains an important source of political information.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.760
Radio is less important at reaching a diverse
mass audience, although talk radio, especially

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.010
conservative talk radio, matters a lot in
the political media landscape. But despite

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.110
it's massive reach, broadcast media has a
significant drawback in shaping public opinion:

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.239
television stories are very short, usually less than
two minutes long, and therefore less informative.

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.340
A third major media force in politics is,
what's that called? The Internet! You probably

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.600
already know that, though, since you're watching
this video. It's a little bit tricky to write about

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.880
how the Internet affects politics because it's changing
so rapidly. But there are a few things we can say.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.540
As a news source, the primary advantage of
the Internet is that it can update so quickly.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.280
This is great for breaking news, although
there's an argument that it pushes news organizations

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.140
towards creating more stories and hot takes (also my
nickname in high school), rather than deep reporting.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.460
In the early days of the web, Internet news
was mostly just online versions of print newspapers,

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:07.530
but that landscape has shifted, a lot. First
came blogs about politics, and then sites

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.320
dedicated to politics. Which, this being America,
tended to polarize into right wing and left wing sites.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.040
The growth of social media provided new avenues
for politicians, campaigns, and parties to

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.680
get their information to the masses, and now
every candidate has at least one Twitter profile

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.460
and Facebook page. And they've probably got
a Snapchat and a Tumblr, and a, uh, maybe

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.920
a Tinder, and staff dedicated to maintaining
a social media presence.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.420
This can be great for lots of information about a
candidate or their policies, but it's hardly unbiased news,

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.920
so if this is your only source of information,
you're probably aren't going to get the full story.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.500
For a sense of how the media landscape has
changed over the past two decades, check out

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.659
this chart. That's right, we got charts here.
Cause we are video media. The surprising thing

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:46.959
to me about this data is not that so many
more people are getting their news from online

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.940
sources, but that such a high percentage still
relies on television news, especially if you

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.439
combine local, national, and cable news programs.

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:57.759
I, sometimes I forget I have a TV. I guess
you can chalk it up to information costs.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.260
Without any research on your part, watching
a nightly news program will keep you decently

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.900
informed, and it only takes twenty-two minutes
of your time, without the commercials. So

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.260
just sit there and let the TV do the thinking
for ya.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.189
I should probably talk about those commercials
a little bit. One of the really great things

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:13.599
about the Internet is that it opens up the
possibility of a lot more non-commercially

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:18.799
supported information becoming available.
There's no commercials on the Internet... none.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.400
A serious complaint about broadcast and print
journalism is that, because they are primarily

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.690
financed by advertising, news organizations
have an incentive not to report on stories

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.820
that are critical of their parent organizations
of advertisers. This doesn't stop us from getting

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.280
negative reports about News Corp or the Washington
Post group, but they're unlikely to report on themselves.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.960
So this question of how much we can trust
the news comes down largely to issues of bias,

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.220
because it's pretty rare that news organizations
lie outright. Without the public trust, readers

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.690
and viewers will just go somewhere else. This
doesn't mean that newspapers, and to a much

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.380
lesser extent, television companies, are without
bias, though.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.200
The New York Times and Washington Post do tend
to be more liberal than conservative, but overall

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.460
they're probably balanced out by the Wall Street Journal,
Fox News, and talk radio, which tend to be conservative.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.520
Putting political bias aside, the most persistent
bias in the news seems to be towards conflict

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.590
and scandal! And these are not really liberal or
conservative issues. If anything, the news media is

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.440
most biased towards conflict, which may explain
why you don't see a lot of stories about compromise.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.500
Two politicians smiled and shook hands today, and then
walked away, happy. That doesn't sound interesting.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.140
Let's look at the three main factors that
effect news coverage in the Thought Bubble.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.500
The first factor influencing the news is the
journalists who make it. The journalists are

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.970
even more important than their bosses, the
publishers, because they have the discretion

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.780
to report and interpret the news. If you think
the news is just the facts, then it's useful

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.660
to remember that the New York Times slogan
used to be: all the news that's fit to print.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.699
Do reporters have a bias towards one political
ideology or the other? Probably. More journalists

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:42.419
identify as liberal and as Democrats than
say they are conservative or Republican.

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:46.410
The next factor to consider is the source
of political news: the politicians themselves.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.190
Politicians do a lot of things to create a
positive media image for themselves, and this

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.819
goes beyond shaking hands and kissing babies.
They show up at important events, like opening

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:56.979
day of the baseball season, or a natural disaster,
and make the most of these photo opportunities.

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:00.509
They also cultivate relationships with reporters,
because if a journalist likes you, they might

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:03.770
be more likely to write something nice about
you. Or at least something less mean. One

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.360
of the best ways to cultivate a good relationship
with a journalist is by leaking information

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.240
to them. A leak is a disclosure of confidential
information to a journalist, and politicians

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.849
can use them to cement relationships with
news organizations, and to make sure that

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:17.329
a story is reported the way that they want
it reported.

00:06:17.329 --> 00:06:20.880
Reporters have a hard time refusing a scoop,
so if a politician gives inside information,

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:24.669
they can usually influence the way the reporter
will tell the story. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:28.610
Even more important then leaks are press releases.
These are stories written by politicians,

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.289
or more likely their staff, that are released
to the press. Politicians hope that stories

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:35.860
will be reported with minimal revisions, and
they often are, especially since there's so

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.460
much pressure for news organizations to put
out content as quickly as possible.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.180
News organizations like them a lot, because
they lower the cost of producing information.

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.180
But advocates of responsible journalism worry a lot
about them because, coming directly from politicians,

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.680
they're certain to be biased. And when they're
reported as straight news, they can be misleading.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.800
The third factor influencing the media is
us, the consumers of news. Why do we matter

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.229
if news is just a matter of reporting what
happens? We matter because producers of news

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:01.750
want us to read and watch it, so they make
news that we will want to read and watch.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:05.750
In practice, this means that the news will be tailored
to the groups of people most likely to consume it.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.389
And those people are not always a good cross-section
of Americans as a whole. People who watch

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:13.150
and read the news tend to be better educated
and wealthier than those who don't, and media

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.570
producers respond to this. What this means
in practice is that certain segments of the

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:20.139
population, and their concerns, are under-reported.
Among the large groups that don't get media

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:24.599
attention that is proportional to their size
are the working class, especially union workers,

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.620
religious groups, veterans, and various minority
groups.

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:31.620
So the media plays an important role in American
politics as the filter through which politicians

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.759
can make information available to the public.
The media, as the name suggests, mediates

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:39.110
this information and shapes it in powerful
ways. In the sense that it doesn't actually

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.680
create or change the structures of government,
you could argue that the media isn't all that

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.190
important to the American political system.
But if you believe that information is key

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:50.930
to understanding why and how American politicians
act, then we start to see media in a new light.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:54.020
In many ways the most important thing about
media is what it doesn't cover. It's really

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.729
hard for voters and other citizens to formulate
opinions and try to influence their elected

00:07:57.729 --> 00:08:01.500
representatives if they don't even know something
is an issue. Even in the twenty-first century,

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:05.600
when there are so many more sources of information to
choose from, there are still stories we don't get to hear.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.740
The first step to hearing them is probably
a better understanding of the media and its

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.069
importance as a political institution. Thanks
for watching, see you next time.
