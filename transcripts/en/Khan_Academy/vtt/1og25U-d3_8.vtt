00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.104
Let's continue with our
proof of Stokes' theorem.

00:00:03.104 --> 00:00:04.520
And this time we're
going to focus

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.840
on the other side
of Stokes' theorem.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.410
We're going to try
to figure out what

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.270
is the line integral over the
boundary C-- where this is C

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.792
right over here, the boundary
of our surface of f dot dr.

00:00:15.792 --> 00:00:17.500
And what we're going
to see is that we're

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.270
going to get the exact same
result as we have right up

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.440
here.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.970
Before we do that, I'm going to
take a little bit of a detour

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.270
to kind of build up to this.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.866
So let's just take this and
put it to the side for now.

00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.990
Actually, let me actually
just delete it right now.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.365
And what I'm
actually going to do

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:34.980
is I'm going to focus
on this region down

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.370
here-- this region
in the xy plane.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.970
This is path C, which is
the boundary of our surface.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.740
I'm going to focus
on the path that

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.300
is the boundary of this region.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.720
This path that sits
in the xy plane.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.040
I will call that path C1.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.440
And so, one, we can think
about a parameterization

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.630
of just that path
in the xy plane.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.620
We could say that C1
could be parameterized

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:11.370
as x is equal to x of t and
y is also a function of t.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.340
And t is obviously
our parameter.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.590
And it can go between A and B.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.380
So maybe when t is equal
to A, it sits right here.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.710
And then, as t gets larger
and larger and larger,

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.110
it goes all the way around.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.930
And eventually, when
t is equal to B,

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.990
it gets to that
exact same point.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.057
So that's our
parameterization right there.

00:01:30.057 --> 00:01:32.640
And now, just to make the rest
of this proof a little bit more

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.490
understandable, I'm
going to give you

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.730
a little bit of a
review of something.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.270
Imagine that we have some vector
field G. And G, at minimum, is

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.310
defined on the xy plane.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.960
And it could be
defined other places,

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:57.549
but let's say that G is equal
to m of x, y i plus N of x, y j.

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:58.590
And this is all a review.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.640
We've seen this a long time ago.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.280
What would be the line
integral over the path C1?

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.270
Not C, but this path that
sits in the xy plane.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.100
What would be the line
integral over the path C1?

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.810
I like to write that sometimes.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.230
And I'm using G so I don't
get confused with F--

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.040
our original vector field--
of G, our vector field

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.940
here, along that path.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:36.605
G dot dr. Well, dr is just going
to be equal to dxi plus dyj.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.070
So if you take the dot product
of these two things right

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.440
over here, you're going to get
the line integral over our path

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.940
C1.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.727
Remember, C1 is
this path down here.

00:02:48.727 --> 00:02:50.310
Let me do it in that
same color so you

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.420
don't think I'm
changing colors on you.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.570
The line integral
over our path C1.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.130
But when you take
this dot product,

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.740
you multiply the x
components and then add that

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.300
to the product of
the y component.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:16.030
So you have m times
dx plus n times dy.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.880
I just took the dot product
of G and dr. n times dy.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.950
And when you evaluate
these things,

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.700
one way to think about it
is that dx is the same thing

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.140
as-- let me write it up here
in a different color-- dx

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.250
is the same thing as the
derivative of x with respect

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.690
to t, dt.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.530
And same logic for y. dy
is equal to the derivative

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.130
of y with respect to t, dt.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.320
One way to think about
it, these dt's cancel out.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.956
And you are just left with dx.

00:03:45.956 --> 00:03:47.830
And this is an important
thing to think about

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.020
because then this allows
us to take this line

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.390
integral into the
domain of our parameter.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:59.770
So then, this will be
equal to the integral

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.260
in the domain of our parameter.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.180
So now we are in the t domain.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.210
And t is going to
vary between a and b.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.200
We are in the t domain
between a and b.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.460
This is going to be equal to m
times-- instead of writing dx,

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.690
I'm going to write dx/dt dt.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.810
So it's going to be dx--
let me write it this way.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.900
dx-- the derivative
of x with respect

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:34.270
to t-- dt-- that's the
first expression-- plus n--

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.080
and then, the exact same
thing-- times dy dt.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.470
n times dy dt.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.450
These are all
equivalent statements.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.120
Now, with all of that out
of the way-- and all of this

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.190
is really just a reminder so
that the rest of this proof

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.370
becomes a little bit intuitive.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.330
With that out of the
way, let's come up

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.920
with the parameterization
for this path

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.710
up here, for C.
Remember, we just

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.290
did C1 down in the xy plane.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.860
Now we're going to
do C that sits up

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.770
here that kind of rises
above the xy plane.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.340
Well, for C, the
parameterizations for x and y

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.970
can still be the
exact same thing

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.810
because the x and
y values are going

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.820
to be the exact same thing.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.880
The x and y value there
is the exact same thing

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.650
as the x and y value there.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.290
The only difference is we
now have a z component.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:32.980
We defined it way up here.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.720
Our z component is going to
be a function of x and y.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.200
It tells us how high to go.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:50.080
We can parameterize C as--
maybe I'll write it as a vector.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.730
So let me parameterize.

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.980
So I'll write C as a vector.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.445
Actually, no.

00:05:57.445 --> 00:05:58.770
Let me write it this way.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:04.470
Let me write C. Let me
do that purple color.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.420
C, we can say is x
is x of t-- actually,

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.450
let me write this as a vector.

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.210
And I'll use a
vector r, not to be

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.850
confused with this
r right over here.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.840
So these are two different
r's, but I'll just

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.090
use r because that tends
to be the convention.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.450
So in order to
parameterize C, it's

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.200
going to be the
position vector r, which

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.930
is going to be a function of t.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:32.891
And x is still just going
to be x of t i plus y of tj.

00:06:32.891 --> 00:06:34.640
And now we're going
to have a z component.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.000
And z is going to be
a function of x and y,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.050
which are, in turn,
functions of t.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.890
So z is a function of x--
which is a function of t--

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.190
and a function of y-- which is a
function of t k-- that tells us

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.390
how high above to, essentially,
get each of those points.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.700
And then, once again, we
know that t is between a

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.130
and b. t is greater than
or equal to a and less than

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:56.160
or equal to b.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.530
So we have that
parameterization right there.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.110
And now we can start
to think about the line

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:06.620
integral of f dot
dr along this path.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.340
Before, we did dr
along this path.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.510
Now we're going to do dr on
this path right over here.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.550
This is now our
parameterization r.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.860
So I'll leave you there, and
I'll see you in the next video.
