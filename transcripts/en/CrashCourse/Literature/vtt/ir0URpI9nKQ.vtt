Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course Literature, and
today we're going to discuss the poetry of Langston Hughes.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.340
So the Harlem Renaissance was an early 20th
Century movement in which writers and artists

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.550
of color explored what it means to be an artist,
what it means to be black, and what it means

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.050
to be an American, and also what it means
to be all three of those things at the same time.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.640
MFTP: Mr. Green, Mr. Green! Does the Harlem
Renaissance have anything to do with that

00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:24.729
renaissance with, like, Leonardo de Vinci,
and all of the other... Ninja Turtles?

00:00:24.729 --> 00:00:29.039
Kind of, but the Harlem Renaissance happened
a lot later than the European Renaissance,

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.179
also on a different continent, and there was
much less plague and much more jazz.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:42.140
[Theme Music]

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.920
OK, so one journalist described the Harlem
Renaissance this way: "What a crowd! All classes

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.329
and colors met face to face, ultra aristocrats,
bourgeois, communists, Park Avenue galore,

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.339
bookers, publishers, Broadway celebs, and
Harlemites giving each other the once over."

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.540
What's the once over? Is that a dirty thing,
Stan? Apparently it is not a dirty thing.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.320
The Harlem Renaissance began just after the
First World War and lasted into the early

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.890
years of the Great Depression because it turns
out it's pretty hard to have a renaissance

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.390
when no one has any money, as they found out
in Venice. And like the European Renaissance,

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.950
it was a social and political movement, but
also an artistic one. I mean it inspired literature

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:25.340
and poetry, music, drama, ethnography, publishing,
dance, fashion, probably even some novelty cocktails.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.979
As Langston Hughes wrote about
this time: "The negro was in vogue."

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.599
Oh, it must be time for the open letter. Oh, look,
it's a floating dictionary. An open letter to language.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.260
Hey there language, how's it going? Don't say it's
going good, language; say it's going well.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.289
So Langston Hughes often used the term "negro"
to refer to African Americans, and when we

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.109
quote him or his poetry we're also going to
use that term. But we won't use it when I'm

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:51.430
talking about African Americans or the African
American experience because these days we

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.500
understand that term to be offensive. I would
argue that this is a good thing about language;

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.799
it has the opportunity to evolve and to become
more inclusive.

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.500
In short, language, I love you and I am amazed
by you every day. Sorry if that sounds creepy;

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.700
I feel I might start singing the song from The
Bodyguard, so I'm just going to stop right now.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.240
Best wishes,
John Green

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.080
Right, so, the poems, essays, and novels of
the Harlem Renaissance often discuss the so-called

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.750
double consciousness of the African American
experience, a term coined by W.E.B. Dubois

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.630
in his book The Souls of Black Folk, and which
you might remember from our To Kill a Mockingbird

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.220
episode. Some writers like Countee Cullen,
and Claude McKay used poetic forms historically

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.230
associated with European white people, like
the Shakespearean sonnet, the Petrarchan sonnet,

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.800
and the villanelle, which is like a very fancy
sonnet, but other writers, including Langston

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.220
Hughes, chose forms based on African and African
American folk forms, you know, fables and

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.910
spirituals, children's rhymes, and blues songs.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.640
This is actually part of Modernism generally,
as artists sought to mix high and low culture

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.360
in an attempt to reinvent art. Like, see also
Marcel Duchamp putting a toilet in an art gallery.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.420
I should clarify: there were already toilets
in art galleries; he was putting it there as art.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.600
Anyway, let's go to the Thought Bubble for
some background on Langston Hughes.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.300
Hughes was born in 1902 in Missouri to mixed-race
parents, who divorced early. He grew up in

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.500
Kansas and began to write poetry in high school:
mostly because white students chose him as

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.730
class poet. In his autobiography, he wrote:
"Well, everyone knows -- except us -- that

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.150
all Negros have rhythm, so they elected me
class poet. I felt I couldn't let my white

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.230
classmates down and I've been writing poetry
ever since."

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.230
Hughes' father wanted him to become a mining
engineer so Hughes went to Columbia University,

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.730
but he left after his freshman year, in part
because other students have snubbed him, and

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.540
in part because actually he didn't want to
become a mining engineer.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.160
So he signed on to work on a boat, going more
or less around the world, returning a couple

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.260
of years later, this is true, with a red-haired
monkey named Jocko. He didn't enjoy the trip

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.650
very much but that might actually have been
a good thing because as he wrote in his autobiography:

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.130
"My best poems were all written when I felt
the worst. When I was happy, I didn't write anything."

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.010
Which stands in stark contrast to all
the happy poets, you know:

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.320
Emily Dickinson, Sylvia Plath, Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.320
Hughes aimed to write in accessible, familiar
language, and in that he was influenced by

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.140
poets like Paul Laurence Dunbar, and also
people like Carl Sandburg and Walt Whitman,

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.440
all of whom wrote in vernacular, everyday
language in the hopes that their work could

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.380
appeal to a larger audience.
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:21.040
So, as Hughes wrote in a 1927 essay, classical
forms didn't support the work he wanted to do:

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.040
"Certainly the Shakespearean sonnet would
be no mold in which to express the life of

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.250
Beale Street or Lenox Avenue nor could the
emotions of State Street be captured in rondeau.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:37.840
I am not interested in doing tricks with rhymes.
I am interested in reproducing the human soul, if I can."

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.259
And this is what makes Hughes such an important
poet. He brilliantly combines formal poetry

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.780
with the oral tradition, and he refuses to
draw a bright line between fine art and folk art.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.580
OK, in order to have a better understanding
of Hughes' approach to poetry, let's look

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.180
at an early manifesto he wrote called "The
Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain."

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.320
In this essay, he criticizes other black writers
for being too interested in white culture

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.889
and white forms. He writes: "This is the mountain
standing in the way of any true Negro art

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:14.030
in America-- this urge within the race toward
whiteness, the desire to pour racial individuality

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:20.620
into the mold of American standardization, and to
be as little Negro and as much American as possible."

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.920
Now, some black writers, like Countee Cullen,
accused Hughes of being TOO black. Like in

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.999
a review of Hughes' first book Cullen wrote,
"There is too much emphasis of strictly Negro

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:33.740
themes." But, then again, later on, James
Baldwin would condemn Hughes for not diving

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.590
deep enough into African American experience;
like Baldwin wrote that Hughes poems "take

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:44.620
refuge, finally, in a fake simplicity in order
to avoid the very difficult simplicity of the experience."

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.300
It's hard out there for a Langston Hughes.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.069
Anyway, let's make up our own mind. I think
the best way to get a sense of how Langston

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:54.209
Hughes expresses himself is probably to,
like, actually read a couple of his poems.

00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:56.719
Let's begin with "The Negro Speaks of Rivers":

00:05:56.719 --> 00:06:00.870
"I've known rivers:
I've known rivers ancient as the world and

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.789
older than the
flow of human blood in human veins.

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:07.360
My soul has grown deep like the rivers.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.259
I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were
young.

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:14.139
I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled
me to sleep.

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:17.610
I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids
above it.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.259
I heard the singing of the Mississippi when
Abe Lincoln

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:22.830
went down to New Orleans, and I've seen its
muddy

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.830
bosom turn all golden in the sunset.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.210
I've known rivers:
Ancient, dusky rivers.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.800
My soul has grown deep like the rivers."

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.300
Here's a bit of news that will be discouraging
to most of you aspiring writers out there:

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.620
Hughes wrote that poem just after graduating
from high school. He was riding a train to

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:44.669
see his estranged father and he passed over
the Mississippi. He writes: "I began to think

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:49.969
about what that river, the old Mississippi,
had meant to Negros in the past... Then I

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:56.219
began to think about other rivers in the past--the
Congo, and the Niger, and the Nile in Africa--and

00:06:56.219 --> 00:07:00.669
the thought came to me: 'I've known rivers,'
and I put it down on the back of an envelope

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:04.680
I had in my pocket, and within the space of
ten or fifteen minutes, as the train gathered

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.180
speed in the dusk, I had written this poem."

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.280
Are you even serious? "Ten or fifteen minutes"!
What? Really!

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.580
So "The Negro Speaks of Rivers" is in the
lyric mode: it's poetry trying to capture

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:19.770
an internal emotional state. He uses the vision
of these rivers to transcend his immediate

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:24.490
relationships and to connect himself instead
to all of his African forefathers, trading

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:28.939
the immediate for the immortal. The repetition
of "I've known rivers" at the beginning and

00:07:28.939 --> 00:07:33.669
"my soul has grown deep like the rivers" at
the middle and end, gives the poem the feeling

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:37.550
of, like, a sermon or spiritual, in keeping
with Hughes' use of folk forms.

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:43.719
And then, there's the catalog of active verbs:
"I bathed", "I built", "I listened", "I looked."

00:07:43.719 --> 00:07:48.499
Those show people actively participating in
human life and having agency; that even amid

00:07:48.499 --> 00:07:53.400
oppression and dehumanization, these people
were still building and listening and looking.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.849
And then, in the latter part of the poem,
there are adjectives that in other poems might

00:07:56.849 --> 00:08:02.969
be used pejoratively, like "muddy" and "dusky",
that are linked with other adjectives, "golden",

00:08:02.969 --> 00:08:08.330
"ancient", that encourage us to perceive them
in a far more positive light. So, darkness

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:12.180
and brownness are seen as lustrous and valuable
and revered.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:15.259
And I know that some of you will say, oh,
you're overreading the poem: Hughes didn't

00:08:15.259 --> 00:08:20.279
mean any of this stuff. To which I say: it
doesn't matter. These are still interesting

00:08:20.279 --> 00:08:23.939
and cool uses of language. Although, as it
happens, I'm not overreading it.

00:08:23.939 --> 00:08:27.289
Anyway, let's look at one more poem, "Harlem",
written in 1951:

00:08:27.289 --> 00:08:29.779
"What happens to a dream deferred?

00:08:29.779 --> 00:08:32.350
Does it dry up
like a raisin in the sun?

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:35.290
Or fester like a sore—
And then run?

00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:40.160
Does it stink like rotten meat?
Or crust and sugar over—

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.450
like a syrupy sweet?

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:43.979
Maybe it just sags
like a heavy load.

00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:45.600
Or does it explode?"

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.610
The dream here is likely a version of the
American dream, a dream that at the time Hughes

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:53.830
wrote the poem was still denied to most African
Americans. And in that sense, it's kind of

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:58.760
optimistic that Hughes uses the term deferred,
rather than, like, destroyed or forbidden.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.250
There's also a great moment earlier in that
same book of poems in which Hughes writes,

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:06.660
"Good morning Daddy, aint you heard, the boogie
woogie rumble, of a dream deferred", which

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:11.520
uses the conventions of blues music to associate the
deferral of the dream with, like, a boogie-woogie rumble.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.480
But the imagery in this poem is very negative:
it often takes things that are sweet and then

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:20.990
makes them horrifying. You've got dried raisins,
running sores. I guess sores aren't that sweet,

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:27.690
but you do have crusty sweets. Even the verbs
are negative: "dry", "fester", "stink", "crust",

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:32.720
"sag". And that works against any real optimism.
This is made even more interesting and complicated

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:37.590
by the fact that the poem sounds like a nursery
rhyme: it has neat, perfect, one-syllable

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:41.870
rhymes like "sun" and "run", "meat" and "sweet".
But then you have the layout of the poem,

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:46.140
which resists conventional stanzas, and that
troubles the simplicity here. Also, the rhythm

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:50.520
of the poem is always changing. Like, this
isn't straight iambic pentameter or anything

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:54.790
like that, and that makes it hard to build
into a comfortable pace as the reader. And

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:59.720
then there's that last line, "Or does it explode",
which from a meter perspective is totally

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:06.660
fascinating because there's a stress on every
single syllable: Or. Does. It. Ex-plode.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:10.460
I don't want to get too Lit Crit-y on you but
it's like the last line itself is trying to

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:14.870
explode because there's no break, no relief.
So the rhymes make it sound harmless, like

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:19.920
it's from a children's book, but the imagery
and rhythm tell another, much more barbed story.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:25.320
And this is definitely one of Hughes' more political poems: He's warning that if circumstances don't change,

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:29.520
there might be dangerous consequences. This poem proceeded the bulk of the Civil Rights Movement,

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:36.360
but it suggests that withholding true equality has
real risks and real costs to everyone in a social order.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:39.880
There's so many other great Langston Hughes
poems that we don't have time to discuss like:

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:44.100
"Dream Boogie", "I, Too", "Dream Variations",
"Theme for English B". I want to share just

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:48.830
one more with you, no lit crit or anything,
just the poem: "Folks I'm tell you, birthing

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:54.560
is hard and dying is mean, so get yourself
a little lovin, in between." See, sometimes

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.110
literature is just in the business of proving
good advice.

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:59.570
