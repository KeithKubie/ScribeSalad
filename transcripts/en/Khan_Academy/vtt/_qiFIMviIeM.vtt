00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.419
- [Voiceover] So in all of our
videos on special relativity

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:04.754
so far, we've had this
little thought experiment,

00:00:04.754 --> 00:00:09.679
where I'm floating in space,
and right at time equals zero,

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:11.985
a friend passes by in her spaceship.

00:00:11.985 --> 00:00:14.400
She's traveling in the
positive x direction,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.148
velocity is equal to v,
and we draw space-time

00:00:19.148 --> 00:00:20.541
diagrams for both of us.

00:00:20.541 --> 00:00:23.246
First, I draw my space-time
diagram in white,

00:00:23.246 --> 00:00:27.065
and then I overlay her space-time diagram.

00:00:27.065 --> 00:00:30.107
And the angle that is formed between

00:00:30.107 --> 00:00:34.368
the time axes and the position
axes, right over there,

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:36.178
that's going to be dictated by

00:00:36.178 --> 00:00:40.357
how fast v is, how fast
she is actually traveling.

00:00:40.357 --> 00:00:43.503
And we give the space-time diagram from

00:00:43.503 --> 00:00:46.127
her frame of reference, we
see with the little primes

00:00:46.127 --> 00:00:47.625
right over there.

00:00:47.625 --> 00:00:49.203
Now, one thing that you might
have been thinking about

00:00:49.203 --> 00:00:50.940
throughout this entire series, is well,

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.781
if I perceive her traveling
with a velocity of v

00:00:55.781 --> 00:00:58.428
in the positive x direction,
if we took her point of view,

00:00:58.428 --> 00:01:00.123
and that's what I have right over here.

00:01:00.123 --> 00:01:02.688
If she views herself as
just floating in space,

00:01:02.688 --> 00:01:06.160
what she will see me as
right at time equals zero,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.388
actually I'd say right at
t prime is equal to zero.

00:01:08.388 --> 00:01:13.310
We're saying that t prime and
t equals zero are coinciding.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.548
Right at that moment,
she will see me fly by

00:01:17.548 --> 00:01:21.820
at negative v, going in
the negative x direction.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.860
Once again, there is no
absolute frame of reference.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.565
These frames of reference
are all absolute...

00:01:28.565 --> 00:01:31.705
I'm sorry, these frames of
reference are all relative.

00:01:31.705 --> 00:01:33.830
And so you could imagine
what it would look like,

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.107
'cause if we drew her
space-time diagram where her

00:01:37.107 --> 00:01:40.369
ct prime axis and x
prime axes that they are

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.028
perpendicular to each other
and then based on that,

00:01:43.028 --> 00:01:47.704
my space-time diagram
would be at an angle.

00:01:47.706 --> 00:01:49.261
It's at an angle like this.

00:01:49.261 --> 00:01:52.361
You can kind of see the positive ct axis

00:01:52.361 --> 00:01:54.404
is in the second quadrant here because

00:01:54.404 --> 00:01:56.889
I'm traveling with the
velocity of negative v,

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:58.549
but these angles are going to be the same.

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.711
This is going to be alpha
and that is going to be,

00:02:02.711 --> 00:02:04.372
let me write this,

00:02:04.372 --> 00:02:07.836
is going to be alpha
and this is going to be,

00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:12.836
and this right over here
is going to be alpha.

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:15.428
Now what I want to do in this video is

00:02:15.428 --> 00:02:20.391
use this symmetry, use these two ideas to

00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:24.571
give us a derivation of
the Lorentz Transformation

00:02:24.571 --> 00:02:26.835
or the Lorentz Transformations.

00:02:26.835 --> 00:02:28.775
And the way we might
start, and this is actually

00:02:28.775 --> 00:02:30.667
a reasonable way that the
Lorentz Transformations

00:02:30.667 --> 00:02:32.502
were stumbled upon, is to say,

00:02:32.502 --> 00:02:35.636
all right, we could start with
the Galilean Transformation,

00:02:35.636 --> 00:02:37.389
where we could say, all right,

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:42.284
the Galilean Transformation
would be x prime is equal to,

00:02:42.284 --> 00:02:44.934
is going to be equal to

00:02:44.934 --> 00:02:49.492
x minus v times t.

00:02:49.492 --> 00:02:52.197
V times t.

00:02:52.197 --> 00:02:54.386
Now we already know that if you just use

00:02:54.386 --> 00:02:55.922
the Galilean Transformation,

00:02:55.922 --> 00:02:58.325
then the speed of light
would not be absolute,

00:02:58.325 --> 00:03:01.223
it would not be the same in
every frame of reference.

00:03:01.223 --> 00:03:03.534
And so we had to let go of the constraints

00:03:03.534 --> 00:03:05.612
that time and space are absolute, and

00:03:05.612 --> 00:03:08.306
so there's going to be some
type of scaling factor involved.

00:03:08.306 --> 00:03:12.444
And so we can call that
scaling factor, gamma.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.160
So, we could say all
right, let's just postulate

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.769
that x prime, if we assume the
speed of light is absolute,

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.680
is going to be some scaling
factor, gamma times x minus vt.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.634
Well, you could make the same
argument the other way around.

00:03:27.634 --> 00:03:30.898
If you view it from
her frame of reference,

00:03:30.898 --> 00:03:33.057
and you're trying to translate
it to my coordinates,

00:03:33.057 --> 00:03:36.980
you could say, well, x,
instead of just using the

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.420
Galilean Transformation that
x is going to be equal to,

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.682
x is going to be equal to x prime,

00:03:45.682 --> 00:03:48.967
and now instead of a v, we
have a negative v, right?

00:03:48.967 --> 00:03:50.848
So if you subtract a negative v, in fact,

00:03:50.848 --> 00:03:52.067
let me just write it that way.

00:03:52.067 --> 00:03:55.898
X minus negative v times t prime,

00:03:55.898 --> 00:03:58.684
that would be the Galilean Transformation,

00:03:58.684 --> 00:04:00.820
but whatever scaling factor we used here,

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.643
there's a symmetry here.

00:04:02.643 --> 00:04:04.303
I shouldn't have to use a
different scaling factor

00:04:04.303 --> 00:04:07.321
if I assume a different, kind of,

00:04:07.321 --> 00:04:09.887
if I'm in a different frame of reference.

00:04:09.887 --> 00:04:13.300
So, if we assume the absoluteness
of the speed of light,

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.320
we're going to have some
other scaling factor

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.834
just like that or we
could rewrite this as x,

00:04:19.834 --> 00:04:22.262
let me do that same color,

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:27.089
we could rewrite it as x is equal to

00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:29.455
this scaling factor.

00:04:29.455 --> 00:04:32.293
I'm really having trouble
changing colors today.

00:04:32.293 --> 00:04:34.278
It's gonna be equal to that scaling factor

00:04:34.278 --> 00:04:38.718
times x prime,

00:04:38.718 --> 00:04:42.387
subtract the negative plus vt prime.

00:04:42.387 --> 00:04:44.422
And if you ignore the scaling
factor right over here,

00:04:44.422 --> 00:04:46.467
this is the Galilean Transformation

00:04:46.467 --> 00:04:48.824
from the primed frame of reference

00:04:48.824 --> 00:04:51.289
to the non-primed frame of reference.

00:04:51.758 --> 00:04:54.611
So an interesting thing is
what is this scaling factor?

00:04:54.611 --> 00:04:55.398
How do we figure out

00:04:55.398 --> 00:04:58.062
what that scaling factor is going to be?

00:04:58.062 --> 00:05:01.267
And so we can do a little bit
of interesting algebra here.

00:05:01.267 --> 00:05:02.707
What we could do is,

00:05:02.707 --> 00:05:04.610
Actually, let me just
write what I just wrote,

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.921
let me write it right below here.

00:05:06.921 --> 00:05:10.565
So we could say that x...

00:05:10.565 --> 00:05:12.748
Once again changing colors is difficult.

00:05:12.748 --> 00:05:17.739
We could write that x is
equal to our scaling factor,

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:22.754
gamma times x prime,

00:05:22.754 --> 00:05:24.954
times x prime

00:05:24.954 --> 00:05:29.169
plus vt prime.

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.430
And now what I'm going to
do in order to have myself

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.742
an equation that involves all
of the interesting variables,

00:05:35.742 --> 00:05:39.449
I'm gonna multiply both
sides of this equation by,

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:42.082
one way to think about
it, I'm going to multiply

00:05:42.082 --> 00:05:44.926
both sides of this top equation by x.

00:05:44.926 --> 00:05:47.318
So if I multiply the left-hand side by x,

00:05:47.318 --> 00:05:52.178
I'm going to have x times x prime,

00:05:52.178 --> 00:05:54.839
x times x prime.

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:57.631
And then the right-hand
side of the equation,

00:05:57.631 --> 00:06:00.550
I could multiply by x,
but x is the same thing.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.089
I'm saying it's the same thing as

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:03.738
gamma times all of this business.

00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:05.990
So, I'm just going to
multiply the left-hand sides

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.318
of the equation and I'm
going to multiply the

00:06:07.318 --> 00:06:09.078
right-hand sides of the equation.

00:06:09.078 --> 00:06:11.433
So if I multiply the right-hand
sides of the equation,

00:06:11.433 --> 00:06:16.135
I am going to get gamma squared times,

00:06:16.135 --> 00:06:18.608
and I'm gonna have a big expression here,

00:06:18.608 --> 00:06:22.647
and so just really applying the
distributive property twice,

00:06:22.647 --> 00:06:24.798
x times x prime,

00:06:24.798 --> 00:06:29.500
x times x prime,

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.500
and then x times positive vt, so,

00:06:35.676 --> 00:06:37.436
that prime doesn't look like a prime,

00:06:37.436 --> 00:06:39.991
x times x prime

00:06:39.991 --> 00:06:43.993
plus x times positive vt

00:06:43.993 --> 00:06:48.696
plus x times, actually
positive vt prime I should say,

00:06:48.696 --> 00:06:49.973
gotta be careful here.

00:06:49.973 --> 00:06:53.502
X times positive vt prime and then

00:06:53.502 --> 00:06:57.496
I have negative vt times x prime.

00:06:57.496 --> 00:07:01.229
So it's gonna be negative vt

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:06.004
times x prime, times x prime.

00:07:06.004 --> 00:07:08.924
And then finally, I'll
have negative vt times

00:07:08.924 --> 00:07:11.129
positive vt prime.

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:14.368
So that's going to be, I could
write that as a negative.

00:07:14.368 --> 00:07:17.247
Let's write that as vt squared,

00:07:17.247 --> 00:07:21.113
I'm sorry, negative v squared.

00:07:21.113 --> 00:07:23.969
And actually, let me
delete this parentheses.

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:27.534
I don't wanna force myself
to squeeze for no reason.

00:07:27.534 --> 00:07:29.506
So I'm gonna have negative v times v,

00:07:29.506 --> 00:07:34.137
so that's negative v squared times t,

00:07:34.137 --> 00:07:36.320
times t prime.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.188
Times t prime.

00:07:40.188 --> 00:07:43.354
And now let me place my parentheses.

00:07:43.354 --> 00:07:46.733
So how can I use all
of this craziness here

00:07:46.733 --> 00:07:49.693
to actually solve for gamma?

00:07:49.693 --> 00:07:51.457
And here we're going to go back

00:07:51.457 --> 00:07:53.013
to one of the fundamental postulates,

00:07:53.013 --> 00:07:55.497
one of the assumptions
of special relativity

00:07:55.497 --> 00:07:58.091
and that's the speed of light is absolute.

00:07:58.091 --> 00:07:59.135
You're going to measure it to be

00:07:59.135 --> 00:08:01.457
the same in any frame of reference.

00:08:01.457 --> 00:08:03.953
And to think about that,
let's imagine an event

00:08:03.953 --> 00:08:07.633
that is connected with the
origin with a light beam.

00:08:07.633 --> 00:08:12.474
So let's say right at time
and t prime is equal to zero,

00:08:12.474 --> 00:08:15.875
I were to shoot my flashlight and

00:08:15.875 --> 00:08:19.085
let's say it hits something at some point.

00:08:21.055 --> 00:08:22.547
We look at some event right over there and

00:08:22.547 --> 00:08:25.565
they're connected by a
light beam, by photons.

00:08:25.565 --> 00:08:28.468
So let me connect them.

00:08:28.468 --> 00:08:31.207
So let me connect them.

00:08:31.207 --> 00:08:32.690
And so if you say, and once again

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:34.407
this could be me turning on my flashlight

00:08:34.407 --> 00:08:36.951
and the photon at some future,

00:08:36.951 --> 00:08:39.749
at some forward distance
and some forward time,

00:08:39.749 --> 00:08:41.214
it could just be at some position or

00:08:41.214 --> 00:08:44.535
maybe it hits something, it
triggers some type of reaction.

00:08:44.535 --> 00:08:46.786
Who know what it does, but
we're going to talk about

00:08:46.786 --> 00:08:48.552
this event right over there.

00:08:48.552 --> 00:08:50.955
That event in my frame of reference,

00:08:50.955 --> 00:08:55.955
its coordinates are going to be x and ct.

00:08:59.065 --> 00:09:03.082
And since we know the
speed of light is absolute

00:09:03.082 --> 00:09:06.125
and the way that we've
set up these diagrams,

00:09:06.125 --> 00:09:09.351
any path of light is always
going to be at a 45 degree

00:09:09.351 --> 00:09:11.266
or a negative 45 degree angle,

00:09:11.266 --> 00:09:14.493
we know that x is going to be equal to ct.

00:09:14.493 --> 00:09:18.325
X is going to be equal to
ct for this particular case.

00:09:18.325 --> 00:09:23.117
I could draw it on this
diagram as well, if I'd like.

00:09:24.307 --> 00:09:27.815
Just to show that I can,
so let me draw that.

00:09:28.487 --> 00:09:31.722
So it would look like this.

00:09:31.722 --> 00:09:35.727
It would look like this and

00:09:35.727 --> 00:09:38.711
we would once again have x equaling ct.

00:09:38.711 --> 00:09:40.231
How would you read that?

00:09:40.231 --> 00:09:41.346
Well, to get the x coordinate,

00:09:41.346 --> 00:09:43.633
you go parallel to the ct axis.

00:09:43.633 --> 00:09:45.966
So that would be the x
coordinate on this diagram.

00:09:45.966 --> 00:09:48.906
And then the ct coordinate,
you go parallel to the x axis.

00:09:48.906 --> 00:09:51.130
So, just like that.

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:54.125
But, once again, x is
going to be equal to ct,

00:09:54.125 --> 00:09:56.235
and, similarly, because the speed of light

00:09:56.235 --> 00:09:59.488
is going to be absolute
in any frame of reference,

00:09:59.488 --> 00:10:04.479
if we look at x prime, x
prime is going to be the same,

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:09.359
is going to need to be
equal to ct prime, ct prime.

00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:13.899
If we look at over here, x prime is going

00:10:13.899 --> 00:10:16.732
to be equal to ct prime.

00:10:16.732 --> 00:10:19.552
Once again, because
light, this is going to be

00:10:19.552 --> 00:10:21.096
at a 45 degree angle.

00:10:21.096 --> 00:10:24.370
So x prime is equal to ct prime.

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:26.066
They're connected by light events.

00:10:26.066 --> 00:10:28.237
So if you take your change in x divided by

00:10:28.237 --> 00:10:31.277
your change of time is going
to be the speed of light.

00:10:31.277 --> 00:10:33.657
So what we can do is use this information,

00:10:33.657 --> 00:10:35.171
for this particular event,

00:10:35.171 --> 00:10:38.329
if gamma's going to be true
for all transformations,

00:10:38.329 --> 00:10:40.946
it definitely should be true
for this particular event.

00:10:40.946 --> 00:10:45.832
I can use this information
to substitute back in

00:10:45.832 --> 00:10:47.515
and then solve for gamma.

00:10:47.515 --> 00:10:49.477
And that's exactly what I'm
gonna do in the next video,

00:10:49.477 --> 00:10:51.172
although, I encourage
you to try it on your own

00:10:51.172 --> 00:10:53.825
before you watch the next video.
