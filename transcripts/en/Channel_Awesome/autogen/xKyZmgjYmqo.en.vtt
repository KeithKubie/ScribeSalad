I would totally be down for that but
 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:32.339
I would totally be down for that but
here it feels like it's trying to be a

here it feels like it's trying to be a
 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:34.320

it just feels like this sci-fi flick

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:43.849
it just feels like this sci-fi flick
 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:45.850
it just feels like this sci-fi flick
about this guy that kind of goes from

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860
about this guy that kind of goes from
 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.890
about this guy that kind of goes from
thing to thing and then it's over

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900
thing to thing and then it's over

enjoy it but they kind of forget about
 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:53.499
enjoy it but they kind of forget about
it shortly after I guess that's not the

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:53.509
it shortly after I guess that's not the
 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:55.149
it shortly after I guess that's not the
biggest crime but for something like

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:55.159
biggest crime but for something like
 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:57.040

or incredibly bad there has to be
something incredible about it and

something incredible about it and
 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.920
something incredible about it and
there's definitely nothing like that

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930
there's definitely nothing like that
 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.710
there's definitely nothing like that
