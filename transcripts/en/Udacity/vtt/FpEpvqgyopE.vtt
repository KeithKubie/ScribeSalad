00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.770
Now that we've taken each of the numbers
and written them in scientific notation,

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.210
we've simplified down
to one power of ten.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.230
Let's continue simplifying
this part of our number so

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.770
we have one decimal over here.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.650
So looking at two and
four-tenths and one in six-tenths,

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.030
what's the largest common factor
that goes into each of them?

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.250
In other words,
what can I divide each of them by,

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.530
in order to simplify this
part of the fraction?

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.590
And also, what's the largest common
factor for three and five-tenths and

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.305
the number seven?

00:00:30.305 --> 00:00:34.740
Write the greatest common factor for
these two numbers here and

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.460
type in the greatest common factor for
these two numbers here.
