00:00:13.854 --> 00:00:15.953
The brain is the center of all of our thoughts,

00:00:15.953 --> 00:00:16.887
dreams,

00:00:16.887 --> 00:00:17.760
emotions,

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.980
and memories.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.141
It's what makes us who we are.

00:00:21.141 --> 00:00:23.773
But, there is still a lot that we don't know about the brain.

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:25.559
Scientists have worked for years

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:27.581
on trying to understand the human brain

00:00:27.581 --> 00:00:30.694
using techniques like EEG and FMRI,

00:00:30.694 --> 00:00:33.061
where we scan the brain from the outside.

00:00:33.061 --> 00:00:35.859
But what if we could look inside the brains of humans

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:37.843
and watch them as they work?

00:00:37.843 --> 00:00:39.498
Well, now we can

00:00:39.498 --> 00:00:41.083
by looking at the brains of people

00:00:41.083 --> 00:00:43.913
who are already going through surgery for clinical reasons,

00:00:43.913 --> 00:00:45.838
like curing epilepsy.

00:00:45.838 --> 00:00:47.579
Epilepsy is a disease

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.201
in which a faulty part of the brain

00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:52.762
starts working spontaneously for no apparent reason.

00:00:52.762 --> 00:00:53.960
It's like an earthquake

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.795
but inside your head.

00:00:55.795 --> 00:00:57.501
There's no way to know in advance

00:00:57.501 --> 00:00:59.292
when a seizure will occur,

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:01.171
so the patients are always at risk

00:01:01.171 --> 00:01:03.765
of unexpectedly losing control.

00:01:03.765 --> 00:01:05.926
There are drugs that treat epilepsy,

00:01:05.926 --> 00:01:07.928
but these don't always work.

00:01:07.928 --> 00:01:10.900
Some patients who don't respond well to the drugs

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.515
can undergo a different treatment

00:01:12.515 --> 00:01:14.676
where the faulty part in their brain,

00:01:14.676 --> 00:01:16.270
the part that starts the seizures,

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.111
is surgically removed.

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:20.754
The challenge is knowing which part to take out.

00:01:20.754 --> 00:01:23.568
How do you figure out which bit of the brain is faulty?

00:01:23.568 --> 00:01:26.905
In order to find the exact location of the seizure onset,

00:01:26.905 --> 00:01:30.581
doctors embed electrodes directly into the patient's brain

00:01:30.581 --> 00:01:33.127
around the suspected seizure center.

00:01:33.127 --> 00:01:35.371
The patient then stays in the hospital for a few days,

00:01:35.371 --> 00:01:37.050
waiting to have a seizure

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.568
with the electrodes constantly recording

00:01:39.568 --> 00:01:42.426
the activity inside his or her brain.

00:01:42.426 --> 00:01:45.513
Yes, now we want the patient to have a seizure

00:01:45.513 --> 00:01:47.608
so doctors can use the embedded electrodes

00:01:47.608 --> 00:01:51.263
to measure it and learn exactly where its origin was.

00:01:51.263 --> 00:01:53.288
After doctors are sure where the seizures

00:01:53.288 --> 00:01:54.948
come from in the brain,

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:56.810
they can take the electrodes out.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.271
Now they know what part of the brain they can remove

00:01:59.271 --> 00:02:01.189
in order to cure the patient.

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.155
These brain electrodes can tell us

00:02:03.155 --> 00:02:06.449
more than just where the seizures happen.

00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:09.836
Based on where the doctors place the electrodes in the brain,

00:02:09.836 --> 00:02:12.720
we can ask questions about what the brain does.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.296
Sometimes we find one cell that starts bursting in activity

00:02:17.296 --> 00:02:20.501
every time the patient sees a particular picture,

00:02:20.501 --> 00:02:24.237
for example, a picture of Marilyn Monroe.

00:02:24.237 --> 00:02:27.424
See, every time the patient sees Marilyn Monroe,

00:02:27.424 --> 00:02:30.723
some specific cells fire in the brain.

00:02:30.723 --> 00:02:34.159
You can now know when the patient is thinking of Marilyn Monroe

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:37.402
just by listening to these cells fire.

00:02:37.402 --> 00:02:41.069
When we find one or a few of these cells with each patient,

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.147
we can then do all kinds of fancy things.

00:02:44.147 --> 00:02:47.072
For example, we can connect the recording electrode

00:02:47.072 --> 00:02:48.736
to a cursor on a screen

00:02:48.736 --> 00:02:51.072
and have the patient move the cursor left or right

00:02:51.072 --> 00:02:53.414
just by thinking of things.

00:02:53.414 --> 00:02:54.226
This can help people

00:02:54.226 --> 00:02:56.319
who lost the ability to move their hands,

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.481
like people with spinal cord injuries or wounded soldiers,

00:02:59.481 --> 00:03:01.416
by having them control a prosthetic arm

00:03:01.416 --> 00:03:03.501
directly with their brain.

00:03:03.501 --> 00:03:05.563
Our brain is a brilliant device

00:03:05.563 --> 00:03:07.969
which can make predictions about the future.

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:09.888
For example, we can all know

00:03:09.888 --> 00:03:12.719
which word will appear at the end of this...

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:14.183
sentence.

00:03:14.183 --> 00:03:16.369
The brain can solve complicated problems,

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:18.823
imagine the entire universe,

00:03:18.823 --> 00:03:21.057
and grasp concepts such as infinity

00:03:21.057 --> 00:03:23.147
or unicorns.

00:03:23.147 --> 00:03:26.647
The brain produces complex emotions like love or jealousy,

00:03:26.647 --> 00:03:29.986
it's what makes us creative and curious,

00:03:29.986 --> 00:03:32.487
and it can even contemplate about itself.

00:03:32.487 --> 00:03:35.825
And the brain is the organ we use to study the brain.

00:03:35.825 --> 00:03:39.805
I think that the brain is the most beautiful organ in our body,

00:03:39.805 --> 00:03:41.414
but then I ask myself,

00:03:41.414 --> 00:03:43.767
"Which organ is making me think that?"
