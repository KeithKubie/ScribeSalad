TAL SCULLY: Advice
for students, I

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.230
would say that the most
important thing for this class

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.010
is knowing that
things will go wrong,

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.720
but that you can work through
it and things will often

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.970
resolve themselves.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.550
Certainly for one experiment
we were working on,

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.180
for the Spring Break
onion experiment,

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.670
the numbers weren't working out.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.310
And after about
30 hours of work,

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.354
I finally found this
one trivial error

00:00:35.354 --> 00:00:36.520
I had made at the beginning.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.080
And everything
started working out.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.170
And it was just
putting in the hours

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.360
and knowing there's
something there.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.680
You just have to keep
persisting through it.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.280
And it's not an easy
thing to learn to do,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.487
but it's very important.
