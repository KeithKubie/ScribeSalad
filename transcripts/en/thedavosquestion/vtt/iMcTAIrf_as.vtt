&gt;&gt; Okay.
My -- Hello the all the viewers.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.650
Uh, I think one of the things which would
help the world change is to

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.110
really focus ourselves on education and I
say that because I believe

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.620
education is very important for economic empowerment
and in particular

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:29.480
for women and, umm, coming from Asia where
I am, Asia is home to

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.590
almost 70 percent of the very poor that live,
umm, in -- at less than

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.120
a dollar a day.
Another, if you look at dollar two a day estimate,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.820
there are about
1.4 billion who are women living.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.600
So to me, umm, education is key to economic
empowerment and economic

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.540
empowerment will change the lives of the very
poor woman.
