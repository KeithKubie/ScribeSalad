00:00:01.418 --> 00:00:03.837
NARRATOR: Shortly after

00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:06.631
the course of Russian
history was changed with one

00:00:06.631 --> 00:00:08.633
act of brutal violence.

00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:10.051
[gunshots]

00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:12.846
Czar Nicholas II and
the royal Romanov family

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:15.598
were executed on orders from
the revolutionaries who had

00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:17.976
taken control of their country.

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:21.396
The Romanov's rule over Russia
had begun over 300 years

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:23.857
earlier, during Russia's
Time of Troubles,

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:26.401
a 15-year period of
dynastic confusion

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:27.777
and foreign invasions.

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:29.863
Mikhail Romanov,
the 16-year-old son

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:32.699
of Russia's religious
patriarch, was ultimately chosen

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.201
to take the throne in 1613.

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:37.537
From there, the
Romanov line continued.

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:41.249
And in 1894, Nicholas
II took power.

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:44.961
But Nicholas was not the most
capable of Russia's czars,

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:47.213
described by contemporaries
and historians

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:50.133
as weak, submissive,
and insecure.

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.343
He only chose advisors
who didn't pose

00:00:52.343 --> 00:00:55.472
an intellectual threat, leading
to questionable decisions

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:56.765
throughout his reign.

00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:59.559
In 1904, Nicholas
started a war with Japan

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.644
after refusing to
negotiate Russia's

00:01:01.644 --> 00:01:03.521
further expansion into Asia.

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:06.316
Japan decisively won the war.

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:08.067
The next year,
workers in the capital

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:10.987
marched to protest
unfair labor conditions.

00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:13.406
Imperial soldiers
fired on the crowds,

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:15.450
killing hundreds and
sparking the failed

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.330
Revolution of 1905, which caused
the deaths of thousands more.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.332
Through all of this
conflict, Nicholas

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:24.626
was still supported by
the love of his life,

00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:28.338
the Empress Alexandra.

00:01:28.338 --> 00:01:31.508
The couple had four daughters
and one son in succession--

00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:35.512
Olga, Tatiana, Maria,
Anastasia, and Alexei.

00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:37.972
While loved by her
husband, Alexandra

00:01:37.972 --> 00:01:40.850
was viewed as an outsider
by her own people.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.311
She was German by birth
and her first cousin

00:01:43.311 --> 00:01:45.480
was Kaiser Wilhelm II.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.440
And like Nicholas,
Alexandra only

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.610
trusted a select few
advisors-- but mainly,

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.946
the infamous mystic, Rasputin.

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:55.907
And by easing the chronic
pain of their hemophiliac son,

00:01:55.907 --> 00:01:58.618
Alexei, Rasputin gained
a prominent place

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:00.787
in the Romanov's inner circle.

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:04.749
In September 1915, Nicholas
left Russia to personally take

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:07.752
command of the army on the
front lines of World War I,

00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:09.838
leaving his wife to
oversee the government's

00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:11.506
day-to-day operations.

00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:15.051
Alexandra was ill-equipped
to govern a country at war,

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:17.846
where wages were depressed,
food was unaffordable,

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:21.391
and industrial workers were
abused to meet wartime quotas.

00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:24.602
To make matters worse,
Alexandra gave Rasputin

00:02:24.602 --> 00:02:26.604
a formal role in government.

00:02:26.604 --> 00:02:30.233
He was allowed to hire and fire
government ministers at will,

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:32.861
angering the rest of
Russia's nobility.

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:35.488
Meanwhile, on the front,
Nicholas and the Russian army

00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:37.490
suffered defeat after defeat.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.786
By November 1916, the country
had lost 1.7 million troops

00:02:41.786 --> 00:02:43.371
to the Great War.

00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:46.332
The Russian people had
reached their breaking point.

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:51.421
First in December 1916, Rasputin
was shot, and maybe poisoned,

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:55.008
and maybe drowned, by a group
of disgruntled noblemen.

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:58.011
Then on the morning
of March 8, 1917,

00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:00.889
thousands of Russian women took
to the streets of the capital

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:04.142
to protest the government on
International Women's Day.

00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:08.479
By midday, 100,000 women and
men had joined the march.

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:10.732
The protests continued for days.

00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:14.611
By Saturday, March 10, more
than 250,000 protesters

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:16.404
forced the city to shut down.

00:03:16.404 --> 00:03:18.698
Czar Nicholas, still
commanding troops in Europe,

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:21.367
wired his generals
to fire on the mobs.

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:23.119
But when given the
order the next day,

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:28.333
Russian soldiers instead turned
their guns on their officers.

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:32.420
By Thursday, Nicholas II had
abdicated the Russian throne.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.089
His palace was overrun
by revolutionary troops,

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:39.135
ending 304 years of
Romanov rule over Russia.

00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:41.304
The family was initially
placed under house

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:44.599
arrest at the Alexander palace,
south of St. Petersburg.

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.976
But the new provisional
government wanted the Romanovs

00:03:46.976 --> 00:03:48.728
out of the country.

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:51.105
So they asked Nicholas' first
cousin, King George V of Great

00:03:51.105 --> 00:03:52.941
Britain, to take them in.

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:56.235
At first, the King accepted,
but then changed his mind

00:03:56.235 --> 00:03:58.279
after realizing
just how unpopular

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:00.281
the Romanovs were
with both parliament

00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:01.741
and the British public.

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:04.285
In August of 1917,
the Romanovs were

00:04:04.285 --> 00:04:07.288
moved to Tobolsk in Siberia,
where their situation

00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:09.374
continued to deteriorate.

00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:11.668
In November, Vladimir
Lenin and his Bolsheviks

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:13.586
seized control of
the government.

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:15.505
They had a much more
hostile attitude

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:18.633
towards the former monarchy,
expelling many of the Romanov's

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:20.510
servants and
restricting the family

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.637
to a diet of army rations.

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:24.138
The next spring,
the Romanovs were

00:04:24.138 --> 00:04:27.266
moved to their final
location in Yekaterinburg--

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:30.478
to a building called the
House of Special Purpose.

00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:34.607
On July 17, 1918, Nicholas
Romanov and his family

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:37.276
were awoken from bed
shortly after midnight.

00:04:37.276 --> 00:04:39.445
They were told that
counterrevolutionary troops

00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:41.030
were approaching
and that the family

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.658
had to move into the basement
for their own safety.

00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:46.327
The Romanovs and four
loyal servants obliged.

00:04:46.327 --> 00:04:48.913
Several were wearing clothing
with precious jewels sewn

00:04:48.913 --> 00:04:51.165
into the seams, which they
had smuggled with them

00:04:51.165 --> 00:04:52.792
throughout their captivity.

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:55.336
Once the family was in, the
basement room was sealed,

00:04:55.336 --> 00:04:57.797
and Yakov Yurovsky,
their chief executioner,

00:04:57.797 --> 00:05:00.800
informed them they
would be executed.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.469
Nicholas could only
respond with one word--

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:06.055
[speaking russian]

00:05:06.055 --> 00:05:08.641
Yurovsky and his men
opened fire on the family,

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:10.560
killing Nicholas and Alexandra.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.437
But some, including
the children,

00:05:12.437 --> 00:05:13.980
survived the initial attack.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.275
The jewels lining their
clothing had acted as armor.

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:20.278
The Bolsheviks finished them
off with bayonets and gunshots

00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:21.654
to the head.

00:05:21.654 --> 00:05:23.406
[gunshots]

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:25.366
Yurovsky had the
family buried in two

00:05:25.366 --> 00:05:28.911
separate, unmarked graves
off the side of a local road.

00:05:28.911 --> 00:05:32.206
The first grave wasn't
rediscovered until 1979,

00:05:32.206 --> 00:05:34.334
the other until 2007.

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:36.085
The Romanov family
has since been

00:05:36.085 --> 00:05:39.756
reinterred at Peter and Paul
cathedral in St. Petersburg.

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:42.759
In July of 2018,
Yekaterinburg commemorated

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:45.887
the 100th anniversary of
the family's execution.

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:47.930
More than a century
after their deaths,

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.476
100,000 pilgrims attended
the ceremony, still

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:52.477
mourning Russia's lost royalty.
