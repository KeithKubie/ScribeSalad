case Brown lock it's not like random

00:58:25.070 --> 00:58:25.080
case Brown lock it's not like random
 

00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:27.710

good point yeah I think it's a

00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:27.720
good point yeah I think it's a
 

00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:30.710
good point yeah I think it's a
combination of you probably you were you

00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:30.720
combination of you probably you were you
 

00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:31.910
combination of you probably you were you
said you were holding it in you're

00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920
said you were holding it in you're
 

00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:35.630

probably drinking coffee yeah and you
 

00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:40.990
probably drinking coffee yeah and you
know maybe maybe the a little bit of

00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:41.000

Livius Neal Brown Locke I went to a

00:58:53.690 --> 00:58:53.700
Livius Neal Brown Locke I went to a
 

00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:56.900

00:58:59.369 --> 00:59:02.330
shower and I had a lot of different bean
varieties and I think that may have

00:59:02.330 --> 00:59:02.340

coffee makes a different holding it in

00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:12.359
coffee makes a different holding it in
 

00:59:12.359 --> 00:59:14.330
coffee makes a different holding it in
I think the holding it in was really

00:59:14.330 --> 00:59:14.340
I think the holding it in was really
 

00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:16.040
I think the holding it in was really
what you're saying is yeah it's a

00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:16.050
what you're saying is yeah it's a
 

00:59:16.050 --> 00:59:17.480
what you're saying is yeah it's a
combination of things holding it in is

00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:17.490
combination of things holding it in is
 

00:59:17.490 --> 00:59:20.150
combination of things holding it in is
gonna make it worse wait but why is the

00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160
gonna make it worse wait but why is the
 

00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:22.880
gonna make it worse wait but why is the
wipe it wasn't diarrhea so why was the

00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:22.890
wipe it wasn't diarrhea so why was the
 

00:59:22.890 --> 00:59:27.140
wipe it wasn't diarrhea so why was the
wipes so unclean that's like I'm serious

00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:27.150
wipes so unclean that's like I'm serious
 

00:59:27.150 --> 00:59:30.560

00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:34.650
Mooji you didn't have just normal logs
 

00:59:34.650 --> 00:59:36.020
Mooji you didn't have just normal logs
right no you couldn't have

00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:36.030
right no you couldn't have
 

00:59:36.030 --> 00:59:39.320
right no you couldn't have
they were fours they were perfect I mean

00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:39.330
they were fours they were perfect I mean
 

00:59:39.330 --> 00:59:40.940
they were fours they were perfect I mean
ORS are perfect

00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:40.950
ORS are perfect
 

00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:44.060
ORS are perfect
is perfect logs they were a little

00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:44.070
is perfect logs they were a little
 

00:59:44.070 --> 00:59:46.720
is perfect logs they were a little
hotter than normal but I don't know but

00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:46.730
hotter than normal but I don't know but
 

00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:51.500
hotter than normal but I don't know but
yeah they're an exemplary for like if

00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:51.510
yeah they're an exemplary for like if
 

00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:53.000
yeah they're an exemplary for like if
you kind of look at this they were a

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:53.010
you kind of look at this they were a
 

00:59:53.010 --> 00:59:54.890
you kind of look at this they were a
little hotter and a little more torn

00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:54.900
little hotter and a little more torn
 

00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:57.260
little hotter and a little more torn
yeah but that heat is means that they

00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:57.270
yeah but that heat is means that they
 

00:59:57.270 --> 00:59:59.690
yeah but that heat is means that they
weren't perfect because perfect ones

00:59:59.690 --> 00:59:59.700
weren't perfect because perfect ones
 

00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:02.930
weren't perfect because perfect ones
aren't hot hot indicates that it's a

01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:02.940
aren't hot hot indicates that it's a
 

01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:05.030
aren't hot hot indicates that it's a
little higher up on that scale you're

01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.040
little higher up on that scale you're
 

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.650
little higher up on that scale you're
probably looking at like a 5 and a 5 and

01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:06.660
probably looking at like a 5 and a 5 and
 

01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:09.140
probably looking at like a 5 and a 5 and
a half they weren't broken pieces they

01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:09.150
a half they weren't broken pieces they
 

01:00:09.150 --> 01:00:11.480
a half they weren't broken pieces they
were solid yeah but if their heaters

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:11.490
were solid yeah but if their heaters
 

01:00:11.490 --> 01:00:14.030
were solid yeah but if their heaters
like that that means something's up that

01:00:14.030 --> 01:00:14.040
like that that means something's up that
 

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:16.099
like that that means something's up that
you know you can always tell the heat

01:00:16.099 --> 01:00:16.109
you know you can always tell the heat
 

01:00:16.109 --> 01:00:21.140
you know you can always tell the heat
factor means this is not 100% and I

01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:21.150
factor means this is not 100% and I
 

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:22.849
factor means this is not 100% and I
think it probably has to do with the

01:00:22.849 --> 01:00:22.859
think it probably has to do with the
 

01:00:22.859 --> 01:00:25.400
think it probably has to do with the
fact that you were having a lot of

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:25.410
fact that you were having a lot of
 

01:00:25.410 --> 01:00:27.710

you're saying that the log was a little
hot and torn and that's why it just

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:08.490
hot and torn and that's why it just
 

01:01:08.490 --> 01:01:11.210
hot and torn and that's why it just
wouldn't break clean because of the

01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:11.220
wouldn't break clean because of the
 

01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:13.849
