00:00:01.802 --> 00:00:03.745
- [Voiceover] So now I wanna
talk a little bit about

00:00:03.745 --> 00:00:05.745
the concept of Feedback.

00:00:06.746 --> 00:00:09.643
This is a, this is a
really important concept.

00:00:09.643 --> 00:00:13.640
It was developed in the 1920s,
the idea of using Feedback,

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.485
and it was done at, at Bell Labs,

00:00:15.485 --> 00:00:17.818
Bell Telephone Laboratories.

00:00:20.352 --> 00:00:22.820
Remember we talked about
this on the op amp,

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.019
this being the, the non-inverting input,

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:29.282
so if this voltage went
up, this voltage went up,

00:00:29.282 --> 00:00:32.098
and the negative sign
is the inverting input,

00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:34.401
so these, these voltage here and here,

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:36.601
move in opposite directions.

00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:38.450
And the key to understanding
what Feedback is,

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.354
is to pay attention to
this inversion path,

00:00:41.354 --> 00:00:43.689
and these non-inverting paths.

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:46.442
We're gonna start over
here with just isolating

00:00:46.442 --> 00:00:48.243
the voltage divider part of our circuit,

00:00:48.243 --> 00:00:50.493
so that's copied over here.

00:00:56.305 --> 00:00:58.729
And when you think about,
let's look at what happens

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:00.146
if V out goes up.

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:03.129
And what happens to V minus in this case?

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.545
Well V minus goes in what
direction in a voltage divider?

00:01:06.545 --> 00:01:07.462
It goes up.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.561
So this is a, this is a
non-inverting structure.

00:01:12.561 --> 00:01:15.753
If V out goes up, then the
thing we care about V minus,

00:01:15.753 --> 00:01:17.161
goes up as well.

00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:21.328
And likewise if V out goes
down, then V minus goes down.

00:01:24.426 --> 00:01:26.201
So that's isolating
just on this part of it,

00:01:26.201 --> 00:01:29.379
we have no inversion
happening around here.

00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:30.721
So we go around here now, and let's look

00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:33.089
at what happens on this path here,

00:01:33.089 --> 00:01:37.089
if we go up in V in, then
we know V out goes up.

00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:43.165
If we then change colors
to, let's try this.

00:01:44.482 --> 00:01:46.065
If V minus goes up,

00:01:47.948 --> 00:01:49.649
then V out goes down.

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.816
That's the inverting path.

00:01:52.697 --> 00:01:54.881
So there's, so there's one
inversion in this circuit,

00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:57.877
and it happens right here
where V minus goes to V out,

00:01:57.877 --> 00:02:01.009
so that's where the inversion is.

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.849
So now let me set up
just an example circuit.

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:05.932
We'll set R1 equal to R2.

00:02:10.465 --> 00:02:13.529
And from the last video, we
developed a gain expression,

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:17.696
and we said that V out
equals R1 plus R2, over R2,

00:02:23.516 --> 00:02:27.683
times V in, and with these,
with these resistor values,

00:02:29.908 --> 00:02:32.241
V out equals two times V in.

00:02:35.733 --> 00:02:39.483
Alright, so this is
equal to, two times V in.

00:02:42.047 --> 00:02:43.736
And what does that make this point here?

00:02:43.736 --> 00:02:46.108
V minus, this is V minus,

00:02:46.108 --> 00:02:49.457
and from our voltage divider,
we know a voltage divider

00:02:49.457 --> 00:02:52.790
says that V minus equals V out times R2,

00:02:57.351 --> 00:02:59.934
which is just R, over R plus R,

00:03:03.914 --> 00:03:06.747
or V minus equals one-half, V out.

00:03:10.205 --> 00:03:12.506
So, we have let's put a,

00:03:12.506 --> 00:03:14.938
let's put a voltage on here.

00:03:14.938 --> 00:03:16.241
Let's put a real voltage on here.

00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:19.491
Let's say this is at one volt, alright?

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:21.777
And going through our amplifier,

00:03:21.777 --> 00:03:24.777
we know that V out equals two volts,

00:03:25.896 --> 00:03:29.633
and that means that V minus
equals one-half of V out,

00:03:29.633 --> 00:03:31.550
so V minus is one volt.

00:03:32.491 --> 00:03:34.574
So this is one volt here.

00:03:37.233 --> 00:03:39.288
So let's say for the moment,

00:03:39.288 --> 00:03:40.757
that something happens to the circuit,

00:03:40.757 --> 00:03:42.874
like we heated up or something like that,

00:03:42.874 --> 00:03:47.153
and let's say the gain
goes up a little bit.

00:03:47.153 --> 00:03:48.553
Now what that means is,

00:03:48.553 --> 00:03:51.585
that this amplifier, which is amplifying

00:03:51.585 --> 00:03:53.971
this voltage difference right here,

00:03:53.971 --> 00:03:55.213
is gonna be a little higher,

00:03:55.213 --> 00:03:59.193
so the voltage here is
gonna go up a little bit.

00:03:59.193 --> 00:04:00.943
Let's use this color.

00:04:02.001 --> 00:04:04.553
It goes up a little bit,

00:04:04.553 --> 00:04:06.628
and that means that this output voltage

00:04:06.628 --> 00:04:09.046
is gonna go up a little bit.

00:04:09.046 --> 00:04:12.080
And we already decided from
looking at this voltage divider,

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.161
that if this point goes up,
that this point will go up.

00:04:16.161 --> 00:04:17.375
It goes up half as much, but it,

00:04:17.375 --> 00:04:19.797
it goes in the up direction.

00:04:19.797 --> 00:04:22.041
When this voltage goes up, that means

00:04:22.041 --> 00:04:24.833
this voltage goes up, and
now we find ourselves,

00:04:24.833 --> 00:04:26.729
we're at the inverting input.

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:29.665
We're at the inverting
input to the amplifier,

00:04:29.665 --> 00:04:30.529
and that means what?

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:34.206
When a change at the
inverting input goes up,

00:04:34.206 --> 00:04:37.486
that means the output goes down.

00:04:37.486 --> 00:04:39.025
And that's in the opposite direction

00:04:39.025 --> 00:04:41.348
of the original change.

00:04:41.348 --> 00:04:43.465
So this is the mechanism of Feedback.

00:04:43.465 --> 00:04:44.986
A went up a little bit.

00:04:44.986 --> 00:04:47.726
We thought that V out would go up a bit,

00:04:47.726 --> 00:04:49.666
which meant this point goes up,

00:04:49.666 --> 00:04:53.657
which meant it gets fed back to the input,

00:04:53.657 --> 00:04:55.041
to the inverting input,

00:04:55.041 --> 00:04:56.499
and then it goes back down,

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:59.305
and this balancing act
that's going on right here,

00:04:59.305 --> 00:05:03.472
that is the mechanism, that
is what we call Feedback.

00:05:04.321 --> 00:05:06.058
You get this Feedback effect,

00:05:06.058 --> 00:05:08.077
when this connection is made right here,

00:05:08.077 --> 00:05:10.465
back to the inverting
input, to the op amp.

00:05:10.465 --> 00:05:13.105
And in particular, because
it's the inverting input,

00:05:13.105 --> 00:05:15.855
this is called Negative Feedback.

00:05:23.444 --> 00:05:25.275
So this is the mechanism of Feedback,

00:05:25.275 --> 00:05:27.757
in particular, Negative Feedback and,

00:05:27.757 --> 00:05:29.329
what it does for us is,

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:32.226
it provides us a way
to exploit and to use,

00:05:32.226 --> 00:05:35.033
this enormous gain that
these amplifiers have,

00:05:35.033 --> 00:05:39.200
to create really stable, really
nicely controlled circuits,

00:05:40.369 --> 00:05:42.939
that are controlled by the
values of the components

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:46.022
we attached to the, to the amplifier.

00:05:47.932 --> 00:05:49.177
So that's the idea of Feedback,

00:05:49.177 --> 00:05:51.153
a really powerful idea,

00:05:51.153 --> 00:05:54.936
and really at the heart
of analog electronics.
