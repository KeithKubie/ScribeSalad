00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.560
 All of us were exposed to wounds on our fingers or anywhere else on 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.320
 Our bodies, and immediately that part of the body gets a bit 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:16.219
 From redness, a bit of swelling, maybe some heat 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.800
 Of course, there will be some pain that accompanies 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.040
 What is happening there 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.150
 In general, this group of symptoms we passed 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.370
 They are known as inflammatory response, or you can 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.220
 Say that there are some infections you get there 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.670
 People have known about this, I think, really 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.230
 Since they were injured 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.250
 I think maybe with modern medicine, they become people 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.030
 More accurate about the classification of symptoms 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.640
 But this is nothing new to someone 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.880
 To say that there is a type of inflammation gets or 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.380
 Type of inflammatory response 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.080
 But what I want to do in this video is to understand what 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.330
 Cause these - I think we can call them (Macrosystems) 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.130
 What happens at the cellular level? 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.480
 Because, in fact, for an inflammatory response 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.140
 Are mainly the primary field of battle 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.530
 For our immune system 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.090
 Our first line of defense is our skin or fluid on 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.360
 Extra skin or mucous membranes, however 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.070
 The inflammatory response is what happens when there is something 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.780
 Beyond that 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.870
 When we get a hole from a nail, or there is a kind of virus 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.000
 Or bacteria that go beyond skin or mucus 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.250
 Surrounds our membranes 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.950
 So please .. 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.160
 This is the battlefield, especially 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.830
 The initial field of motion 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.940
 So we prepare for the battle of immunity so we can see exactly 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.000
 What happens with the inflammatory response 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.050
 I want to be very clear 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.830
 Immunology is still an incomprehensible science 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.400
 It is an effective field of research 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.520
 People are still discovering mechanisms 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.270
 It is very complex 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.520
 I'm sure we probably will study this 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.550
 For a long time to come 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.250
 So, what I'm talking about is just an overview 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.700
 Just to know the public actors, you know in general 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.760
 What causes redness, swelling, 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.030
 Heat and pain 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.855
 So let me paint some skin cells 

00:02:05.855 --> 00:02:09.070
 So, to say that these skin cells 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.889
 This is the total simplification 

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:13.820
 For everything, but they really only give an idea of ​​what 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.900
 Being 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.420
 So I will draw a cross section 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.210
 If these are some skin cells in it, then I will b ... 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.190
 If this is the outside world here 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.120
 Outside world 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.770
 Then between these skin cells, I will draw some other cells 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:28.820
 We will talk about what they are doing 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.340
 I will not go into huge details about it 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.410
 Let us call this cell mast cells here 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.260
 I will draw more mast cells 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.110
 Maybe another one here 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.500
 This is a fat cell 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.500
 If you remember the videos about the work of the cell or bug 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.480
 Phagocytosis, you will remember that there is one type called 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.710
 Stem cells, they tend to appear near the skin 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.430
 Appear near the areas you are facing 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.380
 Outside world 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.640
 So I will draw two stem cells and these 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.680
 Also good at 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.550
 Activation of auxiliary cells 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:11.480
 Maybe I'll draw another stem cell here .. Here it is, this stem cell 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.370
 These are called stem cells 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.450
 They have nothing to do with the nervous system 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.440
 It looks like it has ramifications for it 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.170
 They call it radical, but it is actually corrosive 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.800
 They are near the exterior facades 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.530
 The parts are ingested and are good at displaying those parts 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.150
 For T cells help .. until they are activated 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.870
 The alarm bells are struck. 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.870
 So the skin is normal and works happily. 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.290
 This is the outer part. 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.170
 Here is the fluid that is distributed between tissues 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.200
 .. 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.740
 This is the luxurious name of the liquid carrier of good cells 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.220
 Surrounded by other cells. 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.350
 The cells do not direct directly 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.530
 To the circulatory system 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.190
 Oxygen goes from circulation to 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.240
 Fluid between cells Finally 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.250
 To cells .. 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.380
 So everything is directed to the bristles .. but 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.560
 The capillaries play a role in blood circulation. 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.470
 So let me draw this .. 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.815
 Instead of just painting it as a pipe .. I will 

00:04:08.815 --> 00:04:11.360
 Draw cells in circulation 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.130
 this is 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.670
 Are the cells lining the circulatory system 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.310
 Actually, cells are making walls 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.560
 For capillaries 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:32.100
 .. 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.490
 This is a cross-sectional drawing 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.410
 And he painted it as a pipe. 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.420
 It does not look like scraps. 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.940
 Actually .. are pipes 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.040
 Everything appears in a cross-section 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:55.160
 These are wall and vessel cells 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.850
 This, of course, is the flowing blood 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.460
 It has red blood cells 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.315
 .. 

00:05:03.315 --> 00:05:04.600
 These are red blood cells 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.050
 And seems to be heading for that direction 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.390
 In this aspect, cells are oxidized. 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.250
 These arteries to carry the oxygenated cells, and veins in the case of the cells otherwise 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.580
 Through loss of oxygen. 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.950
 Of course you may have white blood cells 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.470
 Inside you .. much less than the red number 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.580
 But only to make sure they are in your blood cycle. 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.940
 It moves according to the circulatory system 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.640
 Which the heart pump work in it. 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.500
 Under natural conditions .. 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.210
 Gas exchange occurs between 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.020
 Blood cells in the circulatory system and intracellular fluid 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.140
 And some of the exchange of cells and proteins 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.950
 We will now look at how this happens 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.090
 If we get an outsider 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.430
 For example, a person takes a nail and sticks it into a bovine fertilizer 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.170
 And sting him. 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:51.420
 To see what will happen 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:57.730
 .. 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.100
 If someone sticks that nail in you 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.370
 After stitches in that manure 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:07.570
 Of course the screw became polluted 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.730
 It carries a bunch of bacteria 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.240
 Which were filled with manure 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.000
 He did not choose the manure for no reason 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.920
 It carries a large amount of bacteria 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.720
 Once you touch the first line of defense of your immune system 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.310
 In the first entry through his skin 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.830
 Some things will inevitably happen 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.740
 The bacteria will start in 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.860
 Resurfacing within the liquid surrounding the cells 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.310
 Which touched the bacteria .. 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:33.570
 Maybe also .. Some cells have been eliminated. 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.990
 And some of the skin cells as well 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.860
 Skin cells begin directly in the secretion 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.120
 Some chemicals. 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.530
 this Materials 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.520
 They are considered transportation vehicles 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.360
 News about the exposure of some cells 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.970
 To the infection of these exotic organisms .. First: the surrounding fluid 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.890
 Something happened to me. 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:54.140
 These materials are called chemical transporters 

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.560
 .. 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.960
 It is a general word that actually means 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.110
 Small molecules or proteins produced by cells 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.570
 As a type of coding signals. 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:10.170
 "Chemical vectors" is a word consisting of two parts 

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:11.560
 She works as a "reporter" 

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.460
 They are moving. 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.790
 So these substances are excreted. 

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:17.120
 It's enormously complicated. 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.840
 So, what I'm doing now is very high-level information. 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.970
 There are many types of "vector" polarizers. 

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.160
 And also we have these mast cells here, and this mast 

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.570
 It can be activated by possibly direct contact with 

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:27.440
 Rusty nail. 

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.150
 Can be exported from excreted polarizers 

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.500
 Of these cells. 

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.460
 Some of the particles can be released from 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:36.870
 Actual bacteria. 

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:40.800
 These bacteria are also excreted by different derivatives 

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.350
 As soon as the body enters. 

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:48.020
 Any of the above can activate the mast cells 

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.440
 Hence, those mast cells secrete histamine. 

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:56.880
 .. 

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.910
 You can now appreciate the high level of information 

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.280
 It's really complicated though 

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.870
 I think you become familiar with the subject. 

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:07.270
 If the word "histamine" is vague to you, it is not new 

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:11.040
 Maybe because you've had an anti-histamine one day .. 

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.800
 Perhaps in the past few months, 

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.240
 Especially during the cold season. 

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.590
 Histamine type is one of the main actors in 

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:20.840
 Inflammatory response, and when you have a cold .. 

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.760
 Gonorrhea, nasal obstruction, and similar symptoms 

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:29.950
 These are all deposits of inflammatory response. 

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:32.880
 Antihistamines are mainly used to mask 

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.000
 The symptoms respond without stopping their action. 

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.490
 But the question arises: Is it necessarily necessary? 

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:39.419
 Is it always a good thing? 

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:41.539
 Because, as I continue to talk about in this video, that is 

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:42.880
 First line of defense. 

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.690
 This is the first part of our immune system battle. 

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:49.330
 But anyway, so the histamine is one of the things that 

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:54.460
 It does it go to the lining cells 

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:58.750
 Of the capillaries, causing them to be separated away 

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:03.400
 From each other and make the actual capillaries bigger. 

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.650
 This is called vasodilation. 

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:15.560
 .. 

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.960
 Suppose all of them have been activated with a little bit 

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.210
 Of histamine. 

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:23.680
 .. 

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.910
 Histamine has been attended, so .. 

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:27.110
 The cells moved away from each other. 

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:29.130
 And go further and further 

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:30.400
 Until capillaries become larger than they are 

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:35.810
 .. 

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:38.780
 So you happen to have swelling, because 

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.370
 Suddenly, the capillary tubes grew larger and more flexible 

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:44.110
 In fact, it returns to its normal size with time 

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.780
 The liquid is encouraged to assemble around. 

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.190
 This is called "vasodilation" 

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:52.960
 Another fancy word to describe 

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.470
 Increased volume of capillaries 

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:55.420
 She grows up .. 

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.420
 The liquid fills them. 

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.900
 Not only liquid, but 

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.830
 More red blood cells also. 

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:06.580
 There is a lot of fluid here, and white blood cells too 

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.400
 As porosity of the walls of capillaries increased. 

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.820
 Suddenly, all the parts that could not pass through the bristles previously 

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.280
 You will be able to pass now easily. 

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.810
 And one of those things that will be easier passed 

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:18.750
 During them - and again, remember, all 

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.210
 Other things happen. 

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:24.400
 Hystamine is submerged in these 

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.350
 The lining cells are probably some of them 

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:27.340
 Blood entry. 

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:31.530
 These polarizers are excreted from nearby cells 

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:32.920
 Of damage. 

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.550
 Green parts 

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:38.870
 Are produced by viruses 

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:41.330
 You have polarizers, which are blue. 

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:44.820
 They all come out here. 

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:48.600
 So the first responders, the macrophages, especially 

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.590
 And then neutrophils, which are the most abundant of 

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.510
 Phagocytes, "subclass of white blood cells", and they 

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:56.730
 These chemicals are attracted to. 

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.760
 They want to move in the direction of those 

00:10:58.760 --> 00:10:59.660
 Chemicals. 

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:03.800
 Now that the vacuum between these capillary cells increases 

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.440
 They can pass through the walls of poetry. 

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.855
 So what they are actually doing - let's say this 

00:11:08.855 --> 00:11:10.105
 Of neutrophils 

00:11:10.105 --> 00:11:13.980
 .. 

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:17.530
 Begin to roll over the walls 

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:18.430
 .. 

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:19.330
 Which is called proximity. 

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:23.310
 And roll up 

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:24.600
 Stick to the wall. 

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.610
 They stick to the wall, and then eventually press 

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:32.650
 Through these gaps in the wall capillaries. 

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:36.220
 This is called leakage. 

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.110
 Sometimes it is called emigration. 

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:39.800
 These are all luxury words, but basically mean 

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.920
 Pressing the walls. 

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.620
 These are neutrophils 

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.270
 Hence, of course, due to vasodilation, 

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:48.120
 Where neutrophils will leave here 

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.800
 Exactly where it is needed. 

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.090
 These neutrophils will move here and there 

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:52.870
 Will do its job. 

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:55.810
 They are going to swallow some of these bacteria 

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:57.330
 Start to eat up, maybe even some 

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:59.240
 Damaged cells here. 

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.460
 This is what you want to happen. 

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:01.860
 That's why it's called the battlefield. 

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.310
 At the same time, your cross-sectional cells, 

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:08.430
 And other phagocytes, will eat up viruses and so on 

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:10.530
 It exists on its surface. 

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:12.980
 And it is not just the neutrophils that come here. 

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:17.240
 For this is a place to be consumed and all this 

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:21.410
 Liquid is gathered here, you will also have B cells and 

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:24.180
 T cells help that will also make their way. 

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:27.840
 They will also get close to the walls, where they are 

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:32.130
 They are rolling too .. 

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:35.900
 They leak 

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.670
 And act and do 

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:39.490
 Specific immune system. 

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:41.840
 That's the whole point here. 

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.730
 This is the reason why the video delays the inflammatory response 

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:49.440
 Because it is not a simple thing. 

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.830
 It is actually a battlefield where all actors are 

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.400
 Come play its role, even the first line to defend your skin, 

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.480
 All actors, 

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.610
 The inflammatory response is usually categorized 

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:02.520
 Not specific because it will occur regardless of anything 

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.450
 But you have non-specific actors like 

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:06.320
 Neutrophils. 

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:11.600
 And the immune system identified as your B cells and T cells 

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.890
 You also have an unspecified supplemental system. 

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:15.580
 I will not go into details here, but you have 

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:19.990
 Some of the proteins that flow in your blood plasma that 

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:23.650
 Usually in an inactive state, but when infections occur 

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:27.050
 A response occurs, .. These proteins usually act 

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:29.940
 (This process is not explained 100% so far) 

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.490
 After activating the sniff 

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:35.600
 These are derivations 

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:41.070
 Very helpful in helping too 

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.770
 Many killed 

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:44.970
 Bacteria in this case. 

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:46.990
 This is the supplementary system .. 

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:49.600
 It's really just a group of proteins that 

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.070
 Floating in the blood .. and form a defensive line the first good 

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:57.950
 Unspecified against certain harmful objects that invade our bodies 

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:02.470
 So hopefully this gives you a good sense of what is going on 

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:04.410
 In the inflammatory response. 

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.670
 As you can imagine, you have all those fluids that flow 

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:09.210
 And all that blood that flows here. 

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:13.180
 You have all of these fluids .. 

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.280
 And those cells that move from capillaries to 

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.960
 Ambient fluid means entering the inside 

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.990
 This fluid is called "secretions". 

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:23.800
 .. 

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.010
 So this whole thing is about swelling and redness 

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:30.180
 Therefore, this is what you notice with your naked eye 

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.970
 Of symptoms. 

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.550
 Anyway, we hope that what we have provided has been useful to you ..
