00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.200
Is organizing therapeutic for you?

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.120
Are you a messy person who likes to organize?

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.980
Join the club

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.960
As strange as it sounds, it is possible

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.160
Messiness and laziness might go hand in hand

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.220
But they also might be having an impact

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.720
on your mental and physical health

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.580
Enter a messy room

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.080
and you'll be sure to find objects

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.600
cluttered all over the place

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.420
Like it's a garage sale instead of a living room

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.080
A messy habitat can affect you so badly

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.600
your sleep is negatively impacted

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.960
living you stressed out

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.560
When you get to this point,

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.540
What can you do?

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.980
Organize of course

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.260
Organizing and putting things in place

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.300
can be therapeutic.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.260
It helps you zone out for a while

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.620
and allows for some much needed silence for your mind.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.980
As a result,

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:52.920
your sleep becomes better

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.160
and your stress level decrease.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.660
According to some studies,

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.960
having too much of a mess around us

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.980
bombards our senses with excessive stimuli

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.960
This in turn, increases our inability to relax

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.340
because of our constant elevated stress levels.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.840
The natural decline of cortisol,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.780
the hormone that controls stress is hindered.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.740
Our stress is an important part of our daily lives

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.080
because it keeps us alert.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.220
Too much of it leaves us unable to relax

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.940
or sleep properly at the end of the day.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.420
While this is all well and good

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.800
for the messy people of the world

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.880
what if you're a neat person

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.720
who's experiencing stress?

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:26.960
You don't have to be a messy person

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.140
to use organizing as a form of relaxation.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.760
Organizing doesn't have to mean cleaning.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.740
For example,

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.160
think of reorganizing a bookshelf.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.600
Doing so could be as satisfying as cleaning the entire room.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.840
It could also be a way of feeling in control

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.260
of your surroundings, activities or more.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.400
According to research done in a field of occupational health,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.900
you experience less stress when

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.520
you feel you have control over your work.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.140
In the age we live in, it's a great achievement to be in control.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.000
Also, organizing doesn't always have to pertain

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.320
to higher bedroom lux

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.100
you can gain a sense of control

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.040
by organizing your calendar for the next month,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.580
right down to the tiniest detail

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.780
Rearranging your closet or organizing your school notes.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.280
The recurring factor is instilling order.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.100
Which the human brain is wired to respond positively to.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.680
It's easier for our brains to deal with order.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.340
Enabling us to take better care of

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.880
other aspects of our lives.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.920
A great way to reduce anxiety or stress before you sleep,

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.460
is to organize things that are important to remember.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.020
If you find you cant sleep,

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.580
you could try writing a to-do list for the next day.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.340
or, arranging your school books according to size or class.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.660
These activities are effective because

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.920
they help you relax, and stop you

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.900
from worrying of what's keeping you awake.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.400
It's easier to sleep better after organizing

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.760
instead of trying to just fall asleep when you're stressed.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.860
Simply put,

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.220
it's easier to sleep when you have a sense of control.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.460
Symmetry, patterns and similarities are things

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.460
the brain recognizes and feels aesthetically pleased towards.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.640
By organizing and putting things in order,

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.920
you'll feel a sense of familiarity and calmness.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.440
Resulting in pleasing you and your mind.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.000
If you enjoy organizing and have always wondered why it helped you relax,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.320
we hope this video explained why.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.340
Even you don't relate to this,

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.980
try it out for yourself and see if there are benefits.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.280
Do you like to organize things to help you relax?
