00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.340
So I was at a friend's house warming party a few months ago

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.840
and I get really anxious when I'm in a situation where I don't know a lot of people very well.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.540
So I do what a lot of us do. I drink.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.300
So tell me about yourself.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.740
Uh . . . well . . .

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.740
*Ding*

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.180
Whoa, how many cats do you have?

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.380
Six cats really isn't that many, it's not . . .

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.000
*Ding*

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.920
I don't like you.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.780
Oh, okay.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.040
No, I, I'll still take it

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.000
I probably need it now more than ever.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.580
*Ding*

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.820
And I know I shouldn't, but I can't help it because when someone says:

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.380
Yo Anna, do you want another shot?

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.320
I hear:

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.560
Yo Anna, are you fun?

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.720
*Ping*

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.340
and though party was super fun, and everyone was really great.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.280
I kind of ended up going past the knowledge of my limit.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.140
You know what I'm talking about, right?

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.300
You know your own alcohol limit for a 100 pound 27 year old woman

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.480
it's usually about two. When you go beyond this limit the knowledge of your limits lies completely out the window.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.480
I may be drunk right now.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.740
So of course I had to throw up.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.620
I have to throw up.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.680
Okay Anna,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.700
just find a tree or a trash can or a sew- oh wait...

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.120
Oh wait, do sewers go back to the ocean?

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.080
Cause I don't want to throw up on dolphins.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.360
WARNING

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.580
You are in the middle of the street at night.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.320
Get the fuck up. I repeat, get the fuck up.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.700
Holy fuck, holy shitball, omg, get up.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.780
Get the fuck inside, I repeat, get the fuck inside.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.040
I feel really lucky that my body's innate sense of fear of the night, strangers and potential harm woke me up.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.000
Because who knows how long I would have been passed out on the street.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.849
I mean, maybe my friend would have eventually come looking for me,

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:05.660
but who knows what could have happened before then.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.520
I mean honestly can you recall any time in your life when you passed out

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.660
and then woke up and something great occurred?

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.660
I'm sure this is a lesson we all learn eventually right?

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.060
To know your limits, to hydrate between shots...

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.420
The unfortunate thing is I think some people black out and have to learn this lesson again and again and again.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.420
But if there's any lesson, that's stuck with me, it's: "Don't pass out in the street!"

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.920
At home? Fine.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.940
At a friend's house? Fine.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.360
On the toilet? Not ideal, but fine.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.000
