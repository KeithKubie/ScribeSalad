KIMBERLY NICHOLE: So that's
a new tune Brad Williams

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.430
and myself wrote.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.730
It's called "Shade of Blues."

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.380
It's an ode to my hometown
of Seattle, Washington.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.662
Yeah, it's two of [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:27.662 --> 00:03:29.020
I think there's two of us here.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.470
Two black people from
Seattle in the house.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.130
We represent the percentage, 2%.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.510
Hello.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.010
So, yeah.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.093
Seattle means a lot to me.

00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:40.319
So when Brad and I
got together-- god,

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:41.110
when was that Brad?

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.339
Earlier this year?

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:44.130
Yeah, a couple months
ago, we got together.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.150
And I was like, you know Brad?

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.320
I really want to
do something that's

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.780
in tribute to my hometown,
the Grunge Movement and all

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.940
that good stuff.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.590
May I curse tonight?

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.020
Am I able to curse-- oh, good.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.872
Shit.

00:03:54.872 --> 00:03:56.390
It's hard for me not to.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.060
But so, I wanted to do a
song in ode to-- Seattle

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.490
has meant a great deal to
my development and evolution

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:03.230
as an artist.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.140
So I definitely wanted my
new music to reflect that.

This is a new one.

And Brad and I, we had
the pleasure of recording

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.370
this like, a couple weeks ago
with a live band and stuff.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.037
Have you guys recorded
with a live band?

00:04:25.037 --> 00:04:26.036
I mean, it's everything.

00:04:26.036 --> 00:04:27.000
Like, old school time.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.886
Like, I was really
in the booth singing

00:04:28.886 --> 00:04:30.010
while the band was playing.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.134
Like, it was the real deal.

00:04:31.134 --> 00:04:32.902
OK, hello.

00:04:32.902 --> 00:04:34.610
And we record it on
tape, didn't we Brad?

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:35.840

00:04:49.934 --> 00:04:52.590
But look.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.160
We recorded the last song
I sang, "Shade of Blues,"

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.580
and this one a few weeks ago.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.970
It sounds incredible.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.880
So when I scurry up the funds
to mix that motherfucker,

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.505
you guys will probably hear it.

So I wrote this song
with my two good friends.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.320
The Scottish Freddie Stevenson
and the young man from Georgia.

And we wrote this one day
in the Upper West Side

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.526
in an apartment.

00:05:25.526 --> 00:05:26.775
We had a little Grand Marnier.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.340

that song is, let's just

and we were very small,

and we were precious,
and sweet, and innocent.

all the time on the radio,

and we loved this song,
and we'd always sing it.

hit the notes when I was young.

from? [LAUGHING].

KIMBERLY NICHOLE: I was born and
raised in Seattle, Washington.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:33.720
And I grew up listening to the
music my parents played when

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.700
I was a child, which was
majority gospel music and soul

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:37.600
music.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:41.810
But I was also really like,
into the music of Seattle,

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.730
which was grunge and rock.

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:46.730

into who I am today.

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:09.344

inspire you growing up?

Sisters when I was a kid.

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:18.700
I really loved them.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:23.880
I think my mom kind of catered
my voice towards those that I

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.380
resembled, so she
really encouraged

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:28.210
me a lot of times to listen
to like, Gladys Knight.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:31.430
And even if I got older, Sade.

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:33.740
But currently, those
who really inspire

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:36.440
me are more so like The Doors,
Jim Morrison, Sister Rosetta

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:40.380

been inspiring me lately.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:45.570

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.317
Ginger, a lot of
ginger, and carrots.

00:19:27.317 --> 00:19:28.150
RYAN LOREN: Carrots.

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:28.600
Carrots.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:28.870
KIMBERLY NICHOLE: Yes.

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:30.140
That's my favorite juice.

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.223
RYAN LOREN: Have you ever
been on a juice cleanse?

00:19:32.223 --> 00:19:35.490
KIMBERLY NICHOLE: I've
tried, but the chicken

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:36.722
keeps calling me.

00:19:36.722 --> 00:19:37.597
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING].

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:42.866
AUDIENCE: Speak the truth.

00:19:42.866 --> 00:19:44.307
KIMBERLY NICHOLE: Yes, honey.

00:19:44.307 --> 00:19:44.890
I like to eat.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:48.930
RYAN LOREN: Great.

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:50.790
Well, that's wonderful.

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:53.990
So can you tell us one
thing maybe outside

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:57.257
of music and juicing that
you're passionate about.

00:19:57.257 --> 00:19:58.590
KIMBERLY NICHOLE: I love my dog.

00:19:58.590 --> 00:19:59.734
I have a puppy.

00:19:59.734 --> 00:20:00.650
Her name is Hendricks.

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:01.274
RYAN LOREN: OK.

00:20:01.274 --> 00:20:01.775
Hendricks.

00:20:01.775 --> 00:20:03.149
KIMBERLY NICHOLE:
That's my baby.

00:20:03.149 --> 00:20:04.677
I was in LA like,
for three days,

00:20:04.677 --> 00:20:06.010
and I liked, missed her so much.

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:08.269
So that's my partner in crime.

00:20:08.269 --> 00:20:10.060
And next week, we're
going home to Seattle.

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:10.950
So that's my baby.

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:11.790
RYAN LOREN: And she's
accompanying you.

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:12.720
KIMBERLY NICHOLE: Yes.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.362
That's my girl.

00:20:13.362 --> 00:20:14.570
RYAN LOREN: What kind of dog?

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:15.986
KIMBERLY NICHOLE:
She's a Shorkie.

00:20:15.986 --> 00:20:17.410
She's a Shih Tzu and Yorkie mix.

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:17.951
She's a mutt.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.250
RYAN LOREN: I love the fact
that I now know that word.

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:22.790
Shorkie.

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:25.090
All right.

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:26.270
Cool.

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:30.749
So tell us more about your
music and what's coming up.

00:20:30.749 --> 00:20:32.790
KIMBERLY NICHOLE: Well,
I'm working on new music.

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:35.170
I'm so excited about it.

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:37.410
I'm going to do two
songs here today

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:39.760
during the performance piece.

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.620
I'm excited about
how I'm evolving,

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:42.620
what it's sounding like.

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:48.040
It's really inspired largely
from my childhood in Seattle.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.410
So it's straight
ahead rock music.

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:52.320
Like, there's no
sugar coating it.

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.250
It's raw.

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:56.794
It's nasty, and it's rock.

00:20:56.794 --> 00:20:57.790
RYAN LOREN: Good.

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.650
When did you move to New York?

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:03.325
And you've been here
for a little while.

00:21:03.325 --> 00:21:06.690
What is advice you give to
people who have just got here

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:08.760
who are trying to do
what you're trying to do?

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:12.320
KIMBERLY NICHOLE:
I came here in '08.

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.760
I think New York, you
have to be very focused.

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.390
You have to have a
drive in you, and you

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:20.950
have to be persistent,
and just strong-headed

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:23.030
and have a strong will.

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:24.720
Because it can
really eat you up.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.060
Like, I've had moments
where I'm like, I can't.

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:30.583
Jesus, please Lord,
just help me out.

00:21:30.583 --> 00:21:33.970
But if you believe in what
you've come here to accomplish,

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:35.760
you can accomplish it,
but you can't do it

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.760
without having drive
and hard work behind it.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:39.510
RYAN LOREN: Great.

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:42.800
Well, I know you do
have those things based

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.280
on knowing you for
a little while.

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.176
So I'm really happy
to have you here.

00:21:46.176 --> 00:21:47.800
I know great great
things are in store.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.629
And best of luck to you.

00:21:49.629 --> 00:21:51.420
And I'm looking forward
to the performance.

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:52.836
KIMBERLY NICHOLE:
Thank you, Ryan.

00:21:52.836 --> 00:21:53.520
Thank you, guys.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:54.420
AUDIENCE: Woo!

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:55.320
Woo!

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.770
KIMBERLY NICHOLE:
Y'all have a good one.
