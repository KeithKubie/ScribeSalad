00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.100
At this point people have been studying the impacts that humans have had on the world around us for a solid 50 years.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.120
And while it's hard to get a handle on exactly how the choices we make every day affect the environment,

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:15.749
there's no question that our lifestyles, our
cars, our need for more farmland,

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:21.449
and our love of all kinds of plastic stuff are putting the hurt on ecosystems all over the world.

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.360
Human activity all by itself,
just people doing what they do,

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.350
could be responsible for the extinction of
nearly 1000 plant and animal species to dateâ€”

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.100
most of them over the last century.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.010
And even if you don't particularly care about the Barbary lion, or the St. Helena olive, or the passenger pigeon,

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.320
or anything else we've driven into extinction,
the thing is: we need these other organisms.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.440
The ecosystems of the world are working very
hard for us every day,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.800
filtering water, sucking carbon dioxide out
of the air, producing all the food we eat...

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.580
All very important ecosystem services, benefits
that the natural world provides us for free.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:02.579
So having ecosystems and keeping them intact is important not only for the organisms who live in them,

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:09.700
but also for us, the animals who rely on them for thousands and thousands of things that we could never do for ourselves.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.939
Over the next two episodes we're going to
look at these systems

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.739
and how our actions are affecting the ecosystems
that we need for our survival.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.880
Basically we're messing up the environment
six ways from Sunday,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.640
but to make it easy on ourselves, let's start
with the top five.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:31.580
[Theme Music]

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.560
We often hear about all the different ways
that our behavior is affecting the biosphere:

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:41.129
extinctions, climate change, deforestation,
acid rain, desertification, pollution and more!

00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:44.319
But you're asking, "Why are all those things
bad? What is going on?

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.529
How is this stuff turning the Earth into sausage?
I don't understand."

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:51.759
Well, I do understand which is why I'm qualified
to make this video, so let me lay it on you.

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.359
The services that ecosystems provide for us, all the dirty work they do, can be broken up into 4 different categories.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.320
They're things that we could never, ever,
ever duplicate or work around,

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.289
no matter what kind of smarty-pants technology
we come up with.

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.280
First, healthy ecosystems provide support
services that create and replenish the foundation

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.009
of the earth's biological systems.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.540
These services include recycling all of the
compounds that are necessary for life,

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.989
through the carbon, water, nitrogen and phosphorous
cycles.

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.420
They also include other processes we've talked
about before,

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.700
like forming new soils and producing atmospheric
oxygen.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.540
Some ecosystems contribute more to these services
than others,

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.700
but none of them can get these basic jobs
done unless they are intact.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.180
Two: Ecosystems also perform provisioning services, giving us the raw materials we need to live.

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:40.950
Like, the ocean provides food in the form
of fish sticks and stuff.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.160
And rivers and aquifers and other freshwater
sources give us water.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.620
Plants and animals also yield all kinds of
fiber that we use for clothing and shelter.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.150
And all around us we find sources of fuel,

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.320
whether it's biomass in the form of grasses or wood, hydropower in the form of flowing water,

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.900
or the carbon locked in millions-of-years-old trees that we're now re-releasing into the atmosphere.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.460
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.500
Ecosystems also perform super-important regulating
services,

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.519
moderating many of the earth's systems that
can get dangerous if they get out of whack.

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.639
Like as we learned in Biology: fungi and other organisms take on the task of decomposing dead things and poop.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.740
Meanwhile, plants help filter the water you drink and the air you breathe, and provide flood control.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.829
And they also absorb all that carbon you exhale
and that your car belches out,

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.879
which in turn, helps regulate the climate.

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.979
And finally, number four, ecosystems are just
kind of awesome.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.140
It's nice to be surrounded by happy plants
and critters, doing their business.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.600
Nice, robust ecosystems give us places to play, scenes to inspire us, and things to just discover and learn about.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.620
These are their less tangible, but still important
cultural services.

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:44.589
An interesting thing about ecosystem services
is that economists actually can,

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:49.329
and do, calculate the monetary value they
provide for humanity.

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:54.840
If, for example, we had to do all of the things
that ecosystems do for us, it would cost us

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.700
$46 trillion/year.

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.940
Which is a lot, considering that the output
of the global economy is $66 trillion/year.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.999
So, yeah, we should be happy that we don't
have to pay for all that.

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:12.999
But you'll notice that I keep saying that ecosystems can only serve up all this awesome sauce if they are "intact."

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.660
By that I mean they specifically have to have
their biodiversity intact,

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.480
because ecosystems are just a bunch of living
and nonliving things working together,

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.500
so unless their living parts are healthy,
they're basically just rocks and weather.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.610
The main reason biodiversity is
so important is that

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.450
it makes ecosystems more resilient to that never-ending change we talked about a few weeks ago.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:38.460
Ecosystems with high biodiversity are way more resilient to disturbances than those with low biodiversity.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.120
In a high-biodiversity system, if you take one species out of the mix, it's less likely that the ecosystem will collapse.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.380
Take a hectare of Amazonian rainforest:

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.000
in that little patch of land, there are more different species of plants and animals than there are in all of Europe.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.090
So if a species of insect goes extinct, there's less risk that the whole house of cards will fall than, say,

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.560
in the Sonoran Desert, where there are very
few organisms,

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.790
so the disappearance of one species could
affect the entire ecosystem.

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.620
So the best way to understand our impacts on the environment is through how we affect biodiversity.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.280
Unfortunately, it turns out that we've been
doing a really bang-up job of

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.510
endangering some of the highest biodiversity
ecosystems on the planet.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.960
In some cases, we're having impacts on the
organisms themselves directly.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.300
In other cases, we're affecting biodiversity
indirectly, by creating one or two changes

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.390
in that ecosystem that cascade into all kinds
of problems for living things.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.830
First, let's look at that hectare of Amazonian
rainforest again,

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:37.670
because even though it's one of those super-resilient ecosystems, we're having serious impacts on it.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:43.380
How? Well, first by removing a lot of what
makes a forest a forest: trees.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.700
According to some estimates, we're clear-cutting
around 8,000 hectares of trees a day

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.760
to provide land to graze cattle on, and to
harvest wood to make coffee tables or whatever.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.940
When you cut down a hectare of rainforest, suddenly

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:01.160
a place where a few thousand species used to live turns into a place where just a handful of species live:

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.720
some grass, some weeds, maybe some rats or
mice, some insects and, you know, some cows.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.870
Because man, we love cows.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.810
And when you take out so many of the living things on that hectare of land, a bunch of things happen.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.870
For starters, you're not just affecting that
ecosystem, but neighboring ecosystems as well.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.370
For instance, all those trees that were cut
down provided the service of regulating the

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.310
flow of all that rain that rainforests get,

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:27.560
not only by absorbing some of it but also by slowing down runoff, letting the water seep into the soil,

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.390
before slowly making its way into streams
and rivers and ultimately the ocean.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:35.120
But when those trees are gone, the water hits
the land and shoots off in the nearest stream,

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.940
causing erosion and washing minerals and chemicals all the way to the sea, where it affects marine ecosystems.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.550
And when I say "affect," I don't mean in a
good way.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.940
This, my friends, is what's called a cascade
effect, in this case caused by deforestation,

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.780
one of the most obvious, observable human
impacts.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.020
In addition to causing more flooding and changes
in water quality,

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.460
deforestation on a large scale can lead to
another impact:

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.520
desertification, or the spread of dry, unproductive
landscapes.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.750
But cutting down trees doesn't automatically
turn a forest into a desert,

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:09.300
desertification is driven along by additional
factors, like overgrazing by cattle, and over-irrigation.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.520
So how can over-watering something make it
turn into a desert?

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:17.840
Well, when we use groundwater to irrigate crops, the natural salts in the groundwater build up in the soil,

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.940
eventually making it so salty that nothing
wants to live there.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.390
Over time, fertile land near desert ecosystems
becomes overtaxed, and the desert spreads.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:28.160
And this is exactly what has happened in China
over the past century,

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.650
where overgrazing and the cities' unquenchable
thirst for water have caused

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:37.150
the Gobi Desert to grow by 3,600 square kilometers
every year.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:41.810
Now, these two impacts by themselves clearly
limit the biodiversity of otherwise lush ecosystems.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:46.420
But because they also result in fewer trees
that provide the all-important services of

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:52.390
releasing oxygen and absorbing CO2, you know
what domino's gonna fall next: the climate.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:56.500
Carbon dioxide: the principle greenhouse gas.
It insulates the Earth.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:08:00.340
So it stands to reason that the more CO2 there is in the atmosphere, the warmer the earth will be.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.720
And the thing is, we're reducing the size
of forests at the same time as

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:07.430
we're unleashing all kinds of greenhouse gases
by burning fossil fuels.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:10.010
This double-whammy is much of what's driving
global warming.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:13.820
As a result, we're seeing decreases in the
levels of polar sea ice,

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.700
which means less habitat for polar bears,
seals and sea birds.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.440
More temperate animals are moving closer to
the poles,

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:22.940
and hotter, drier conditions are causing more
grass fires and forest fires.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.450
And while the climate has changed many times
in the past,

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:31.700
those changes usually took place over centuries or even millennia, giving organisms time to adapt or move.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:37.240
These changes are taking place within our lifetimes and it's kind of a huge deal, and it's complicated.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:41.810
It'd take me at least, like, 10 minutes and
52 seconds to explain it all in detail.

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:44.130
Which is why I did that in another video.

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:47.880
By now hopefully you can see how one human
impact can lead to another,

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:51.760
and how, even indirectly, they can end up
reducing biodiversity.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.190
But it's hard to overlook the more immediate
impacts we can have on ecosystems.

00:08:55.190 --> 00:09:00.290
One of the more in-your-face ways we affect
biodiversity is by introducing nonnative species,

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.880
either intentionally or unintentionally.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:08.180
Again, there are so many examples of this that you can learn more about it in another video I did.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:12.700
But suffice it to say: whether it's kudzu
in North America, or cane toads in Australia,

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:17.360
invasive species have a knack for out-competing
or outright eating native species

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.700
to the point that it rocks the world of an
entire ecosystem.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:26.520
And finally, probably the most direct impact we have on biodiversity is simply overharvesting certain organisms.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:31.100
We're overfishing the oceans to meet growing
demand for popular fish species, like tuna,

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:36.560
while on land we're exterminating important predators, like wolves, to protect livestock...those cows again.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:41.520
And the less diverse those ecosystems are,
the more vulnerable they become to disturbances,

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.060
including those other four impacts I just
mentioned.

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.140
And the fact is, there's a bunch more where
those came from

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:51.240
because there's a whole separate set of effects
that humanity has on the biosphere

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:57.140
that stems simply from us putting the wrong amounts of certain stuff in the wrong place at the wrong time.

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:02.600
That's what we call pollution, so tune in
next time when we'll explore what it really is,

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:06.260
where exactly it's coming from, and what we
can do about it.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:10.500
Thank you for watching another kind of depressing
episode of Crash Course Ecology
