00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answer is all of these involve cryptography,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and the reason for that is they all involve secrets.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Let's go through each in turn.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So the first is opening a door with a mechanical key.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
What's the secret there?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Well, let's look at a key.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So, the secret is actually the shape of the key.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now that I've shown you this key,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
there's no secret any more.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
If you can look at the ridges on the key,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
well, you know the secret.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
You can make a copy of the key

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and open whatever door this opens--

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
hopefully it's not something very important--

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
since I've just shown the key in a public video,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and it's actually possible to do this

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
from a fairly large distance.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
There was a group of students at University of California, San Diego,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
that showed that from taking a picture

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
several hundred feet away you could learn

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
enough about a key to create a replica

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
that would open the same door.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Playing poker certainly involves secrets.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It wouldn't be much of a game if everyone

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
could see everyone else's cards.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Logging into your Udacity account involves

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
entering an email and password,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and I'm not going to actually type my password now,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
because--one of the things I hope you'll start to understand from this class is--

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
even if you don't see it because of the stars here,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
the fact that you can hear the audio of my keyboard

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
would give you a pretty big clue about what my password is

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and the number of characters.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And--unlike the key that I showed you--

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
this protects something really important

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
so I'm not going to expose my password.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We will talk, in one of the future units,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
about how to manage passwords correctly.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
This involves a lot of encryption--your password is a secret--

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
but you also want to manage passwords--

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and check them--in a way that doesn't require storing those secrets.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
You don't want to store passwords in a way that could expose them easily,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and we'll talk about that more in unit 2.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The final option--doing a search using google.com--

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
is an interesting one.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
This actually changed about a year ago--

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
whether or not that involves encryption--

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and, if you try it today, you'll note when you enter google.com

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
what happens is, you actually get redirected

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
to https://google.com and--you can see the lock in the browser--

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
this means it's using a protocol called TLS

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
to encrypt all the traffic between you and Google.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So--both the keywords that you're typing are not exposed on the internet--

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
as well as the search results,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and we'll talk more about that in a later unit in the class

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
that involves both asymmetric and symmetric encryption.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
There's lots of interesting things about the protocol

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
to protect web traffic, that we'll talk about later in the class.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So the key point is that secrets are all around us,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
that they're very useful for solving problems,

00:02:33.000 --> 99:59:59.000
you're using cryptology all the time, every day.
