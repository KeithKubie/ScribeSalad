00:00:06.328 --> 00:00:08.105
I'm a geographer at Middlebury College,

00:00:08.105 --> 00:00:10.456
and I use digital technologies

00:00:10.456 --> 00:00:12.792
to reimagine the past.

00:00:12.792 --> 00:00:16.672
I want to take you to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania,

00:00:16.672 --> 00:00:19.382
July 1, 1863,

00:00:19.382 --> 00:00:21.856
we're right in the middle of the Civil War.

00:00:21.856 --> 00:00:23.386
From the northwest,

00:00:23.386 --> 00:00:24.606
the Confederate forces

00:00:24.606 --> 00:00:26.020
under Robert E. Lee,

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.474
and from the southeast,

00:00:27.474 --> 00:00:29.560
the Union forces under George Meade,

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.189
converge at this place

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:32.771
more or less by chance.

00:00:32.771 --> 00:00:34.647
They didn't plan to fight here.

00:00:34.647 --> 00:00:37.399
But the Battle of Gettysburg turns out

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.606
to be the turning point of the Civil War.

00:00:40.606 --> 00:00:42.522
Now, Robert E. Lee is probably

00:00:42.522 --> 00:00:45.642
the most famous American general,

00:00:45.642 --> 00:00:47.076
widely respected.

00:00:47.076 --> 00:00:48.170
But at Gettysburg,

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.788
he made some crucial mistakes,

00:00:49.788 --> 00:00:51.388
probably the most important

00:00:51.388 --> 00:00:53.905
was in ordering Pickett's Charge.

00:00:53.905 --> 00:00:55.044
I'm going to show you

00:00:55.044 --> 00:00:57.877
how I took a new look at Pickett's Charge

00:00:57.877 --> 00:01:01.887
with historical maps and GIS.

00:01:01.887 --> 00:01:04.302
My key map was this extraordinary thing,

00:01:04.302 --> 00:01:06.094
12 feet by 13 feet,

00:01:06.094 --> 00:01:08.806
in the vault of treasures at the National Archives.

00:01:08.806 --> 00:01:10.516
Here are some of my students at Middlebury

00:01:10.516 --> 00:01:12.602
to give you a sense of that scale.

00:01:12.602 --> 00:01:15.306
It was recompiled into a finished map

00:01:15.306 --> 00:01:17.554
the size of a large poster.

00:01:17.554 --> 00:01:20.526
You can see the layout of the town of Gettysburg,

00:01:20.526 --> 00:01:23.555
you see the undulating shape of the terrain.

00:01:23.555 --> 00:01:24.988
If you look at other details,

00:01:24.988 --> 00:01:28.991
you can see forests and orchards and streams and roads.

00:01:28.991 --> 00:01:33.080
I want you to look at those very fine black lines.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.998
Those are called contour lines,

00:01:34.998 --> 00:01:39.420
and they show the elevation at 4-foot intervals,

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.757
the most detailed elevation I have ever seen.

00:01:42.757 --> 00:01:44.556
Now, before I explain this image,

00:01:44.556 --> 00:01:46.971
I need to tell you a little about GIS.

00:01:46.971 --> 00:01:50.888
It stands for Geographic Information Systems.

00:01:50.888 --> 00:01:52.305
It's a kind of software

00:01:52.305 --> 00:01:54.970
that allows you to map almost anything.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.638
You can also use it to do terrain analysis.

00:01:57.638 --> 00:01:59.804
For example, if you're building a ski resort,

00:01:59.804 --> 00:02:01.554
and you want people to get off the lift

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:04.221
and have the most spectacular view possible,

00:02:04.221 --> 00:02:06.138
you use viewshed analysis

00:02:06.138 --> 00:02:07.976
that shows you what you can see

00:02:07.976 --> 00:02:10.242
from a certain point on the terrain.

00:02:10.242 --> 00:02:13.870
I used that to place myself digitally

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.886
in the footsteps of Robert E. Lee,

00:02:15.886 --> 00:02:17.666
to ask, 'What could he see?'

00:02:17.666 --> 00:02:19.554
and 'What could he not see?'

00:02:19.554 --> 00:02:22.212
that might have influenced his command decisions.

00:02:22.212 --> 00:02:24.508
Now, back to these contour lines.

00:02:24.508 --> 00:02:28.137
This is the best elevation data that I could find.

00:02:28.137 --> 00:02:29.804
I traced all of the lines,

00:02:29.804 --> 00:02:31.432
you see in the black and white drawings,

00:02:31.432 --> 00:02:32.847
some of those lines,

00:02:32.847 --> 00:02:34.433
stitched them together,

00:02:34.433 --> 00:02:36.137
gave them elevation values,

00:02:36.137 --> 00:02:39.521
and then transformed it, within the GIS program,

00:02:39.521 --> 00:02:41.970
into a continuous terrain.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.806
This is a simulation of the ground of the battlefield.

00:02:44.806 --> 00:02:47.737
Now, I'm ready to place myself in Lee's boots

00:02:47.737 --> 00:02:50.199
and ask what he could see.

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:51.909
The particular moment I want to look at

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.747
is that battle I mentioned, Pickett's Charge.

00:02:54.747 --> 00:02:57.665
Lee makes a crucial decision

00:02:57.665 --> 00:02:59.583
on the morning of the third day,

00:02:59.583 --> 00:03:02.971
this is July 3rd, 1863,

00:03:02.971 --> 00:03:05.424
the fighting on the previous two days has been fierce.

00:03:05.424 --> 00:03:07.138
It's gone back and forth,

00:03:07.138 --> 00:03:09.721
neither side has a clear advantage.

00:03:09.721 --> 00:03:12.514
Lee goes down to the bottom of the field,

00:03:12.514 --> 00:03:13.765
we know this,

00:03:13.765 --> 00:03:15.767
here's my gorgeous source map again

00:03:15.767 --> 00:03:18.185
and watch the red circle appear.

00:03:18.185 --> 00:03:20.188
He goes to the southern end of the battlefield

00:03:20.188 --> 00:03:21.887
at about 8:00 in the morning

00:03:21.887 --> 00:03:23.555
with his binoculars

00:03:23.555 --> 00:03:25.219
and looks through them

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:27.887
to figure out where to attack the Union line,

00:03:27.887 --> 00:03:30.031
where are they most vulnerable.

00:03:30.031 --> 00:03:31.365
Now, in this next image,

00:03:31.365 --> 00:03:34.577
I'm going to show you the GIS process

00:03:34.577 --> 00:03:36.330
called viewshed analysis,

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.806
along with Lee's line of sight

00:03:38.806 --> 00:03:41.500
in that sort of reddish cone

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.480
is the direction we think he was looking.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.755
Viewshed analysis, remember, tells me what I can see

00:03:46.755 --> 00:03:48.419
and what I can't see

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:49.426
from a certain point,

00:03:49.426 --> 00:03:50.650
so in this map,

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.097
the grey area is what Lee couldn't see.

00:03:54.097 --> 00:03:56.888
The clear area, where you see that historic map coming through,

00:03:56.888 --> 00:03:59.602
is what he could've definitely seen.

00:03:59.602 --> 00:04:05.056
Notice how much of the right side of the map is in grey.

00:04:05.056 --> 00:04:09.109
Now, we add another crucial piece of information.

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:10.864
Someone named John Bachelder,

00:04:10.864 --> 00:04:12.866
a landscape painter from New Hampshire,

00:04:12.866 --> 00:04:14.741
went down to the battlefield

00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:16.703
as soon as he heard about the fight,

00:04:16.703 --> 00:04:19.913
in order to document where troops had been

00:04:19.913 --> 00:04:21.887
and to try to paint the battle.

00:04:21.887 --> 00:04:24.169
He ended up getting $10,000 from Congress

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.421
in order to document troop positions

00:04:26.421 --> 00:04:29.465
down to the half hour.

00:04:29.465 --> 00:04:31.344
He produced 24 maps

00:04:31.344 --> 00:04:33.219
that we also digitized

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:35.305
and brought into the GIS.

00:04:35.305 --> 00:04:39.056
And this next map shows that troop position information;

00:04:39.056 --> 00:04:40.805
it's crucial for understanding

00:04:40.805 --> 00:04:43.270
what Lee could and what he couldn't see.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.226
Now, if you look closely at this map,

00:04:45.226 --> 00:04:46.607
you might be able to see

00:04:46.607 --> 00:04:47.692
kind of the middle

00:04:47.692 --> 00:04:51.821
is a black oval around an area that's relatively clear.

00:04:51.821 --> 00:04:55.073
The blue markings in that black oval

00:04:55.073 --> 00:04:59.077
are Union troops that I'm definitely sure that Lee could see.

00:04:59.077 --> 00:05:01.220
But if you look to the right of that,

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.084
you'll see an awful lot of blue markings.

00:05:04.084 --> 00:05:07.253
Those are Union troops in the shadows.

00:05:07.253 --> 00:05:12.351
Now, we know that on the night before Lee's reconnaissance

00:05:12.351 --> 00:05:14.808
so, the night of July 2nd, he sent out scouts.

00:05:14.808 --> 00:05:16.804
Of course, he wanted to know where the federal troops were.

00:05:16.804 --> 00:05:19.267
But quite astonishingly,

00:05:19.267 --> 00:05:21.100
we have no explanation for this.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.804
The scouts came back saying,

00:05:22.804 --> 00:05:24.439
'Don't worry, General Lee.

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:27.638
We didn't see any troops to the east,'

00:05:27.638 --> 00:05:30.138
in your map to the right,

00:05:30.138 --> 00:05:32.654
'of the Roundtops, some really big hills.'

00:05:32.654 --> 00:05:35.114
We don't know if they got drunk or fell asleep,

00:05:35.114 --> 00:05:39.554
but they didn't see almost a third of the Union army.

00:05:39.554 --> 00:05:41.579
So Lee is blind from his scouts,

00:05:41.579 --> 00:05:44.803
and from his viewpoint, he's also blind.

00:05:44.803 --> 00:05:46.249
He decides to attack

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:49.137
what he thinks is the weak middle of the Union line,

00:05:49.137 --> 00:05:51.637
not knowing about where the rest of the troops are.

00:05:51.637 --> 00:05:53.507
So if you look in the middle of this image,

00:05:53.507 --> 00:05:55.801
there's a gap in the Union line

00:05:55.801 --> 00:05:57.555
from where the blue soldiers

00:05:57.555 --> 00:06:00.305
are at the north of the battlefield and at the south.

00:06:00.305 --> 00:06:01.850
So let me now play out,

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.519
using these troop positions,

00:06:03.519 --> 00:06:04.972
Pickett's Charge.

00:06:04.972 --> 00:06:07.387
The Confederate soldiers are lined up

00:06:07.387 --> 00:06:09.054
on the west side of the battlefield,

00:06:09.054 --> 00:06:10.637
standing under the trees.

00:06:10.637 --> 00:06:17.250
18,000 men who first begin to walk and then trot

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.909
and then run across open farm fields

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:23.471
with their rifles leveled at the federal line.

00:06:23.471 --> 00:06:28.054
Now, the Union army has about 15-20 minutes to organize itself.

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:30.386
They see that the Confederates are converging

00:06:30.386 --> 00:06:31.796
on the middle of their line,

00:06:31.796 --> 00:06:33.173
and what do they do?

00:06:33.173 --> 00:06:36.470
The blue arrow here, representing movement of the Union troops,

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.304
they pull their troops toward that weak center,

00:06:40.304 --> 00:06:42.015
and let me show you how they were able

00:06:42.015 --> 00:06:45.308
to concentrate those men in a remarkably short period of time.

00:06:45.308 --> 00:06:48.234
Lee didn't know that the Union could've done this.

00:06:48.234 --> 00:06:50.939
You see now, they're standing like a wall,

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:53.567
ready to receive the Confederate assault,

00:06:53.567 --> 00:06:58.818
which happens between 1:30 and about 2:00, 2:30 in the afternoon.

00:06:58.818 --> 00:07:00.700
There is tremendously fierce fighting,

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.402
hand-to-hand combat.

00:07:02.402 --> 00:07:04.236
Now these blue lines,

00:07:04.236 --> 00:07:06.652
coming in between 2-2:30 in the afternoon,

00:07:06.652 --> 00:07:09.791
are pulling more reserves, more reinforcements,

00:07:09.791 --> 00:07:12.503
to that weak center of the Union line.

00:07:12.503 --> 00:07:15.190
What happens?

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:18.434
The Union soliders drive the Confederates off.

00:07:18.434 --> 00:07:23.184
Lee rides out, among his men, at 3:00 in the afternoon,

00:07:23.184 --> 00:07:29.886
saying, 'I'm sorry. It's my fault. It's my fault.'

00:07:29.886 --> 00:07:34.684
This story of sight has been a missing part

00:07:34.684 --> 00:07:36.984
of the Battle of Gettysburg.

00:07:36.984 --> 00:07:38.767
Here's their retreat.

00:07:38.767 --> 00:07:40.739
Historians have not been previously able

00:07:40.739 --> 00:07:42.992
to figure out what he could and couldn't see.

00:07:42.992 --> 00:07:44.907
I think it helps explain his decision.

00:07:44.907 --> 00:07:47.328
Why? Because from his point of view,

00:07:47.328 --> 00:07:49.790
the federals were very weak.

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:52.213
He was attacking at the logical place,

00:07:52.213 --> 00:07:53.960
but without full knowledge,

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.184
he set his men out for a dreadful defeat.

00:07:57.184 --> 00:07:59.840
Now, there's one more piece to this story.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.684
Last summer was the 150th anniversary

00:08:02.684 --> 00:08:04.267
of the Battle of Gettysburg.

00:08:04.267 --> 00:08:06.221
And I was able to work with a 3D animator,

00:08:06.221 --> 00:08:09.184
so we were able to use the GIS information

00:08:09.184 --> 00:08:11.810
to render the terrain issue as you see it here.

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:16.270
And my closing story is about how sight helped the other side.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.984
A federal general named GK Warren

00:08:17.984 --> 00:08:21.821
stood in the spot that this panoramic view is showing you,

00:08:21.821 --> 00:08:24.061
looking out over the battlefield.

00:08:24.061 --> 00:08:26.490
And at a key moment on day two,

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:29.685
he was able to see on the far horizon

00:08:29.685 --> 00:08:31.787
Confederate soldiers emerging out of the trees

00:08:31.787 --> 00:08:34.042
who were about to attack Little Roundtop.

00:08:34.042 --> 00:08:36.251
He called in reinforcements just in time

00:08:36.251 --> 00:08:38.671
and saved the day for the Union,

00:08:38.671 --> 00:08:42.633
setting the stage for the Union almost-victory on day three.

00:08:42.633 --> 00:08:45.385
So, I hope that all of you who are so gifted

00:08:45.385 --> 00:08:47.185
with digital technologies

00:08:47.185 --> 00:08:50.223
will begin to think about how you can use them for history.

00:08:50.223 --> 00:08:51.767
It can be amazing.

00:08:51.767 --> 00:08:53.351
Thank you.
