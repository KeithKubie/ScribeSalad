00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.300
All right, so the first thing to do here is to go to Spotlight and open Xcode.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.800
There it is.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.090
I will click on the Create a new Xcode project link.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.360
Now, on the left hand side here,

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.210
you will notice that there are two categories, iOS and OS X.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.500
These are two different operating systems that Apple makes.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.580
iOS is for mobile devices and OS X is for desktop.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.370
Since I'm interested in making a mobile application,

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.070
I will make sure that application is selected under iOS.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.730
All of the options that you see here like Single View,

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.750
Game, these are templates that we can use to create projects.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.290
You can think of them as templates that you can see when creating a presentation

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.320
for instance.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.260
Single View, is the simplest template around.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.320
It is a great place to start for a lot of apps.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.860
It is also somewhat similar to a blank template when you

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.410
are making a presentation.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.720
So I will make sure I select this and hit Next.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.766
I will name our app Pitch Perfect.

00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:05.170
[SOUND] By the way,

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.894
this name will also appear just below the apps icon on the user's phone.

00:01:10.894 --> 00:01:14.974
I've added a link in the instructor notes that highlights recommendations from

00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:18.870
Apple on how to choose an effective name for your application.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.430
Under Organization Name, Xcode has already entered Udacity.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.620
You can enter either your name or the name of your organization in this box.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.550
For the Organization Identifier, Apple recommends that you reverse the address

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.270
of your personal website or the website of your organization.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.940
So here I have added com.udacity.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.510
Now the reason for us reversing this address is because we

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.780
want to make this bundle identifier unique for our app.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.780
I am developing this app in Swift so I will pick that.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.870
Under Devices I will choose iPhone.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.350
Now, the reason why I am picking this value is because I want to

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.640
focus my teaching efforts for this course.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.260
I could have made an app for both iPad and iPhone.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.970
By the way, you can change this setting later on if you choose.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.080
I'm going to hit Next.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.600
And select a folder where I want to save my project.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.250
I have a folder called iOS Apps on my desktop.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.359
And I will hit Create.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.020
And voila, we've made an empty app.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.110
Now there's a lot going on here in Xcode.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.840
Let's dive into it in the next video.
