00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.100
Here at DNews we’re obsessed with Mars,
and we kind of think you are too, we kind

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:13.200
of think everyone is.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.420
Ever since the Romans named the planet after
their God of War, it’s been used in fantastical

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.660
tales in literature, radio, TV, and film.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.150
Gulliver traveled there, men are supposedly
from there and the term martian is inspired

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.510
by the planet’s name.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.529
So why are we so obsessed?

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.760
Well, maybe Neil deGrasse Tyson said it best,
“So much of what drives cosmic exploration

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.480
involves the quest to learn whether or not
we're alone in the Universe.”

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.550
And though there have been some significant
advances in the race to Mars, as of today

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.550
we really only have some pictures of the planet
and a limited amount of data from rock samples.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.080
So, some could say we really haven’t gotten
that far, but I’m already getting ahead

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.080
of myself.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.100
Let’s rewind back.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.399
In the 60s there was a good handful of attempts
to see Mars.

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.000
Now I say attempts because they pretty much
all failed until Mariner 4 in 1965.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.520
The spacecraft spent just 25 minutes flying
by Mars but in that time it took 21 pictures.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.000
Like this one.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.341
For the next 20 years there were more missions
to Mars and thousands of more pictures, but

00:01:21.341 --> 00:01:24.160
also a significant number of failures.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.619
Expensive failures.

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:32.720
And after losing communication with the Mars
Observer in 1993, a spacecraft costing an

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.259
estimated 813 million dollars, NASA decided
enough was enough.

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.870
In NASA’s own words, “...we have tried
to do too much, too fast.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.899
We have lost sight of how difficult Space
Exploration is…we have had too many Mission

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.340
Failures which must be fixed.”

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.570
And that ‘fix’ turned out to be something
called FBC, which really doesn’t need any

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.190
complex scientific explanation.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.670
It’s simply: Faster, Better, Cheaper.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.229
And with that kind of mentality NASA developed
a method called aerobraking, or using the

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.629
friction of another planet’s atmosphere
to control a spacecraft’s orbit, which has

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.890
save---l---d lots of money in fuel.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.580
Aerobraking is used with the more recent Mars
Odyssey and Reconnaissance (rəˈkänəsəns)

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.250
Orbiter which has played a big part in learning
about the existence of water on Mars.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.120
Since then, the rover Curiosity has been our
primary source for collecting data on the

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.760
mysterious red planet.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.900
Curiosity is using some pretty cool tools
to test rock samples -- which, actually tells

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.590
us quite a lot.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.200
For example, the Curiosity can cook Martian
rock up to 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.569
Depending on what temperature the sample breaks
down, we can determine what compounds exist

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:50.940
in Mars’ surface.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.209
While Curiosity is still chugging along Mars
surface, here on Earth, NASA is planning a

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.830
new mission called InSight, a lander designed
to study the interior structure of Mars.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.660
Of course it really wouldn’t be a race without
competitors.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.030
Big players like China, are hoping to send
a rover to Mars and Russia, are looking to

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.459
send trained monkeys there.

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.280
But there are also smaller organizations in
the running.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.250
Like non-profit Inspiration Mars, who are
working to send a middle-aged couple to flyby

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.250
Mars.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.930
Or Elon Musk’s organization Space-X, who
hope to pioneer round trips to Mars via reusable

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.680
spacecrafts.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.769
And the highly controversial Mars One, which
has big plans to establish a permanent human

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.269
settlement.

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.320
But this race is a costly one.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.540
Not just in terms of the billions of dollars
that these projects need to get off the ground,

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.700
but also the time and manpower that is required.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.849
So let’s not forget FBC.

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:47.780
Maybe us racers can work Faster, Better and
Cheaper through collaboration.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.909
So, maybe the key to finally finding Martians,
we have to do a better job working together

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:54.909
as Earthlings.

00:03:54.909 --> 00:04:02.030
So, we get to talk about stories of space
exploration because of our sponsor, Toyota.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.510
They want to get the word out about their
new Toyota Rav4 Hybrid.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.049
The all new Toyota Rav4 Hybrid let’s your
sense of wonder lead the way and drives your

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.660
passions further.The Toyota Rav4 Hybrid, how
far will you take it?

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:23.250
NASA's Reconnaissance Orbiter recently found
strong evidence that suggests liquid water

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.250
flows on Mars!!

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.100
