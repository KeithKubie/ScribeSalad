00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.820
- Hey everyone, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:03.720
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.830
and this is one of my favorite
cities in the world for food

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.090
because it's such a melting pot.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.140
It has so many different
people and cultures and foods

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.070
that make up Kuala Lumpur and so today

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.930
we're gonna go on a Malaysian food tour.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.640
We're gonna eat a lot of
incredibly delicious food

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.490
and I hope this video
will give you a great idea

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.280
of the diversity and the
spectrum of amazing food

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.880
that you can eat when
you are in Kuala Lumpur

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.220
and so we are on our way.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.720
I'm gonna share all the food with you

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.217
in this video right now.

00:00:32.217 --> 00:00:35.300
(upbeat world music)

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.890
We met up with Farul and Anwar.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.250
They're from Oh My Media
and they're gonna be

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.320
taking us around today on this ultimate

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.080
Kuala Lumpur street food tour

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.570
and most of all, we all love to eat.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:50.403
- Yes, correct.

00:00:50.403 --> 00:00:53.340
- So it's gonna be a very
fun day and we are on our way

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.110
to the first place right now.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.289
- Let's go.

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:57.206
- Let's go.

00:00:58.691 --> 00:01:02.608
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.423
- [Mark] Mansion Tea Stall.

00:01:09.423 --> 00:01:10.256
- Yeah.

00:01:10.256 --> 00:01:13.173
- So the real name is
called Mansion Tea Stall.

00:01:14.668 --> 00:01:17.716
(chopping sound)

00:01:17.716 --> 00:01:20.820
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.653
- [Mark] Chicken?

00:01:21.653 --> 00:01:24.277
- [Chef] Our chicken curry.

00:01:24.277 --> 00:01:25.110
- [Mark] And this one is Sambal?

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.443
- [Chef] Sambal.

00:01:27.597 --> 00:01:28.430
This one does.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.347
- [Mark] This one does.

00:01:34.127 --> 00:01:34.960
Oh, and then the eggs.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.460
- [Chef] This egg.

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:43.682
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:43.682 --> 00:01:45.450
- We got the Roti Canai Special,

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.150
which they chop it up the Roti.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.006
A mess of sauces and oozing
eggs all wrapped up in that,

00:01:52.006 --> 00:01:55.290
all like soaking into that flatbread.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.350
It's all components that
you could possibly want

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.830
for breakfast all on one single plate,

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.350
all mixed together and
mingled together, awesome.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.600
Let's do it, let's dig in.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.560
Break that yoke?

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.840
- Yeah.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.899
- Oh yes, okay.

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:07.732
And you gotta kind of pour that--

00:02:07.732 --> 00:02:08.565
- Pour that.

00:02:08.565 --> 00:02:11.087
Oh ho ho, nice, okay.

00:02:11.087 --> 00:02:12.510
Okay, yes!

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.202
He knows what he's doing.

00:02:14.202 --> 00:02:15.101
- It's tempting, right?

00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:16.980
- [Mark] Scoop out,
scoop out that egg yolk

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.130
and just sprinkle it all over everything,

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.083
coating everything.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.320
Oh, that looks awesome.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.621
- [Anwar] Just like this.

00:02:23.621 --> 00:02:24.520
You mix it up.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.560
- Oh yeah, popping yokes
is just something here

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.560
that never gets old.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.250
And then I will just kinda sprinkle...

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.300
Oh ho, ho, ho, ho!

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.410
Okay that's good, I'm gonna
go in for some of that,

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.840
is this a Sambal?

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.673
- Yep, it's Sambal.

00:02:36.673 --> 00:02:38.210
- Sambal, okay, mix that in.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.393
Roti Canai Special.

00:02:40.477 --> 00:02:41.394
- To India.

00:02:46.724 --> 00:02:49.111
- Oh, oh that's awesome.

00:02:49.111 --> 00:02:50.530
- Yeah.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.660
- That is amazing.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.240
You've got the richness of the egg yoke,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.190
you've got the bread which is,

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.020
the Roti which is slightly like chewy

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.750
because it's been fried in oil

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.490
before being soaked in sauce.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.680
And then you've got the Sambal which is,

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.053
it's like a little bit sweet
and a little bit spicy.

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:07.886
- Yeah, a little bit.

00:03:07.886 --> 00:03:08.719
- And a little bit spicy, yeah?

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:09.960
But that might, like that
gives it a nice contrast.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.694
- If you want no more,
you can put ketchup on it.

00:03:11.694 --> 00:03:13.279
- Oh, this one is kecap manis?

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:15.483
Like a sweet, sweet soy sauce?

00:03:16.494 --> 00:03:17.994
- Let me dip this.

00:03:18.952 --> 00:03:20.354
Yeah, kecap manis.

00:03:20.354 --> 00:03:21.263
- Kecap manis?

00:03:21.263 --> 00:03:23.810
And that's like a sweet
soy sauce that you can add.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.630
So that's like a total Malaysian touch

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.463
to the whole thing, adding
some kecap manis to it.

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:37.580
- It's good, I love leche.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.483
- It's great, everything I wanted, wow.

00:03:39.483 --> 00:03:41.381
- I think what makes
it for me is the entire

00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:44.960
mash-up combination,
because you've got the,

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.530
it's just all textures and
flavors all mingled together.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.820
And for this bite, I'm gonna
take some of that extra yolk

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.473
and kinda re-yolk it.

00:03:54.756 --> 00:03:56.500
(laughing)

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.083
(upbeat music)

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.660
It's almost like, what is
it called, Eggs in the Hole?

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.239
Egg in the Basket?

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:08.319
- Eggs in a Basket.

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.470
- You know Eggs in the
Basket, where you put three

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.218
on a piece of toast, and
then you poke a hole,

00:04:12.218 --> 00:04:13.960
you put an egg in it?

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.580
This is like the extreme, ultimate,

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.713
next-level version of Eggs in a Nest.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.687
Yeah, that's a breakfast of
champions in Kuala Lumpur,

00:04:25.687 --> 00:04:29.170
and this place they have, it's
kinda at the bottom of this

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.410
pretty tall, well not that tall,

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.840
apartment complex, a mansion complex.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.350
The main stall is over here
where they're making the food,

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:39.980
and they have a dining
section, but then over here,

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.980
this is like the extended
seating section where we sat.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.446
- I'm a big fan of yours.

00:04:46.446 --> 00:04:47.279
- Thank you very much.

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:48.453
Good, nice to meet you.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.380
Next, we are on our way to
go eat what is considered

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.830
to be the national dish of Malaysia.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.620
It's a dish that everybody loves.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.160
It's an incredible dish.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.927
We're on our way to eat the the next dish.

00:05:01.927 --> 00:05:05.460
(upbeat world music)

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.290
And again, something I love so much

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.960
about Kael, Kuala Lumpur
is that it's a big city,

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.130
it's a modern city,
there's sky-rise buildings

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.030
and yet, there's so many green spaces,

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.490
and so, we kinda came into this,

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.327
it's almost like a little mountain park,

00:05:19.327 --> 00:05:22.517
but we're surrounded by
beautiful greenery, trees.

00:05:22.517 --> 00:05:25.210
There's a little almost
food court section,

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.530
and that's where we are heading.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.540
We are here to eat Nasi Lemak,
which is often considered

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.890
one of the national,
ultimate dishes of Malaysia.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.300
Rice cooked with coconut milk.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.946
There's a few sides that
are common, but then, also

00:05:37.946 --> 00:05:41.537
each stall, each restaurant has
their specialty of different

00:05:41.537 --> 00:05:44.997
curried dishes to include on top.

00:05:44.997 --> 00:05:47.410
And so this place is
called Nasi Lemak Tanglin.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.720
They've been around since
1948, and I've been wanting

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.130
to come here for a long time,

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.716
so I'm very happy to finally be here.

00:05:55.716 --> 00:05:59.701
(speaking in foreign language)

00:05:59.701 --> 00:06:02.236
Yes, capo, and also maybe the--

00:06:02.236 --> 00:06:03.620
(speaking in foreign language)

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:04.470
And then the egg.

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.040
You can dance while you're eating.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.980
A live band here, too,

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.453
to give you the energy you
need to eat Nasi Lamak.

00:06:17.453 --> 00:06:18.286
- Yeah.

00:06:18.286 --> 00:06:21.050
- It's such a wonderful
environment in the nature,

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.670
with a band, delicious food on our plates.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.450
Nasi Lamak is dish of many components,

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:30.010
and one of the most important,
significant components is

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.437
the rice, which is made with coconut milk,

00:06:32.437 --> 00:06:35.420
but then it's your choice of
what other dishes to order,

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.520
so I got squid curry, I got the cockles,

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.120
as well as a unique
dish of, it's a spleen--

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.891
- [Anwar] Curry.

00:06:44.891 --> 00:06:46.624
- A curried spleen.

00:06:46.624 --> 00:06:51.605
We all got different plates,
so you can just choose

00:06:51.605 --> 00:06:53.500
your own dishes right.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:54.808
- I choose, yeah, the potato--

00:06:54.808 --> 00:06:55.641
- That's like a potato patty?

00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:56.474
- Begedil.

00:06:56.474 --> 00:06:57.307
- Begedil.

00:06:57.307 --> 00:06:58.730
This is extra Sambal, as well.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.683
A piece of that squid.

00:07:03.522 --> 00:07:06.355
(band performing)

00:07:09.138 --> 00:07:10.190
Oh, yeah.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:13.959
The rice, it's fluffy, but
you can taste that coconut

00:07:13.959 --> 00:07:16.860
aroma to it, definitely coconut.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.738
It's sweet at first, but then it's kind of

00:07:19.738 --> 00:07:22.683
spicy towards the end of your bite.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.910
It tastes like a roasted
chili jam, almost,

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:28.338
that it's wrapped up within.

00:07:28.338 --> 00:07:30.903
Okay, and then rotating my
plate over to the spleen.

00:07:33.468 --> 00:07:34.403
Oh, whoa.

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.423
That definitely has a
unique texture to it.

00:07:39.819 --> 00:07:41.060
It's actually gummy.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.650
You feel like almost grassy texture to it.

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:47.650
It's almost like a sponge,
a gooey sponge of flavor.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:48.483
Really good.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.087
I think the cockle is the best.

00:07:51.087 --> 00:07:53.800
(upbeat world music)

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.750
Each one of the dishes
has it's own flavor,

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.140
I think I like the cockles the best,

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.957
the cockles curry it's fantastic.

00:08:00.457 --> 00:08:02.757
And it's just balanced
perfectly, the flavors.

00:08:06.067 --> 00:08:09.750
And I love the anchovies,
'cause they're fried,

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.633
they're crispy, they're salty.

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:20.680
The live music was fun to dance to

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.044
as we finished that plate of Nasi Lamak,

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:26.250
but yeah, Nasi Lamak,
no matter where you go,

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.610
you can eat it at many, many places.

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:30.540
It's a dish you do not wanna miss

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.330
when you're in Malaysia, when
you come to Kuala Lumpur.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:37.413
Okay, we're moving on
to the next spot, okay.

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:42.170
Which is one of my favorite
Malaysian foods to eat.

00:08:45.363 --> 00:08:48.446
(upbeat world music)

00:08:57.369 --> 00:09:00.000
(speaking in foreign language)

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.970
Are you having this immediately
step out of the car,

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:05.873
you can immediately
get the distinct aroma.

00:09:05.873 --> 00:09:07.113
You want some right now?

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.560
Cempedak jackfruit
madufra, it's more sweet

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.970
it's more honey-tasting.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:17.360
So he has a basket of the
fruit, which is peeled already

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.060
there to be sit into a batter,
and then deep fries it.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.720
And as she's frying that, it's
just so incredibly fragrant,

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.840
it literally smells like
honey is coming out of those

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.973
oil fumes.

00:09:30.738 --> 00:09:33.500
Fried right out of the
oil, it's really hot,

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.275
so you better be careful biting into this.

00:09:35.275 --> 00:09:38.560
Oh, yeah.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.780
That is incredibly hot.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:41.883
Oh, it's amazing.

00:09:41.883 --> 00:09:45.510
It's crispy, it's so honey sweet.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:47.785
And then the texture is also kind of

00:09:47.785 --> 00:09:48.783
a little bit stringy, as well.

00:09:49.654 --> 00:09:51.880
It's gonna taste like a...

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.463
And then you end up with
this seed at the end.

00:09:54.463 --> 00:09:56.890
(live band playing)

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:58.340
Steam coming out of my mouth.

00:10:00.913 --> 00:10:03.163
(steaming)

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.750
There's about five or
six different restaurants

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:09.660
along this stretch, and
there's a live band here.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.820
But this one of the best
places in Kuala Lumpur

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.410
to eat Ikan Bakar, which is grilled fish.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:16.453
And maybe some of the smaller mackerel?

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.280
In order to make this
Ikan Bakar, it's actually

00:10:25.211 --> 00:10:26.044
cooked on a hot skillet,
but what they do first

00:10:26.044 --> 00:10:27.940
is they take the fish, they
put it into the Sambal,

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:32.940
which is the chili sauce
blend, they actually dunk it

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:36.540
into the Sambal, then they
wrap it in a banana leaf

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.060
and stick it onto the hot
griddle and that sort of like,

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:44.010
the banana leaf keeps the flavor
in so it grills and roasts

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.780
and bakes and just simmers
it in it's own juices

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.050
and chili sauce all at the same time.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:51.220
It goes up in a cloud of steam and smoke,

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.170
even if you walk past, if you get a whiff

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:54.770
of some of that steam
coming off the grill,

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:57.030
you can feel it in your lungs.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:59.913
Carameling, 'cause I believe
it caramelizes onto the fish.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:05.110
Really quick story before we
dig into the amazing food here,

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:08.863
but I came here back in 2012,
I actually made a video,

00:11:08.863 --> 00:11:12.020
it's a very old, slightly
embarrassing video.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.890
I am looking for some of
the, what is supposedly,

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:18.989
some of the best Ikan
Bakar, or grilled fish

00:11:18.989 --> 00:11:21.150
here in Kuala Lumpur.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:25.880
I remember, there's like a
highway behind there somewhere,

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.130
there's this big highway, and
I climbed over the highway,

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.250
there's a overpass over the highway.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:32.800
I had to find my way up to
the top of this little hill

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.240
to get to the restaurant,
so I remember having to hop

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:39.670
a couple of fences, kinda
whack my way through the jungle

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:40.630
to get here.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:45.630
I think I have just found
Jalan Bellamy, and I think,

00:11:46.258 --> 00:11:49.663
I'm excited, I think that is
the restaurant right there.

00:11:51.299 --> 00:11:52.550
It was no easy mission to get here.

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:54.795
I had to run across some highways,

00:11:54.795 --> 00:11:57.830
I had to jump across some fences.

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:00.230
So times have changed
a little bit, this is

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:02.120
gonna be the new and updated version,

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.518
but this is an Ikan,

00:12:03.518 --> 00:12:06.870
to all that, it's very special to me,

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:09.030
and so I'm very, very happy to be back.

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:11.840
Now we got actually four
different types of fish,

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.319
plus the squid, plus some
different Sambals, plus rice.

00:12:14.319 --> 00:12:16.900
And this is the Stingray Sambal,

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.170
and this is one of my favorite.

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:20.510
If I were to just choose one
fish, this is what I'd get.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:23.230
You can see, if you unwrap it,
you can see the oily juices

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:25.240
just flowing, look at that.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.650
I'm gonna grab a piece of this first,

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:28.150
this has to be the first bite.

00:12:29.195 --> 00:12:30.028
Oh, it's so meaty!

00:12:30.028 --> 00:12:33.028
(live band playing)

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.290
It's such an incredibly meaty, meaty.

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:41.230
It's almost like chicken,
yet kinda softer and oilier,

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:42.080
and then you taste that Sambal,

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.310
you taste the dry chili
in there, the turmeric,

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:49.239
and again, just how the
banana leaf helps to

00:12:49.239 --> 00:12:53.018
keep in all the juices
so that they re-absorb

00:12:53.018 --> 00:12:57.400
into the fish, as they come
out, they re-absorb into it.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.850
Look at that sting ray,
just how it flakes off,

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:01.460
it's so stringy.

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.963
And I'm gonna dip that
into some of the sauce.

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:07.020
Okay, next I'll reach into the squid.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.173
And for this, I'll dip
into, I think this is

00:13:09.173 --> 00:13:10.883
like a shrimp paste, chili dip.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.100
The texture of the squid
is light and chewy,

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.230
and then that sauce, the
saltiness of the shrimp paste,

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:24.763
plus it has a wonderful acidity,

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:27.220
I think possibly from Calamonte.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.660
Next up, I'm gonna try, I
think this is a mackerel,

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.680
and it has a little bit
of a banana leaf wrapper.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.520
And as soon as you, oh you
have to get a close-up,

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.641
look at that.

00:13:35.641 --> 00:13:37.438
Soon as you unravel the
banana, you can see that oil

00:13:37.438 --> 00:13:40.867
and that sauce just caked
up in there, that Sambal.

00:13:42.275 --> 00:13:43.310
Oh yeah, it's just oozing and juicy.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:45.610
Reach in for a little
piece off the side here.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.560
I think that's a short head mackerel,

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.378
or an Indian mackerel.

00:13:53.378 --> 00:13:55.070
Moving on to the next fish.

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:56.870
And I believe this one is a catfish.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.700
Just unwrap it, oh ho
ho ho, that's so oily

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.080
and juicy and fatty!

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.118
The juices and the Sambal is just flowing.

00:14:04.118 --> 00:14:08.583
Look at how oily, oh man, that's awesome!

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:11.500
You could actually
squeeze it, and I'm sure

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.290
the oils and juices would just fall out,

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:14.570
but I'm not gonna squeeze it for you

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:16.733
because I wanna keep those in my bite.

00:14:20.229 --> 00:14:21.590
(laughing)

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:25.490
I think because catfish is such
an oily fish from the start,

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:29.680
then when it has a chance
to live on that griddle

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.320
and just absorb more
Sambal, and juices and oil,

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.417
that even like, enhances it more.

00:14:36.417 --> 00:14:39.373
And you really taste the
smokiness of the catfish.

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:44.349
Final fish we got here is,
I think it's the tilapia?

00:14:44.349 --> 00:14:45.182
- [Anwar] The tilapia.

00:14:45.182 --> 00:14:46.015
- The tilapia?

00:14:46.015 --> 00:14:48.430
Which is also cooked in
the same exact fashion

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:50.290
with the Sambal,
surrounded by banana leaf,

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.037
and this banana leaf is
just sort of like to started

00:14:52.037 --> 00:14:54.189
disintegrating on to the
fish, peel that back.

00:14:54.189 --> 00:14:55.080
Let's get a bite of this.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.750
Oh, it's so oily and
juicy again, that has been

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:00.300
the story of every single fish.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.496
Is it Sambal Belacan?

00:15:03.496 --> 00:15:04.329
- [Anwar] It's a Belacan.

00:15:04.329 --> 00:15:05.162
- So it's shrimp-based?

00:15:05.162 --> 00:15:05.995
- [Anwar] Yeah.

00:15:05.995 --> 00:15:06.828
- Okay, it's so good.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:15.480
And so yeah, that's at least like three,

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:20.370
maybe four or five layers of
flavor all in one single bite.

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:23.260
The diversity of taste from
the Sambal on the fish,

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:27.020
to the banana leaf, to
the Sambal that you add on

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:28.980
when you take a bite, it's superb.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.490
- That fish is definitely
fence-jump worthy fish,

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:32.633
it's incredible.

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:39.928
Okay, all of the Ikan Bakar is delicious,

00:15:39.928 --> 00:15:42.210
but nothing can top this sting ray.

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:44.240
That is, that's the best.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.900
Like if you come here,
and you just eat one fish,

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.558
that's the fish you should go for.

00:15:48.558 --> 00:15:51.630
And then finally, to
end, we have a coconut,

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:54.690
this is just the coconut
water, plus the coconut meat,

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:55.910
in a cup conveniently

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.113
with a spoon and straw combo at the top.

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:05.255
Oh yeah, that's incredibly
sweet, incredibly,

00:16:05.255 --> 00:16:08.225
and nothing refreshes like
a coconut water, either.

00:16:08.225 --> 00:16:12.225
(singing in a foreign language)

00:16:31.064 --> 00:16:32.610
This is just a little food paradise.

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:35.110
As soon as he lifts the
lid of that ice chest,

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:38.820
you just get this poof of
Durian in your nostrils.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.640
I thought the coconut
was gonna be the dessert,

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.730
but this, this is the real dessert.

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:44.080
The Durian on top with ice cream,

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.633
I'm gonna try to get like
equal ratios of both.

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.073
Okay, I got half ice cream, half Dorian.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.565
Oh wow!

00:16:59.565 --> 00:17:01.815
(laughing)

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.740
It's unbelievably good,
because the Dorian is kind of

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:15.650
mushy and creamy, it's pudding.

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:18.980
It's sweet, it has a little
bit of a bitterness to it,

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.550
and then you've got the
cold Dorian ice cream

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:24.400
which is more like the
refreshing Dorian taste,

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.760
so you've got cold and
warm cream in your mouth

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.700
combining, it's sensational,

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.220
it's really and truly sensational.

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:33.352
That is a dessert of a lifetime.

00:17:33.352 --> 00:17:35.934
(band singing)

00:17:35.934 --> 00:17:36.767
(speaking in a foreign language)

00:17:36.767 --> 00:17:37.600
- You're welcome.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.433
- Thank you very much.

00:17:38.433 --> 00:17:39.795
- Well come again, have
a good day, my friend.

00:17:39.795 --> 00:17:43.378
(speaking in a foreign language)

00:17:43.378 --> 00:17:45.360
- He is the owner, and there's
like maybe five different

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.473
restaurants in Ikar Bakar, but we came to

00:17:47.473 --> 00:17:50.824
Ikan Bakar (Seri Melaka),
so that's the spot,

00:17:50.824 --> 00:17:55.610
yeah, and he's an amazing
man who owns this restaurant

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:57.385
so this is the spot that was delicous.

00:17:57.385 --> 00:17:59.879
(speaking in a foreign language)

00:17:59.879 --> 00:18:01.155
- Welcome to Malaysia.

00:18:01.155 --> 00:18:03.292
(speaking in a foreign language)

00:18:03.292 --> 00:18:04.660
- Thank you very much.

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:06.904
- Alright, have a great one.

00:18:06.904 --> 00:18:09.430
- I'm very happy to report
that the method of getting

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:13.130
here has changed, but the
flavor of the Ikan Bakar,

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.800
it remains the same, it's incredibly good.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:20.800
This in my opinion is a
must-eat area stall and dish

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.200
when you come to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:28.130
Next place, and I think we have
another big meal coming up.

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:29.771
Yes, Indian food.

00:18:29.771 --> 00:18:32.354
(upbeat music)

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:43.660
When I reached out and asked
where to eat in Kuala Lumpur,

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:45.780
and I was really looking
for some off-the-beaten-path

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:49.520
destinations, and so a number
of you recommended that

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:53.090
we check out this place for
the banana leaf rice and curry,

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:55.990
which is really like
somebody opens their home

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:58.060
and opens their home as
a restaurant and so I'm

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:01.470
very excited for this next
meal, South Indian food.

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:02.705
A green gate.

00:19:02.705 --> 00:19:03.555
It's with the plants outside.

00:19:03.555 --> 00:19:04.680
And luckily, there's a
photo on Google Maps.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.503
Green gate at the front,
but there's not even a sign.

00:19:07.503 --> 00:19:10.800
We would not know it is a restaurant here,

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.410
but it's known as Sri Ganapathi Mess.

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:16.650
Potted plants, there's clay pots.

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:18.730
Okay, and then you do walk
inside and there is the sign

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:21.210
like once you get into the compound.

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:22.854
This is awesome.

00:19:22.854 --> 00:19:23.687
- Hello.

00:19:23.687 --> 00:19:24.520
- Hello.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:29.420
It really is a home with
like many, many rooms

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.490
And they kinda open it
rooms as they get busier

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:34.375
so if the first few rooms are
full, they open up an entire

00:19:34.375 --> 00:19:37.220
mess hall in the back.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.366
Do you have the Crab Rasam?

00:19:39.366 --> 00:19:40.199
- [Chef] Yeah, yeah.

00:19:40.199 --> 00:19:41.230
- Oh, it's swordfish.

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:43.635
Maybe can we have swordfish and vegetable?

00:19:43.635 --> 00:19:44.727
Mutton curry.

00:19:44.727 --> 00:19:45.977
- Mutton curry?

00:19:53.935 --> 00:19:54.893
- Oh, it's like a soup.

00:19:54.893 --> 00:19:56.342
Should be rice, okay, perfect.

00:19:56.342 --> 00:20:00.030
Okay, now I'm gonna move back
to our dining room section

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:01.503
to start digging in.

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:05.210
Okay, I think I ordered.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:08.993
- Thank you ma'am, that's beautiful.

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:12.770
- Yes, final step before
eating is one more of scoop

00:20:13.923 --> 00:20:15.160
of curry sauce over the
rice, or double scoop of

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.700
curry over the rice.

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:17.710
Thank you.

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:20.570
One of the reasons that Kuala
Lumpur is just one of the

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.830
best cities in the world
if you love to eat,

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:24.390
because of the diversity of foods.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:27.963
This would be very authentic South Indian.

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:36.190
You can taste ginger in there.

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:39.130
Yeah, oh that's wonderful.

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:42.410
A little bit spicy, gingery, very gingery.

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:44.560
Oh and then the spice
just keeps on coming.

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.760
Onions have a little bit
more of a sour taste to them.

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.460
Let me try some of that swordfish.

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:58.220
And this is always one
of my favorite dishes.

00:21:01.335 --> 00:21:04.830
And people really enjoy
really mixing it up,

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.923
getting it all evenly coated on the rice.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.433
- Yeah.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.280
- It's almost like shredded
chicken, but kinda like dry

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.210
but in a good way.

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:20.450
I'm not sure if it's mustard seed,

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:21.560
there might be cumin seed in there, too.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.850
I'm gonna follow that with a
Crab Rasam, which they serve

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:25.510
in a cup because you're
actually supposed to drink it,

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:27.795
it's like a beverage, it's like a soup.

00:21:27.795 --> 00:21:28.940
Cheers.

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:29.940
- Actually drink it.

00:21:33.056 --> 00:21:34.973
- Ah, that's delicious.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:37.960
- Yeah, you can taste that--
- Wow.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.617
- It tastes like the shells of crab

00:21:39.617 --> 00:21:40.960
that's just been boiled down.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:44.580
But you taste the crab,
you taste the sweet onion's

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:47.097
herbal-ness of it?

00:21:47.097 --> 00:21:49.680
(upbeat music)

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.447
Oh yeah, you can taste
that that is mutton.

00:21:57.447 --> 00:21:59.496
You can taste the goatiness of it.

00:21:59.496 --> 00:22:00.800
This layer is delicious, yeah.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.200
That's awesome, especially
with everything else.

00:22:05.504 --> 00:22:07.754
(groaning)

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:18.320
The vegetable has a
very nutty taste to it.

00:22:20.513 --> 00:22:24.580
That crab consomme is
incredible, and yeah,

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:26.620
it tastes very light, but
then you taste the spice

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:28.950
at the back of your throat
as you keep on drinking it.

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:32.060
Uh-huh, really good, real really good.

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:34.513
This is what its all come
down to, my final bite.

00:22:35.545 --> 00:22:38.890
The final driplets of curry sauce.

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:40.910
The final meat juices.

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:41.823
The final veg.

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:50.620
That was just an ultra-satisfying meal.

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:53.520
I'm gonna have to surrender
after that because we've had

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:54.700
quite a lot of food, so all you do is,

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.723
you just fold over your banana leaf.

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:00.508
- Thank you very much.

00:23:00.508 --> 00:23:01.610
- Yeah.

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:02.443
- Thank you very much.

00:23:02.443 --> 00:23:03.276
- Take care, man.

00:23:03.276 --> 00:23:06.350
- Just the front of a
home, it's unassuming,

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:09.900
it's not stand-out, you
gotta know about this place,

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:13.235
but just in the green gate,
the restaurant and home

00:23:13.235 --> 00:23:15.740
just goes back further and further,

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.617
and they just keep opening
more and more rooms

00:23:17.617 --> 00:23:19.210
as it gets busier.

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:22.420
Such a cool restaurant,
incredibly delicious

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:23.840
South Indian food.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.175
- I am the owner of public shop.

00:23:25.175 --> 00:23:27.462
- Oh, thank you very much!

00:23:27.462 --> 00:23:28.937
What's your name?

00:23:28.937 --> 00:23:31.090
- Pumar, I'm ex-police detective.

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:32.263
- Oh, awesome!

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:35.460
Food was incredibly good.

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.110
- I like it, thank you, thank you.

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:38.747
- A few friends recommended it to me.

00:23:38.747 --> 00:23:39.580
- Okay.

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:42.163
(upbeat music)

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.350
- For our final stop on this Kuala Lumpur

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:53.740
Malaysian food tour, we are in Chinatown,

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:55.930
and we're gonna go to a
very legendary restaurant

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:57.140
to eat a certain dish.

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:58.890
But a number of people
recommended it to me,

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:00.230
it looks incredibly delicious,

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:01.840
and this is gonna be the final dish.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.920
This is what's gonna wrap it up, and again

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.330
we are going to see just how diverse

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:08.580
the food is in Malaysia.

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:11.550
This is a fully Chinese food court,

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:13.640
four or five different stalls
that you can choose from,

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.360
different Chinese dishes to order.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.790
And then just communal seating tables.

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:19.790
One of the most famous things to eat here,

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:21.590
and maybe one of the
most famous unique things

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:24.870
to eat in Chinatown is the Clam Bee Hoon.

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:27.746
So it's noodles on the bottom, with a clam

00:24:27.746 --> 00:24:32.630
broth gravy over noodles,
and that's exactly what

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:35.395
I came here to eat, what I just ordered.

00:24:35.395 --> 00:24:37.645
(sizzling)

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:51.930
It was very nice that
they allowed me to watch

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:53.920
them as they made the
entire process of this dish.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.067
It took about five minutes,
but what he first did was,

00:24:56.067 --> 00:24:58.200
he took some oil, he
kneaded them in a wok,

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.890
and then he threw in a
handful of sliced ginger,

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:04.110
and he really just
caramelized that ginger,

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:08.080
the aromatic aroma of the
ginger just came fully out.

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:11.370
He tossed in a bunch of
clams into that sauce,

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:15.165
and then, I believe he tossed
in a spoonful of cooking wine

00:25:15.165 --> 00:25:18.210
because I got kind of that wine aroma

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:19.560
that came out of the soup.

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:23.120
Then they just quickly blanched
the noodles, the Mee Hoon,

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:26.320
and then combined, he
drained some of the clams,

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.460
put them onto the top of the noodles,

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:31.050
and then put all the soup on top.

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:33.990
It's very aromatic, it smells incredible,

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:36.380
again, this is a very unique dish.

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:38.914
Man, the dish is called Clam Mee Hoon.

00:25:38.914 --> 00:25:40.793
Yeah, the first thing to do
is just start with that broth.

00:25:45.656 --> 00:25:47.680
(groaning and laughter)

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.050
That's like ultimate comfort.

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:52.660
But as it goes down, you
actually feel the ginger

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:53.790
going down your throat.

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:57.010
It has this complexity of
flavor because of the broth,

00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:59.425
the wine, the ginger, the garlic in there.

00:25:59.425 --> 00:26:01.430
That's really what's
standing out, but then

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:03.570
it's just that slight, it
might be clam broth as well,

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:04.680
I'm not totally sure.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.160
But it's so...

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:09.863
It's slightly thickened,
it's rich, it's just complex.

00:26:14.855 --> 00:26:16.400
(groaning)

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.303
And those noodles, they're rice noodles.

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:23.550
Yeah, the noodles just kinda
go along with the soup.

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:25.870
They're soft, they're thin,

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:27.880
and they just sort of absorb that broth.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.390
Where's my spoon, I'm gonna refill

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:31.803
my clam shell with that broth.

00:26:34.226 --> 00:26:35.320
(slurping)

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:37.443
Making it hard to get all
that ginger and garlic.

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:42.540
Yeah, those are shells
you're just wanna gonna lick

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:45.350
until you get all, every
last strand of ginger,

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:48.113
and every drip of broth out of it.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.083
(upbeat music)

00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:58.270
Oh, that's a broth of wonders.

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:02.560
They're doing a little bit
of construction in this area,

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:05.490
but we have come to the
end of this Kuala Lumpur,

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:07.210
Malaysian food tour.

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:11.440
It's been an incredible day,
and again, I've mentioned this,

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.980
and I probably mention this
every Malaysian food tour

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:17.250
that I ever take, and every
day, but just the fact that

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:21.160
you can eat authentic Malay
food, authentic Indian food,

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:24.160
authentic Chinese food,
one meal after another,

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:28.290
after another, it's just
incredible, and Kuala Lumpur

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:30.360
really is a melting pot, that's
what makes it so special,

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.690
the mix of cultures, food, people.

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:35.270
I wanna say a huge thank
you to Farul and Anwar

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:38.020
for taking us around, they're so friendly,

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:41.600
so hospitable, they're amazing guys.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.680
And I'll have their information

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.400
and their company linked
