<v 1>What'd you think?
Bad stuff was only going to happen.</v>

11
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.600
Other people every once in a while comes few neighborhood shake it off,

12
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.060
but smiling plus.
Um,

13
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.420
anyways,
uh oh.
Did I wake up mad this morning?

14
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.500
What a surprise.

15
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.800
What are unique emotion from the freckled country have come to know and love?

16
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.940
MMM.
By the way,
you know,

17
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.060
now that I went through all of that bullshit to get on fucking Instagram,

18
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.590
the fact that you have to follow 9,000 fucking people or you get to say you just

19
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.670
stared at the same photo every fucking day and it's just really like a,

20
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.280
it's like a mace.
You know,
you're on Twitter,

21
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.480
you just fucking on Twitter now.
You still have to follow people,

22
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.360
I guess.
Now I've got to fucking go on.
Ah,

23
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.260
I can't fucking follow all these fucking gay on dance.
My wife's telling me good.

24
00:01:18.261 --> 00:01:21.470
I Yaron gs.
Follow all your friends and food.

25
00:01:21.471 --> 00:01:26.180
Think of things you're interested in so I can just be another mouth breathing

26
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.130
dopes staring at my fucking phone.
I already,
I already stare at it too much.

27
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:33.920
Um,
you know,

28
00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:36.770
I thought I was going to get on Instagram and all I was going to see his ass and

29
00:01:36.771 --> 00:01:40.190
titties said I just not seeing it right.

30
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.510
It's probably cause I only followed Dean del Ray and Joe Rogan.
So what I see is,

31
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.570
uh,
what did I see us?

32
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.410
So Joe Rogan walking around holding a chicken with another 40 chickens following

33
00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:55.130
him.
All right.
All these years I've known Joe Rogan.

34
00:01:55.131 --> 00:01:59.500
I had no idea that he owned chickens.
You know,

35
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.370
it's causing me to reevaluate our entire friendship.
I mean,

36
00:02:03.371 --> 00:02:06.130
I don't know why he would keep that from me.
Does he?

37
00:02:06.131 --> 00:02:08.230
Does he think he can't trust me with that information?

38
00:02:08.231 --> 00:02:12.140
That these are the kinds of things I'm going to ask him
the next time.

39
00:02:12.141 --> 00:02:13.310
I think I've had them on here.

40
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.610
<v 0>Okay.</v>

41
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.020
<v 1>I don't fucking know.
Anyways.
And,
and,
and Dean del Ray's in New York,</v>

42
00:02:20.021 --> 00:02:23.120
that's what I know.
That's all I know.

43
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.100
No whores,
no inspirational workout videos.
You know,

44
00:02:31.101 --> 00:02:34.520
where some guys trying to inspire you to work out,

45
00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:36.890
but he's really just wanted to take his shirt off.

46
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.930
You know what's funny about those fucking,

47
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.760
it's Instagram people is beyond the fact that they're doing that show,

48
00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:49.290
the inspirational celebrity where they're just every day,
you know,

49
00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:52.770
acting like they have life all figured out and now they're going to pass these

50
00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:57.270
gems on to you.
Hey,
next time you're thinking outward,

51
00:02:57.271 --> 00:02:59.560
look inward to find the real use.

52
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:04.561
So your truth can be you fucking sent to the stratosphere and shut the fuck up.

53
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.960
And the other one I love,

54
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.170
I love the celebrity fucking standing outside his private jet with this serious

55
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:20.950
look on his face.
How about a smile?
You fucking cunt

56
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.380
standard there,
yo.
This is how we do.

57
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.630
This is my Louis Vuitton luggage.
What a fucking moron.

58
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.920
Gotta Asshole by $5,000 fucking pieces of luggage so some asshole can throw it

59
00:03:38.201 --> 00:03:42.020
in the bottom of a fucking United flight.
Yeah,
no,
I don't know.

60
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.400
You'd have to fly private for the rest of your life and watch your luggage.

61
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:47.830
Just going easy,
easy,

62
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.250
or you could just get a fucking bag that's designed to get the shit kicked out

63
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:56.590
of it.
You can keep all your fucking jewels inside of it.

64
00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.840
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

65
00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.441
<v 1>Oh my God.</v>

66
00:03:59.441 --> 00:04:04.020
If I see one more cont do the photo shoot with all their cars and then there's

67
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.630
the fucking private jet in the background.
What went down?
What is that?

68
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.470
And you know,
just to fucking just put it under,

69
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:15.280
I'm rubbing it in your face that I have more money than you.

70
00:04:15.281 --> 00:04:19.750
Don't fucking do that thing where I'm trying to inspire you to get to my level.

71
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.393
<v 2>Okay.</v>

72
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.160
<v 1>Do you realize everything that has to be involved?
They're like,</v>

73
00:04:26.161 --> 00:04:28.530
you have to fucking call up the fucking airport.

74
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.530
Some poor bastard has to do that.
You have your cars.

75
00:04:31.531 --> 00:04:33.120
It's not enough that you have your cars.

76
00:04:33.121 --> 00:04:34.890
It's not enough that you're flying private.

77
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.570
It's not enough that your luggage costs more than what a lot of people make to

78
00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:43.470
fucking teach kids in public schools.
You have to have all of that.
I mean,

79
00:04:43.471 --> 00:04:47.160
how many fucking drivers do you need to get all your fucking cars out there?

80
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.080
Then you got to figure out what fucking outfit you're gonna wear.

81
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.440
I Dunno.
Anyways,
plowing ahead.

82
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.930
But that is the kind of shit that I want to see.

83
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.600
I actually kind of have this thing going on with,

84
00:05:03.601 --> 00:05:07.800
with friends of mine where we just send each other all of those like photos.

85
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.800
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

86
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.370
<v 1>That poor kid who died there,
the,
the humble brag guy.</v>

87
00:05:12.371 --> 00:05:14.920
He woulda had a fucking field day on Instagram.

88
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.210
Jesus Christ.
I mean,
that's why I kind of went on there.

89
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.460
I just didn't realize it was going to be that much work to try and find all of

90
00:05:24.461 --> 00:05:28.030
those fucking photos because people would just send me them all the time and I

91
00:05:28.031 --> 00:05:31.420
was like,
Jesus Christ,
I'm,
I'm really missing out not being on Instagram.

92
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.500
And then you get on there and I,

93
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.660
I followed Dean del Ray and Joe Rogan and my beautiful wife and that's it.

94
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.490
And Rogan and Dean del Rey,
or normal grounded human beings.
So it's just,

95
00:05:42.491 --> 00:05:43.324
you know,

96
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.940
tell me who to follow.
Okay.

97
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.210
I do enough fucking promotional as other ones.
I just want to see,

98
00:05:53.211 --> 00:05:55.490
I want to see that.
That's the Shit I want to see.

99
00:05:55.491 --> 00:05:59.330
I want to see people that are pretending to inspire me,

100
00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:00.980
but they're really just fucking,
you know,

101
00:06:00.981 --> 00:06:04.990
they want to show me how much money they have or how great is shaped her.
And,

102
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.580
um,
I mean,
why can't everybody be down to Earth like me?

103
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.930
I'm sorry,
I'm just a self involved.
I'm just not as motivated in the gym.

104
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.880
Plus you,
it's fun.
Even if I got shredded,
I mean,
if I took my shirt off,

105
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:23.660
all people would say is like,
dude,
the fucking white.
You are.
Oh my God.

106
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.170
I bet.
What about Mike?
What about my eight pack abs?
Um,

107
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.790
nobody cares.
Um,
all right,

108
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.700
so let's get to my week here.

109
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:39.710
I went and I saw ministry live for the first time.
I saw them,

110
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.570
uh,
down at the,
uh,
the fuck is it?

111
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.620
[inaudible] the house of Blues in Anaheim.

112
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:49.220
And I was meeting some friends down there and they're like,
oh,
we're at the,

113
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.660
and we're at the Ramada my guy,
so I fuck with her at the bar.

114
00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:57.080
So I walk into the Ramada,
go to the fucking bar.
There.
They,
uh,

115
00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.700
there's nobody there.
Turns out I'm at the wrong Ramada.

116
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.080
Who knew there was more than one role model,
whatever the fuck it was,

117
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.470
wherever the hell it was going.
So anyways,
we ended up going over to the,
uh,

118
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.540
to the show and it was just,
it was awesome.

119
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:14.030
Live music was in always will be the shit.

120
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.240
And I got to see them,
uh,
basically play the entire album.

121
00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.370
There are new album Amera can't KKK aunt,

122
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.320
um,
and Al Jourgensen as always,
just fucking crushing it,

123
00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.390
fucking crushing it,
man.
You know,

124
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.710
there's front men and then there's front still has the passion,

125
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.320
Silky,
you know,
got the fucking crowd going.
You're looking around,
you know,

126
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:42.580
a lot of people like my age by the,
like the fucking fourth song,

127
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:47.410
there was a mosh pit.
I stayed clear of it.

128
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.790
I definitely stay clear of it,
but they got a bunch of,
uh,

129
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.820
I think they're on like a 25 city tour right now.
And they,

130
00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:58.240
they did a Anaheim and then Oxnard,

We promote a couple of their dates.

132
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.850

Why is my Internet so fucking slow?

137
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:20.420
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

138
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:24.540
<v 1>It'd be funny if they actually had it run at the same speed as your intellect</v>

139
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:28.760
and you couldn't get mad anymore.
It's like,
well,

140
00:08:28.761 --> 00:08:31.700
it's because I'm a fucking asshole.
I'm dumb.
All right.

145
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:53.330
And then when they go into end to April,
they're going to be in,
uh,

146
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:57.420
Montana,
Nebraska,
Chicago,
Illinois.

147
00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:03.120
A couple of nights there.
Cincinnati,
grand rapids,

148
00:09:03.121 --> 00:09:06.810
Michigan,
Indianapolis,
Toronto,

149
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:12.570
Mario,
when they're playing great places.
BOSTON,
April 17th,

150
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:18.780
um,
a couple of nights there.
Portland,
Maine,
Jesus,
they go going everywhere.

151
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.300
You got to catch them in.
That runs through

152
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:27.270
the fuck is,
it runs through the end of April as far as what they have here.
Um,

153
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:30.240
all right,
back to the podcast here.

154
00:09:30.241 --> 00:09:34.800
So old freckles forgot that it was formula one season and unfortunately somebody

155
00:09:34.801 --> 00:09:38.010
on Twitter said,
hey,
you excited for this weekend?
I was like,
Oh shit,

156
00:09:38.011 --> 00:09:41.790
that's right.
And because it's now not on NBC sports,

157
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:46.530
the ESPN cons took it over and God knows they'll fuck it up somehow.

158
00:09:46.531 --> 00:09:48.180
That's what I thought they were going to do.
I've got to admit,

159
00:09:48.181 --> 00:09:52.110
I watched what I got of the race.
I thought they did a good job,

160
00:09:52.111 --> 00:09:56.430
although I don't understand why we'll Buxton isn't there now they have like this

161
00:09:56.431 --> 00:09:57.840
comedy team or some shit.

162
00:09:57.841 --> 00:10:01.260
They got two people down there who then throw it over to another guy.

163
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:03.780
You think ESPN would try to save money

164
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.770
and not fucking hire three people for the job?

165
00:10:07.771 --> 00:10:11.850
That one guy was doing outstandingly since I've been watching,
but a,

166
00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:13.440
I don't run this shit.
So anyways,

167
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:18.470
I fucking go on and my cable box and I go to record the race and I don't know

168
00:10:19.471 --> 00:10:23.250
what happened.
All I recorded was the pregame,

169
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.730
which ended up getting me like the first 10 laps of the race.

170
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:31.260
So I missed the fucking race.
Uh,
but then I went on and I read all about it.

171
00:10:31.261 --> 00:10:35.220
First thing that I noticed was the new,
the uh,
Jesus Christ.
I'm stuttering here,

172
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:39.390
their new design of the,
uh,
the cocktail.
I'm like,

173
00:10:39.391 --> 00:10:42.780
what the fuck is that thing that's like in the driver's line of sight.

174
00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:47.520
And they got this new halo thing that they got going on.
Um,

175
00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:51.150
I guess for a years since like 2010 or 11,
they'd been trying to figure out,

176
00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:55.110
you know,
cause it's the open cockpit,
people smashing into walls,

177
00:10:55.111 --> 00:10:58.110
tires and bolts go fly in.
These guys that drive in,
you know,

178
00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:01.740
upwards of a hundred fucking 80 miles an hour.
You get hit with a scroll,

179
00:11:01.741 --> 00:11:05.640
you know,
could go right through your helmet.
India fucking head.
I don't know.

180
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.390
They've been trying to figure out how to protect them,
you know,

181
00:11:09.391 --> 00:11:11.790
and then all everybody in the crowd's like,
well hey man,

182
00:11:11.791 --> 00:11:15.680
don't put it like make it look like a fighter jet man where you're like is,

183
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:19.380
he's always been open cockpit man.
So everybody in the crowd,

184
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.170
you know,
they want to see,
it's like,
listen,

185
00:11:22.171 --> 00:11:24.900
if we're going to sit here along this fucking fence in,
at any point,

186
00:11:24.901 --> 00:11:27.030
a washer can come flying off the car,

187
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.860
go through my eye socket and into the back of my brain,
me,

188
00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:34.950
at least you can do is with your fucking almant driver out in an open cockpit.

189
00:11:34.951 --> 00:11:36.750
So they decided

190
00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.990
to come up with this new design.
Uh,
the halo car pick design,

191
00:11:42.991 --> 00:11:46.170
which is supposed to,
uh,
looks like a giant piece of plastic to me.

192
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.780
It's probably made out of carbon fiber.
Um,
but if a deli that will stop a,

193
00:11:51.781 --> 00:11:56.781
a tire from smashing you in the fucking head and killing you,

194
00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:01.330
nobody wants that.
Right?
I don't think so.
So anyways,

195
00:12:01.331 --> 00:12:03.940
I saw at the beginning of the race and as always,

196
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.290
Lewis Hamilton got the pole position.
It help.

197
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:10.090
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

198
00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:10.923
<v 1>And uh,</v>

199
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:15.730
the race starts and he gets to the first corner first.

200
00:12:15.731 --> 00:12:19.360
So obviously he's going to win the fucking race.
That's how it works.

201
00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:23.200
And even one of the announcers stupidly said,
well,
you know,

202
00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:27.490
history has shown that whoever wins the first race of the year usually goes on

203
00:12:27.491 --> 00:12:28.780
to win the championship.

204
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:33.040
And I don't know if that was a comment on how much lack of fucking passing there

205
00:12:33.041 --> 00:12:38.041
is or the fact that basically Mercedes and Ferrari have such superior engines

206
00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.670
that you don't,
nobody else can compete with them.

207
00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:46.060
You know,
I mean,

208
00:12:46.061 --> 00:12:51.061
I know other teams like the American team Haas has Ferrari engines,

209
00:12:51.731 --> 00:12:56.140
but that's like this shit one.
Like they get the z 28 engine,

210
00:12:56.141 --> 00:12:59.710
we get the fucking rally sport,
um,

211
00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.010
just for white trash people from the 70s.
Um,

212
00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:08.710
so anyways,
uh,
I guess what happened,

213
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:11.470
Sebastian Vettel one,
the uh,

214
00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:16.530
on the Australian Grand Prix for Ferrari who went back to the Ferrari red or I

215
00:13:16.961 --> 00:13:20.290
guess less white in their car.
The car's definitely look different,

216
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:21.730
looked like at different color red.
And I was like,

217
00:13:21.731 --> 00:13:26.410
there's no way that there's like a specific read the Ferrari has to be,

218
00:13:26.411 --> 00:13:30.240
but it turns out they just had less white in the car this year.
Uh,

219
00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.130
they went on to win it because,
um,

220
00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:37.450
their Mercedes team I guess fucked up where,
uh,

221
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:39.250
Lewis Hamilton went into Pitt.

222
00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:43.660
They thought they had enough space between the fucking second place and first

223
00:13:43.661 --> 00:13:46.870
place he was going to get out of the pit first or something like that.

224
00:13:46.871 --> 00:13:49.780
I don't know.
Oh No,
he was out on the track.
I just saw the highlight.

225
00:13:49.781 --> 00:13:53.020
I don't fucking know.
And they screwed up,
but you know,
it's fucked up.

226
00:13:53.021 --> 00:13:54.640
They blame their software.

227
00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.750
So it's just like,
is there any sort of like,

228
00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.070
I dunno,
racing going on.

229
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:09.140
So they got some computers looking where the fucking Sebastian Vettel's car is

230
00:14:09.141 --> 00:14:12.010
in the pit and wow.
How fast they have to be going.
What tar though?

231
00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:13.880
The computer figures all of that out.

232
00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:20.300
You got an APP and evidently the APP shit the bed and uh,

233
00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:25.390
that'll got out first.
You know,
Hamilton,
he's always fucking sell was

234
00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:31.270
[inaudible] you right.
I love Hamilton,
but he gets so fucking,
he go,

235
00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:36.020
he just starts bleeding and whenever you fucking losers.
Um,

236
00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.760
I remember last year something happened in qualifying and then he just sat in

237
00:14:40.761 --> 00:14:43.830
his car for like fucking maybe when,

238
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.760
when when you were a kid and he got mad at your parents or whatever and they got

239
00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:48.680
out of the car,
went in the house.
You're trying to make a point.

240
00:14:48.681 --> 00:14:50.240
You just sat in the car in the driveway.

241
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:54.590
They didn't give a shit to let Greg how's,
we'll be quiet.

242
00:14:54.591 --> 00:14:58.160
But that's your fucking complainant ass in here.
Um,

243
00:14:58.161 --> 00:15:02.240
so he ended up winning Ferrari one.
Sebastian Vettel came in first,
uh,

244
00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:07.260
a soaking Lewis Hamilton came in second Kimmy Reagan and eight and drive anybody

245
00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:12.200
off the track came in third.
And,
uh,
Ricky Ricardo,
Daniel Ricardo came in,

246
00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:17.030
uh,
the hometown favorite Cayman in fourth place.

247
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:20.960
And what's his face?
Valtteri bolt.
Haas,
I guess he crashed,

248
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:24.680
you're in qualifying and was given us five spot penalty for,
uh,

249
00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:26.030
cause he changed a gearbox.

250
00:15:26.031 --> 00:15:28.790
He started in 15th and then ended up finishing eighth.

251
00:15:28.791 --> 00:15:33.791
But I think the real big story was how well the USA team with their [inaudible]

252
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:39.200
fucking Ferrari engine,
that Ferrari threw up in their back dumpster,

253
00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.800
um,
was fucking killing it in the beginning.

254
00:15:42.801 --> 00:15:45.110
We were like in fourth and sixth place at one point.

255
00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:49.400
The part of the only part of the race that I saw.
And then,
uh,
I got all excited,

256
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:52.430
you know,
to look up to see where we finished.

257
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:56.090
We finished 19th and 20th with two,
not one,

258
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:58.340
but two did not finish

259
00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:02.630
I guess.
Evidentaly uh,

260
00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:07.700
we know how to take the tire off,
but we don't know how to put it back on

261
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.600
twice in the same race.
One of the hottest cars went in.

262
00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:15.970
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

263
00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:20.730
<v 1>To get the tire change their way.
They put the fuck guitars back.
God,</v>

264
00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.870
three out of four were on,
but one wasn't.

265
00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:28.860
They did that the first time and then the fucking mechanical screwed it up was

266
00:16:28.861 --> 00:16:30.860
hilarious.
They cut to the cut to the,
uh,

267
00:16:30.861 --> 00:16:34.130
the pit team and he just walked out of the camera shop.
Why?

268
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:37.710
Then he went into the bathroom and closed the door and probably throw up that he

269
00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.220
cost his team,
one of the cars,
you know,
and then the fucking,

270
00:16:41.221 --> 00:16:44.160
then they turned around and they did it again.
But uh,

271
00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:48.360
they're keeping that Chin up there saying,
you know what?
Well A,
you know,
if,
uh,

272
00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:53.340
you know,
just stick.
What would happen if we actually put the bolts back on?

273
00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:00.480
I'll tell you if Rory Mercedes better look out because Ya,

274
00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:04.340
we're going to be practicing how to take a tire on and off for when we get that

275
00:17:04.341 --> 00:17:04.801
down.

276
00:17:04.801 --> 00:17:09.801
I'm telling you things are going to be real shook up in the a four to six

277
00:17:10.051 --> 00:17:14.100
positions this year.
Yeah.
Boy,

278
00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:18.450
you know what it is.
We're Americans.
We don't give a shit.
Okay.
Cause this,

279
00:17:18.451 --> 00:17:22.710
this whole fucking Duh left turns and right turns the we have land over here.

280
00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:25.170
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

281
00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.870
<v 1>Fucking assholes in Europe and everywhere else around the world.</v>

282
00:17:27.871 --> 00:17:29.610
You're all fucking over populated,

283
00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:34.740
driving around fucking on an old cow paths.
Um,

284
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:39.540
that's all I got.
What else can I do?
What do you do when you completely screw up?

285
00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.810
You know what you do,
you make fun of the rest of the world.

286
00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:48.680
That's exactly what you do.
Alright,
let's get into some happier American news.

287
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:52.530
The Boston Bruins,
once again were down.
They were down two to nothing to

288
00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:54.680
the Goddamn Dallas Stars.

289
00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:59.680
So down in fucking Dallas now they used to be the Minnesota north stars.

290
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:01.463
Okay.

291
00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:07.970
And it was an eclectic group of incredibly normal looking people in the crowd.

292
00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:15.010
Okay.
And,
and the Minnesota people,
nice people,

293
00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:18.380
the kind of people you say hello to,
or if you Philly fan,

294
00:18:18.381 --> 00:18:21.670
she throw full beers at right.

295
00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.720
Then they moved down to fucking Dallas.
Okay.

296
00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:29.570
The fake titty capitol of the world.

297
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:31.490
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

298
00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:32.323
<v 1>All right.
You know,</v>

299
00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:36.280
you know silicone valley out there where they do all the fucking computer shit,

300
00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:37.750
you know,

301
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:41.500
an Apple's big fucking all look around building with the forest in the middle of

302
00:18:41.501 --> 00:18:43.750
it.
Um,

303
00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:48.160
that's where all the computers shit happens down in Hollywood's where all the

304
00:18:48.161 --> 00:18:51.350
movies get made out in Arizona's where they,

305
00:18:51.351 --> 00:18:53.860
they don't want to celebrate Martin Luther King Day

306
00:18:55.500 --> 00:19:00.130
New Mexico's where they shop breaking bad.
And then you get out to Dallas,
Texas.

307
00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:01.293
Okay.

308
00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:05.890
And you basically you have Dealey plaza and you have fake titties that is

309
00:19:05.891 --> 00:19:06.730
fucking Dallas.

310
00:19:06.731 --> 00:19:11.731
And then you have a bunch of shiny four door pickup trucks that has never seen a

311
00:19:11.771 --> 00:19:15.790
day of blue collar work driving around out there.
I don't know why.
I Dunno.

312
00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:19.860
Why you taking,
they get themselves Cadillac.
Um,

313
00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:24.490
everybody's acting like they got a ranch.
Um,
anyways,

314
00:19:24.491 --> 00:19:25.001
we went down,

315
00:19:25.001 --> 00:19:29.620
then we played them and we were down two to nothing and we score three goals in

316
00:19:29.621 --> 00:19:31.750
the third fucking period.
It was just,

317
00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.200
and of course I missed the game cause I got the kid now I was at a,

318
00:19:36.201 --> 00:19:38.830
I was at a birthday party,
a great birthday party,

319
00:19:38.831 --> 00:19:41.890
went out to a fucking farm and all of that had an awesome time.

320
00:19:41.891 --> 00:19:44.440
But I didn't get to see the game.
And I saw Tim shallows,

321
00:19:44.441 --> 00:19:48.950
fucking filthy shorthand for nice feed from Brad Marshawn,

322
00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:51.640
a pasta knock at the game winner.

323
00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:56.410
And it seems even though you know Theresa Persia,
Ron's out with a broken foot.

324
00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:01.440
I Dunno if Chara his back last game I saw he fell the way I used to fall when I

325
00:20:02.351 --> 00:20:05.860
was public at like a public skating rink.
You know what I mean?

326
00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:10.300
Will you try to stop and then you catch an edge and all of a sudden you go like

327
00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:15.210
headfirst,
do a face plant before the board's mercifully stopped.

328
00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:19.090
You usually knocked down like a five year old trying to learn how to figure

329
00:20:19.091 --> 00:20:23.150
skate.
Uh,
I'm trying to say we have a lot of injuries,
but we're still winning.
Uh,

330
00:20:23.151 --> 00:20:24.370
the Celtics on the other hand,

331
00:20:24.371 --> 00:20:27.370
Kyrie Irving is going to be out three to six weeks.

332
00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:31.390
Sports Illustrated's website is telling me I don't need to panic.

333
00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:35.140
Toronto's going to get the number one seed and we're probably going to play some

334
00:20:35.141 --> 00:20:38.650
shit bomb fucking team and he'll be back by the end of it.
I don't fucking know.

335
00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:42.610
Uh,
I think Toronto's will come pretty strong.
It's going to be obviously Toronto,

336
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:43.720
Cleveland.
When you think,

337
00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:49.300
when you think and can Lebron put his fucking team on back once again.
Okay.

338
00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:53.800
And get to the finals again while the entire basketball world shits on them and

339
00:20:53.801 --> 00:20:55.480
says how much he's an asshole.
Now mind you,

340
00:20:55.481 --> 00:20:59.440
I've never seen a guy achieve more and get more shit.
I just don't get it.

341
00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:04.150
What more does he have to do?
All right.
He took his talents to south beach.

342
00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:07.770
All right.
He won two championships on a pile on team.
But Daddy,

343
00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:10.510
he went back to Cleveland,
put the fucking team on his back

344
00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:17.740
and beat the Golden State Warriors.
Right.
Right there.

345
00:21:17.741 --> 00:21:18.790
It should have been over.

346
00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:25.020
It was over for Steve Young when he beat the fucking San Diego chargers.

347
00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:27.913
<v 3>Okay.</v>

348
00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:32.360
<v 1>He,
whew.
Uh,
huge.
Was it chuck Humphreys?</v>

349
00:21:32.361 --> 00:21:35.210
You chump freeze Chuck Humphreys.

350
00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:37.453
<v 3>I don't remember.</v>

351
00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.091
<v 1>Be That fucking team.</v>

352
00:21:40.091 --> 00:21:44.560
One of the most boring super bowls there ever was 49 is went out and they had

353
00:21:44.561 --> 00:21:46.090
fucking white pants on and shit.

354
00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:48.353
<v 3>MMM.</v>

355
00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.220
<v 1>And then the monkey's been off his back and nobody ever fucking questioned him</v>

356
00:21:52.221 --> 00:21:54.770
again.
Ever questioned him again.

357
00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:59.060
Even after fucking spygate when he said the Patriots should give up their three

358
00:21:59.061 --> 00:22:02.900
fucking super bowl titles,
you know,

359
00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:05.750
fucking guys on TV,
he's in hall of fame player.

360
00:22:05.751 --> 00:22:09.530
He didn't realize that that was a brand new rule and the Patriots weren't
guilty,

361
00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:12.020
but it was only illegal for one gate.

362
00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:18.050
Nobody gave him shit yet.
They still give Lebron Shit.
Why is that?

363
00:22:18.051 --> 00:22:19.550
Why do you think that is?

364
00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:26.860
Is it because Steve Young is a fucking more,
um,

365
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:29.560
I have no idea.
Anyway,
so I went to this birthday party,

366
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:34.240
a two year old's birthday parties from friends of ours and there was this,
uh,

367
00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.550
went out to the speaking ranches.

368
00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:41.620
We went out to this farm way the fuck out towards Oxnard came a Rio.

369
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:46.063
<v 3>MMM.</v>

370
00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:50.510
<v 1>It was awesome.
It's part of,
you know,
part of Los Angeles.
I very rarely go to,</v>

371
00:22:50.511 --> 00:22:53.690
I fly over it,
but I never fucking actually went out there.

372
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:55.820
It was absolutely beautiful out there,

373
00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:00.410
past the theme you valley and they had all like these animals and stuff.

374
00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:05.880
They're big animal farm and I realized that I am a big fan of Al packers.

375
00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:08.083
You know,

376
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:13.280
there was this brown one just with these giant fucking brown eyes just looking

377
00:23:13.281 --> 00:23:18.110
at you.
A little weird little wema admittedly a little weird,
you know,

378
00:23:18.111 --> 00:23:22.310
they kind of look like llamas.
They like better looking llamas,
you know?

379
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:28.850
Um,
pot belly pig,
which I never realized when people say I go,
you know,

380
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.130
you've got a pot belly.
What an insult that is.
I mean,

381
00:23:31.131 --> 00:23:36.131
these things were fat fucks that belly was Lee was like on the ground.

382
00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:39.763
<v 3>MMM.</v>

383
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:44.920
<v 1>They just like,
they just did fucking pigs.
I mean,
pigs really,
our pigs,</v>

384
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:48.110
they always talk about how smart they are and that type of stuff.

385
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:53.090
I think the level that they eat in the fact that they roll around in their own

386
00:23:53.091 --> 00:23:55.700
shit,
it's just really hard to see the intelligence.

387
00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.233
<v 4>You know what I mean?</v>

388
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:03.240
<v 1>I mean,
I think a lot of fat people get treated the same way.</v>

389
00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:08.190
Do you think if Albert Einstein was a fat fuck,
like

390
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:13.890
I dunno,
rolling around in his own shit.
I mean,
I don't think we win World War II.

391
00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:16.070
What do you guys think?
You care to comment?

392
00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:20.270
Would you like to write into the podcast about that one?
Um,

393
00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.160
I'm just filibustering here.

394
00:24:22.161 --> 00:24:25.460
I got to get this shit done cause I got all kinds of stuff to do today and I'm

395
00:24:25.461 --> 00:24:29.450
waiting for my advertising and my questions to come in and God dammit,
Oh,

396
00:24:29.451 --> 00:24:34.130
the reads is sent.
Oh Shit,
everything's fucking here.
Ready to go.

397
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:39.830
I love it.
All right,
let's download these goddamn things.
Um,

398
00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:44.150
so anyways,
we were at where you're out there and uh,
at that,

399
00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.180
at the birthday party,

400
00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:50.780
you are so fucked up about me lip to fuck all the birthday party stuff.
I,

401
00:24:50.781 --> 00:24:53.810
first thing I did was Alpac as I looked at those things and I'm like,
wow,

402
00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:57.590
those things look like a food source because they said they were from South

403
00:24:57.591 --> 00:24:58.011
America.

404
00:24:58.011 --> 00:25:03.011
So all of that picturing his boa constrictors and God knows what killing those

405
00:25:03.981 --> 00:25:07.400
things,
you know,
or that like the Komodo Dragon,

406
00:25:07.401 --> 00:25:12.401
this time he sat this stock in this giant bull looking thing and did the debt.

407
00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:15.710
Those Komodo dragons,

408
00:25:15.711 --> 00:25:20.360
they have such fucking shit breadth in their mouth is so full of bacteria that

409
00:25:20.361 --> 00:25:22.430
if they,
all they gotta do is just nick an owl.

410
00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.770
An animal just did 10 times its size.

411
00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:29.210
It just need a bite it and then they just follow it around for three days is

412
00:25:29.211 --> 00:25:34.211
that bacteria just slowly fucking kills the thing and I just wish the bull knew

413
00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:39.260
that the second it was bit by that fucking dragon that it was over because then

414
00:25:39.261 --> 00:25:42.530
you just,
you just turn around,
I'll blow.
You're not going to fucking eat me.

415
00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:45.930
Right.
Just go over and kill the fucking thing.

416
00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:50.100
Because the problem with those God damn reptiles and my issue with reptiles is

417
00:25:50.101 --> 00:25:51.900
they don't have the d and chimpanzees is,

418
00:25:51.901 --> 00:25:54.360
they don't have the decency to kill you before they start eating.
Yeah,

419
00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:58.380
they don't know.
Yeah,
they don't like that thing.

420
00:25:58.381 --> 00:26:03.120
Once you collapse it just walks up.
It has no feeling whatsoever,
you know,

421
00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:09.050
which is why chimpanzees and human beings are the worst chimpanzees and human

422
00:26:10.441 --> 00:26:10.780
beings.

423
00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:15.240
The only people I've ever seen get off on the suffering of something else.

424
00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:18.240
Like it actually excites him.
Uh,
I told you,

425
00:26:18.241 --> 00:26:20.640
I think I saw that thing one time when they did for the longest time,

426
00:26:20.641 --> 00:26:24.750
they didn't think chimpanzees,
monkeys,
eight other monkeys,
they disapproved that.

427
00:26:24.751 --> 00:26:26.010
They found out it wasn't true.

428
00:26:26.011 --> 00:26:30.780
And I saw these fucking chimpanzees catch this fucking smaller monkey.

429
00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:32.101
All right.
And the,

430
00:26:32.101 --> 00:26:36.390
he just stood on the thing's fucking back and with his fingers was digging flesh

431
00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.640
out of its back as the other monkey screaming.

432
00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:41.640
And the chip was getting off on a sec,
dude.
Like,
you know,

433
00:26:41.641 --> 00:26:43.020
how fresh does it have to be?

434
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:47.000
Just snap it's little fucking neck and get on with it.
Um,

435
00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:51.600
and ever since then,
I fucking hate chimpanzees.

436
00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:57.370
I hate him.
I hate him as much as I love,
uh,
uh,

437
00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:01.800
gorillas.
But having said that,
I don't want to see chimpanzees ever hurt though.

438
00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.120
You know,
I,
I,
you know,

439
00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:08.610
although I wanted that bowl to fucking destroy that Komodo dragon has it just

440
00:27:08.611 --> 00:27:10.620
kept falling around,
you know,

441
00:27:10.621 --> 00:27:14.370
like some goddamn banker watching a fucking farmer working himself to death,

442
00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:17.940
waiting to take over the land to sell to some other,
fuck.
All right,
Bill,

443
00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:22.160
let's not get that dramatic.
Okay.
It's the wild.
Get Mad at God.
It created it.

444
00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:26.220
Um,

we actually think God looks like us

448
00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:45.460
and actually argue about what it's races or it's sex.

449
00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:47.620
It's the stupidest shit ever.

you only thing worse to have a right employees is the wrong employees.

Is it a service that help you to stop picking the wrong employee?

480
00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:47.740
You know what I mean?
They hire some person who comes in ready to work,

00:29:47.741 --> 00:29:49.000
not showing up with fuck me,

God dammit.
Hey,

531
00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.610
speaking of that,
am I in a Tulsa,
Oklahoma this weekend?

532
00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:02.060
Speaking to southern accents?
Margaret,

533
00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:06.980
I'll be down there on a over there in Tulsa,
Oklahoma.
The brain theater.

534
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:11.150
Yes,
I am March 30th Oh my God,
I love it.
What's today?

535
00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:14.210
Today's the 26 let's see here.

536
00:33:14.211 --> 00:33:18.770
That's Thursday,
Tuesday,
Wednesday,
Thursday,
Friday.

537
00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:22.460
So this say I'm going to be,
um,

538
00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:27.830
at the Brady theater,
Tulsa,
Oklahoma.
And then on March 30,

539
00:33:27.831 --> 00:33:30.620
first I'm going to be down in San Antonio,
Texas,
right?

540
00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:35.740
The stars at night are big and bright deep in the heart of Texas.

541
00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:40.040
What do they have their,
what do they call that thing?

542
00:33:40.041 --> 00:33:43.940
That little fucking river that you,
the riverwalk.

543
00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:48.430
It's actually really relaxing,
you know,
then,

544
00:33:48.431 --> 00:33:51.500
then you don't really ever have to get off and buy anything.

545
00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:54.320
You just fucking sitting there floating around on a God damn boat.

546
00:33:56.180 --> 00:34:00.410
<v 1>That's going to be one of those weird flights where like it should only take me</v>

547
00:34:00.411 --> 00:34:02.330
like an hour to go from fucking Tulsa,

548
00:34:02.331 --> 00:34:05.660
Oklahoma or 90 minutes to San Antonio.

549
00:34:05.661 --> 00:34:08.180
But it's going to take the whole fucking day cause I'm up to like connect

550
00:34:08.181 --> 00:34:12.410
through like Denver or some shit.
Um,

551
00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:16.910
speaking of what she,
I got some shows coming up in Pittsburgh April 6th,

552
00:34:16.911 --> 00:34:18.470
and for whatever fucking reason,

553
00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:22.610
the only direct flight I can get out of La is a southwest flight.

554
00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:28.850
I don't understand Philly and Pittsburgh back in the day,

555
00:34:28.851 --> 00:34:33.740
the only direct flight from La to Philly was on us air.

556
00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:38.390
I don't mind,
I don't mind southwest it until they start telling the jokes,

557
00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:44.090
you know,
and just fucking,
it's so God damn obnoxious because nobody heckles him.

558
00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:47.240
That's what's missing on a southwest flight.

559
00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:51.560
Booing the jokes.
You have such a captive audience.

560
00:34:51.561 --> 00:34:55.100
Everybody's afraid we're going to crash.
You know,

561
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:59.420
for some reason you'd think the steward or the stewardess actually is sliding

562
00:34:59.421 --> 00:35:02.310
the plane so you don't want to give him shit.
Right.

563
00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:04.453
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

564
00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.840
<v 1>Oh God.
That's when I wish I,
you know,
Patrice,</v>

565
00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.550
I could just fucking see him in that.

566
00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:11.820
If he ever saw what those fucking people became.

567
00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:15.620
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

568
00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:16.650
<v 1>He have had called.</v>

569
00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:18.670
<v 0>Okay.</v>

570
00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:20.760
<v 1>He definitely would have fucking heckled.
Um,</v>

571
00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:27.210
I just sit there and he's doing an anger and not even mad at the fucking steward

572
00:35:27.211 --> 00:35:30.480
or stewardess is a,
which I still call them,
by the way.

573
00:35:30.481 --> 00:35:35.430
I don't understand how the fuck that ever became offensive.
You know what I mean?

574
00:35:35.431 --> 00:35:37.110
Or they feel like steward had

575
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:40.913
<v 3>mmm.</v>

576
00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:43.500
<v 1>Like,
I don't know,
come up.
It's to it.</v>

577
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:45.233
<v 3>Okay.</v>

578
00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:50.440
<v 1>Why is,
let me look this up.
Why is</v>

579
00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.760
Stuart is offensive.

580
00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:56.660
<v 3>Okay,</v>

581
00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:57.920
<v 1>I might be wrong.
Here's why.</v>

582
00:35:57.921 --> 00:36:01.940
Flight attendants don't like being called stewardesses.

583
00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:09.390
All right.
Flight attendance.
Oh Man,
they've got an old fucking school one.

584
00:36:09.391 --> 00:36:11.580
Look how hot they used to be.

585
00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:13.673
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

586
00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:17.440
<v 1>I swear to God,
they must've fucking dropped the pay dramatically.</v>

587
00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:22.570
I don't know what they used to be.
Fucking gorgeous.
Unbelievable.

588
00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:24.140
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

589
00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:28.410
<v 1>All right.
Flight.
But the food was way worse.
There's always a trade off,
right?</v>

590
00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:34.860
Um,
flight attendance have a job that holds a lot of prestige in the eyes of most

591
00:36:34.861 --> 00:36:39.360
travelers.
Why?
What,
who?
There's a giant,

592
00:36:39.361 --> 00:36:43.590
vague bullshit statement.
I think that used to be when the,

593
00:36:43.591 --> 00:36:46.950
when they were beautiful women,
it seemed glamorous.
The whole thing.

594
00:36:46.951 --> 00:36:50.610
The pilot seemed like a fucking borderline James Bond.

595
00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:54.060
There's all these sexy women fucking walking around like wow.

596
00:36:54.061 --> 00:36:57.360
They get to go to all of these places before everybody flew him all the time.

597
00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:00.440
<v 3>MMM.</v>

598
00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:04.310
<v 1>People who actually used to dress up when they went on planes wearing suits and</v>

599
00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:08.870
women would,
would get all dolled up and shit.
You know,

600
00:37:08.871 --> 00:37:11.120
this is before they treated you like a fucking animal though.

601
00:37:11.121 --> 00:37:12.950
Then they started treating everybody like animals.

602
00:37:12.951 --> 00:37:17.210
Now people walk in and on in the borderline pajamas anyways,

603
00:37:17.211 --> 00:37:21.320
they get called a lot of different things while doing their jobs.
Waitress,
ma'am?

604
00:37:21.321 --> 00:37:21.681
Hey,

605
00:37:21.681 --> 00:37:26.390
you miss air hostess and Trolley Dolly.

606
00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:31.220
Okay.
You know what?
I have well over a million fucking a frequent flier miles.

607
00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:35.900
I've never heard anybody say waitress.
No one's ever said,
hey,

608
00:37:35.901 --> 00:37:40.310
you air hostess.
Hey Trolley Dolly.

609
00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:44.840
Can I get a fucking drink?
Come on.
I'm sure everybody has this story,
but come on.

610
00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:49.520
I think pretty much everybody's been respectful is certainly after nine 11,

611
00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:54.040
because then all the stewards and stewardesses,
all they have to say is,
uh,

612
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:57.670
why are you being hostile?
Do you not want to fly today?
Yeah.

613
00:37:59.160 --> 00:37:59.630
<v 3>MMM.</v>

614
00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:04.100
<v 1>Anyways,
flight attendants have a job than Obama.
Okay.
Uh,</v>

615
00:38:04.101 --> 00:38:06.680
but one moniker that is pretty much gone out.

616
00:38:06.681 --> 00:38:10.680
The emergency exit door is stewardess.
And here's why I love it.

617
00:38:10.681 --> 00:38:15.080
This person just made up all of this other shit waitress,
ma'am.
Hey you.

618
00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:16.480
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

619
00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.880
<v 1>trolley Dolly just made up all of that shit.</v>

620
00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:22.840
So they could get to the stewardess part.
All right.

621
00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:28.140
I think it's safe to say that a strip tease ad for an airline like this one from

622
00:38:28.271 --> 00:38:32.450
Braniff international airways below would not fly today.
Yeah.

623
00:38:32.451 --> 00:38:37.000
A lot of things from back then wouldn't fly today.
Uh,
at least not in America.

624
00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:42.220
Oh,
look at that.
Um,
but this type of ad,

625
00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:45.910
which most would now consider objectifying towards women

626
00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:47.810
<v 2>yeah.</v>

627
00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:50.270
<v 1>Was the only way to go in</v>

628
00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:56.060
the sex cells day.
Okay.
Sorry.
I was thinking about clicking on the video.

629
00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:56.811
I was doing the math,

630
00:38:56.811 --> 00:38:59.900
whether I could do that and not get in trouble because I'm advertising on this.

631
00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.180
Sorry.
Let me go back to trying to read this.
Uh,

632
00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:06.680
was the only way to go in the sex cells day of the early jet age.
Oh yeah.

633
00:39:06.681 --> 00:39:09.230
Because they don't use sex to sell anything anymore.

634
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:14.420
A Braniff was hugely popular in its heyday.
Uh,

635
00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:18.260
their flight attendants,
wars psychedelic trends from some of fashions,

636
00:39:18.261 --> 00:39:20.720
top designers such as

637
00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:27.340
Emilio Pucci.
Oh,
he fell off.
I never heard of that fucking guy.

638
00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:30.610
Pacific southwest airlines was another airline ever.

639
00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:34.490
I'm going to watch this fucking video.
Let's see what's going on here.
Uh,

640
00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:39.540
Pacific southwest airlines was another airline press start to play with color of

641
00:39:39.711 --> 00:39:40.990
course advertising.

642
00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:45.580
And there's a bunch of sexy women winking at me and all this using sex to sell.

643
00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:47.450
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

644
00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:48.830
<v 1>In 2018.</v>

645
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:50.270
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

646
00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:54.150
<v 1>What is going on here?
Is this another ad?</v>

647
00:39:54.151 --> 00:39:57.720
This is an ad for Disneyland.
I'll,
you know what,
go fuck yourself.

648
00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:03.660
Fuck this video.
And is this just clickbait?

649
00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:06.660
Is that what I've done here?
Um,

650
00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:10.420
was it another and can I take some something right now?

651
00:40:10.421 --> 00:40:13.510
I guarantee you all these fucking hotties that were on this airline,

652
00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:15.360
they weren't the ones that bitched.

653
00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:18.880
It was ugly women that couldn't get the fucking job.
I am so sick of like,

654
00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:23.010
there's certain jobs you should just be good.
Lucky.
Okay.
And as a fucking,
uh,

655
00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:27.160
unsightly human being,
I feel like I can say this shit right.

656
00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:33.170
Hey.
Yeah.
Can you walk into a restaurant?
You want to see somebody good looking,

657
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:38.320
you know,
hotel,
gym,

658
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:40.900
all of that Shit,
this fucking thing.

659
00:40:40.901 --> 00:40:45.220
Now that you don't have to be good looking and you could be like,
uh,
you know,

660
00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:50.110
overweight and all of that stuff is,
that's really not helping out fat people.

661
00:40:50.111 --> 00:40:52.210
I can tell you that yes,
they're getting a job,

662
00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:57.340
but they're still eating their way to a fucking early grave who doesn't want to

663
00:40:57.341 --> 00:41:01.570
live.
It's sort of what you're doing is as much as you're giving them a job,

664
00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:06.340
you're also in this roundabout way in each kind of doing this assisted suicide,

665
00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:10.300
you're kind of a part of it,
right?
In a food sense.

666
00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:15.430
I don't know what I'm talking about,
but I'm going to continue speaking.
Um,

667
00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:19.470
Pacific southwest airlines was another airline that advertise the attractiveness

668
00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:24.370
of its flight attendants.
They introduced the miniskirt in 1965 in our book,

669
00:41:24.371 --> 00:41:29.371
long legs and short nights form a PSA flight attended Maryland trips said they

670
00:41:30.341 --> 00:41:34.610
used to be a distinction between flight attendance and stewardesses.

671
00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:39.500
Flight attendants were there for safety while stewardesses were there to be eye

672
00:41:39.501 --> 00:41:43.940
candy,
flirt and served drinks.
Yeah,
that's your job.

673
00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:49.220
The pilot passes out.
Do you know how to fly the fucking plane?

674
00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:54.140
We'll then start waking it.
People,
this sweetheart,
um,

675
00:41:55.220 --> 00:42:00.220
she noted stewardesses were not allowed to do pa announcements because nobody

676
00:42:00.321 --> 00:42:04.100
could understand them.
I'll get this to get a little weird,
therefore,

677
00:42:04.101 --> 00:42:08.180
let's face it.
They were,
they were along for the ride.
Now.
They weren't.

678
00:42:08.181 --> 00:42:11.060
They were like,
they were serving drinks.
Maryland,

679
00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:15.800
trich Schwartz contacted me to let me know that I had misunderstood a quote and

680
00:42:15.801 --> 00:42:18.920
there was not a distinction between stewardesses and flight attendants.

681
00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:23.360
They merely changed the job titles once more men joined the industry.

682
00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:28.880
Yeah.
These were called stewards when she referred to stewardesses as they,

683
00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.530
because she was one herself.

684
00:42:30.531 --> 00:42:33.380
I miss interpreted that to mean that there were actually two different jobs,

685
00:42:33.381 --> 00:42:36.080
so this guy really doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about.
Oh,
this woman,

686
00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:41.550
what am I reading here?
I don't even know many modern and dare I say,

687
00:42:41.551 --> 00:42:46.160
older flight attendants now considered stewardess a derogatory term towards

688
00:42:46.161 --> 00:42:50.880
their profession and even their personal virtue because they take their job more

689
00:42:50.881 --> 00:42:51.481
seriously.

690
00:42:51.481 --> 00:42:56.060
That being there is simply too to serve as eye candy.

691
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:58.290
<v 0>Okay.</v>

692
00:42:58.290 --> 00:43:00.840
<v 1>All right.
I'm done with this fucking article.
All right.</v>

693
00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:05.140
I learned absolutely nothing other than the astounding lack of fucking research.

694
00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:10.620
I mean,
I thought only I did that on my podcast,
this fucking person,

695
00:43:10.930 --> 00:43:14.350
he literally,
his article,
rather than going back and correcting it,

696
00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:16.720
he's fucking corrected himself.

697
00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:20.710
Like he writes the article and I realized I fucked up and he's just continuing

698
00:43:20.711 --> 00:43:21.544
on.

699
00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:30.350
Yeah.
I mean,
at the,
at the end of the fucking day,
like this is just,

700
00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:36.960
I think what really fucking happened was flying back then was glamorous.

701
00:43:38.350 --> 00:43:43.230
Okay.
It was way more glamorous.
You got treated way more.
It was considered an,

702
00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:48.260
an an an amazing luxury to be able to fly.

703
00:43:48.271 --> 00:43:52.170
Now.
Everybody,
everybody fucking flies.
They,
Jamey in the back,

704
00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:57.400
you know,
you have to pay for food.
I mean,

705
00:43:57.401 --> 00:44:02.230
back then it was like coffee tea or me was,
was,
that was basically the,

706
00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:07.920
uh,
the vibe back that,
you know what I mean?
And they're acting like,

707
00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:10.080
<v 0>yeah,</v>

708
00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:13.130
<v 1>I dunno.
I Dunno what they're active,
they're,
they're acting like a that</v>

709
00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:16.023
<v 0>yeah.</v>

710
00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:19.510
<v 1>That there weren't some fucking women that that was an appealing job to,</v>

711
00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:22.360
not everybody has a dream.

712
00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:26.670
<v 0>Okay.</v>

713
00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:28.140
<v 1>That's,
you know,
something that's,</v>

714
00:44:28.141 --> 00:44:32.580
maybe that's what's going on right now was fucking all of these medias is that

715
00:44:32.581 --> 00:44:36.810
everybody's acting like they're fucking Joe Montana.
You know what I mean?

716
00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.160
That they're like an Oscar winner.

717
00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:42.270
Most of us would just put background that said,

718
00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:45.710
where that guy in the fucking middle seat staring at the,

719
00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:47.700
some woman serving them peanuts,

720
00:44:47.701 --> 00:44:50.640
that is way out of their league that you'd never have the balls to talk to.

721
00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:56.010
Not now.
Everybody's a winner according to Oprah.

722
00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:59.400
You could do whatever you want.
It's going to be great.

723
00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:01.020
All your dreams are going to come true.

724
00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:05.010
Nobody's going to try to steal your ideas.
There's plenty of room for everybody.

725
00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:07.510
<v 3>Top of the mountain.
Um,</v>

726
00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:11.810
<v 1>I,
that's just not the case.
I hate to say that.</v>

727
00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:14.690
If just go out and look at a mountain,
just look at the shape of this.

728
00:45:14.691 --> 00:45:18.920
Plenty of room down the bottom.
There's a,
you know,
there's less,

729
00:45:18.921 --> 00:45:22.400
but still a lot of room in the middle.
But as you keep going higher and higher,

730
00:45:22.401 --> 00:45:27.200
you know,
it's,
I dunno,
I don't even know what I'm talking about.

731
00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:29.660
I still don't understand why.
So basically

732
00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:33.740
flight attendants wanted to,

733
00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:35.180
<v 0>okay,</v>

734
00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:37.190
<v 1>they're still doing the same fucking job.</v>

735
00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:43.890
I Dunno.
Maybe now they,
they actually know CPR or some shit like that,

736
00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:49.550
that took a couple of Mas classes.
Um,

737
00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:52.130
but you know,
what are they,
what are they going to do?
You know what I mean?

738
00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:55.160
I mean,
if like some terrorists go to take over the plane,

739
00:45:55.250 --> 00:45:57.890
do they also have like Chinese stars that they're allowed to bring onto the

740
00:45:57.891 --> 00:46:01.890
fucking plane?
Um,
please.
People,

741
00:46:01.891 --> 00:46:04.080
I don't want to be called a comedian anymore.

742
00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:09.000
I think that's offensive because people just feel like I'm going to have a

743
00:46:09.001 --> 00:46:13.350
lampshade on my head.
I would now like to be called a,

744
00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:18.780
uh,
a humor doctor,
doctor humor something,

745
00:46:18.781 --> 00:46:22.800
or I'll come up with it.
I don't,
I don't want to,
um,

746
00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:26.370
I think it's very sexist.
Just be called the comedian.

747
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:29.623
<v 3>MMM.</v>

748
00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:35.130
<v 1>I Dunno why.
You know,
other languages have male and female things.</v>

749
00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:37.170
I think that's the thing that made it my business to comedian.

750
00:46:37.171 --> 00:46:41.590
They don't wanna be called a comedian.
We have a comedian coming to the stage.

751
00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:43.870
Look,
why do you have to just make a distinction?

752
00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:46.493
<v 3>I Dunno.</v>

753
00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:50.310
<v 1>Why did,
why did you,
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I'm just,</v>

754
00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:52.670
can we get a gender neutral microphone was up the,

755
00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:53.730
that's probably gonna be the next thing.

756
00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:57.210
Maybe that microphones are shaped too much.
Like dicks.

757
00:46:59.110 --> 00:47:03.510
They can have more
of a,
like a hermaphrodite style one.

758
00:47:03.511 --> 00:47:08.040
You can have like a dick coming out of vagina.
Uh,
you know,

759
00:47:08.041 --> 00:47:13.041
something may be like those old school Elvis once you get to have that and just

760
00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:17.520
bad like a,
I don't know what you speak into.
Looks like a clip.
I don't know.

761
00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:21.840
Is this technically even like still a podcast?

762
00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:25.650
Let me just get to the questions this week that went nowhere by the way.

763
00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:28.510
And I know a lot of it was ignorant and,
uh,

764
00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:33.210
I think I stand by it.
Um,
all right,
let's get to the,
uh,

765
00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:37.440
let's get to the questions here.
Jesus fucking Christ.

766
00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:39.560
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

768
00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:41.650

00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:43.310
<v 1>yeah.
Do that then.</v>

770
00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:45.350
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

771
00:47:45.350 --> 00:47:49.310
<v 1>Become a pilot.
Run an airline.
You want respect you that okay.</v>

772
00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:51.490
You fucking do that is be Ellie's police.

773
00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:54.880
People on special teams all of a sudden want to be treated like quarterbacks.

774
00:47:54.881 --> 00:47:58.070
I it,
it's just you're not a quarterback.
Sorry.

775
00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:01.460
<v 3>MMM.</v>

776
00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:02.211
<v 1>Oh Shit.</v>

777
00:48:02.211 --> 00:48:07.211
The all things comedy festival is coming back again this year in,

778
00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:12.740
uh,

Just an Internet dushoney all right,
Mr. Rogers movie.
Oh,
I love it.

785
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:42.890
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.
A Beautiful Day in the neighborhood.

786
00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:46.640
Would you be mine?
Could you be mine?
I have always wanted,

787
00:48:46.641 --> 00:48:49.610
I can't believe I remember this.
Have a neighbor just like you.

788
00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:53.240
I've always wanted to live with you.

789
00:48:53.241 --> 00:48:56.600
So let's make the most of this beautiful day.

790
00:48:56.770 --> 00:48:57.603
<v 3>E,</v>

791
00:48:59.170 --> 00:49:01.700
<v 1>don't call them stewardesses and don't say,</v>

792
00:49:01.701 --> 00:49:06.701
hey column flight attendants make it seem like they have a master's degree.

793
00:49:09.110 --> 00:49:11.690
Would you like some fucking peanuts?

794
00:49:11.691 --> 00:49:14.900
You will respect me and my slacks.

795
00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:19.850
Hello Mr Neighbors.
Mr. Rogers movie.
Hey there bill,

796
00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:24.530
I'm writing to you here from Minneapolis and very much looking forward to your

797
00:49:24.531 --> 00:49:28.520
upcoming show here.
You know Becca,
when I was a kid,
you know,

798
00:49:28.521 --> 00:49:31.670
getting treated like shit motivated you to get a better job,

799
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:36.590
not demand that your you fucking be treated with respect that the low level that

800
00:49:36.591 --> 00:49:40.100
you had attained in the job world.
Anyway,

801
00:49:40.101 --> 00:49:44.120
I was wondering if you heard about the movie being made about Mr. Rogers

802
00:49:44.121 --> 00:49:46.550
starring Tom Hanks is Fred Rogers.

803
00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:51.050
Coincidentally a movie trailer was also just released for a new documentary

804
00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:55.040
about Fred Rogers that just premiered at Sundance and it looks awesome.

805
00:49:55.310 --> 00:49:59.720
I grew up watching Mr. Rogers as a kid and it's really refreshing to look back

806
00:49:59.721 --> 00:50:03.770
at some of the clips that show what a grape,
one of a kind person he was.

807
00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:07.130
Did you grow up watching Mr. RogersRogers' neighborhood?
Yes I did.

808
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:11.060
Mister McFeely speedy delivery.
And if so,

809
00:50:11.090 --> 00:50:14.420
what were you or your thoughts about them making a movie about him?

810
00:50:14.570 --> 00:50:19.570
Maybe you sh you have a different perspective now that you have a kid because it

811
00:50:19.641 --> 00:50:23.510
seems like there's so much awful shit that kids are exposed to on TV and the

812
00:50:23.511 --> 00:50:26.060
Internet.
And Mr. Rogers was a rare TV show,

813
00:50:26.061 --> 00:50:30.140
which actually helps to become better human beings.
Last but not least,

814
00:50:30.141 --> 00:50:34.130
would you consider auditioning for this shows?
Long time guest,

815
00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:35.540
Mister McFeely?

816
00:50:35.541 --> 00:50:39.860
I think you'd look hilarious in that mailman hat and went with the spectacles

817
00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:43.760
and the mustache.
Thanks for being a great neighbor and go fuck yourself.

818
00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:48.170
I absolutely would play mister McFeely.
Um,

819
00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:54.080
I loved,
I loved Mr. Rogers when I was a kid.
I like sesame street better.

820
00:50:55.490 --> 00:50:56.323
Um,

821
00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:59.960
and there was something about him that did make me a little uncomfortable when I

822
00:50:59.961 --> 00:51:01.880
was a kid.
I will admit that.
No,
you know what?

823
00:51:01.881 --> 00:51:05.690
I didn't like lady Elaine and King Friday.

824
00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:10.590
I liked the trolley when it went into the,
uh,

825
00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:13.880
the make believe land or whatever.
But,
um,

826
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:20.140
I dunno,
Lady Lane and King Friday,
they just used to make me sick to my stomach.

827
00:51:21.730 --> 00:51:25.750
They just weren't as funny and they didn't have the personality of like Ernie or

828
00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:29.740
Grover Harry the cookie monster.
I mean,

829
00:51:29.741 --> 00:51:34.741
there was just those who liked the guys guys have puppets over there on sesame

830
00:51:34.931 --> 00:51:38.260
street.
I just thought it Mr. RogersRogers' neighborhood was,

831
00:51:38.261 --> 00:51:42.270
it was just a little stiff.
But um,
I've,

832
00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:44.440
I imagined that I learned a bunch of great lessons.

833
00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:46.060
I was too young to understand like,
oh,

834
00:51:46.061 --> 00:51:48.700
this guys tried to teach me how to be a better person.
You know,

835
00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:51.490
it was just a kid watching the shit go.

836
00:51:51.690 --> 00:51:54.460
Wouldn't that be cool if we had a trolley in our house and then you could get on

837
00:51:54.461 --> 00:51:59.461
it and it go to a magical neighborhood and avoid king Friday and Lady Elaine,

838
00:52:00.010 --> 00:52:04.240
she was fucking weird looking at too,
right.
I gotta look this up here.

839
00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:08.830
Lady Elaine Lady

840
00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:13.910
Lady.
How do you spell Elaine?

841
00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:20.580
Oh yeah.
Yeah,
she was ugly.
Is dealing with them.
My God.
Lay off the booze

842
00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:25.800
lady,
Elaine Fairchild.
I never knew the last name is a neighborhood.

843
00:52:25.801 --> 00:52:26.850
And mischief maker.

844
00:52:27.090 --> 00:52:32.090
And having learned from the wizard of Lou Povich off the uses or boomerang to

845
00:52:32.981 --> 00:52:35.610
Marangu,
summa rang.
Oh my God,
I forgot about that.

846
00:52:35.611 --> 00:52:39.330
To do things such as rearrange the neighborhood or turn it upside down.

847
00:52:40.350 --> 00:52:43.080
She's credited with the discovery of planet Purpa,
Purpa,

848
00:52:43.081 --> 00:52:45.420
which she found while flying in or something or other.

849
00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:51.910
Well is it,
you know,
that would never happen.
Now that would be considered sexist.

850
00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:56.710
Oh,
why?
Why does the woman have to be the bad person?
Well,

851
00:52:56.711 --> 00:53:01.330
she's in a position of power.
Isn't that enough?
No.
Ah,
what are you doing?

852
00:53:01.331 --> 00:53:05.560
Come on.
Um,
all right.

853
00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:10.690
So I,
I think Tom Hanks is going to do a great job because he always does.

854
00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:12.820
You know,
you look out,
we just said that like,

855
00:53:12.821 --> 00:53:17.680
he's an upcoming actor rather than the two times back to back.
Best actor.

856
00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:22.660
Um,
do I call him an actress now?
Is that progressive?

857
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:27.190
Should I not identify him by his gender?
I don't fucking know.
I don't know.

858
00:53:27.250 --> 00:53:30.870
I don't know what,
what to do right now.
Um,

859
00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:33.780
I think it'd be interesting if they actually get into his,
his whole life.

860
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:39.180
You know,
but if it's just Tom Hanks doing an episode of Mr. Rogers and then

861
00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:44.520
I don't know.
I don't know what,
I don't fucking know.
I watch sports.

862
00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:48.330
Why would you ask me about movies?
All right.
Linkedin business APP.
Dear Billy,

863
00:53:48.331 --> 00:53:49.164
balloon head.

864
00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:56.640
My girlfriend and I have been together,
his girlfriend,
one or two words.

865
00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:01.380
There was two,
one word.
My girlfriend and I have been together for a year.

866
00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:04.500
For the past two months.
She's been out of work

867
00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:09.840
for two months.
It has been using this business app to get work online.

868
00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:15.060
It has never bothered me as of revenue.

869
00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:17.730
I think you said recently

870
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:23.220
as of revenue reverently me,

871
00:54:23.221 --> 00:54:26.100
she has been getting notifications from the APP.

872
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:29.970
I don't know what any of that means.
I didn't think anything of it,

873
00:54:29.971 --> 00:54:34.110
but I noticed that she had gotten a message in the middle of the night.
Oh,

874
00:54:34.111 --> 00:54:38.070
as of recently.
This is a voice text.

875
00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:41.520
Reverend Lee reverently me as of recently,

876
00:54:41.521 --> 00:54:45.780
she has been getting notifications from the APP.
I didn't think anything of it.

877
00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:51.580
Um,
but I've noticed that she has gotten messages,

878
00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:53.400
gotten a message in the middle of the night.

879
00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:57.240
I asked her about it and she always tells me that it's strictly professional.

880
00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:00.900
And that is just business men seeking to employ.

881
00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:04.290
Do you think that APP is just a cover up for meeting men?

882
00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:07.140
She would meet on apps like Tinder.

883
00:55:10.290 --> 00:55:13.770
Um,
I don't know dude,
but it doesn't sound like you fucking trust your,
uh,

884
00:55:13.771 --> 00:55:17.790
your girlfriend,
which is definitely an issue.
So what you have done,

885
00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:22.020
you have to figure out is if you don't trust her because had got saying she

886
00:55:22.021 --> 00:55:23.670
shady or is it some,

887
00:55:23.730 --> 00:55:27.540
some of your own shit that you brought because of a previous relationship or

888
00:55:27.541 --> 00:55:31.950
possibly something that happened to you as a child when you were watching Mr.

889
00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:35.760
Rogers
calling women's steward assists.

890
00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:40.580
Um,
I dunno.

891
00:55:40.590 --> 00:55:44.280
It's possible women are really good at fucking around,

892
00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:48.720
which is why they don't get caught as much as guys do.
Guys,
you know,

893
00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:52.740
guys are the worst,
you know,
we just fucking,
we get caught

894
00:55:57.180 --> 00:56:00.000
anyways.
He wants,
I don't know.
I don't know what to tell you to do there.

895
00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:05.370
So now you've got to start snooping and then if you get caught in your wrong

896
00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:08.280
than what,
where does that leave you?

897
00:56:11.490 --> 00:56:15.840
Just tell her it's making you feel insecure and you would just,
can you just,

898
00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:17.340
you know,
and it's your issue.

899
00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:22.620
Can you just see one of the texts next time it happens and then just say,

900
00:56:22.621 --> 00:56:25.750
sorry,
I dunno.
I just love these oblige.

901
00:56:25.790 --> 00:56:28.780
I was worried that somebody else was still a year.
Passions.

902
00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:32.500
Talk your way out of it that way.
Does that work?
I don't know.

903
00:56:32.530 --> 00:56:36.670
This is not professional advice.
He wants to get married.
I don't.

904
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:42.010
Hey,
built your phone of cynical humor and knowledge that I've admired for years.

905
00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:47.150
Yo,
you are a fount.
Oh Jesus Christ.
So I wanted to ask some advice.
Hey,

906
00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:48.760
this is not professional advice.

907
00:56:48.761 --> 00:56:52.480
My boyfriend proposed two years ago after I said yes.

908
00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:56.710
He said he wanted to keep it a secret since he hadn't met my parents yet,

909
00:56:57.100 --> 00:56:58.840
except via Skype calls.

910
00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:04.060
They live across the country by parents kept canceling their plans to visit last

911
00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:04.060
minutes.

912
00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:08.140
So he planned to visit them for this past Christmas where he would publicly

913
00:57:08.141 --> 00:57:11.980
propose Jay's is,
Chris is the longest proposal ever.

914
00:57:12.490 --> 00:57:15.640
I kept us to seek him for two years.
We only had two fights,

915
00:57:15.641 --> 00:57:17.770
but each time he broke off the engagement,

916
00:57:17.771 --> 00:57:20.080
only do apologize and make up the next day.

917
00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:24.250
One month prior to the trip he says he wants to postpone and proposing due to

918
00:57:24.251 --> 00:57:29.170
finances since we will be moving to another state after I graduate.
I understand.

919
00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:32.950
Uh,
why spend five grand on a wedding.

920
00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:36.820
One was soon need that to get a house while the next day he admitted.

921
00:57:36.821 --> 00:57:41.821
The other reason is because I had gained weight after getting on birth control

922
00:57:42.011 --> 00:57:44.500
and anxiety.
Man,
fuck this guy.

923
00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:50.740
I'm getting a Master's in physics and I have a part time job.

924
00:57:50.741 --> 00:57:54.740
So sorry if I couldn't hit the gym enough.
Uh,
well that's no excuse.

925
00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:57.770
You should also fucking eat well and I'm not saying that about him and your,

926
00:57:57.970 --> 00:58:02.970
your relations should do it for yourself because you really do not want the

927
00:58:04.531 --> 00:58:09.531
health issues that fucking start earliest in your late thirties and into your

928
00:58:10.111 --> 00:58:13.150
forties.
Um,
you know,

929
00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:16.600
I've lost friends to heart attacks that look like they're in the same shape as

930
00:58:16.601 --> 00:58:21.250
me,
but I don't,
you got to get checked up.
Um,
just cause you're busy.

931
00:58:21.251 --> 00:58:22.084
This is what you do.

932
00:58:22.090 --> 00:58:25.780
You fucking cook all your food on the weekend and the g you gotta make that up

933
00:58:25.781 --> 00:58:30.670
fucking priority cause it's going to be stressful enough.
But anyways,

934
00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:35.020
ice,
I still maintain at this point.
Fuck this guy.
Anyways,

935
00:58:35.021 --> 00:58:37.750
that Christmas was so depressing,
but who could I talk to?

936
00:58:38.050 --> 00:58:42.100
The engagement was a secret.
I told him being engaged was a joke.

937
00:58:42.101 --> 00:58:45.640
I don't want to be on this rollercoaster anymore or ever again.

938
00:58:45.850 --> 00:58:49.390
Now he started because he says marriage isn't,
it is important to him.

939
00:58:50.110 --> 00:58:54.790
He does want to marry me.
Just not yet hot.
No thanks.
I'm good.
He said,

940
00:58:54.791 --> 00:58:57.250
well we'll just revisit this later.

941
00:58:57.490 --> 00:59:01.150
Your thoughts from one cynical ginger to another thanks to the left.
Yeah.

942
00:59:01.151 --> 00:59:06.070
Fuck this guy.
Fuck this guy
does.

943
00:59:06.071 --> 00:59:07.210
This is what,
this is what,

944
00:59:08.190 --> 00:59:09.023
<v 0>okay,</v>

945
00:59:09.460 --> 00:59:10.780
<v 1>this guy's an asshole.</v>

946
00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:15.600
I want to postpone the engagement because you gain weight.

947
00:59:15.870 --> 00:59:18.810
That's what the fuck you going to hit your wagon to fuck this guy.

948
00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:23.180
Fuck that guy.
Um,

949
00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:26.270
and you seem really strong and you,
you,
you get,
you get,
you know,

950
00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:27.950
you're getting his master's degree in physics.

951
00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:30.720
You could be out there designing roller coasters or whatever the fuck you're

952
00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:33.980
going to be doing.
You don't need this guy.
By the way,

953
00:59:33.981 --> 00:59:36.200
I watched this thing that I had recorded.
You know,
my wife's,

954
00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:39.320
we got killed when it's stuff on the Dvr,
right?

955
00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:41.540
Whatever the fuck you call it nowadays.

956
00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:44.510
So we had to go back and erase a bunch of shit that I take.

957
00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:47.360
I kept all my Superbowl highlights.
I,

958
00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:51.710
and I kept the Patriots for Seattle and patriots first.

959
00:59:51.711 --> 00:59:55.640
Atlanta had no problem or racing patriots versus eagles.
Um,

960
00:59:56.720 --> 01:00:01.580
and I don't know where those patriots were as giants games went,
Geez.
Um,

961
01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:07.250
Ethel Merman.
All right.
You want to talk about a fucking hilarious human being?

962
01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:12.890
Uh,
I gotta find this fucking thing.
Ethel Merman.

963
01:00:12.891 --> 01:00:14.870
She was all right.

964
01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:19.640
We were watching this fucking thing on the JFK inauguration,

965
01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:24.980
which was supposed to be broadcast by NBC.
And,

966
01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:28.250
uh,
there was a horrific snow storm.
They were in this weird venue.

967
01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:33.020
It was like Frank Sinatra,
Nat King Cole,
Ethel Merman.

968
01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:40.460
Uh,
Milton Berle.
Who else?

969
01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:45.620
Gene Kelly.
Harry Belafonte,
Ella Fitzgerald.

970
01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:51.160
I mean it was crazy lineup and I'm Jimmy Duranti and all this shit.

971
01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:53.390
This was like a,
it was a big deal.

972
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:58.630
This is the first time like marrying Hollywood and politics now where that's led

973
01:00:59.841 --> 01:01:01.640
us is probably a bad thing.
But

974
01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:04.333
<v 2>MMM.</v>

975
01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:07.770
<v 1>It was just on a watching all these performances and everything.</v>

976
01:01:07.771 --> 01:01:12.771
So watch an Ethel Merman and she's literally wearing just like this winter coat

977
01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:18.770
during the performance because she went there for rehearsals and she got stuck

978
01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:23.960
in the snow and couldn't get back to a hotel and she was a republican and still

979
01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:29.370
saying to the president,
it rather than all these fucking Douche is today

980
01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.900
[inaudible] you shit.
Right.
Did she put politics aside?

981
01:01:33.901 --> 01:01:37.790
And she did it and as she was singing near just goes there.

982
01:01:37.830 --> 01:01:40.800
She said something like that.
There's,
there's a fucking there right there,

983
01:01:40.801 --> 01:01:45.360
there is a tough broad.
And I just started laughing and I said,
what do you mean?

984
01:01:45.361 --> 01:01:46.920
She goes,
you could just see it.
She's,

985
01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:51.660
she's been through it all bunch of asshole guys and she survived.

986
01:01:51.661 --> 01:01:53.010
She's seen it all and blah blah.

987
01:01:53.011 --> 01:01:55.470
So I look her up and of course neither was 100% right.

988
01:01:56.030 --> 01:01:57.780
She'd been married like four times

989
01:01:59.490 --> 01:02:03.990
and she was married one time for like three months to earn as Borg night.

990
01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:07.710
And they got divorced.
All they did was argue and she,

991
01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:10.350
one of the things she said was extreme cruelty.

992
01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:15.180
So there's a quote,
I wish I could find the fucking thing.

993
01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:21.480
Um,
let me,
I got to find,
cause I,
cause she it so perfectly.
This is,

994
01:02:21.810 --> 01:02:24.750
you want to talk about somebody hilarious that you've loved to hang out with?

995
01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:30.940
Um,
earnest.

996
01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:35.060
I just put in Ethel Merman.
Earnest cunt.

997
01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:39.050
Ernest Borgnine.
Ethel Merman.
There we go.

998
01:02:40.370 --> 01:02:45.030
The classic Ethel Merman Story.
All right.
Of course,

999
01:02:45.031 --> 01:02:47.850
this is going to be some douche turning it into an entire fucking

1000
01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:51.670
tire fucking blog.

1001
01:02:52.790 --> 01:02:53.300
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1002
01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:54.710
<v 1>God Damn assholes.</v>

1003
01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:03.010
Okay.
Yeah.
So she,
she was in her brief marriage.
Mirman was on some fucking,

1004
01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:04.393
um,

1005
01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:08.630
she was on some fucking movie set and she came home.

1006
01:03:08.631 --> 01:03:12.020
She was all excited because the director had complimented her saying her,

1007
01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:17.030
she had the voice of like a 25 year old,
you know the face.

1008
01:03:17.230 --> 01:03:19.040
It's just like,
she was like 60,
all right,

1009
01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:24.820
35 year old face and a 35 year old figure any she said.

1010
01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:29.780
And then Ernest Borgnine said,
oh yeah,
he goes,

1011
01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:35.000
did he bring up your old content?
And she goes,
no,

1012
01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:39.310
he didn't mention you once.
Something like that.
I Dunno.

1013
01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:43.130
They find that this is,
this isn't written as well.

1014
01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:49.370
And what about your 65 year old cut?
And she said,
nobody mentioned you at all.

1015
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:52.120
I've seen this thing written like five different ways.
She also did it.

1016
01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:57.130
She did a guest star on some set comp and they had a curse jar and she was in

1017
01:03:57.321 --> 01:04:00.230
the middle of whatever sketch they would do that she just stopped.
She goes,

1018
01:04:00.530 --> 01:04:04.580
what the hell is this going?
And then the star of the show was just like,
um,

1019
01:04:04.610 --> 01:04:08.790
Bethel,
you know,
my role that'll cost you a dollar and she just goes out.

1020
01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:12.500
What,
uh,
what would it cost me to tell you to go fuck yourself?

1021
01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:20.060
So Ethel Merman.
Ethel Merman is a,

1022
01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:23.570
I'm a new,
I'm a big fan of hers.
Um,

1023
01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:25.940
unfortunately she passed away a long time ago,

1024
01:04:25.941 --> 01:04:27.540
so you can't go out and have a drink with them,

1025
01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:29.660
but just seemed fucking hilarious.
All right.

1026
01:04:29.661 --> 01:04:33.890
Let me read the last goddamn question here so I can move on with my fucking
life.

1027
01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:36.173
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1028
01:04:36.590 --> 01:04:40.580
<v 1>Why do I keep doing this?
I keep going away from my fucking the questions here.</v>

1029
01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:44.420
This is unprecedented the amount of times I fucked this up and you guys have to

1030
01:04:44.421 --> 01:04:47.840
listen to me,
uh,
on precedent for this podcast,
I should say.

1031
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.710
All right,
content.
Here's the last one.
The last one

1032
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:58.330
is a jealous boyfriend.
I love that the women have finally right now.
All right.

1033
01:04:58.331 --> 01:05:00.940
Hello,
Bill Barr.
I really love your podcast.
Thank you.

1034
01:05:00.941 --> 01:05:04.300
When I was wondering what your thoughts on a situation I am going through.

1035
01:05:04.570 --> 01:05:06.730
This is my first serious relationship.

1036
01:05:06.731 --> 01:05:10.720
My boyfriend and I just moved in about four months ago.

1037
01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:11.761
I have all,

1038
01:05:11.761 --> 01:05:16.761
I have always fucking now that he's been over protective and jealous,

1039
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:21.820
however I it started to progress more and more.
Oh,
get out,

1040
01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:26.080
get out.
I trust him that he's not cheating on me.

1041
01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:28.180
Of course like many other women,

1042
01:05:28.181 --> 01:05:32.260
I can be self conscious and think that maybe he could stray or do better,

1043
01:05:32.261 --> 01:05:35.680
but I've never once accused them of cheating on me.
Not once,

1044
01:05:35.681 --> 01:05:38.530
however he has caused me

1045
01:05:40.550 --> 01:05:43.100
what he has caused me of cheating on.

1046
01:05:43.130 --> 01:05:45.650
He's accused do,

1047
01:05:45.651 --> 01:05:48.710
these are all voice texts he has caused me of cheating on him.

1048
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:50.720
He's accused me of cheating on him multiple times.

1049
01:05:50.930 --> 01:05:55.930
The worst case of when should have been of which he made accusations,

1050
01:05:57.770 --> 01:06:02.450
uh,
was fairly recently.
I just got a full,
a new full time job.

1051
01:06:02.451 --> 01:06:06.680
I was only working part time minimum wage job,
which I'm very excited about that,

1052
01:06:06.681 --> 01:06:11.450
this full time job.
Um,
so that he's not the only one working.

1053
01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:14.270
I feel like I can contribute now.
However,

1054
01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:17.720
he started accusing me of cheating on him with someone at work,

1055
01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:19.310
even though there is no evidence.

1056
01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:23.120
He even started accusing me of cheating on him with his own cousin.

1057
01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:28.430
He's the one that helped me get the job is actually of 10 dump this guy.

1058
01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:32.270
His accusations are not just him speaking,
but yelling,

1059
01:06:32.271 --> 01:06:36.890
hitting walls and scaring me to the point like he might get violent.
Ah,
right.

1060
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:40.070
Here's what should do.
Okay.

1061
01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:45.170
Put a deposit down on another fucking apartment.
Okay.

1062
01:06:45.171 --> 01:06:49.790
One day when he goes to work,
you take a fucking sick day,
all right?

1063
01:06:49.970 --> 01:06:53.450
You get a friend yet clear all your shit out of there.

1064
01:06:55.210 --> 01:06:58.690
Yeah.
Fuck this guy.
Fuck this guy.

1065
01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:02.230
All right?
You don't want to be anywhere near this guy.

1066
01:07:02.231 --> 01:07:05.200
You don't want to be around this guy when you break up with him,
he seems like a,

1067
01:07:05.410 --> 01:07:06.810
I don't like any of this.
Uh,

1068
01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:10.690
he doesn't even want me to wear shorts and we live in this area that gets hot.

1069
01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:14.110
I am not the type of person to show a lot of skins.
However,
when it's hot,

1070
01:07:14.111 --> 01:07:16.330
I would like to wear shorts.
You see what's going on here?

1071
01:07:18.130 --> 01:07:22.000
Sky's taken over your whole life.
I'm just wondering if this,
if his thoughts

1072
01:07:23.930 --> 01:07:27.540
that me wearing shorts is disrespectful to him to the point he is just uh,

1073
01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:29.023
wait a minute.

1074
01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:32.490
I'm just wondering if his thoughts that me wearing shorts as different,

1075
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:37.630
as disrespectful to him to the point is justified breaking up with me over this.

1076
01:07:40.050 --> 01:07:42.010
I am not sure where to draw the line.
Oh,

1077
01:07:42.011 --> 01:07:45.330
you should have drawn the line of while ago.
Let me ask you this.

1078
01:07:45.331 --> 01:07:48.660
If any girlfriend you had was telling you this story,
you would be like,

1079
01:07:48.661 --> 01:07:52.470
get the fuck out.
Right.
I really believe that.
I love and care about him.

1080
01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:55.170
That's the problem.
However,
when he does,

1081
01:07:56.720 --> 01:08:00.230
when love,
when does love turn into more of an obsession?
Also,

1082
01:08:00.231 --> 01:08:03.440
what is considered an abusive or unhealthy relationship?
I would say this.

1083
01:08:03.890 --> 01:08:05.390
I would really like to know your thoughts.

1084
01:08:05.391 --> 01:08:08.090
You are straight up and I believe you'll be able to give some good advice,

1085
01:08:08.091 --> 01:08:12.890
especially since you will not have real bias since you don't know us.
Thank you.

1086
01:08:12.891 --> 01:08:16.070
Yeah,
you should get the files as far as your version.
What's going on?
You should

1087
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:17.180
<v 4>get the fuck out of here.
Okay.</v>

1088
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:22.780
Just the fact that he's choosing you a cheating on him.
Um,

1089
01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:25.610
and what's your,
what his cousin,
which is fucking weird.

1090
01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:29.290
And then yelling and hitting the walls.
I mean,
you're already out.

1091
01:08:29.370 --> 01:08:32.340
You're already gone.
It should be gone.
And now,
uh,

1092
01:08:33.030 --> 01:08:37.920
the fact that he's telling you what you can and can't wear,
fuck this guy.

1093
01:08:38.010 --> 01:08:42.420
So
the problem is,
is moved in with the guy.

1094
01:08:42.421 --> 01:08:45.390
So if you break up with the guy,
what are you going to go into another room?

1095
01:08:45.630 --> 01:08:49.770
And then you gotta worry about this guy,
you know,
doing God knows what.

1096
01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:55.350
Um,
do you have any male friends?
Do you have a brother?
Somebody,
you know,

1097
01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:58.410
they can help protect you when you get your shit out of there?

1098
01:08:58.830 --> 01:09:02.100
I would get another fuck.
I,
I mean,
I,
this is a type of situation.

1099
01:09:02.130 --> 01:09:03.990
I wouldn't fuck you pride.

1100
01:09:03.991 --> 01:09:07.770
I would move back in with my parents if I had to and drive longer to work.

1101
01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:10.370
Get the fuck out of that.
MMM.

1102
01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:17.910
And,
uh,
I'd be,
it's easiest break up ever as far as the reasons.

1103
01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:20.170
Uh,
I dunno,

1104
01:09:20.170 --> 01:09:24.480
cause you don't trust me because you think I'm fucking your cousin to the
points.

1105
01:09:24.750 --> 01:09:28.610
You're a acting like Jeff Goldbloom in the fly and start punching the goddamn

1106
01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:31.410
door jams out.
Oh.
And by the way,

1107
01:09:31.411 --> 01:09:36.000
it's 90 degrees out and I can't wear shorts because you and your fragile ego

1108
01:09:36.001 --> 01:09:36.960
can't fucking handle it.

1109
01:09:36.961 --> 01:09:41.290
And I wouldn't say it this way because this guy sounds like a lunatic.
Um,

1110
01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:46.970
I dunno what,
what could you say that would just make this guy go away?
Just say,

1111
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:47.571
ah,
you know,

1112
01:09:47.571 --> 01:09:52.571
I just decided that I want to get really fat and wear shorts and I didn't want

1113
01:09:53.301 --> 01:09:55.070
to put you through that.
I don't know what to tell you,

1114
01:09:55.071 --> 01:09:59.410
but I would get out of this and when somebody is violent like this,
okay.
Uh,

1115
01:09:59.411 --> 01:10:03.810
I would be concerned about your own safety.
So like I said,
I would take a,
um,

1116
01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:07.053
<v 2>yeah,</v>

1117
01:10:07.190 --> 01:10:10.370
<v 4>this is what you do.
All right.
Yeah,
I figured you,
you sound like you're young,</v>

1118
01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:15.180
so you probably don't have that much shit.
So,
uh,

1119
01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:19.510
I would just,
whatever your friend is that's going to help you move up,

1120
01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:24.710
you put the boxes together over her house.
Okay.
All right.
And then bomp.

1121
01:10:24.711 --> 01:10:29.000
Bomp bomp bomp bomp bomp you fucking go in there.
All right.

1122
01:10:29.001 --> 01:10:32.900
You just act like you go into work and then you don't fucking go to work.

1123
01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:38.670
Okay.
Yeah.
And uh,
I would even tell you boss,
just say,
listen,

1124
01:10:38.730 --> 01:10:43.290
I am living with a guy I have to break up with and I'm afraid he's going to get

1125
01:10:43.291 --> 01:10:47.220
violent.
So he's at work today.
Uh,

1126
01:10:47.290 --> 01:10:49.720
I'm going to act like I'm going to work and I'm going to clear my shit out of

1127
01:10:49.721 --> 01:10:51.910
that.
And I think you should be fine.
And then you guys fucking,

1128
01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.500
and he'd probably be like,
you want some fucking help?
You know,

1129
01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:57.260
cause he's a good dude.
And then also maybe,
maybe he's trying to fuck him.

1130
01:10:58.070 --> 01:11:01.150
Wait a minute.
Maybe your boyfriend's actually making a good point.
No,

1131
01:11:01.230 --> 01:11:02.000
I'm kidding.

1132
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Go in there and I would just clear all your fucking shit out and uh,

1133
01:11:07.191 --> 01:11:11.360
I would fucking,
yeah.
And I would go live somewhere else.

1134
01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:14.760
And,
uh,

1135
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:18.000
then I would have one last conversation with this guy and I would change my cell

1136
01:11:18.001 --> 01:11:22.380
phone number and that's it.
And,

1137
01:11:23.310 --> 01:11:27.330
uh,
I don't know,
depending on where the fuck you live,
maybe you can just,

1138
01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:31.620
he won't be able to find you.
But uh,
yeah,
this is just,
this is good.

1139
01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:32.670
This is the beginning.

1140
01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:36.810
This has the beginnings of someone that's going to stalk you and possibly do

1141
01:11:36.811 --> 01:11:40.990
something fucking horrible.
Fuck this guy.
All right.

1142
01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:45.880
I wish my wife was here to hear this God damn email she's always talking about,

1143
01:11:45.881 --> 01:11:49.720
you know,
I'll fucking difficult a person.
I am,
you know,

1144
01:11:51.130 --> 01:11:53.920
I'm going to fucking print this email out and put it on her,
her side of the bed,

1145
01:11:53.921 --> 01:11:54.754
on the pillow.

1146
01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:01.750
I shouldn't be making jokes like this.
Yeah,
I would get the fuck out of it.
Uh,

1147
01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:04.980
and that's it.
And I would,
uh,

1148
01:12:05.010 --> 01:12:08.700
go find love with somebody that's excited that she got a new job,

1149
01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:11.630
that you're going to be participating and that,
uh,

1150
01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:15.210
and let you wear shorts when it's hot out.
There you go,
everybody.

1151
01:12:15.211 --> 01:12:19.770
That's the podcast for this week.
Oh,
go fuck yourselves.
And I'll check.
Yeah.

1152
01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:23.860
On,
uh,
on Thursday.

1153
01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:28.300
Kerryn congratulations to the Ferrari team for winning.
The next one is,

1154
01:12:28.301 --> 01:12:30.250
I believe in Bahrain or something like that,

1155
01:12:30.251 --> 01:12:32.740
and then they go to fucking Singapore.
All right,
I'll see you.
