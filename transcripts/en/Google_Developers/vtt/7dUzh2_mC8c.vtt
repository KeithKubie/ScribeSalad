[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.492 --> 00:00:08.200
AVNISH MIDUTHURI: Good
evening, everyone.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.210
Welcome, and hope you're having
a great time at Google IO go.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.620
So far I'm Avnish
Miduthuri, and I'm

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.020
a product manager at
Google working on Google

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.120
Pay for online payments.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.790
TONY CHEN: And I'm Tony Chen,
software engineer also working

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:22.552
on Google Pay.

00:00:22.552 --> 00:00:24.760
AVNISH MIDUTHURI: And we're
here today to talk to you

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.280
about what we've been
working on on Google Pay

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.464
to improve online checkout.

00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:32.520
So I'm sure a lot of
you here are already

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.900
excited about the potential
for e-commerce, and rightly so.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.410
In the US alone in 2017,
we saw retail sales

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.860
near half a trillion dollars,
with the highest year

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.520
on year growth in
the last six years.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.960
And we're seeing similar
growth trends globally.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.390
But this growth is
happening despite the fact

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.300
that online conversions
haven't really improved.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.220
From all the
estimates we've seen,

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.490
conversions across
desktop and mobile devices

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.700
has been largely flat over
the last couple of years.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.180
And it's not hard
to see that cart

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.930
abandonment during checkout
is one of the leading causes.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.790
When users go to
check out online,

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.230
they see long checkout forms, 15
plus form fields and other card

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.930
information, their billing
address, their shipping

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.270
address, logins, passwords,
and the list goes on.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.550
When users see all these
forms, it's not surprising

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.200
that they drop off,
especially when

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.259
they're on a low speed data
connection on mobile devices.

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.050
So we think there's a
huge opportunity here

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.430
to really improve
online checkout.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.410
And that's what we hope
to do with Google Pay.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.270
At the start of this year,
we unified our payment

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.880
and checkout experiences
across all of Google

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.210
under a single
brand, Google Pay.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.980
Our vision for Google Pay is
to enable users everywhere

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.270
to pay with their Google account
anywhere they're signed in.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.750
So Google Pay is more than
just an app on a device

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.850
or a button on a website.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.410
We're building it as a platform,
integrated as a core part

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.380
of our users' Google account
and available to them everywhere

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.960
they're signed into Google.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.984
In, this session
we'll spend some time

00:02:19.984 --> 00:02:22.400
to share some of the changes
we've made over the last year

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.540
as we've launched Google
Pay, and then we'll

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.224
talk about how you can
implement the Google Pay API.

00:02:27.224 --> 00:02:28.640
And finally, we'll
also share some

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.640
of the product announcements
that are coming up.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.077
So looking back a few years
ago, we launched Android Pay,

00:02:37.077 --> 00:02:38.910
and we started our
journey with the enabling

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.970
easy in-app payments
using cards that users

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.610
has provisioned on their
device in the Android Pay app.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.450
We launched this
feature in 112 countries

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.930
and saw great adoption from
thousands of developers.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.200
But we heard from
you, our developers,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.810
that you wanted more.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.270
You wanted access to many more
users paying what more payment

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.050
methods, and in
several more countries.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.570
And so we went back
to the strengths

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.460
of Google, our billions of
users across multiple popular

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.610
products around the world.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.550
Our users have saved
hundreds of millions of cards

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.770
to their Google accounts,
making purchases

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.310
on apps like the Play Store,
YouTube, or even to shopping

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.860
the web using Chrome.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.780
What Google Pay,
users can easily

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.150
make payments what the
payment methods stored

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.790
in their Google account
anywhere they're signed in,

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.010
a consistent and seamless
payment experience.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.380
And Google Pay is already the
way users pay across Google.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.670
Users see Google Pay
today when they check out

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.450
on the Play Store buying
an app, renting a movie,

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.580
or just on Chrome auto
filling a checkout form.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.950
And not only is
Google Pay present

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.130
when users buy from
Google, but it's also

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.970
being incorporated into several
new surfaces for transactions

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.120
that users can make with
third party merchants.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.120
For instance, you'll see
Google Pay powerinf checkout

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.379
for merchant experiences
within Android messages

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:14.170
from merchants that
have used rich business

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.880
messaging, and also a system
to enable transactions

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.000
like the Google Assistant,
or on web actions including

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.820
AMP pages.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.620
And in keeping with
our vision, we've

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.650
extended our Google APIs
to external developers

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.200
so users can pay with all their
cards in their Google account

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.600
when they're on
your sites or apps

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.580
without any additional setup or
having to download a new app.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.250
We launched earlier this
year with payments enabled

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.040
on Android devices,
both native apps

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.590
and on the mobile web using
Chrome's implementation

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.730
of the Payment Request standard.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.460
In the last few
months, we've already

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.250
seen great adoption from several
developers around the world.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.260
Take a look.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.380
Users can already use Google
Pay on a range of merchants

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.170
from order ahead apps to retail
sites, travel, transportation,

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.370
ride sharing, and many more.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.420
We have merchants
live across the world

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:17.150
from the US, Brazil, Russia,
the UK, Australia, Japan,

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.260
and many more.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.470
And merchants with
a global user base

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.660
can enable Google Pay
for all their users

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.240
with a single API integration.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.050
For instance, Deliveroo,
a leading order ahead app,

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.290
launched Google Pay for their
users in over 12 markets.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.970
And Uber is rolling out Google
Pay for all of their users

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:36.470
globally.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.030
And our early developers
have seen great results

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.290
from their integrations.

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.770
For example, Hotel Tonight saw
that Google Pay users converted

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.730
at a 65% higher rate than users
on their regular checkout flow,

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.810
thanks to the easy
payment experience.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.010
And as I mentioned earlier,
our new Google Pay APIs

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.870
enable many more users to
pay with all of their cards

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.520
in the Google account.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.550
And so when StubHub
updated from Android Pay,

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.600
they saw a 7x increase in
the number of unique users

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.000
paying with Google Pay.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.890
And when Airbnb updated,
they saw an 11x increase

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:19.500
in daily transactions
from Google Pay.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.170
And our APIs also
enable merchants

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.560
to build streamlined onboarding
experience of for their users.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.490
For example, new Airbnb users,
when they set up the app,

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.570
can completely skip the
payment method setup flow

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.600
and complete a booking
with Google Pay

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.750
without ever having to enter any
payment information or billing

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.840
addresses.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.340
We're now taking a
huge step to make

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.950
Google Pay available
to many more users

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.814
and to developers on the web.

00:06:48.814 --> 00:06:50.730
Last week, we announced
that Google Pay is now

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:55.080
available across the web
from Android to desktop,

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.790
and yes, even on iOS devices.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.480
Through one integration with
our JavaScript libraries,

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.570
merchants can enable
Google Pay globally,

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.970
available to all of
your users regardless

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.740
of what device or browser
they're shopping on.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.955
We've also focused on making our
APIs really easy to integrate,

00:07:16.955 --> 00:07:19.580
and we've been really encouraged
by the positive feedback we've

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.500
seen from developers.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.770
For instance, The Iconic,
an online fashion retailer

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.020
in Australia,
reported that it took

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.620
just one of their developers
a week to enable and launch

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.150
Google Pay.

00:07:34.936 --> 00:07:37.060
And in keeping with our
mission to make integration

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.070
as simple as
possible, we've also

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.350
partnered with leading
e-commerce platforms

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:45.550
to make accepting Google
Pay on the web even simpler.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.800
For instance, if you're
a Shopify merchant,

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.990
all you have to do is go
to your merchant settings

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:53.470
page in the payment provider
section and with a single click

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:55.830
you can enable Google Pay.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.720
And Shopify launched just a
few weeks ago, and in that time

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.300
we've already seen Tens
of thousands of merchants

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.110
enable Google Pay.

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:07.890
And finally, we've partnered
with several leading payment

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:10.140
providers, gateways,
and processors

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:13.320
around the world to
enhance security and make

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.100
it easy for their merchants
to add Google Pay.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.600
These providers
have already enabled

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.780
Google Pay in their SDKs
and merchant solutions,

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.750
and we have many
more coming soon.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.974
To show you now how Google
Pay works on the web

00:08:26.974 --> 00:08:28.890
and how you can integrate
the Google Pay APIs,

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.360
I'm going to hand
it over to Tony.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.950
TONY CHEN: Thank you, Avnish.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:36.260
Can you switch to
my iPHone, please?

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.760
So I can't really walk
very far with this.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.669
So I'm going to quickly walk
you through what the web

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:43.470
experience is going to be like.

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:45.150
I'm on a merchant
side right now.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.850
I'm going to buy something
and check out with Google Pay.

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.620
Now as you all know,
Mother's Day is coming on up

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.910
and I haven't bought
anything from my mom yet.

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:55.830
As a father of two,
I normally would

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.210
try to buy something
for my wife first,

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:00.480
but every time I try to
pick out clothes for her,

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:04.530
somehow they always end
up getting returned.

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.660
So I think my mom
would appreciate

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.200
this nice green sweater.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.680
So I'm going to go ahead
and add it to the cart.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.340
I'm going to click
checkout, and up pops a Buy

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.410
with Google Pay button.

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:19.820
I'm going to open this, and
this shows our payments sheet.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:24.090
Our payments sheet is what
shows the available cards

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.400
and shipping
addresses associated

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.630
with a particular
Google account.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:32.010
If you happen to be logged in
into more than one account,

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:35.709
you can easily
toggle it like so.

00:09:35.709 --> 00:09:37.500
And as you can see,
this is a test account,

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.180
so there aren't
any cards set up.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.380
I'm going to go ahead
and switch it back

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.500
s I can easily check out.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.000
Now I'm going to
ship this to my mom

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.620
so I need to add her
shipping address.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.810
And sometimes I really
have a tough time

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:56.669
remembering exactly what my
mom's shipping address is.

00:09:56.669 --> 00:09:58.210
But it's a good
thing that Google Pay

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:01.330
shows autofill suggestions
from the Google Maps API

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:05.035
to make even filling out
this form super simple.

00:10:05.035 --> 00:10:06.410
Now that I'm done,
I'm just going

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.562
to go ahead and click
the Continue button.

00:10:08.562 --> 00:10:10.020
And now we've just
made a purchase.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:21.740
So Google Pay also remembers the
last selected card and shipping

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:25.320
address to make your
next checkout easier.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:30.710
For example, if I open up
to the payment sheet again,

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:32.600
you'll now see that my
mom's shipping address

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.650
is now the default. Users will
see the same consistent user

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:38.570
experience across
all major browser

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:42.830
platforms such as Safari,
Firefox, and coming soon,

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:45.770
Microsoft Edge.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:49.130
One other thing to note is
that this merchant page,

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:51.320
even though we built
this just for I/O,

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.600
we're going to actually
release this to the public

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.300
and to all of you developers
so that you can play around

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.480
with our APIs without
first having to integrate.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.300
We built this nifty
little developer console

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.069
on the top right.

00:11:03.069 --> 00:11:05.360
I don't know if you noticed,
but there was a little bug

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.560
little icon.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.060
And you can easily
manipulate the request.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.230
So for example, if I
wanted to not collect

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:15.170
shipping address
for whatever reason,

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:17.310
I can change it to false.

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:20.450
And if I, for some reason can't
support all the available card

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:22.490
networks, I'll easily
remove one like so.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:28.520
And then I'm going to click
on the Google Pay button.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.890
And now you'll see that
the shipping address is

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:34.470
no longer available, and my
previously selected Visa card

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:35.510
is no longer accepted.

00:11:37.981 --> 00:11:39.730
Can you switch back
to the slides, please?

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.980
So for that site that you
just saw, go to g.copay/demo.

00:11:51.347 --> 00:11:53.680
Now that we've walked through
what the web experience is

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.070
like, let me walk you through
how easy it is to integrate

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:59.620
with the Google Pay API.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.210
With these four
simple steps, you

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:03.220
can enable the same
payment experience

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:06.460
that I just showed you
for all Google users.

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:07.780
The four steps are as follows.

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:09.700
You're going to download
some JavaScript,

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.150
check if the user's on
a supported browser,

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:14.740
add the Google Pay
button, and then open up

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.120
our payments sheet.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.340
So first things first.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:21.070
You're going to add the
script tag to your site.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:22.990
As soon as the script
is loaded, you're

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:25.420
going to construct a payments
client object by passing

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.280
in an environment field.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:31.890
We support two environment
fields, test and production.

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:35.520
In environment test you don't
have to register with us.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.270
You can actually play
around with the APIs

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:40.066
yourself and integrate
into your site.

00:12:40.066 --> 00:12:44.020
In environment test, we do
show the users real data.

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.540
However, whenever
they make a selection,

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:49.120
we actually return
you a fake token.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.870
If you're integrating with one
of our supported processors,

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:56.120
we'll actually return your token
that you can actually charge

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.540
in their test environment.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.250
Once you complete
the integration

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:02.350
and you're ready to
handle real payment,

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:05.050
come register with us through
our self-service portal,

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:08.650
and then flip the
environment to production.

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:11.260
So now that you have the
payments client constructed,

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.320
the first API you're going
to call is IsReadytoPay.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.377
IsReadytoPay returns
a simple Boolean

00:13:16.377 --> 00:13:18.710
telling you whether their
user is on a supported browser

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:20.000
or not.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.050
At Google, we really focus
on optimizing for conversion.

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:27.940
So rather than you showing
yet another payment option,

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.560
you should only show
Google Pay if you

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:33.250
think it will help improve
your checkout experience.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:35.530
So if IsReadytoPay
returns false,

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:38.260
don't render the
Google Pay button.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.660
In the near future, we're
going to make an enhancement

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.970
to the IsReadytoPay
API so you can

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:46.011
ask for ready to pay Google
users with an existing payment

00:13:46.011 --> 00:13:46.510
method.

00:13:48.915 --> 00:13:50.290
Now that you know
that the user's

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:52.630
ready for making
a payment, you're

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:55.330
going to call our second
API, Create Button.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:58.810
Create Button returns
a simple HTML element

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:01.690
that you can append to
the Dom of your site.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:04.300
We highly recommend that
you should call this API

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:07.340
over constructing your own
button with static assets

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:09.610
so you can take advantage
of all of the improvements

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:12.020
that we make to the
button over time.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.380
For example, in the
near future, we're

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:19.330
going to automatically translate
the button to the user's locale

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.930
in order to improve
click-through rates.

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:24.700
Another thing that
we recommend is

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:27.520
that you should use our
default color, which is black.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:31.660
However, if you happen to
have a site with a dark theme,

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:36.211
we provide an alternate
white color that you can use.

00:14:36.211 --> 00:14:38.710
The minimum that you need to
pass through this Create Button

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:42.770
API is this On Click
Event listener function.

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:46.690
So once you add the
button to your site,

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:50.080
the user clicks on
the button, you're

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.440
going to call or load payment
data to actually open up

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.104
the payments sheet.

00:14:56.104 --> 00:14:57.520
The first thing
you're going to do

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.960
is construct this payment
data request object,

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.320
which is just a set of
payments configuration used

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.420
for this particular transaction.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:07.210
For example, if you need
to collect a full billing

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:09.340
address because you
want to do an AVS check,

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.610
or to collect a phone number so
that you can contact the user,

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:15.730
you can easily
configure it like so.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.440
We highly recommend
that you collect

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.482
as little information as
necessary from the user,

00:15:20.482 --> 00:15:21.940
as we've seen
conversion rates tend

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.470
to drop whenever
you ask the user

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:27.230
for additional information.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:29.560
One other thing to call
out in this request object

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.800
is this payment method
tokenization parameters.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.750
This object may
have a long name,

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:37.690
but all it is is a set of key
value pairs that were going

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:39.370
to forward to your processor.

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:41.800
So be sure to check your
processor's integration

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:48.130
guidelines to find out
what they need from us.

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:51.400
Now that you've constructed
the request object,

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.470
you're going to pass it
to load payment data.

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:56.290
That's going to open
up our payment sheet.

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:58.250
The user is going
to make a selection.

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:01.690
And we're going to return to
you a payment data object.

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:05.570
The payment data object consists
of metadata about the user's

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:08.110
selection so that you can
use it to render the order

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:10.420
confirmation screen.

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:12.100
Also within the
payment data object

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:13.805
is this payment method token.

00:16:13.805 --> 00:16:15.430
The payment method
token is what you're

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:17.800
going to actually use to
complete the transaction

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.868
by passing it to the processor.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.630
One thing to note is
that security is already

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:26.430
baked into our product.

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.260
Our payments sheet
is always open

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.050
within a separate pop-up
window to eliminate

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:35.850
user click jacking or any
other security vulnerabilities.

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:39.580
What that means is if the site
happens to be compromised,

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:42.000
no malicious content can be
overlaid onto our payment

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.120
sheet, so it won't confuse the
user by obscuring their data.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.570
And what that means is
a Google user's data

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:50.870
is always kept in their control.

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:57.310
So what that means for
you as a developer is

00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:59.650
that when the click
event happens,

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:03.190
you must call load payment
data synchronously.

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:05.200
Don't make network
requests to the server

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.690
or any other asynchronous
calls in order

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:09.819
to avoid having the
pop-up window blocked

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:13.079
by the user's browser.

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:16.470
And that's our
entire integration.

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:18.474
So it's super simple.

00:17:18.474 --> 00:17:20.099
I'm going to prove
to you how simple it

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:23.460
is by doing a live
implementation from scratch.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.380
And all I'm going
to do is basically

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:29.220
copy and paste from the deck
I've already presented you

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.710
to show the entire integration.

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:33.570
Can we switch to my
Pixelbook, please?

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.880
So remember, folks, this
is a live implementation.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.240
There is a possibility
that things may not work.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:47.000
Just in case, I have this cheat
sheet that may help me out.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.010
But hopefully, I won't need it.

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:49.510
All right.

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:51.430
So I'm going to do
this implementation

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:55.572
on JS Fiddle, which allows me
to enter JavaScript on the fly,

00:17:55.572 --> 00:17:57.280
and then it'll print
out onto this result

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.750
page on the bottom right here.

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.800
So on the left we have HTML,
JavaScript's in the middle,

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.824
and CSS is on the right.

00:18:04.824 --> 00:18:06.490
As you can see, we've
already downloaded

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:09.189
the script tag for p.js.

00:18:09.189 --> 00:18:11.230
And we've already constructed
the payments client

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:12.811
with environment test.

00:18:12.811 --> 00:18:14.560
So I'm just going to
expand the JavaScript

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:18.910
section a little bit just so
that you have more room to see.

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:22.660
And the first thing we're going
to do is call IsReadytoPay.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:27.790
So IsReadytoPay returns
a simple Boolean

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:32.110
that tells you whether the user
is on supported browser or not.

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:35.252
So I'm going to print out
the response of IsReadytoPay.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:46.150
Response.result. I'm
going to update the site.

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:49.230
It's taking a little
time to think about it

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:50.080
and try it again.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.530
Wow.

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:57.620
This is art.

00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.930
Let me try that.

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:02.555
What?

00:19:02.555 --> 00:19:03.500
Aahh.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:04.100
Thank you.

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:08.060
I changed this based on
someone else's suggestion,

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:09.590
and now that totally
screwed me up.

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:11.821
Thank you for catching that.

00:19:11.821 --> 00:19:12.320
All right.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.790
Let's print that out again.

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:23.490
All right.

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:24.961
Run it again.

00:19:24.961 --> 00:19:25.460
Great.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:28.190
The result shows you that
we're on a supported browser.

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:31.610
The next thing we're going
to do is call Create Button.

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:35.962
So Create Button returns
a simple HTML element

00:19:35.962 --> 00:19:37.920
that we're going to use
to embed into our site.

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:48.210
So I'm going append the
button into the site

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:54.510
and then need to fill in this
Click Event Listener function,

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:57.390
which I'll leave blank for now.

00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:58.596
Updates again.

00:19:58.596 --> 00:19:59.220
And here we go.

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.340
Here's our black
Google Pay button.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:05.210
Now by default, as I mentioned,
we always use the black color.

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:08.180
However, if your site
happens to have a dark theme,

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:11.330
you can easily change the
bun color to white like so.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.250
And then you automatically
get this white button.

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:18.440
If you're [INAUDIBLE] to
developing on a responsive

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.830
page, or if you just
don't have real estate

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:23.780
and you need a
narrower button, you

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:27.070
can easily change the
button type to short

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:28.631
to get a shorter button.

00:20:28.631 --> 00:20:30.380
And as I mentioned
earlier, you don't need

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:32.180
to fill in any of this at all.

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:34.300
By default we will always
use the black button

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:35.870
and the standard size.

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:40.070
So now we're going to call Load
Payment Data by constructing

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:42.240
this payment data request.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:47.515
So I'm going to copy the request
object from these two slides,

00:20:47.515 --> 00:20:49.265
and then I'm going to
merge them together.

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:57.990
And then we're going
to call Load Payment

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:02.370
Data on the button click
event, which I left empty.

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:08.535
And then to show that everything
is wired together properly,

00:21:08.535 --> 00:21:10.660
I'm going to fill in this
process payment function.

00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:16.690
So the process
payment function is

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:18.148
going to take in
our payment method

00:21:18.148 --> 00:21:23.450
token, and the token
itself is a JSON object.

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:27.442
So I'm going to call
JSON.stringify so

00:21:27.442 --> 00:21:28.650
that you can see the content.

00:21:32.271 --> 00:21:32.770
All right.

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:34.240
Here we go.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.130
Button click.

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:36.550
Going to wait a little bit.

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:37.820
Click on the button.

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:39.760
Up pops the payment sheet.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.950
You make a selection.

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:45.620
This always seems to happen.

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:48.132
I'll do it again.

00:21:48.132 --> 00:21:49.590
It's going to work
the second time.

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:50.514
Here we go.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.101
And here is the exact
token onto the result pane.

00:21:58.101 --> 00:21:58.600
Thank you.

00:22:02.429 --> 00:22:03.970
Can we switch back
to slides, please?

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:04.990
Thank you.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.800
So like I said, super simple.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.026
You can complete the
entire implementation

00:22:09.026 --> 00:22:10.150
within a matter of minutes.

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:15.950
Wrong button.

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:17.630
So I've just shared
with you what

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:20.540
we've been working on
the past few months

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.079
leading up until this launch.

00:22:22.079 --> 00:22:24.620
Now I'm going to share with you
a couple of things that we're

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:26.270
going to be launching
soon to enhance

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:30.170
our offering for both users
and for you, the developer.

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:32.870
Let's start with the
user experience first.

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:34.910
As I mentioned before,
we want to have

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:36.950
the same consistent
payment experience

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:39.430
for all major browser platforms.

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:42.750
However, we're going to try
and optimize wherever we can.

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:45.950
So for the browsers that
support native UI such as Chrome

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:50.090
with Payment Request, we can
offer this nice native payment

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:53.570
sheet experience
on mobile websites.

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:56.630
Similar to a pop-up
window, this native sheet

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.660
is impossible to click jack
because the sheet itself

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:02.750
is completely separated and
detached from the Chrome app

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:04.340
itself.

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.980
But unlike a pop-up
window, this payment sheet

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:09.020
is a streamlined
purchase experience

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:10.850
because it allows
the user to stay

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:14.970
in context of the
payment within your site.

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:17.810
Soon we're going to be
expanding native support

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:23.550
from mobile onto the desktop
with the Payment Handler spec.

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:27.250
So Payment Handler works by
installing a service workers

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:29.860
into the user's browser.

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:32.620
A service worker is just
a JavaScript interface

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:38.757
between our payments sheet and
the native UI in the browser.

00:23:38.757 --> 00:23:40.840
You don't really have to
understand what a service

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:43.620
worker is, nor do you really
have to understand what Payment

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:46.260
Handler does, because when you
integrate with the Google Pay

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:49.210
API, all this will
happen automatically.

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:52.220
We're going to do all the
heavy lifting for you.

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:54.910
So let me walk you
through a quick preview

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:58.990
of what that's going to
look like on Chrome desktop.

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:01.300
Can you switch me to
my Pixelbook, please?

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:07.950
So as you can see, we're
on our merchant page again.

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:13.370
This time, when I click
on the Google Pay button,

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:18.020
up pops our payment sheet within
this nice, secure native frame.

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:22.130
Very similar to the
mobile experience,

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:24.050
you cannot click jack this.

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:28.080
Also, because it's embedded
nicely into the pop-up window,

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.920
you can tell that it's
part of the same sheet.

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.734
It's native and secure.

00:24:32.734 --> 00:24:34.400
It's not part of the
website because you

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.070
can see that the native
sheet itself is overlaid

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:39.620
right on top of my toolbars.

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:43.160
So I'm going to click Continue
just to show you that it works.

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.120
And there we go.

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.624
We just completed a payment
with Payment Handler.

00:24:47.624 --> 00:24:49.290
Let's switch back to
the slides, please.

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:56.370
So as you can see, we're going
to always look for new ways

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:59.040
to improve our
payment experience.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:03.780
Now for developers, this
Payment Handler example

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:07.410
is a great way to showcase
what our mantra is,

00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:10.140
which is we want to ensure
that you only have to integrate

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.106
with the Google Pay API once.

00:25:12.106 --> 00:25:14.730
And after that, you're going to
be able to continuously benefit

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:16.104
from all the
improvements that we

00:25:16.104 --> 00:25:17.640
make without you
having to change

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.460
any parts of your integration.

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:22.900
When you integrate on
Android, for example,

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:25.850
we can make updates through
the Google Play services

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:29.470
to the two billion
active Android devices.

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:32.820
However, this has always
limited us to client releases.

00:25:35.494 --> 00:25:36.910
Now that we've
launched on the web

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:39.510
and we've switched to
this new JSON interface,

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:42.510
we're able to take advantage
of the continuous server

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:46.560
pushes so that we can bring
new features and improvements

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.310
on a daily basis.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:53.610
And as we look to expand Google
Pay to additional surfaces,

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:56.940
we want to bring the same
consistent, unified integration

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:58.872
experience for all developers.

00:25:58.872 --> 00:26:00.330
So I'm happy to
announce that we're

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:03.450
going to be extending
the same JSON interface

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:07.620
and bringing it from the
web to Android, AMP, Actions

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:10.230
on Google, and more.

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:12.780
So let me walk you through
a couple of these examples

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.710
by starting with
accelerated mobile pages.

00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:20.120
Now we've seen tremendous
adoption of AMP

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.000
from around the world.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.250
AMP by Design is
a restricted set

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:28.940
of HTML with limited
JavaScript support.

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:31.010
By working closely
with the AMP team,

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:33.410
you'll soon be able to
enable Google Pay by using

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:35.750
the standard AMP components.

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:38.750
All you need to do is drop
in the same JSON payload

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:41.000
as you would to
load payment data,

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
and you'll be able to
easily render a Google Pay

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.870
button within your AMP page.

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:46.607
The button itself
will automatically

00:26:46.607 --> 00:26:49.190
handle opening the payment sheet
and returning you the payment

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:51.310
method token.

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:54.920
And as we all know, payments
is no longer limited

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:59.240
to just websites
and native apps.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.370
If you happen to be
collecting payments

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:04.970
through Android Messages or
through the Google Assistant,

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:08.900
you'll soon be able to also
enable the same Google Pay

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.810
experience with the
same JSON interface.

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:15.620
Consistent and easy to
integrate on all surfaces,

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:19.730
we're making Google Pay as easy
to integrate everywhere as it

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:22.760
is for users to pay everywhere.

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:26.330
Now if you're interested
in learning more about how

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:28.220
to collect payments
on Android Messages

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.710
or through the
Google Assistant, go

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:34.670
find my buddy Sean, who will be
at the Google Assistant Sandbox

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:36.750
from 12 to two tomorrow.

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:37.640
All right, Avnish.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:38.364
Take us home.

00:27:38.364 --> 00:27:39.530
AVNISH MIDUTHURI: All right.

00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:42.430
Thank you, Tony.

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:44.050
So we shared a lot
of details with you

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:46.390
today about how you can add
Google Pay to your site,

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:47.950
improve conversion.

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:50.170
We're really excited to
see how you'll integrate.

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:52.128
We know there's a lot of
information out there,

00:27:52.128 --> 00:27:54.250
and it's nicely organized
into two websites there.

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:57.727
There's one so you can learn
about how Google Pay can

00:27:57.727 --> 00:27:59.435
improve things for
your business overall,

00:27:59.435 --> 00:28:02.682
so that's g.co/pay/business.

00:28:02.682 --> 00:28:04.390
And if you're ready
to start integrating,

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:08.432
just dive right into our
developer docs there.

00:28:08.432 --> 00:28:10.140
Tony and I are also
going to be available

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:11.764
right after the
session in our sandbox.

00:28:11.764 --> 00:28:16.329
That's located at Dome G. So
please stop by, ask questions.

00:28:16.329 --> 00:28:18.120
We'll also have members
from the Google Pay

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:20.790
team available tomorrow if
you can't make it today.

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:23.290
So stop by, ask questions,
try a few demos out.

00:28:26.849 --> 00:28:28.890
Also, if you want to learn
more about Google Pay,

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:31.710
we also have two more
sessions tomorrow.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:34.100
The first is led by
our Payments UX team,

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:37.000
and it walks through
design principles,

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.740
how you can optimize
conversion using Google Pay.

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.090
And for learning about how
you can enable transactions

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:45.180
via the Assistant,
check out the session

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:48.040
on adding transactional
capabilities to your actions

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.110
tomorrow afternoon.

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:52.602
That's hosted by
our Assistant team.

00:28:52.602 --> 00:28:55.060
Finally, we have a hackathon
coming up next month for those

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:56.260
of you on the West Coast.

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:57.280
It's in San Francisco.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.210
It's in June.

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:01.550
So you can sign up at the
link there, or stop by, again,

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:04.490
at our sandbox if you
want more information.

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:06.570
We host developer
events globally.

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:08.320
So if you'd like to
see an event near you,

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.361
or if you want to stay
tuned for upcoming events,

00:29:10.361 --> 00:29:13.600
you can sign up for our
developer documentation

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.710
and we'll keep you posted.

00:29:17.577 --> 00:29:18.160
And that's it.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.780
Thank you so much for attending.

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:20.988
