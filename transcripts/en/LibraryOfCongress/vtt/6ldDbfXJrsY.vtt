00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:01.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.513
&gt;&gt; And so that being said,
I'd like to welcome you.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.163
My name is Alison Starling,
I work at ABC 7 and anchor

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.560
of Good Morning Washington,
nice and early.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.820
I'm the ABC affiliate here in DC.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:18.620
[ Applause ]

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.153
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.486
So happy to be back out here

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.580
for the National Book
Festival once again this year,

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.460
and it's only fitting

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.860
in this historical occasion near the
Washington monument near the capital

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.823
that we're celebrating
here the inspirational

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.410
and motivational stories
of immigrants who have come

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.263
to our country and sacrificed
so much to be Americans.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.676
But first, you should know that
for our presentation today,

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.350
we have sort of a special set up.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.016
You are a special guest today
and that's because of instead

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.323
of the typical forum
when the author comes up

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.940
and gives their presentation
and simply takes questions

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.826
from the audience, instead, today,

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.726
our author somehow convinced a world
famous journalist to come with him

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.543
and actually do the
interviews for him.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.980
We don't know how he
managed to do that.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.913
We'll have to find out.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.436
I am happy to introduce two people
here for you today, the author

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.990
and the interviewer, and
they happen to be a couple.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.150
First we have Steve Roberts

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.560
who has been a journalist
for more than 40 years.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.950
He was a journalist with the
New York Times and with US News.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:31.246
He is of course a well-known
commentator, a lecturer,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.413
a professor and an author.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.053
This is his second time at
the National Book Festival.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.900
He was here as well in
2005 for his memoir,

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.660
his childhood memoir
called My Father's House.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.153
Secondly, you will be
seeing the interviewer,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.640
and that is his wife, Cokie Roberts.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.626
As you know, Cokie is an Emmy--

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.820
[ Applause ]

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.620
&gt;&gt; Yes, applause for Cokie.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.020
She is an Emmy award winning
journalist and commentator as well.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.933
She is with the National
Public Radio and ABC news.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.570
She and her husband write a popular
nationally syndicated newspaper

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.510
column together as well.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:10.700
They have two children,
they have six grandchildren,

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.786
at least one of which I
know is here today, Regan.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.060
And they also in 2000,
Steve and Cokie published,

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.720
From This Day Forward, which
was an account of their marriage

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.250
and other marriages
in American history.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.683
And you know what, it's been 7
weeks at the Times bestseller list.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:31.720
It's a book that I personally
enjoyed very much and in it,

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.886
this is one of my favorite quotes.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.553
They say marriage has enlarged
our lives, not encircle them.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.766
It has opened new doors,
not closed them.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.136
We are better people together
than we are separately.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.893
Today, they are here to
talk about Steve's new book

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.366
about the immigration experience and
the search for the American dream.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.620
That book is called From
Every End of this Earth.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.656
I hope you will help me to
welcome Steve and Cokie Roberts.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.200
[ Applause ]

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.670
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.340
We're so thrilled of you to come.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.140
Thank you.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.673
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.140
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.140
[ Applause ]

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.806
&gt;&gt; Now I think someone is supposed
to come whisk this lecture in array.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.406
Otherwise-- [laughter] here we go.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.473
Withstand it, okay, thank
you, thank you very much.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.206
What a great, what a great day.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.273
I mean Dr. Jim Billington
is with us right here,

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.013
The Librarian of Congress.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000


00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.640
[ Applause ]

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.203
&gt;&gt; And well, and Jim and Laura
Bush together saw a vision of a day

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.653
like this 10 years ago of
bringing hundreds of thousand--

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.860
hundreds of thousands of people on a
hot day to the National Hall to talk

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.733
about books, buy books, and listen
to authors talk about books,

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.993
and what a great thing it is.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.093
So, my job here today is
basically to say to Steve,

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.026
so tell me the one about.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.986
[Laughter] But first, I
know that you like to talk

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.970
about why you wrote this
book in the first place.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.923
&gt;&gt; That's true and thank you.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.486
What did you say your name was?

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:23.700
[Laughter] We just had
our 44th anniversary

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.100
and I'm still getting used to it.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:27.900
[ Applause ]

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.166
&gt;&gt; Although you know the best line
about Steve's best line really

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.320
about marriage is not
in the book but it is

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:37.206
that you can tell a good
marriage by the number

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.600
of teeth marks on your tongue.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.120
[ Laughter ]

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.520
&gt;&gt; From biting it.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:47.276
[Laughter] Candor is
vastly overrated,

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.410
but I grew up in a
family of immigrants.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:54.583
My grandparents are immigrants
from Russia and Poland.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:57.510
I grew up in a town in
New Jersey, Bayonne,

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.056
New Jersey where [laughter]
everybody I knew had a grandmother

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.330
with an accent.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.733
&gt;&gt; I did too, they just
had Southern accents.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:10.860
&gt;&gt; That's good.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.330
[Laughter] And I grew up-- Bayonne
was about 80 percent Catholic

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.566
and about 19 percent Jewish
which is what we were.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.246
I thought Protestants were tiny
minority group, I-- some weird sect.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.770
Imagine my surprise
when I went to Harvard.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:29.970


00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:31.646
[Laughter] All these names on their
building, Eliot, Weld, Winthrop,

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.840
so short, so crisp and they
ended in consonants, I--

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.230


00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.870
but it left me with a lifelong
interest in immigration.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.840
As Alison said, I did a book about
my own grandparent's immigration

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.393
to America and-- I
then started teaching--

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.890
and all through my writing career
I've written about immigrants,

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.933
but I started teaching at
George Washington University

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.313
and I started getting these stories
in a writing class of my students

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.496
from Ukraine and from
Vietnam and from El Salvador

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.593
who are living today the story my
grandparents had lived 100 years

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.103
ago, and that was really the
inspiration for the book.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:17.260
Almost all of my writing over the
years has ruthlessly exploited my

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.880
family, and having used up all

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.863
of that material, I
turned to my students.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.256
And in payment for exploiting
them, I actually dedicated the book

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:31.280
to my students [inaudible],
some of whom are here today

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.760
but that was really
the inspiration for it.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.613
&gt;&gt; And you found that
they really are--

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.360
there are some things
that are very similar

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.306
to your grandparent's immigration
in the early 20th century

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.060
and some things that
are very different.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:51.630
&gt;&gt; Well, my friend Jamie Morris
who just preceded me made the point

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.363
that historically, immigration
was a very lonely process.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.633
When my grandfather left Bialystok
which is now in Eastern Poland,

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.013
he was out of touch with his own
sister for 50 years, 50 years.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:13.050
There was no Skype, there was no
cell phone, there was no internet,

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.316
50 years she was behind
the iron curtain.

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:20.850
And the truth is today,
there are still things

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.450
about immigration that
never changed.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.146
Every immigrant in the history of
the world leaves something behind.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.290
They leave their graves
of their ancestors.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:33.476
The air never smells
the same anywhere else.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.550
The food never tastes
quite the same.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:43.210
So this pain of separation is
common to every immigrant story

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.866
in the history of the world.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:46.760
In the 13th century, a Persian
mystic named Rumi wrote something

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.786
called The Song of the Reed.

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:53.693
And he said when a reed is plucked
from a reed bed and you blow

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.686
through it, it makes a very
plaintive sound which is the sound

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:03.683
of the pain of separation
that the reed feels

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:04.913
from having been separated
from the reed bed.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:07.266
An immigrant from Afghanistan
said to me,

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:09.800
"That's how I feel having
left out my-- Afghanistan.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.066
I'm the reed who's been plucked

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.690
from the bed playing
that plaintive sound."

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:19.443
But in other ways, the
situation is very different.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.933
I have a student who owes a--
brother married a woman from Brazil,

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:27.670
she was from Brazil and the woman's
family couldn't come to America

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:32.290
for the wedding so my student
in her bridesmaid's dress

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:34.903
and a digital camera and a
laptop went to the wedding,

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:38.876
took all these photographs,
put them up on the web

00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:40.753
and the bride's family
back in a tiny village

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.200
in Brazil watched the
wedding in realtime on it--

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.966
surrounding a laptop
in their village.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.640
My grandfather didn't
get to do that.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:58.016
So, some things never change but
other things are very different.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.160
&gt;&gt; And-- but you do still
have people leaving.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:02.696
Your grandparents left essentially
because they were persecuted as Jews

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.230
in Eastern Europe and
you found a family

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:10.563
for whom a very similar story,
they weren't necessarily persecuted

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:12.890
but they certainly couldn't
fulfill their life's ambitions

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:17.516
in Ukraine as Jews.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:23.360
&gt;&gt; This is actually a family whose
son was a student of mine, and Nick

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:28.193
and Sarah Stern [phonetic] grew
up as young Jews in the Ukraine

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:32.883
at a period when anti-Semitism had
actually gotten worse, not better.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.133
Because Nick's mother was a doctor,
he couldn't aspire to be a doctor

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:39.503
because all Jews by edict
of Stalin had been prevented

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:44.103
from going to medical school.

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:47.156
So he became an engineer.

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:48.890
It was about the only
profession open to young Jews.

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:50.600
And so did Sarah, she
became an engineer as well.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.446
They met in their first job.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:57.673
And you know, immigration starts
with an active imagination.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.266
It starts with a sense
of there is another life

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:01.560
out there for me, somewhere else.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:03.430
&gt;&gt; And I said to the
Sterns, where did that spark

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.156
of imagination come from?

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:13.070
So Sarah said, well, we had a family
friend who had moved to Israel

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:14.373
and she wrote a letter
that my mother read to me

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:15.810
and the letter said, you
know, here in Israel,

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.950
we eat oranges the
way you eat potatoes.

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:23.613
And that orange became a
symbol of another life.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:29.020
Then she said, I used
to watch Italian movies,

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.263
the Russians would never let in
American movies but they would let

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:36.963
in movies made by Italian communists
like Fellini and Carlo Ponti.

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:41.850
So she said, I would watch
these movies and I never listen

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.566
to the plot, I look
at the apartments.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.920
[Laughter] Now my grandfather,
the sainted Avram Rogowsky,

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:51.326
when he came to America and
went back in the mid 60s,

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:58.446
he decided when he saw Russia that
the great chink in the Soviet armor,

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:02.316
what would pull down the entire
Soviet empire was plumbing.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:04.536
&gt;&gt; He was right.

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:07.460
&gt;&gt; And that if Russians could see
American bathrooms, they would arise

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.613
as one and revolt against
the Russians.

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:11.903
[Laughter] Now of course
he was basically right.

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:14.503
&gt;&gt; He was basically right.

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:15.770
Yeah.

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:17.770
&gt;&gt; Of course.

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:19.103
He was a nut ball but he was right.

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:23.370
But the Stern story was similar, it
was the apartments, it was the way

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:25.080
of life that they saw on these
movies and then finally they decided

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:25.393
to immigrate and it
was very difficult.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:27.860
&gt;&gt; But how would--
Sarah's apartment was like?

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.260
&gt;&gt; Well Sarah's apartment,
she lived in an apartment

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:35.393
where 28 people shared 1 bathroom,
28 people, and they were well off.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.540
Her parents were professional
people.

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.300
So there were certain other impulses
to immigrate and they finally got

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.150
up their courage to immigrate but
at that time, it was a system,

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:51.370
the Soviets were just starting to
allow people to immigrate but they--

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:52.270
you had to get invited by
some relative from abroad.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:55.816
The fiction was it was
family reunification.

00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:58.320
So you had to have a
letter from cousin Morris

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:00.813
in Brooklyn saying I want
the Sterns to join me.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:02.930
There actually didn't have
to be a cousin Morris,

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:05.230
but you had to get the
information to HIAS,

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.776
the Hebrew Immigration
Aid Society in Vienna

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:12.810
who could file a phony
application for you.

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:13.163
And you had to get
the information out.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:15.936
But the Soviet censored
this information.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:18.936
They wouldn't let it out.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:19.336
So Nick was a pretty smart guy.

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:21.993
He wrote down on little
tiny pieces of paper all

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.396
of the vital information they
needed for the application

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:30.830
and he had Sarah sew the little
pieces of paper into the elastic

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:34.830
of his boxer shorts and
they would give the boxers--

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:35.490
every time a Jewish family left
Ukraine, they would give him a pair

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:43.783
of Nick's boxer shorts and say here,
bring the boxers to HIAS in Vienna,

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.386
tell them to look in the
elastic for our information.

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.526
It took them 20 tries.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:50.526
As Nick says, you know,
there are a lot of guys

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:55.126
in Vienna walking around
in my underwear.

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:56.460


00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:57.783
[Laughter] So they finally got out.

00:12:59.450 --> 00:12:59.806
They breached the border
there, headed for Vienna,

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.693
they stopped for a coke
and Nick runs off the train

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:12.030
and he buys the first bottles
of warm Coca-Cola he's ever had

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:12.956
and he gives them to
his kids and I said,

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:16.356
"Nick, what did it taste like?"

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.906
He said, "Steve, it tasted like
freedom, tasted like freedom."

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:23.970
They get to America, it's
the worst day of his life.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.916
Some of you have ever
been to Russia, you know,

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:28.653
the plumbing is such-- keeps
coming back to the plumbing.

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:32.950
The plumbing is such that the water
never rises in the toilet bowl,

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:36.270
you flush the bowl and
all the water goes out.

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:38.816
He said a Ramada Inn in Kennedy
Airport, his first night in America,

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:41.906
he flushes the toilet,
the water comes back up.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:44.630
He says, oh my God,
I've broken the toilet.

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:49.316
[Laughter] They're gonna
send me back to Ukraine."

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:51.326
He spends the entire night
madly flushing the toilet,

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.213
he never gets the water down.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:57.086
They finally get to Saint Louis

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.753
and he becomes a very
successful engineer.

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:04.990
Just to give you a sense of
where this family is today,

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:06.236
I interviewed them in
their penthouse apartment

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:12.330
on Central Park West, which
is only one of their houses

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:17.616
because they also have a condo
in Florida where, as Nick says,

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:19.116
Sarah's closet is bigger than
the apartment she grew up in.

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:24.710
&gt;&gt; So the American
dream still lives?

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.280
&gt;&gt; American dream still lives.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.083
&gt;&gt; But, you know, you talk about
how we go through in this country

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:33.810
and we certainly have
seen it now these spasms

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.266
of anti-immigrants [inaudible].

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:39.496
And right now it's
mainly against Hispanics,

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:41.616
and you have a wonderful
Hispanic family.

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:43.150
&gt;&gt; What we're seeing is against--

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:45.083
&gt;&gt; You want to move the mic up--

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:48.816
&gt;&gt; -- two groups in America.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:50.550
&gt;&gt; Can you move the microphone
up a little bit up here?

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:51.950
Up higher.

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:54.750
&gt;&gt; Is that a little better.

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:55.350
Okay. I'll hold like-- I'll hold it.

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:58.616
Look, there are-- there are
two groups in America today.

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:00.203
They're subject to tremendous
prejudice and persecution, Hispanics

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:04.030
and Muslims, we all know that.

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:09.340
I'm sorry to say having looked
at this issue for many centuries,

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:14.206
over many centuries as a historian,
this is a very American phenomenon.

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:16.190
Jamie Morris who was here just
before me talked about the Statue

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:19.896
of Liberty and we love to talk
about the Statue of Liberty,

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:21.990
love to tell the stories
about the nickels and dimes

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:24.483
that built the pedestal
and we get teary-eyed

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:25.816
about our own immigrant ancestors.

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:28.016
The fact is, however, throughout
our entire history as a country,

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:34.616
we have also had spasms
of anti-immigrant feeling,

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.853
and what is happening today
unfortunately is totally keeping

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.840
with American tradition.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.973
In 1750s, 1750s, the group

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.460
that everybody was
attacking were the Germans,

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:52.210
1790s it was the French.

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:56.943
In the 1840s the Know Nothing Party
prospered as a political party

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:58.023
in this country by
attacking Irish Catholics.

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:02.290
In the 1880s, we passed
the Chinese Exclusion Act

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:02.940
to stop Chinese from
immigrating at all.

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:09.020
In the 1910s, there were--
Italians were considered non-white

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:09.820
in many parts of this country,
and in the 1920s, we hanged Sacco

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.043
and Vanzetti as much as
anything for their nationality

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:17.560
and their immigrant statuses
for their political views.

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:24.020
In the 1940s, we then turned 120,000
loyal Japanese-American citizens.

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:29.023
In my humble opinion, the
haters were wrong then

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.400
and they're wrong today.

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.300
[ Applause ]

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:40.760
[ Cheering ]

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:49.543
&gt;&gt; And they're not just
wrong because of sentiment,

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:50.790
and they're not just wrong
because of some romantic notion

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:54.850
of our wonderful ancestors.

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:55.643
They're wrong on the
fact because the fact is

00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:58.173
that immigrants give far more to
this country than they take away.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:02.340
They contribute more.

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:04.940
[Applause] They contribute more
economically, they contribute

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:07.233
to our vitality, they contribute
to our entrepreneurship.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:14.713
The day this book was published
last October, two Americans,

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:15.683
two Americans won the Nobel Prize
for Physics, one born in Canada,

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:23.090
one born in China, both of
them did their work in America.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:24.183
One did the scientific work
that created fiber optics,

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:28.180
the other did the scientific work
that created digital photography.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.133
Now you tell me how many
Americans are working in jobs today

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:33.920
because those two scientists
were welcome in America

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.320
and didn't do their
work somewhere else?

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:40.786
[Applause] So-- but if
you look at the history,

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.786
if you look at the
history, going back to 1750,

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:51.123
the language is exactly the same
because what the assumption is

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:55.170
that America is now perfect and
that the next we have to pull

00:17:56.190 --> 00:18:00.523
up the drawbridge to stop the next
group, the Germans, the French,

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:01.450
the Irish, the Jews, the Italians,
the Japanese, the Chinese,

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:08.450
the next group is gonna corrupt our
culture and degrade our character,

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:13.223
profoundly misunderstands
the nature of America,

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:17.613
the genius of America is we're
never perfect, we're never perfect.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:18.140
&gt;&gt; Striving for a more
perfect union.

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.006
That's right there.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:22.073
&gt;&gt; And if the haters had their way,

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:25.673
most of us in this room would
be back in Bialystok in Poland

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:26.440
or wherever your family
is from as mine is.

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.373
And the story I tell
that illustrates--

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:33.563
this is about a Hispanic
man named Pablo Romero.

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:36.830
Pablo is born in a small
village in rural Mexico.

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:38.583
He had to drop out of school
when he was 10 years old.

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:41.526
There was no school left in
his village and in any case,

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:47.386
his parents needed the
money so he went to work

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:52.103
and his father brought him
to America as a farm worker

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:56.073
when he was 13 years old and
he worked in the lettuce fields

00:18:56.300 --> 00:19:00.100
of Salinas, California for 7
years and then he was drafted

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:02.420
into the American army, it was the
best thing ever happened to him.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:06.453
He went to Germany and he earned
his high school equivalency

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:11.233
and he really impressed
his commanders who said,

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:12.306
"I'm gonna come back looking
for you in Salinas, Romero.

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.513
And if I find you back in lettuce
fields, I'm gonna kick your butt

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:17.963
because you can do
something more than that."

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:20.063
He came back to America and
through the help of some--

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:26.783
of all things benevolent, government
bureaucrats helped him enroll

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:29.603
in a community college.

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:31.470
He went to school at night
every night while working

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:33.536
in the lettuce fields.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:36.736
He went-- did go back to the lettuce
fields, went to community college,

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:38.190
then they kicked him out of the
library every night at midnight.

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:38.433
After 2 years he gets the
scholarship to UC Irvine.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:45.666
He's studying at UC Irvine, still
hasn't been to high school and one

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:46.573
of his Hispanic professors
said to him, "Romero,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:49.933
you should consider
going to medical school."

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.733
He said, "Medical school, I
haven't been to high school."

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.070
He said, "Romero, how many
Spanish-speaking doctors are there

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:57.530
in Salinas, California?"

00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:59.930
The answer of course was zero.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:00.446
&gt;&gt; He got-- he applies
to medical school.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.063
Can't get the Case Western
in Cleveland by himself,

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:05.260
he had a trucking license so
he gets a trucking assignment

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:08.380
to drive a semi-trailer
to Cleveland.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.210
Gotta be the only kid in the history
of Case Western Medical School

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:16.616
who drove to his interview
driving a semi-trailer.

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:19.736
[Laughter] They took him.

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:21.023
He decided not to go but he
did enroll at UCSF University

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:23.650
of California San Francisco
Medical School.

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:27.250
In his senior year,
he failed a test.

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:28.523
He was horrified.

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:31.856
He went to the-- went
to the professor

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:34.730
and said, "I knew this stuff."

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:35.196
And the guy said, "You people,
you people can't do the work

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:39.796
and your test proves it."

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:41.130
He is aghast.

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:43.996
He said, "Show me the test."

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:45.203
The guy shows him the test,
two pages had stuck together.

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:47.556
But because this professor
saw Pablo through the lens

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:51.423
of you people, he failed him.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:53.426
When Pablo pointed out the problem,
the guys agreed to review the test,

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:57.530
put a big A on it, threw
the book at Pablo and said,

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:00.790
"Get the hell out of here."

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:02.456
He was so embarrassed.

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:07.123
Today, friends, Pablo Romero runs
a neighborhood medical clinic

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:10.960
in Salinas, California,
where 90 percent

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:14.103
of his clients are farm workers.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:18.066
He today takes care of the
children and grandchildren

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:23.636
of the people he worked in the
fields next to all those years.

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:24.650
I do not know.

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:30.030
[Applause] I do not know a better
American than Pablo Romero.

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:31.510
[ Applause ]

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:39.993
&gt;&gt; So we have time
for a few questions.

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:44.660
The microphone is on-- at
the front of each isle,

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.613
if anybody has a question.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.880
Do they wanna-- want to raise.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:51.526
Steve, one of the things that you
found was the feminization of--

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:55.780
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:58.180
&gt;&gt; -- of immigration.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:21:59.380
&gt;&gt; This is a very interesting
phenomena.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.046
As I said to Cokie, there are some
things that are very different

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:02.913
about modern immigration and one

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:05.580
of them is the feminization
of immigration.

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:07.446
A majority of immigrants
today are women.

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:08.913
Historically, this was not true.

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:11.713
But two very interesting
things have happened

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:13.180
to make this more and more possible.

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:18.246
First of all, it is far more
possible from a cultural

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:19.590
and social point of view to-- for
women to immigrate by themselves.

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:23.036
Historically, women needed men.

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:25.970
They needed a brother, a father,
an uncle to watch over them.

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:29.436
Today that's not true.

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:31.023
The second thing that's
happened is economic opportunity.

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:33.973
Historically, a lot of the jobs that
are open to immigrants were jobs

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.766
for muscle and for brawn.

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:38.336
Today, with the switch
to a service economy,

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:44.243
women in many ways are
more marketable than men.

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:44.903
My mom who just died a few
weeks ago in suburban hospital

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:52.996
in suburban Maryland, here, many
of you know it, every single person

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:54.376
who took care of my mother in that
hospital was a foreign-born woman

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:58.490
of color, every single one.

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:00.460
And if you took those women from
Jamaica and Trinidad and Rwanda

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:03.110
and the Cameroons out of
suburban hospital or any hospital

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:06.350
in Washington today, it
would collapse overnight.

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:10.430
&gt;&gt; Surely.

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:12.880
[ Applause ]

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:16.063
&gt;&gt; So thank you very much.

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:16.863
You guys are communicators
for a living

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:18.643
and you obviously have some
pretty powerful building pulpits

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:22.950
if you will.

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:24.106
So, how do we move the
titanic away from the iceberg?

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:31.260
How do we-- we keep telling
these stories of great immigrants

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:36.136
that are doing great things here and
yet we still have this hate which,

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:38.183
you know, we live-- we have freedom
of speech so we have this kind

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:40.530
of challenge going on, but there
are boundaries, you don't get to--

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:46.476
you all fire in a crowded theatre.

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:49.223
So, how do we collectively do this?

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:52.723
&gt;&gt; Good question.

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:55.056
&gt;&gt; Well, look as I said to
you, I don't know how many

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:57.056
of you heard the question
but he asked about the fact

00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:58.386
that today there still
is this tremendous sense

00:23:59.860 --> 00:23:59.926
of animosity toward immigrants.

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:02.390
Look, as I said to you,
there's nothing new about this.

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:05.330
We have to understand that there's--

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:07.796
we've gone through this
for several reasons.

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:09.540
First of all, there is
this impulse to xenophobia

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.120
in our country, it's
very deeply inbred.

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:17.393
Secondly, it's worse in
times of economic stress

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:19.220
because then people say, well,
foreigners are taking our job.

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:21.823
It is not true, foreigners
are not taking our jobs,

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:24.350
foreigners are creating new jobs.

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:26.216
But it is an easy thing to say.

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:32.550
All I can do is say-- to try to
tell these stories, I'm not a pol--

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:33.753
writing-- I haven't
written a political book,

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:34.886
I've written a book of stories.

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:37.300
It's just stories, but I hope people
will understand the contributions

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:44.073
Americans are making
everyday to our well-being,

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.926
and that's all I think we can do but
I think it's a useful thing to do.

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:48.073
&gt;&gt; But the other thing
that does happen

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:53.073
that you've certainly seen
is intermarriage, you know.

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:53.860
And the people who were once the
other are now your son-in-law and,

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.913
you know, and that
tends to change things.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.346
&gt;&gt; Very much so.

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.146
The moment of greatest stress
in many immigrant families is

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:07.450
when their children get married, and
particularly their girl children,

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:14.576
because that's when
they define who they are

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:15.496
and who their parent's
grandchildren are going to be.

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:17.733
But as Cokie said, in many ways,

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:20.063
those moments bring us more
together than separate us.

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.590
&gt;&gt; So you have a question over here?

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:26.163
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you guys-- you
guys started off talking

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.643
about a little advice for marriage.

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:32.790
And Cokie, you've had a
distinguished career and I'd

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.613
like to ask you both
how has having your--

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:37.000
the career where you have so many
responsibilities, so many challenges

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.146
and you've really climbed
up that ladder,

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:41.946
how does that strengthen
your marriage

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:44.013
and what are some advice
you might have

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.013
for some newlyweds
facing those things?

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.480

&gt;&gt; Well, you can start
by buying our book.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.480
&gt;&gt; Go for it.

just signed a couple.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.480
Go ahead, girl.

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.946
&gt;&gt; No, no, no, you go.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.680
I'm dying to hear.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.480
[ Laughter ]

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.413
&gt;&gt; Everybody needs an editor.

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.213
I just married mine
and brought her along.

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.946
But I really think that the, you
know, Cokie is Catholic, I'm Jewish

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.303
and so we have our specialty, your
interfaith marriages and I think--

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:20.590
but look, I came to believe that
all marriages are mixed marriages.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.626
Let's start with the marriage
between a man and a woman.

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:23.880
Anybody who has been
married more than--

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:26.813
anybody who has been married
more than two weeks knows

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:27.973
that gender is far more
a significant difference

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:31.520
than ethnicity or religion.

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:36.700
And even same sex couples, the
fact is the same issues arise,

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.666
issues of tolerance, issues
of mutual respect and issues

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:45.940
of taking pride and justice in
accomplishments, and one of the--

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.176
our greatest accomplishments we take
pride in are our six grandchildren

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:51.970
and it's a particular pleasure

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:53.250
to have a 9-year-old grandchild
sitting here and listening to us

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:55.890
and the faint hope that
someday she'll grow up

00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:57.156
and actually remember who we were.

00:26:58.890 --> 00:26:59.956
[Laughter] Yeah?

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:02.453
&gt;&gt; Could you comment briefly
about the success of Vietnamese

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:03.326
in the United States and also--

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:06.793
&gt;&gt; The success of what?

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.260
I didn't--

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.260
&gt;&gt; Vietnamese.

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:12.260
&gt;&gt; Vietnamese.

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:15.526
And also just a comment that the
congressional seat formerly held

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.060
by Cokie's parents is now held
by a Vietnamese republican.

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:18.260
&gt;&gt; That's true.

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.993
The Vietnamese are a great
success story in this country.

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:21.393
Few people are more hard working

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:23.926
and few people struggle
more to get here.

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:27.060
The fam-- the Vietnamese family
in my book tried to escape

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:28.063
from Vietnam sit-- you know, a
dozen times and he finally escaped.

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:33.390
They were floating
free on the open sea.

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:35.433
The engine had conked out in their
boat and the mother [inaudible]

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:40.906
and the family said to me
to save my two children.

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:46.490
The next thing I was going to
do was have to slit my wrist

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:48.490
and feed my children my blood.

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:50.193
Now, it didn't come to that
because they saw land the next day.

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:53.626
But in that period, in Southeast
Asia, if you washed up on the shore

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.453
of Cambodia, you'd be killed.

00:27:58.520 --> 00:27:58.813
And if you washed up on the
shore of Thailand you'd be safe.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:02.163
And you could imagine the moment
when my student's father stood

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:06.876
in the [inaudible] with that
boat and called out where are we?

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:12.570
Literally it was a life
and death question.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.386
Fortunately, it was Thailand

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:16.590
and then eventually the
family found sanctuary

00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:18.616
in the Philippines before
they came to America.

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.520
And that child, my student
was born in the refugee camp

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.420
in the Philippines and
her name today is Thai Phi

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.766
for the two countries, Thailand

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:32.526
and the Philippines
that gave her sanctuary.

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:36.226
Her family is not unusual,
the struggle and the tenacity

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:41.140
and the courage that her family
showed to escape from Vietnam

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.266
and survive that hardship
is just one tiny chapter

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:47.310
of this marvelous story that
immigrants are writing everyday.
