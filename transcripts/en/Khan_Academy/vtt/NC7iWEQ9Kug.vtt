00:00:00.882 --> 00:00:02.372
Voiceover:Which of these are contained

00:00:02.372 --> 00:00:07.508
in the solution set to
sine of X is equal to 1/3?

00:00:07.508 --> 00:00:10.361
Answers should be rounded
to the nearest hundredths.

00:00:10.361 --> 00:00:12.139
Select all that apply.

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:14.027
I encourage you to pause
the video right now

00:00:14.027 --> 00:00:16.783
and work on it on your own.

00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:18.638
I'm assuming you've given a go at it.

00:00:18.638 --> 00:00:20.219
Let's think about what this is asking.

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:21.777
They're asking what are the X values?

00:00:21.777 --> 00:00:23.367
What is the solution set?

00:00:23.367 --> 00:00:24.618
What are the possible X values

00:00:24.618 --> 00:00:28.003
where sine of X is equal to 1/3?

00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:30.029
To help us visualize this,

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.617
let's draw a unit circle.

00:00:32.617 --> 00:00:35.559
That's my Y axis.

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.270
This right over here is my X axis.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.912
This is X set one.

00:00:41.912 --> 00:00:44.150
This is Y positive one.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.887
Negative one along the X axis,

00:00:45.887 --> 00:00:47.934
and negative one on the Y axis.

00:00:47.934 --> 00:00:51.065
The unit circle, I'm going
to center it at zero.

00:00:51.065 --> 00:00:53.265
It's going to have a radius of one,

00:00:53.265 --> 00:00:55.187
a radius of one and we just
have to remind ourselves

00:00:55.187 --> 00:00:58.564
what the unit circle definition
of the sine function is.

00:00:58.564 --> 00:01:02.845
If we have some angle,
one side of the angle

00:01:02.845 --> 00:01:05.961
is going to be a ray
along the positive X axis,

00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:08.210
if we do this in a color you can see,

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.339
along the positive X axis.

00:01:10.339 --> 00:01:13.370
Then the other side, so let's see,

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.839
this is our angle right over here.

00:01:14.839 --> 00:01:16.760
Let's say that's some angle theta.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.000
The sine of this angle is going to be

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.609
the Y value of where this ray intersects

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:22.878
the unit circle.

00:01:22.878 --> 00:01:25.069
This right over here, that is going to be

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:27.252
sine of theta.

00:01:27.252 --> 00:01:28.811
With that review out of the way,

00:01:28.811 --> 00:01:30.501
let's think about what X values,

00:01:30.501 --> 00:01:33.431
and we're assuming we're
dealing in radians.

00:01:33.462 --> 00:01:35.566
What X values when if
I take the sine of it

00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:38.378
are going to give me 1/3?

00:01:38.378 --> 00:01:41.093
When does Y equal 1/3
along the unit circle?

00:01:41.093 --> 00:01:44.850
That's 2/3, 1/3 right over here.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.713
We see it equals 1/3 exactly two places,

00:01:48.713 --> 00:01:50.638
here and here.

00:01:50.638 --> 00:01:53.139
There's two angles where, or at least two,

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:55.745
if we just take one or two on each pass

00:01:55.745 --> 00:01:56.714
of the unit circle.

00:01:56.714 --> 00:01:58.725
Then we can keep adding
multiples of two pi

00:01:58.725 --> 00:02:00.575
to get as many as we want.

00:02:00.575 --> 00:02:03.772
We see just on the unit circle
we could have this angle.

00:02:03.772 --> 00:02:06.600
We could have this angle right over here.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.539
Or we could go all the way around

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.923
to that angle right over there.

00:02:12.923 --> 00:02:15.051
Then we could add any multiple of two pi

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:17.133
to those angles to get other angles

00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:18.440
that would also work where if I took

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.442
the sine of them I would get 1/3.

00:02:21.442 --> 00:02:23.111
Now let's think about what these are.

00:02:23.111 --> 00:02:25.190
Here we can take our calculator out,

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.278
and we could take the inverse sine of 1/3.

00:02:28.278 --> 00:02:29.081
Let's do that.

00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:34.406
The inverse sine of 1 over 3.

00:02:34.406 --> 00:02:36.335
We have to remember what the range

00:02:36.335 --> 00:02:37.598
of the inverse sine function is.

00:02:37.598 --> 00:02:39.446
It's going to give us a value between

00:02:39.446 --> 00:02:42.278
negative pi over 2 and pi over 2,

00:02:42.278 --> 00:02:44.468
so a value that sticks us in either

00:02:44.468 --> 00:02:46.392
the first or the fourth quadrant if we're

00:02:46.392 --> 00:02:49.145
thinking about the unit
circle right over here.

00:02:49.145 --> 00:02:51.785
We see that gave us zero point,

00:02:51.785 --> 00:02:53.404
if we round to the nearest hundredth,

00:02:53.404 --> 00:02:54.721
34.

00:02:54.721 --> 00:02:57.164
Essentially they've given us this value.

00:02:57.164 --> 00:03:00.145
They've given us 0.34.

00:03:00.145 --> 00:03:01.485
That's this angle right over here.

00:03:01.485 --> 00:03:02.110
How did I know that?

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.108
Well, it's a positive value.

00:03:03.108 --> 00:03:04.494
It's greater than zero,

00:03:04.494 --> 00:03:06.710
but it's less than pi over two.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.759
Pi is 3.14, so pi over two is going to be

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:13.226
1.57 and we can go

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:14.618
on and on and on so this right over here

00:03:14.618 --> 00:03:17.668
is 0.34 radians.

00:03:17.668 --> 00:03:20.387
But what would this thing over here be?

00:03:20.387 --> 00:03:21.787
It's going to be whatever,

00:03:21.787 --> 00:03:24.240
if we go to the negative X axis

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.350
and we subtract 0.34

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.267
so we subtracted 0.34.

00:03:29.267 --> 00:03:31.125
This is 0.34

00:03:31.125 --> 00:03:33.304
We're going to get to this angle.

00:03:33.304 --> 00:03:36.798
It's going to be if we take pi

00:03:36.798 --> 00:03:40.842
minus the previous answer, it gets us

00:03:40.842 --> 00:03:41.840
we round to the nearest hundredth,

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.086
is 2.8 radians.

00:03:44.086 --> 00:03:47.529
This is 0.34 radians, and then this one,

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:49.151
let me do it in this purple color,

00:03:49.151 --> 00:03:51.233
this one right over here if we were to go

00:03:51.233 --> 00:03:52.231
all the way around,

00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:57.585
it's pi minus 0.34 which is 2.80 radians

00:03:57.585 --> 00:03:59.476
rounding to the nearest hundredth.

00:03:59.476 --> 00:04:00.739
Now that's not all of the values.

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.572
We can add multiples of
two pi to each of these.

00:04:03.572 --> 00:04:07.786
So 2.80 plus any multiple of two pi's,

00:04:07.786 --> 00:04:10.850
so two pi N where N is an integer.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.083
N is an integer.

00:04:14.083 --> 00:04:18.247
Or we could take 0.34 and add any multiple

00:04:18.247 --> 00:04:19.794
of two pi.

00:04:19.794 --> 00:04:27.096
So two pi N where N is an integer.

00:04:27.096 --> 00:04:30.330
Our solution set here
just to rewrite it kind of

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.994
outside of this messiness

00:04:31.994 --> 00:04:35.422
is going to be 2.80 radians plus two pi N

00:04:35.422 --> 00:04:37.060
where N is an integer,

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:43.297
and 0.34 plus two pi N
where N is an integer.

00:04:43.297 --> 00:04:45.046
Let's see which of these are at least

00:04:45.046 --> 00:04:47.545
a subset of this.

00:04:47.545 --> 00:04:51.401
We look at 0.34 plus two
pi N where N is an integer.

00:04:51.401 --> 00:04:53.754
That's exactly what we wrote over here.

00:04:53.754 --> 00:04:55.185
That's 0.34.

00:04:55.185 --> 00:04:57.888
If N is a positive integer
we'll go around this way

00:04:57.888 --> 00:04:59.374
and we keep getting
back to the same point.

00:04:59.374 --> 00:05:01.016
If it's a negative integer
we go around that way.

00:05:01.016 --> 00:05:02.510
We keep getting to the same point,

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.505
but that's definitely in the solution set.

00:05:05.505 --> 00:05:09.611
0.34 plus pi N for N an integer.

00:05:09.611 --> 00:05:12.091
So if we have 0.34 and
if we were to not add

00:05:12.091 --> 00:05:14.800
two pi, but just pi where would we get to?

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.200
Well, we would get to right over there.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.405
The sine of this isn't
going to be positive 1/3.

00:05:21.405 --> 00:05:23.435
It's going to be negative 1/3.

00:05:23.435 --> 00:05:25.520
So we could rule that out.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.650
Negative 0.34, well that's
this angle right over here.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.741
The sine of that's going
to be negative 1/3.

00:05:31.741 --> 00:05:33.725
If you add a multiple of two pi to that,

00:05:33.725 --> 00:05:35.276
you're still going to get negative 1/3

00:05:35.276 --> 00:05:36.584
so that doesn't work.

00:05:36.584 --> 00:05:38.822
Same thing for this one right over here.

00:05:38.822 --> 00:05:42.511
2.8 plus two pi N, that's
what we wrote right over here.

00:05:42.511 --> 00:05:45.207
2 point going all the way to 2.8

00:05:45.207 --> 00:05:47.043
and any multiple of it
is going to get you back

00:05:47.043 --> 00:05:49.541
to that same point so that one works.

00:05:49.541 --> 00:05:51.953
2.8 plus pi N so if you're here

00:05:51.953 --> 00:05:54.483
and if you added pi you're
going to get over here,

00:05:54.483 --> 00:05:57.076
and the sine of that isn't
going to be positive 1/3.

00:05:57.076 --> 00:05:59.441
It's going to be negative 1/3

00:05:59.441 --> 00:06:01.638
so we can rule this one out as well.

00:06:01.638 --> 00:06:03.399
These are the only two apply,

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:05.041
and if you actually take them together

00:06:05.041 --> 00:06:06.785
you have the entire solution set

00:06:06.785 --> 00:06:08.835
to this equation right over here.
