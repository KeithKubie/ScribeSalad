00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:03.503
China is performing a minor
miracle right now.

00:00:03.503 --> 00:00:06.605
They are taking
captive-born pandas

00:00:06.605 --> 00:00:09.342
and releasing them back
into the wild.

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:12.245
<i>They're also creating corridors</i>

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:14.747
<i>and creating more habitat
 for pandas</i>

00:00:14.747 --> 00:00:16.949
<i> and a whole host of
 other species.</i>

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.218
<i> So, I had front row
 access to this,</i>

00:00:19.218 --> 00:00:21.287
and this was quite a
big privilege,

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:24.491
because no foreigners have ever
been allowed to cover this.

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:26.992 line:0%
I was there with a film team

00:00:26.992 --> 00:00:31.030 line:0%
and we were covering this
incredible moment as Hope,

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.298
that was her name,

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:34.233
was taking her first
trepid steps

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:36.669
out into the wild for
the first time.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.507
<i>- Me trying to be empathetic.</i>
- ( audience laughter )

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.142
<i>I dressed up in a ghillie suit</i>

00:00:43.142 --> 00:00:44.677
<i> because I didn't want
 to scare her</i>

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:47.913
when she was taking those
steps out into the wild.

00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:53.619
And the director of the panda
program, Director Zhang Hemin,

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:55.889
also called Papa Panda,

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:58.591
saw me and he came
running up to me

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:00.159
and he gave me a
hug and he said,

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:03.095
"You will get to hold
two baby pandas."

00:01:03.095 --> 00:01:04.964
( audience laughter )

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:07.867
"President Obama,
he only held one."

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:09.702
( audience laughter )

00:01:12.772 --> 00:01:17.310
I know! It's so crazy!
( laughs )

00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:22.915
<i> So they laid out their
 bumper crop</i>

00:01:22.915 --> 00:01:26.452
<i>that year of baby pandas.</i>

00:01:26.853 --> 00:01:30.056
<i>And then I got to go back,
 and this is very recent,</i>

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:32.425
<i> this is this year.</i>

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:35.762
<i>They actually had even a bigger
 bumper crop,</i>

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:38.564
<i> I think it was twenty
 six baby pandas born.</i>

00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:42.502
It's incredible.
( laughs )

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:45.605
( audience laughter )

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:49.274
They will melt
your heart, truly.

00:01:49.274 --> 00:01:50.743
<i>So they did something amazing.</i>

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:52.912
<i>They cracked the code how
 you breed them.</i>

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:55.448
<i> Because for a long time,
 for fifteen years,</i>

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:57.116
they couldn't figure out how,
you know,

00:01:57.116 --> 00:01:59.652
how you successfully
breed the pandas.

00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:02.288
But it turns out,
pandas are like humans.

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:03.589
They're picky.

00:02:03.589 --> 00:02:06.258
They don't have eHarmony
or Match.com.

00:02:06.525 --> 00:02:11.064
So, it took sort of realizing
they needed to find a partner

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:12.365
that they liked.

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:16.469
And the females only are
able to have a baby--

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:20.339
they basically have
24 to 72 hours to get pregnant.

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:22.208
That's it, an entire year.

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:24.110
So it's a very narrow window

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.513
and you have to find the
right partner for her.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.881
So they've done that.

00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:32.084
And what is so incredible is

00:02:32.084 --> 00:02:35.254
<i>they're born blind, deaf and</i>

00:02:35.254 --> 00:02:37.390
<i> just a little squiggle
 of a thing.</i>

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.192
<i> And completely helpless.</i>

00:02:40.192 --> 00:02:42.228
But the mothers are incredible,

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:44.230
they just take such
good care.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.000
They won't-- for days, they go
without water and food and

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.769
they just hold on to their
babies and take care of them.

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.673
<i>- They're one of the fastest--</i>
- ( audience laughter )

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:55.674
<i> fastest growing mammals.</i>

00:02:55.975 --> 00:02:59.511
<i> So, this little guy is
 maybe a month old.</i>

00:02:59.511 --> 00:03:01.046
So they grow fast.

00:03:01.046 --> 00:03:05.284
And literally every week I'd go
into the incubator room and

00:03:05.284 --> 00:03:09.189
they would just grow in
front of your eyes. Incredible.
