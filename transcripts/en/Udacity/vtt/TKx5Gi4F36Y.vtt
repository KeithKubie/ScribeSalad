00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.540
Another option you have for
paid marketing is to directly buy

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.440
ad space from websites, or
more easily, from ad networks.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.630
There are some websites who can sell
you their ad real estate directly.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.250
But in most cases, you'll use an ad
network or an ad exchange platform

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.930
to buy ad space and target your
audience in the most relevant websites.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.090
These networks are using today's
technological platforms that allow both

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.180
advertisers and publishers to optimize
their buy or sell, accordingly.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.340
These platforms are called DSP and SSP.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.760
Demand side platform and
supply side platform.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.890
A demand side platform allows
advertisers to engage in transparent

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.400
automated media buying across multiple
sources using unified targeting,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.320
data, optimization, and reporting.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.470
The platform helps the ad buyer
to aggregate all this data and

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.799
find the most ideal impressions for
a campaign.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.620
A supply side platform helps
web publishers automate and

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.220
optimize the selling of
their online media space.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.900
