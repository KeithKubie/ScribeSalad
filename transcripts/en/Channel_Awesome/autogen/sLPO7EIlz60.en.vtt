00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.450 align:start position:0%
like an insecure like kind of whiny
right<00:07:22.720><c> dude</c><00:07:23.080><c> who</c><00:07:23.410><c> was</c><00:07:23.500><c> just</c><00:07:23.650><c> trying</c><00:07:23.950><c> to</c><00:07:24.040><c> assert</c>

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:24.460 align:start position:0%
right dude who was just trying to assert
 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.580 align:start position:0%
right dude who was just trying to assert
his<00:07:24.610><c> dominance</c><00:07:24.640><c> over</c><00:07:25.330><c> this</c><00:07:25.630><c> 8th</c><00:07:25.900><c> grader</c><00:07:26.230><c> right</c>

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:26.590 align:start position:0%
his dominance over this 8th grader right
 

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:27.870 align:start position:0%
his dominance over this 8th grader right
so<00:07:26.770><c> it</c><00:07:26.980><c> made</c><00:07:27.130><c> sense</c><00:07:27.340><c> that</c><00:07:27.550><c> that's</c><00:07:27.610><c> where</c><00:07:27.820><c> it</c>

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:27.880 align:start position:0%
so it made sense that that's where it
 

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.670 align:start position:0%
so it made sense that that's where it
stopped<00:07:28.090><c> and</c><00:07:28.270><c> I</c><00:07:28.420><c> also</c><00:07:28.660><c> just</c><00:07:28.930><c> really</c><00:07:29.290><c> enjoyed</c>
