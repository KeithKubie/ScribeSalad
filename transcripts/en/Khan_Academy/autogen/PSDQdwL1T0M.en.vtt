00:00:00.307 --> 00:00:02.385
 The Master of Scarlett and Hensle gave them 

00:00:02.385 --> 00:00:04.369
 a system of linear equations to solve. 

00:00:04.369 --> 00:00:05.922
 Each of them has taken several steps that have led 

00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:07.825
 to the systems shown in the table below. 

00:00:07.825 --> 00:00:08.788
 So, this is the system of teacher's equations. 

00:00:08.788 --> 00:00:11.308
 She received Scarlett after she had done several steps. 

00:00:11.308 --> 00:00:12.909
 That's got Hanks. 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:14.106
 Which one has received a system, 

00:00:14.106 --> 00:00:17.019
 equivalent to the teacher's system? 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.681
 And just to remember, 

00:00:17.681 --> 00:00:19.701
 equivalent to a given system is, 

00:00:19.701 --> 00:00:21.303
 at least for our purpose, 

00:00:21.303 --> 00:00:23.822
 a system that has the same solution, 

00:00:23.822 --> 00:00:25.320
 or the same set of decisions as the one given. 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.898
 If there is a precisely defined pair (x, y) 

00:00:26.898 --> 00:00:28.268
 which satisfies the teacher's system, 

00:00:28.268 --> 00:00:31.160
 in order for Scarlett's system to be equivalent to that system, 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.458
 it must have the same solution. 

00:00:33.458 --> 00:00:34.967
 Let's look at it. 

00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:36.406
 Scarlett ... Let's see 

00:00:36.406 --> 00:00:39.159
 whether we can connect them. 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:43.465
 Her second equation here, 

00:00:43.465 --> 00:00:45.473
 this is interesting, 

00:00:45.473 --> 00:00:49.235
 its second equation 14x minus 7u is equal to 2, 

00:00:49.235 --> 00:00:50.813
 here the teacher has an equation 

00:00:50.813 --> 00:00:54.133
 14x minus 7u is equal to 7. 

00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.745
 This is interesting because the ratio 

00:00:56.745 --> 00:00:59.334
 between x and y is the same, 

00:00:59.334 --> 00:01:01.354
 but then the permanent member, 

00:01:01.354 --> 00:01:04.744
 the permanent member will be different. 

00:01:04.744 --> 00:01:06.114
 And I say, 

00:01:06.114 --> 00:01:09.109
 that this is already telling us that Scarlett's system 

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:11.629
 is not equivalent to that of the teacher. 

00:01:11.629 --> 00:01:14.624
 You're probably wondering how can I say that? 

00:01:14.624 --> 00:01:16.690
 If you write these two equations 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.128
 in the type of tilt-intersection, 

00:01:19.128 --> 00:01:20.590
 you will see the reason, because the ratio 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.895
 between members x and y is the same. 

00:01:23.895 --> 00:01:25.637
 You will have the same slope, 

00:01:25.637 --> 00:01:27.273
 but you will have a different cross with the y y axis. 

00:01:27.273 --> 00:01:28.690
 In fact, we can find it. 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.072
 This equation is here 

00:01:30.072 --> 00:01:32.927
 can be written as ... Let's see, 

00:01:32.927 --> 00:01:35.133
 if we pull out 14x on both sides, 

00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:38.761
 we get minus 7th 

00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:41.721
 is equal 

00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:45.892
 to minus 14x plus 7 

00:01:45.892 --> 00:01:47.749
 and we can divide both sides to minus 7. 

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:52.485
 We get y is equal to 2x minus 1, and that is ... 

00:01:52.485 --> 00:01:54.321
 I just did this algebraically. 

00:01:54.321 --> 00:01:55.643
 The right is this and I can even try 

00:01:55.643 --> 00:01:58.046
 to draw it. 

00:01:58.046 --> 00:02:00.484
 I'll draw a quick coordinate system. 

00:02:00.484 --> 00:02:02.087
 This will be a very rough drawing. 

00:02:02.087 --> 00:02:04.084
 Quick coordinate axes are there 

00:02:04.084 --> 00:02:06.138
 and then this right, 

00:02:06.138 --> 00:02:08.901
 this right will look like this. 

00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:12.457
 Its intersection with the y axis is minus 1 and it has a slope of 2. 

00:02:12.457 --> 00:02:16.196
 Let me draw straight lines with slope 2, 

00:02:16.196 --> 00:02:19.071
 it might seem 

00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:22.493
 like this. 

00:02:22.493 --> 00:02:24.935
 This is the right here 

00:02:24.935 --> 00:02:28.499
 or there and ... 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:29.753
 Let's see. 

00:02:29.753 --> 00:02:32.992
 This is going to be ... 

00:02:32.992 --> 00:02:35.058
 If we do the same algebraic calculations, 

00:02:35.058 --> 00:02:36.296
 we will have 

00:02:36.296 --> 00:02:41.156
 minus 7u is equal to minus 14x plus 2, 

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:45.028
 or y is equal, just divide everything down to minus 7, 

00:02:45.028 --> 00:02:49.423
 2x minus 2/7. 

00:02:50.173 --> 00:02:52.018
 This will look like this. 

00:02:52.018 --> 00:02:56.522
 Its intersection point with y is minus 2/7 and it's somewhere out there. 

00:02:56.522 --> 00:02:59.401
 These rights will look like this, 

00:02:59.401 --> 00:03:00.377
 I will do my best 

00:03:00.377 --> 00:03:02.791
 an attempt to draw it, 

00:03:02.791 --> 00:03:05.257
 it will look something like ... 

00:03:05.257 --> 00:03:07.294
 In fact, this is not quite accurate. 

00:03:07.294 --> 00:03:08.462
 It will look like ... 

00:03:08.462 --> 00:03:10.551
 I'll start here here. 

00:03:10.551 --> 00:03:13.082
 It will look like ... 

00:03:13.082 --> 00:03:14.592
 Something like this. 

00:03:14.592 --> 00:03:16.228
 There will be the same slope 

00:03:16.228 --> 00:03:18.608
 and the same direction. 

00:03:18.608 --> 00:03:20.686
 Let me draw it. 

00:03:20.686 --> 00:03:22.706
 It will have the same slope, 

00:03:22.706 --> 00:03:25.643
 but a different intersection with y. 

00:03:25.643 --> 00:03:27.744
 That does not look right, but you get a clue. 

00:03:27.744 --> 00:03:29.509
 These two do 

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:30.507
 are parallel, 

00:03:30.507 --> 00:03:33.386
 therefore, no coordinate that satisfies these rights, 

00:03:33.386 --> 00:03:34.942
 will not satisfy this. 

00:03:34.942 --> 00:03:36.868
 They have no common points. 

00:03:36.868 --> 00:03:37.786
 They are parallel. 

00:03:37.786 --> 00:03:40.166
 This is the definition of parallelism. 

00:03:40.166 --> 00:03:43.567
 Because this and this rights have no common points, 

00:03:43.567 --> 00:03:45.448
 there is no way any of the solutions, 

00:03:45.448 --> 00:03:47.503
 which satisfies this equation, also satisfies this, 

00:03:47.503 --> 00:03:49.964
 because each (x, y) that satisfies this, 

00:03:49.964 --> 00:03:52.448
 will not satisfy this and vice versa. 

00:03:52.448 --> 00:03:53.249
 They are parallel. 

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:54.364
 They have no common points. 

00:03:54.364 --> 00:03:56.824
 These two things will never cross. 

00:03:56.824 --> 00:04:00.006
 So Scarlett's system is not equivalent to that of the teacher. 

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:02.502
 But what about Hanks? 

00:04:02.502 --> 00:04:04.104
 We see here that Hanks is here 

00:04:04.104 --> 00:04:05.346
 the same thing. 

00:04:05.346 --> 00:04:09.688
 5x minus y, but then the permanent member 

00:04:09.688 --> 00:04:13.101
 is different, minus 6, plus 3. 

00:04:13.101 --> 00:04:16.502
 So this and this also represent parallel rows. 

00:04:16.502 --> 00:04:19.091
 Each pair (x, y) that satisfies this, 

00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:21.204
 will not satisfy that either. 

00:04:21.204 --> 00:04:23.003
 These two rules do not intersect. 

00:04:23.003 --> 00:04:24.489
 They are parallel. 

00:04:24.489 --> 00:04:28.651
 Hence, the Hanks system is also not equivalent to that of the teacher.
