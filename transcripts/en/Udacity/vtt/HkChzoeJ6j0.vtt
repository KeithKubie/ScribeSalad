00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This is the Super Hard Quiz of Doom and our last question on finite state machines

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and regular languages and regular expressions.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This requires quite a bit of abstract thinking so don't feel bad if this takes a number of tries.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
These questions are always, sometimes, and never.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I've written out two claims, and what I want you to do is mark this box if the first claim is always true,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
mark this box if they're sometimes when it's true and sometime when it's false,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and this box if it's never true. So here's the first claim.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Suppose I have any finite state machine A. You draw it out for me.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Can I then make a new finite state machine that accepts strings of the following form?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
For any string that's in yours, I then get another string that's in yours

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and I accept their concatenation when I glue them together.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
This is a little hard to get a feeling for but let's imagine my finite state machine A accepted

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
ba ba ba, that sort of thing.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Then I want to make a new finite state machine that accepts

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
ba ba, ba ba, ba ba, doublings of the first finite state machine.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Down here, I have a very similar claim but with one bit change.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
If I have a finite state machine B, can I make a new finite state machine that accepts strings

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
of this form--x concatenated with x where x was a string accepted by B?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So if you give me a finite statement machine that only recognizes hello,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
can I make a new finite machine that recognizes hello, hello?

00:01:20.000 --> 09:59:59.000
I don't know why you'd say that. Anyway, give this some thought. This may take some extra time.
