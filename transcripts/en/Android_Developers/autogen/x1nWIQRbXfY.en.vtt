studios down in Australia and and they

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380
studios down in Australia and and they
 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.199
studios down in Australia and and they
really have I think set the bar for

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209
really have I think set the bar for
 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.590
really have I think set the bar for
realistic graphics on a racing game

oh you might not like that and the main
 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:49.870
oh you might not like that and the main
reason is because you might be somewhere

so have a license policy that lets you

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820
so have a license policy that lets you
 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.790
so have a license policy that lets you
check license intermittently you don't

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800
check license intermittently you don't
 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.520
check license intermittently you don't
get it if you don't get contact with the

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530
get it if you don't get contact with the
 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.320

actually you know think that it makes a
 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.879
actually you know think that it makes a
lot of sense of the people can still you

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889
lot of sense of the people can still you
 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:20.379
lot of sense of the people can still you
know get their license and yet play the

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389
know get their license and yet play the
 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:22.450
know get their license and yet play the
game on a plane or something like that

to have constraints with a mobile device

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990
to have constraints with a mobile device
 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.939
to have constraints with a mobile device
mobile devices have power and heat and

console or desktop computer don't have
but with all that considered it's a

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430
but with all that considered it's a
 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.010
but with all that considered it's a
really nice-looking game I mean they've

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020
really nice-looking game I mean they've
 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.129
really nice-looking game I mean they've
done all of the interstitials and the

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139
done all of the interstitials and the
 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:05.770
done all of the interstitials and the
HUD and everything just like I remember

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780
HUD and everything just like I remember
 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.020

it on my xbox it's great stuff and you

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030
it on my xbox it's great stuff and you
 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.370
it on my xbox it's great stuff and you
can actually one thing that that's not

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:09.380
can actually one thing that that's not
 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.870
can actually one thing that that's not
easy to figure out if you can actually

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880
easy to figure out if you can actually
 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.060
easy to figure out if you can actually
change the view here you'll notice we

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.070
change the view here you'll notice we
 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.620
change the view here you'll notice we
actually could just but you know you

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630
actually could just but you know you
 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.390
actually could just but you know you
actually would think that that you would

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400
actually would think that that you would
 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.330
actually would think that that you would
get a higher framerate when the full hut

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340
get a higher framerate when the full hut
 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.670
get a higher framerate when the full hut
was up but actually you don't and I show

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680
was up but actually you don't and I show
 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.980
was up but actually you don't and I show
that Hut again so here's here's our

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990
that Hut again so here's here's our
 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.390
that Hut again so here's here's our
different views here's our full screen

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400
different views here's our full screen
 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.100
different views here's our full screen
there's our front and there's there's

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110
there's our front and there's there's
 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.810
there's our front and there's there's
with the HUD right and what's the

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:28.820
with the HUD right and what's the
 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.060
with the HUD right and what's the
problem here down why why

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.070
problem here down why why
 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.710
problem here down why why
and the theory that I have and again I

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720
and the theory that I have and again I
 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.960
and the theory that I have and again I
have I haven't I've been thrown this one

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:34.970
have I haven't I've been thrown this one
 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.480
have I haven't I've been thrown this one
through all of my tools is that in fact

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.490
through all of my tools is that in fact
 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.340
through all of my tools is that in fact
if you notice the out the border of the

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:39.350
if you notice the out the border of the
 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.410
if you notice the out the border of the
HUD actually has some transom

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:41.420
HUD actually has some transom
 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.910
HUD actually has some transom
translucency on it you can see the

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:42.920
translucency on it you can see the
 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.980
translucency on it you can see the
outside of those windows and so my

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:44.990
outside of those windows and so my
 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.540
outside of those windows and so my
theory is that they're actually drawing

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:46.550
theory is that they're actually drawing
 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.120
theory is that they're actually drawing
this HUD last in order to get that a

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:49.130
this HUD last in order to get that a
 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.130
this HUD last in order to get that a
little bit of transparency and what they

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:51.140
little bit of transparency and what they
 

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.930
little bit of transparency and what they
probably should be doing is drawing just

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:52.940
probably should be doing is drawing just
 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.780
probably should be doing is drawing just
the translucent parts of the HUD last

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:55.790
the translucent parts of the HUD last
 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.310
the translucent parts of the HUD last
and actually drawing the rest of the HUD

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:57.320
and actually drawing the rest of the HUD
 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.930
and actually drawing the rest of the HUD
first cuz you'll actually see the

00:06:58.930 --> 00:06:58.940
first cuz you'll actually see the
 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.180
first cuz you'll actually see the
framerate is just killer when it's not

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:01.190
framerate is just killer when it's not
 

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:02.770
framerate is just killer when it's not
there right they probably can't see it

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:02.780
there right they probably can't see it
 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:03.760
there right they probably can't see it
because I don't think we can capture

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:03.770
because I don't think we can capture
 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.980
because I don't think we can capture
video for youtube yeah highest frame

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:05.990
video for youtube yeah highest frame
 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.170
video for youtube yeah highest frame
rate this device can put out but take it

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:08.180
rate this device can put out but take it
 

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.300
rate this device can put out but take it
big dan's word for it because dan has

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:10.310
big dan's word for it because dan has
 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.330
big dan's word for it because dan has
sort of a fifth sense when it comes to

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:13.340
sort of a fifth sense when it comes to
 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.790
sort of a fifth sense when it comes to
frame rate ya know it looks it looks

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:15.800
frame rate ya know it looks it looks
 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.070
frame rate ya know it looks it looks
amazing and actually I I found that I

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080
amazing and actually I I found that I
 

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.330
amazing and actually I I found that I
really love playing it this way I

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:19.340
really love playing it this way I
 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.480
really love playing it this way I
actually get a sense of speed playing it

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:22.490
actually get a sense of speed playing it
 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.340
actually get a sense of speed playing it
full screen without the HUD that's a

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:24.350
full screen without the HUD that's a
 

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.810
full screen without the HUD that's a
nice texture down there yes beautiful

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:25.820
nice texture down there yes beautiful
 

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.850
nice texture down there yes beautiful
you can even see on the road what I love

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:27.860
you can even see on the road what I love
 

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.380
you can even see on the road what I love

you can see MIT mapping though that

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:34.370
you can see MIT mapping though that
 

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.130
you can see MIT mapping though that
textures and beautifully MIT map so that

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:36.140
textures and beautifully MIT map so that
 

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.230

know clogging down the GPU with lots of
 

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:45.820
know clogging down the GPU with lots of
extra drawing and so you know i mean

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:45.830
extra drawing and so you know i mean
 

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.860

textures might be a slightly bit

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:53.000
textures might be a slightly bit
 

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.270
textures might be a slightly bit
blurrier but there but where we have

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:55.280
blurrier but there but where we have
 

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.800

such a great feeling of speed and the
 

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:57.910
such a great feeling of speed and the
frame rate is high enough that we don't

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:57.920
frame rate is high enough that we don't
 

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.470
frame rate is high enough that we don't
even notice it and even little things

00:07:59.470 --> 00:07:59.480
even notice it and even little things
 

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.740

the screen which is awesome you actually
have to hit the back key to get here and

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:19.850
have to hit the back key to get here and
 

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.730
have to hit the back key to get here and
then you can actually go and change in

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:21.740
then you can actually go and change in
 

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.510
then you can actually go and change in
the settings to go and say that I don't

want to have the heads up display and
and now we can actually go back and it's

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:31.970
and now we can actually go back and it's
 

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:33.630
and now we can actually go back and it's
again it's all driven using the standard

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:33.640
again it's all driven using the standard
 

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.779
again it's all driven using the standard
Android navigation system which is cool

00:08:36.779 --> 00:08:36.789
Android navigation system which is cool
 

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:39.159
Android navigation system which is cool
and so now there we have it we're really

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:39.169
and so now there we have it we're really
 

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:41.560
and so now there we have it we're really
just full screen which is kind of

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:41.570
just full screen which is kind of
 

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:42.909
just full screen which is kind of
awesome like just being able to get to

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:42.919
awesome like just being able to get to
 

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.680
awesome like just being able to get to
this view I think is super

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:44.690
this view I think is super
 

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:45.880
this view I think is super
killer the other thing is that they

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:45.890
killer the other thing is that they
 

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.710
killer the other thing is that they
don't have an accelerator all we can do

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:47.720
don't have an accelerator all we can do
 

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.680
don't have an accelerator all we can do
is break we break by tapping the screen

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:49.690
is break we break by tapping the screen
 

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:52.270
is break we break by tapping the screen
and so it is no you can't actually put

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:52.280
and so it is no you can't actually put
 

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.280
and so it is no you can't actually put
it into a mode where you need to both

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:54.290
it into a mode where you need to both
 

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:56.890
it into a mode where you need to both
accelerate add break um which can be

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:56.900
accelerate add break um which can be
 

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:57.940
accelerate add break um which can be
nice actually I prefer it that way

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:57.950
nice actually I prefer it that way
 

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:02.140
nice actually I prefer it that way
because i like to slide around corners I

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:02.150
because i like to slide around corners I
 

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:04.750
because i like to slide around corners I
just decelerating a bit um but I think

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:04.760
just decelerating a bit um but I think
 

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.370
just decelerating a bit um but I think

they've they made the right choice as
 

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.950
they've they made the right choice as
far as making it easy to jump in and

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:08.960
far as making it easy to jump in and
 

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.440
far as making it easy to jump in and
play yes there's a lot of assists on

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:11.450
play yes there's a lot of assists on
 

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:13.570

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.140
I'm she's actually why don't you play
this game with the assist soft show them

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:17.150
this game with the assist soft show them
 

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.780
this game with the assist soft show them
what it what it feels like okay I just

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:19.790
what it what it feels like okay I just
 

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:22.090

let's go back into settings done and to

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:26.390
let's go back into settings done and to
 

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:30.430
let's go back into settings done and to
wonder under your settings yeah so I

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:30.440
wonder under your settings yeah so I
 

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.140
wonder under your settings yeah so I
think I have I can't change career

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:32.150
think I have I can't change career
 

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.490
think I have I can't change career
difficulty here I'd have to restore

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:33.500
difficulty here I'd have to restore
 

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:34.930
difficulty here I'd have to restore
you'd have to restart the race yeah

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:34.940
you'd have to restart the race yeah
 

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:36.700
you'd have to restart the race yeah
exactly so that's that was that was what

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:36.710
exactly so that's that was that was what
 

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:39.310
exactly so that's that was that was what
I was afraid of but but yeah the game

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:39.320
I was afraid of but but yeah the game
 

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.020
I was afraid of but but yeah the game
really just have have a great sliding

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:41.030
really just have have a great sliding
 

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:42.550
really just have have a great sliding
scale but if you want to just jump into

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560
scale but if you want to just jump into
 

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.230
scale but if you want to just jump into
it it's great to it there's nothing to

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:44.240
it it's great to it there's nothing to
 

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.280
it it's great to it there's nothing to
prevent to it again is you're looking at

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:45.290
prevent to it again is you're looking at
 

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.200
prevent to it again is you're looking at
this freeze frame you can just see how

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:47.210
this freeze frame you can just see how
 

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.300
this freeze frame you can just see how
high quality that that text set road

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:49.310
high quality that that text set road
 

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.130
high quality that that text set road
texture is now let me take a look at

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:51.140
texture is now let me take a look at
 

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:55.210
texture is now let me take a look at
that actually so this is um like you

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:55.220
that actually so this is um like you
 

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.980
that actually so this is um like you
really I ya see that wouldn't be right

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:56.990
really I ya see that wouldn't be right
 

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:58.780
really I ya see that wouldn't be right
there and the what's really amazing is

00:09:58.780 --> 00:09:58.790
there and the what's really amazing is
 

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:00.640
there and the what's really amazing is
is that they've actually done a good job

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:00.650
is that they've actually done a good job
 

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:03.610
is that they've actually done a good job
of simulating a nice oh yeah I don't

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:03.620
of simulating a nice oh yeah I don't
 

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.990
of simulating a nice oh yeah I don't
think they're actually doing in i select

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:05.000
think they're actually doing in i select
 

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.310
think they're actually doing in i select
I don't think that's hard work and do it

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.320
I don't think that's hard work and do it
 

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.110
I don't think that's hard work and do it
mm-hmm at that level but yeah you know

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:08.120
mm-hmm at that level but yeah you know
 

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.620
mm-hmm at that level but yeah you know
you'll um for a lot of min map stuff so

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:11.630
you'll um for a lot of min map stuff so
 

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:14.140
you'll um for a lot of min map stuff so
you'll actually see sort of a line um

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:14.150
you'll actually see sort of a line um
 

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.720
you'll actually see sort of a line um
you know about let's say an inch from

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:16.730
you know about let's say an inch from
 

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:17.830
you know about let's say an inch from
the bottom of this screen you'd actually

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:17.840
the bottom of this screen you'd actually
 

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.300
the bottom of this screen you'd actually
see it turn really blurry or get some

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:21.310
see it turn really blurry or get some
 

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:23.620
see it turn really blurry or get some
you know just visual artifacts in

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:23.630
you know just visual artifacts in
 

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:25.810
you know just visual artifacts in
general there the attention to detail is

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:25.820

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.250
have no idea how I even got there but Oh
Rach I see that's my problem right I

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:41.260
Rach I see that's my problem right I
 

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.930
Rach I see that's my problem right I
just wrecked my car is completely

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:42.940
just wrecked my car is completely
 

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:46.290
just wrecked my car is completely
smashed up but it looks perfect why why

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:46.300
smashed up but it looks perfect why why
 

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.590
smashed up but it looks perfect why why
did fiat make you do that it's very

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600
did fiat make you do that it's very
 

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:53.670
did fiat make you do that it's very
possible so the yeah in general what you

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:53.680
possible so the yeah in general what you
 

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:57.690
possible so the yeah in general what you
want to do is draw your foreground

00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:57.700
want to do is draw your foreground
 

00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:59.820
want to do is draw your foreground
elements first so that you can take

00:17:59.820 --> 00:17:59.830
elements first so that you can take
 

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:03.870
elements first so that you can take
advantage of hierarchical Z and in this

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:03.880
advantage of hierarchical Z and in this
 

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.150
advantage of hierarchical Z and in this
case what you probably want to do you

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:06.160
case what you probably want to do you
 

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.040
case what you probably want to do you
know for a racing game is you can assume

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:08.050
know for a racing game is you can assume
 

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:09.750
know for a racing game is you can assume
that the players car is always going to

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:09.760
that the players car is always going to
 

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.030
that the players car is always going to
be in the foreground anything else is

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:12.040
be in the foreground anything else is
 

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.550
be in the foreground anything else is
probably not worth it the other cars are

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:14.560
probably not worth it the other cars are
 

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.260
probably not worth it the other cars are
almost never on the foreground yeah I

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:16.270
almost never on the foreground yeah I
 

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:17.640
almost never on the foreground yeah I
mean you really see when you see the

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:17.650
mean you really see when you see the
 

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:19.110
mean you really see when you see the
vegetation on the left-hand side of the

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120
vegetation on the left-hand side of the
 

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:20.130
vegetation on the left-hand side of the
screen that we're going on that that's

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:20.140
screen that we're going on that that's
 

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.080
screen that we're going on that that's
where you really really see the the

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:22.090
where you really really see the the
 

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:24.000
where you really really see the the
quality I think that's at exel density

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:24.010
quality I think that's at exel density
 

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:25.680
quality I think that's at exel density
issue it is you know they just aren't

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:25.690
issue it is you know they just aren't
 

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:27.470
issue it is you know they just aren't
loading up big enough textures um

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:27.480
loading up big enough textures um
 

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.550
loading up big enough textures um
although you know they have a lot of

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:29.560
although you know they have a lot of
 

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:33.390
although you know they have a lot of
varied textures they don't for the for

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:33.400
varied textures they don't for the for
 

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.410
varied textures they don't for the for
the areas of the track that are further

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:34.420
the areas of the track that are further
 

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:37.140
the areas of the track that are further
away it's actually very well done yes

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:37.150
away it's actually very well done yes
 

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:38.850
away it's actually very well done yes
absolutely absolutely I just I just

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:38.860
absolutely absolutely I just I just
 

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.140
absolutely absolutely I just I just
think there's there's probably one level

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:40.150
think there's there's probably one level
 

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:42.140
think there's there's probably one level
of MIT mapping that's missing right and

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:42.150
of MIT mapping that's missing right and
 

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:44.700
of MIT mapping that's missing right and
but you know that I know in the game

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:44.710
but you know that I know in the game
 

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:46.230
but you know that I know in the game
development process I wouldn't be

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.240
development process I wouldn't be
 

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:49.530
development process I wouldn't be
surprised if that level was created and

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:49.540
surprised if that level was created and
 

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:52.320
surprised if that level was created and
then thrown away very very possible you

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:52.330
then thrown away very very possible you
 

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:53.550
then thrown away very very possible you
can also say there is a bit of pop up

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:53.560
can also say there is a bit of pop up
 

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.430
can also say there is a bit of pop up
going on you look at I just noticed some

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:56.440
going on you look at I just noticed some
 

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.500
going on you look at I just noticed some
pop up and that's an issue especially

00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:58.510
pop up and that's an issue especially
 

00:18:58.510 --> 00:18:59.820
pop up and that's an issue especially
it's actually a little bit surprising

00:18:59.820 --> 00:18:59.830
it's actually a little bit surprising
 

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:02.430
it's actually a little bit surprising
considering for instance this particular

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:02.440

do you think it's ok to do all the art

00:24:04.289 --> 00:24:04.299
do you think it's ok to do all the art
 

00:24:04.299 --> 00:24:08.240
do you think it's ok to do all the art
on a canvas of say 400 x 240 height

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:08.250
on a canvas of say 400 x 240 height
 

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:10.400
on a canvas of say 400 x 240 height
with pixel art style he's asking because

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:10.410
with pixel art style he's asking because
 

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:11.930
with pixel art style he's asking because
the pixel art looks nice when stretch

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:11.940
the pixel art looks nice when stretch
 

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:13.610
the pixel art looks nice when stretch
but it's all messed up when shrunken and

00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:13.620
but it's all messed up when shrunken and
 

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:15.140
but it's all messed up when shrunken and
that goes against standard best

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:15.150
that goes against standard best
 

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:16.700
that goes against standard best
practices on game art where you

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:16.710
practices on game art where you
 

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:18.830
practices on game art where you
obviously you know have high res assets

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:18.840
obviously you know have high res assets
 

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.870
obviously you know have high res assets
and then shrink them down although

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880
and then shrink them down although
 

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.700
and then shrink them down although
making two separate groups of artwork

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:22.710
making two separate groups of artwork
 

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:24.440
making two separate groups of artwork
both big and small seems to be a better

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:24.450
both big and small seems to be a better
 

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:25.790
both big and small seems to be a better
option it's not practical because it's

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:25.800
option it's not practical because it's
 

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.430
option it's not practical because it's
going to take too many resources well

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.440
going to take too many resources well
 

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.920
going to take too many resources well
remember that the reason it looks bad

filtering which isn't very good now if
 

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:44.360

you run your art through something like

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:44.370
you run your art through something like
 

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:46.880
you run your art through something like
Photoshop and it does al &amp; co's filter

on it you're going to get art that looks

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:48.450
on it you're going to get art that looks
 

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:50.630

pretty much great yeah exactly i

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640
pretty much great yeah exactly i
 

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:51.500
pretty much great yeah exactly i
wouldn't i wouldn't worry too much about

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:51.510
wouldn't i wouldn't worry too much about
 

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:53.180
wouldn't i wouldn't worry too much about
that you also you actually can't

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:53.190
that you also you actually can't
 

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:54.980
that you also you actually can't
actually you if you go into bitmap

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:54.990
actually you if you go into bitmap
 

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:56.270
actually you if you go into bitmap
factor you can set the options for

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:56.280
factor you can set the options for
 

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:59.480
factor you can set the options for
higher quality scaling as well within

00:24:59.480 --> 00:24:59.490
higher quality scaling as well within
 

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:02.210
higher quality scaling as well within
your within the actual you know scaling

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:02.220
your within the actual you know scaling
 

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:03.770
your within the actual you know scaling
of the bitmaps and that that may help

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:03.780
of the bitmaps and that that may help
 

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:05.960
of the bitmaps and that that may help
you out as well but the truth is yeah I

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:05.970
you out as well but the truth is yeah I
 

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:08.210
you out as well but the truth is yeah I
know my feeling is high high resolution

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:08.220
know my feeling is high high resolution
 

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:12.290
know my feeling is high high resolution
pixel art looks amazing and and you know

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:12.300
pixel art looks amazing and and you know
 

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.430
pixel art looks amazing and and you know
the games we saw have you looked at the

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440
the games we saw have you looked at the
 

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.350
the games we saw have you looked at the
last week's show we were doing tower

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360
last week's show we were doing tower
 

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.270
last week's show we were doing tower
defense games we saw some amazing high

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:17.280
defense games we saw some amazing high
 

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.400
defense games we saw some amazing high
res pixel art that just that was looked

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:19.410
res pixel art that just that was looked
 

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:22.160
res pixel art that just that was looked
mind lonely good on on these devices and

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:22.170
mind lonely good on on these devices and
 

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:24.620
mind lonely good on on these devices and
actually scaled down reasonably well and

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:24.630
actually scaled down reasonably well and
 

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:26.480
actually scaled down reasonably well and
it's you know I so I think it comes down

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:26.490
it's you know I so I think it comes down
 

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:28.130
it's you know I so I think it comes down
to art design and style there definitely

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:28.140
to art design and style there definitely
 

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.350
to art design and style there definitely
are you know outline pixel art really

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:30.360
are you know outline pixel art really
 

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:31.910
are you know outline pixel art really
doesn't scale very well you know if you

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:31.920
doesn't scale very well you know if you
 

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.140
doesn't scale very well you know if you
if you're trying to have lots and lots

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:33.150
if you're trying to have lots and lots
 

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:35.060
if you're trying to have lots and lots
of really delicate line details those

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:35.070
of really delicate line details those
 

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:37.130
of really delicate line details those
are going to get lost a lot of time you

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:37.140
are going to get lost a lot of time you
 

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:39.290
are going to get lost a lot of time you
do that but it well and you know who

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:39.300
do that but it well and you know who
 

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:42.640
do that but it well and you know who
does actually very careful line drawing

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:42.650
does actually very careful line drawing
 

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:46.250
does actually very careful line drawing
Rovio mhm and so they actually put a lot

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:46.260
Rovio mhm and so they actually put a lot
 

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.020
Rovio mhm and so they actually put a lot
of effort into making sure that at every

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:48.030
of effort into making sure that at every
 

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:50.210
of effort into making sure that at every
single resolution the black outline

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:50.220
single resolution the black outline
 

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:51.890
single resolution the black outline
about around the birds is exactly one

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:51.900
about around the birds is exactly one
 

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:53.840
about around the birds is exactly one
pixel wide yeah and they're they're very

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:53.850
pixel wide yeah and they're they're very
 

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:55.100
pixel wide yeah and they're they're very
very good about that and you know it and

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:55.110
very good about that and you know it and
 

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:56.450
very good about that and you know it and
so I think I think it's certainly

00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:56.460
so I think I think it's certainly
 

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.310
so I think I think it's certainly
possible it more it's more of an art

00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320
possible it more it's more of an art
 

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.320
possible it more it's more of an art
design question I think than a technical

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:00.330
design question I think than a technical
 

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:01.670
design question I think than a technical
question when it comes to when it comes

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:01.680
question when it comes to when it comes
 

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.860
question when it comes to when it comes
to that I think a lot of people will do

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:03.870
to that I think a lot of people will do
 

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:05.210
to that I think a lot of people will do
something in pixel art thinking that

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:05.220
something in pixel art thinking that
 

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:07.070
something in pixel art thinking that
that's actually gonna be easier and it's

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:07.080
that's actually gonna be easier and it's
 

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.140
that's actually gonna be easier and it's
not doing pixel art well and making it

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:09.150
not doing pixel art well and making it
 

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:11.000
not doing pixel art well and making it
look great on a modern device and also

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:11.010
look great on a modern device and also
 

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:13.370
look great on a modern device and also
appealing to modern users is actually

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:13.380
appealing to modern users is actually
 

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:15.080
appealing to modern users is actually
really tough because you want it to be

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:15.090
really tough because you want it to be
 

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:16.790
really tough because you want it to be
old school but you don't actually want

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:16.800
old school but you don't actually want
 

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:20.799
old school but you don't actually want
it to be old school you want it to be

00:26:20.799 --> 00:26:20.809
it to be old school you want it to be
 

00:26:20.809 --> 00:26:25.250
it to be old school you want it to be
evocative rather than representative of

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:25.260
evocative rather than representative of
 

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:27.560
evocative rather than representative of
your limitations absolutely but yeah I

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:27.570
your limitations absolutely but yeah I
 

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:29.299
your limitations absolutely but yeah I
mean we certainly love pixel art we've

00:26:29.299 --> 00:26:29.309
mean we certainly love pixel art we've
 

00:26:29.309 --> 00:26:31.610
mean we certainly love pixel art we've
we've given you no major thumbs up to a

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:31.620
we've given you no major thumbs up to a
 

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:33.860
we've given you no major thumbs up to a
lot of pixel art titles in terms of in

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:33.870
lot of pixel art titles in terms of in
 

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:35.330
lot of pixel art titles in terms of in
terms of you know what we did the

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:35.340
terms of you know what we did the
 

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:37.100
terms of you know what we did the
presentation and I think the real key

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:37.110
presentation and I think the real key
 

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:39.169
presentation and I think the real key
thing is just again like anything else

00:26:39.169 --> 00:26:39.179
thing is just again like anything else
 

00:26:39.179 --> 00:26:41.240
thing is just again like anything else
it all depends on the quality of your

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:41.250
it all depends on the quality of your
 

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:43.009
it all depends on the quality of your
artist more as much as much as anything

00:26:43.009 --> 00:26:43.019
artist more as much as much as anything
 

00:26:43.019 --> 00:26:46.220
artist more as much as much as anything

have to ask I was so is that HP c2000

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:50.370
have to ask I was so is that HP c2000

guy on them on the live chat I haven't

00:26:54.139 --> 00:26:54.149
guy on them on the live chat I haven't
 

00:26:54.149 --> 00:26:56.149
guy on them on the live chat I haven't
seen any questions from him yet okay

00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159
seen any questions from him yet okay
 

00:26:56.159 --> 00:26:57.590
seen any questions from him yet okay
yeah he was going to ask a question

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600
yeah he was going to ask a question
 

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:00.169
yeah he was going to ask a question
about OpenGL i told him i'd answer it

00:27:00.169 --> 00:27:00.179
about OpenGL i told him i'd answer it
 

00:27:00.179 --> 00:27:01.940
about OpenGL i told him i'd answer it
but i'm not gonna answer it if he's not

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:01.950
but i'm not gonna answer it if he's not
 

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:04.850

good let's go ahead and move on to our

00:27:08.029 --> 00:27:08.039
good let's go ahead and move on to our
 

00:27:08.039 --> 00:27:11.060
good let's go ahead and move on to our
next game alright so our next game isn't

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:11.070
next game alright so our next game isn't
 

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:13.970
next game alright so our next game isn't
really a driving game it would be is

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:13.980
really a driving game it would be is
 

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.409

are it is GTA they've done a great job
of bringing it to android it controls

00:27:37.549 --> 00:27:37.559
of bringing it to android it controls
 

00:27:37.559 --> 00:27:39.289
of bringing it to android it controls
very very well i actually really like

00:27:39.289 --> 00:27:39.299
very very well i actually really like
 

00:27:39.299 --> 00:27:40.610
very very well i actually really like
the fact that the default set of

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:40.620
the fact that the default set of
 

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:42.620
the fact that the default set of
controls is actually tapping the screen

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:42.630
controls is actually tapping the screen
 

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:44.960
controls is actually tapping the screen
and rather than accelerometer i think it

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:44.970
and rather than accelerometer i think it
 

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:46.639
and rather than accelerometer i think it
works really well for the kind of Arkady

00:27:46.639 --> 00:27:46.649
works really well for the kind of Arkady
 

00:27:46.649 --> 00:27:49.870
works really well for the kind of Arkady
style of driving that is in the game and

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:49.880
style of driving that is in the game and
 

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:52.279
style of driving that is in the game and
so you know since it is driving game

00:27:52.279 --> 00:27:52.289
so you know since it is driving game
 

00:27:52.289 --> 00:27:53.870
so you know since it is driving game
we're going to hit the car now there are

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:53.880
we're going to hit the car now there are
 

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.330
we're going to hit the car now there are
a lot of on-screen buttons in this game

00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:56.340
a lot of on-screen buttons in this game
 

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:57.980
a lot of on-screen buttons in this game
and I would say a lot of that is because

00:27:57.980 --> 00:27:57.990
and I would say a lot of that is because
 

00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:59.720
and I would say a lot of that is because
it was you know wasn't really designed

00:27:59.720 --> 00:27:59.730
it was you know wasn't really designed
 

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:02.000
it was you know wasn't really designed
for this kind of system I think if you

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:02.010
for this kind of system I think if you
 

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:03.860
for this kind of system I think if you
were designing it today you would not

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:03.870
were designing it today you would not
 

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:06.139
were designing it today you would not
have nearly as many button actions as

00:28:06.139 --> 00:28:06.149
have nearly as many button actions as
 

00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:08.090
have nearly as many button actions as
this game has this is definitely more of

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:08.100
this game has this is definitely more of
 

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:10.669
this game has this is definitely more of
a port than a remix you know I think

00:28:10.669 --> 00:28:10.679
a port than a remix you know I think
 

00:28:10.679 --> 00:28:14.570
a port than a remix you know I think

more native version designed for touch
 

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:38.190
more native version designed for touch
controls I think that you could go take

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:38.200
controls I think that you could go take
 

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.290
controls I think that you could go take
it really really far but but they've

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:40.300

of wacky with that so if you if we go to

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:07.690
of wacky with that so if you if we go to
 

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:08.850
of wacky with that so if you if we go to
the home screen you'll see that it

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:08.860
the home screen you'll see that it
 

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:10.140
the home screen you'll see that it
actually lets you know whether it's

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:10.150
actually lets you know whether it's
 

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:12.180
actually lets you know whether it's
still running and allows you to get back

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:12.190
still running and allows you to get back
 

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:14.070
still running and allows you to get back
to the to the game right away I don't

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.080
to the to the game right away I don't
 

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.480
to the to the game right away I don't
know how how exactly i feel about this

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:15.490
know how how exactly i feel about this
 

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:16.710
know how how exactly i feel about this
because things do run in the background

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:16.720
because things do run in the background
 

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:20.160
because things do run in the background
and that's like expectation i am so torn

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:20.170
and that's like expectation i am so torn
 

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:22.620
and that's like expectation i am so torn
about this because on the one hand it

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:22.630
about this because on the one hand it
 

00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:25.560
about this because on the one hand it
violates a lot of the philosophy that we

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:25.570
violates a lot of the philosophy that we
 

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:28.250
violates a lot of the philosophy that we
have around android on the other hand

00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:28.260
have around android on the other hand
 

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:31.500
have around android on the other hand
it's done for such a good reason because

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:31.510
it's done for such a good reason because
 

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:33.420
it's done for such a good reason because
basically everything that we've done

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:33.430
basically everything that we've done
 

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:35.730
basically everything that we've done
around android is for a completely

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:35.740
around android is for a completely
 

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:38.730
around android is for a completely
different use case yes and the use case

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:38.740
different use case yes and the use case
 

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:41.940
different use case yes and the use case
of having something that is really

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:41.950
of having something that is really
 

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:43.340
of having something that is really
really big and

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:43.350
really big and
 

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:45.080
really big and
really really expensive to initialize

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:45.090
really really expensive to initialize
 

00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:47.480
really really expensive to initialize
but also something that you might want

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:47.490
but also something that you might want
 

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:49.159
but also something that you might want
to interrupt every now and then to let's

00:30:49.159 --> 00:30:49.169
to interrupt every now and then to let's
 

00:30:49.169 --> 00:30:52.010
to interrupt every now and then to let's
say get a phone call hmm is it stuff so

00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:52.020
say get a phone call hmm is it stuff so
 

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:53.539
say get a phone call hmm is it stuff so
they've they've done something

00:30:53.539 --> 00:30:53.549
they've they've done something
 

00:30:53.549 --> 00:30:54.950
they've they've done something
interesting they basically say okay you

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:54.960
interesting they basically say okay you
 

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:55.970
interesting they basically say okay you
know what we're gonna run all the time

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:55.980
know what we're gonna run all the time
 

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:59.960
know what we're gonna run all the time
but I instead of just doing that which

00:30:59.960 --> 00:30:59.970
but I instead of just doing that which
 

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:01.700
but I instead of just doing that which
is horrible yeah they put up a

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:01.710
is horrible yeah they put up a
 

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:03.409
is horrible yeah they put up a
persistent notification that says

00:31:03.409 --> 00:31:03.419
persistent notification that says
 

00:31:03.419 --> 00:31:06.260
persistent notification that says
essentially for our process is still in

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:06.270
essentially for our process is still in
 

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:08.840
essentially for our process is still in
memory yeah GTA 3 is sitting here taking

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:08.850
memory yeah GTA 3 is sitting here taking
 

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:10.549
memory yeah GTA 3 is sitting here taking
up resources and draining your battery

00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559
up resources and draining your battery
 

00:31:10.559 --> 00:31:12.590
up resources and draining your battery
so that you can go back with fast it is

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:12.600
so that you can go back with fast it is
 

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.600
so that you can go back with fast it is
it is it to stop that yeah it is

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:14.610
it is it to stop that yeah it is
 

00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:16.010
it is it to stop that yeah it is
actually not draining your battery but

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:16.020
actually not draining your battery but
 

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:17.539
actually not draining your battery but
it is to it is still resident in memory

00:31:17.539 --> 00:31:17.549
it is to it is still resident in memory
 

00:31:17.549 --> 00:31:19.490
it is to it is still resident in memory
so it doesn't actually keep the game

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:19.500
so it doesn't actually keep the game
 

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:21.320
so it doesn't actually keep the game
right the threads are our threads are

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:21.330
right the threads are our threads are
 

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:24.100
right the threads are our threads are
stopped but it will it will end up

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:24.110
stopped but it will it will end up
 

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:26.720
stopped but it will it will end up
making things harder for you uh you know

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:26.730
making things harder for you uh you know
 

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:28.700
making things harder for you uh you know
there will be more swapping out yeah I

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:28.710
there will be more swapping out yeah I
 

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:30.140
there will be more swapping out yeah I
mean I mean ultimate ultimate Lee

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:30.150
mean I mean ultimate ultimate Lee
 

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:31.399
mean I mean ultimate ultimate Lee
Android will that will kill the process

00:31:31.399 --> 00:31:31.409
Android will that will kill the process
 

00:31:31.409 --> 00:31:32.990
Android will that will kill the process
if you try to run too much stuff I mean

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:33.000
if you try to run too much stuff I mean
 

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.220
if you try to run too much stuff I mean
we should actually just try that let's

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:34.230
we should actually just try that let's
 

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:35.930
we should actually just try that let's
let's try to launch real racing and see

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:35.940
let's try to launch real racing and see
 

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:40.070
let's try to launch real racing and see
what happens yeah now I'm a you know

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080
what happens yeah now I'm a you know
 

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.840
what happens yeah now I'm a you know
testing fate here you know we're

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:41.850
testing fate here you know we're
 

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:43.460
testing fate here you know we're
obviously running to enormous enormous

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:43.470
obviously running to enormous enormous
 

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:45.080
obviously running to enormous enormous
titles what should happen is we should

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:45.090
titles what should happen is we should
 

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:46.760
titles what should happen is we should
actually see GTA get kicked out of

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:46.770
actually see GTA get kicked out of
 

00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:49.430
actually see GTA get kicked out of
memory always going to do these things

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:49.440
memory always going to do these things
 

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:54.470
memory always going to do these things
live exactly but my point is that you're

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480
live exactly but my point is that you're
 

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.049
live exactly but my point is that you're
right that it's not consuming CPU but it

00:31:57.049 --> 00:31:57.059
right that it's not consuming CPU but it
 

00:31:57.059 --> 00:31:58.520
right that it's not consuming CPU but it
is going to consume the battery because

00:31:58.520 --> 00:31:58.530
is going to consume the battery because
 

00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:00.409
is going to consume the battery because
what's going to happen is that smaller

00:32:00.409 --> 00:32:00.419
what's going to happen is that smaller
 

00:32:00.419 --> 00:32:02.840
what's going to happen is that smaller
apps are gonna cycle in and out faster

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:02.850
apps are gonna cycle in and out faster
 

00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:05.390
apps are gonna cycle in and out faster
yes yeah I you know and everything is

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:05.400
yes yeah I you know and everything is
 

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:06.860
yes yeah I you know and everything is
what once it gets kicked out it should

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:06.870
what once it gets kicked out it should
 

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:08.330
what once it gets kicked out it should
just be kicked out that's you know

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:08.340
just be kicked out that's you know
 

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:09.680
just be kicked out that's you know
that's it doesn't get kicked back in

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:09.690
that's it doesn't get kicked back in
 

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:10.880
that's it doesn't get kicked back in
unless they're actually running a

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:10.890
unless they're actually running a
 

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:12.680
unless they're actually running a
service and hopefully though an are

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:12.690
service and hopefully though an are
 

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:13.820
service and hopefully though an are
renewing this and they've got a

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:13.830
renewing this and they've got a
 

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:15.289
renewing this and they've got a
persistent notifications with it's it's

00:32:15.289 --> 00:32:15.299
persistent notifications with it's it's
 

00:32:15.299 --> 00:32:17.360
persistent notifications with it's it's
really hard to tell yeah i actually have

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:17.370
really hard to tell yeah i actually have
 

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:19.100
really hard to tell yeah i actually have
enough to go out of here and then go

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:19.110
enough to go out of here and then go
 

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:21.380
enough to go out of here and then go
back into GTA and yeah well you see the

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:21.390
back into GTA and yeah well you see the
 

00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:23.029
back into GTA and yeah well you see the
notification is still there so well

00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039
notification is still there so well
 

00:32:23.039 --> 00:32:24.830
notification is still there so well
that's true but that doesn't really mean

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:24.840
that's true but that doesn't really mean
 

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:26.120
that's true but that doesn't really mean
anything cuz all that me as their

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:26.130
anything cuz all that me as their
 

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:27.590
anything cuz all that me as their
service is still alive it doesn't

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600
service is still alive it doesn't
 

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:29.090
service is still alive it doesn't
necessarily mean their main process yeah

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:29.100
necessarily mean their main process yeah
 

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:30.200
necessarily mean their main process yeah
that's looks like let's take a look at

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:30.210
that's looks like let's take a look at
 

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:33.020
that's looks like let's take a look at
what happens you boom where we are so we

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:33.030
what happens you boom where we are so we
 

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:35.000
what happens you boom where we are so we
all you know we add that this test I was

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:35.010
all you know we add that this test I was
 

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:38.570
all you know we add that this test I was
a lot of RAM if it's so and and you know

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:38.580
a lot of RAM if it's so and and you know
 

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:40.789
a lot of RAM if it's so and and you know
so anyway so you know again you it is

00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799
so anyway so you know again you it is
 

00:32:40.799 --> 00:32:42.799
so anyway so you know again you it is
possible to switch to swap between two

00:32:42.799 --> 00:32:42.809
possible to switch to swap between two
 

00:32:42.809 --> 00:32:44.690
possible to switch to swap between two
rather large games I don't think I want

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:44.700
rather large games I don't think I want
 

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:46.310
rather large games I don't think I want
to push push it and actually swap

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320
to push push it and actually swap
 

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.860
to push push it and actually swap
between more than that but there we are

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:48.870
between more than that but there we are
 

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:51.680
between more than that but there we are
with with real racing as well so awesome

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:51.690
with with real racing as well so awesome
 

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:54.620
with with real racing as well so awesome
nice multitasking going on there a

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:54.630
nice multitasking going on there a
 

00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:56.690
nice multitasking going on there a
couple of couple of quick points

00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:56.700
couple of couple of quick points
 

00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:58.460
couple of couple of quick points
from YouTube crispy Corps wants to know

00:32:58.460 --> 00:32:58.470
from YouTube crispy Corps wants to know
 

00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:59.840
from YouTube crispy Corps wants to know
if you can try and see if the two

00:32:59.840 --> 00:32:59.850
if you can try and see if the two
 

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:01.970
if you can try and see if the two
controls work while driving yes that

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:01.980
controls work while driving yes that
 

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:03.110
controls work while driving yes that
just a couple of minutes ago so I'm

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120
just a couple of minutes ago so I'm
 

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.640
just a couple of minutes ago so I'm
guessing that's for GTA there tilt

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:04.650
guessing that's for GTA there tilt
 

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:06.650
guessing that's for GTA there tilt
controls for GTA games there seems to be

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:06.660
controls for GTA games there seems to be
 

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:08.480
controls for GTA games there seems to be
a lot of problems with that I think so I

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:08.490
a lot of problems with that I think so I
 

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:10.100
a lot of problems with that I think so I
think that then there may be an issue

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:10.110
think that then there may be an issue
 

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:13.730
think that then there may be an issue
and as I recall the this is one of those

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:13.740
and as I recall the this is one of those
 

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:17.240
and as I recall the this is one of those
games that actually has I think

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:17.250
games that actually has I think
 

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:19.520
games that actually has I think
accelerometer issues let's take a look

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:19.530
accelerometer issues let's take a look
 

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:23.030
accelerometer issues let's take a look
so let's turn accelerometer on and let's

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:23.040
so let's turn accelerometer on and let's
 

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:25.910
so let's turn accelerometer on and let's
use tick analog data looks during you

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:25.920
use tick analog data looks during you
 

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:27.950
use tick analog data looks during you
yeah I use analog steering for that on

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:27.960
yeah I use analog steering for that on
 

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:31.220
yeah I use analog steering for that on
okay okay and let's take a look as I

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:31.230
okay okay and let's take a look as I
 

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:34.520
okay okay and let's take a look as I
recall this this may have been one of

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:34.530
recall this this may have been one of
 

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:37.850
recall this this may have been one of
those games that that actually does not

00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:37.860
those games that that actually does not
 

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:39.830
those games that that actually does not
correctly look at the default

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840
correctly look at the default
 

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:41.480
correctly look at the default
orientation when interpreting the

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:41.490
orientation when interpreting the
 

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:44.240
orientation when interpreting the
accelerometer but I think as I recall

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:44.250
accelerometer but I think as I recall
 

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:45.710
accelerometer but I think as I recall
and it's been it's been a while I think

00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:45.720
and it's been it's been a while I think
 

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.780
and it's been it's been a while I think
they do it correctly for tablets and

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:47.790
they do it correctly for tablets and
 

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:49.970
they do it correctly for tablets and
they may not do it correctly for they

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:49.980
they may not do it correctly for they
 

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:51.260
they may not do it correctly for they
may actually be sensing the type of

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:51.270
may actually be sensing the type of
 

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:53.990
may actually be sensing the type of
device instead of so what will happen is

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000
device instead of so what will happen is
 

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000
device instead of so what will happen is
the orientation is always done with

00:33:59.000 --> 00:33:59.010
the orientation is always done with
 

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:02.630
the orientation is always done with
respect to a default orientation of the

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:02.640
respect to a default orientation of the
 

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:05.930
respect to a default orientation of the
device you know in other words which we

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:05.940
device you know in other words which we
 

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:08.300
device you know in other words which we
can orientation the home screen expects

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:08.310
can orientation the home screen expects
 

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:12.110
can orientation the home screen expects
to display in and that's not always what

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:12.120
to display in and that's not always what
 

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:15.500
to display in and that's not always what
the game expects ironically this isn't

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:15.510
the game expects ironically this isn't
 

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:17.690
the game expects ironically this isn't
very difficult to deal with where people

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:17.700
very difficult to deal with where people
 

00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:19.490
very difficult to deal with where people
get into trouble is when they try to

00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:19.500
get into trouble is when they try to
 

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:22.310
get into trouble is when they try to
figure out what a default orientation is

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320
figure out what a default orientation is
 

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:25.400
figure out what a default orientation is
hmm I and then figure out what the

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:25.410
hmm I and then figure out what the
 

00:34:25.410 --> 00:34:27.110
hmm I and then figure out what the
accelerometer is telling them rather

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:27.120
accelerometer is telling them rather
 

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.420
accelerometer is telling them rather
than just believing the quaternion that

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:29.430
than just believing the quaternion that
 

00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:30.860
than just believing the quaternion that
they can get from the accelerometer yeah

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:30.870
they can get from the accelerometer yeah
 

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:32.720
they can get from the accelerometer yeah
the quaternion is is is actually always

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:32.730
the quaternion is is is actually always
 

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:34.400
the quaternion is is is actually always
going to be correct and that's that

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:34.410
going to be correct and that's that
 

00:34:34.410 --> 00:34:36.500
going to be correct and that's that
that's that's really the key here but

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:36.510
that's that's really the key here but
 

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:37.820
that's that's really the key here but
anyways you know the tilt is working

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:37.830
anyways you know the tilt is working
 

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:39.050
anyways you know the tilt is working
fine here we should try it on a phone

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:39.060
fine here we should try it on a phone
 

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:40.460
fine here we should try it on a phone
device and see whether it's also

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:40.470
device and see whether it's also
 

00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:42.080
device and see whether it's also
handling that correctly this is I

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:42.090
handling that correctly this is I
 

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:43.610
handling that correctly this is I
shouldn't say phone what I should say is

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:43.620
shouldn't say phone what I should say is
 

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:45.950
shouldn't say phone what I should say is
a portrait default device now the

00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:45.960
a portrait default device now the
 

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.210
a portrait default device now the
question is are the real question is

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:47.220
question is are the real question is
 

00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:50.360
question is are the real question is
what happens on nexus 7 here and so we

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:50.370
what happens on nexus 7 here and so we
 

00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:52.640
what happens on nexus 7 here and so we
can we can tweak it we can i think i

00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:52.650
can we can tweak it we can i think i
 

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:54.860
can we can tweak it we can i think i
have it on this guy well give that up

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:54.870
have it on this guy well give that up
 

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:57.620
have it on this guy well give that up
and see if there's another question well

00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:57.630
and see if there's another question well
 

00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:00.620
and see if there's another question well

that's an interesting question mmm I'll

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:36.560
that's an interesting question mmm I'll
 

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.860
that's an interesting question mmm I'll
tell the truth it's it's something that

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:38.870
tell the truth it's it's something that
 

00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:41.560
tell the truth it's it's something that
I think we have mixed feelings about and

Android there are some issues a lot of

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:07.730
Android there are some issues a lot of
 

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:09.400
Android there are some issues a lot of
people think that since android is linux

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:09.410
people think that since android is linux
 

00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:11.950
people think that since android is linux
it should be very easy to port any piece

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:11.960
it should be very easy to port any piece
 

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:13.660
it should be very easy to port any piece
of linux software and that's not

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:13.670
of linux software and that's not
 

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:17.740
of linux software and that's not
entirely true because android like all

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:17.750
entirely true because android like all
 

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:19.840
entirely true because android like all
other linux systems is built out of a

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:19.850
other linux systems is built out of a
 

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:21.490
other linux systems is built out of a
lot of different components and there's

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:21.500
lot of different components and there's
 

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:22.780
lot of different components and there's
some things you can pick and choose in

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:22.790
some things you can pick and choose in
 

00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:24.430

called bionic that a lot of other people
don't use and all of this adds up to

don't use and all of this adds up to
 

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.580
don't use and all of this adds up to
more hassle now normally for a Linux

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:15.080
on in the android open source project
 

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:16.840

right now what we do instead is we

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:16.850
right now what we do instead is we
 

00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:18.610
right now what we do instead is we
release something called the NDK the

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:18.620
release something called the NDK the
 

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:21.070
release something called the NDK the
native development kit and that is

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:21.080
native development kit and that is
 

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:23.230
native development kit and that is
there's a lot of things in the NDK but

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:23.240
there's a lot of things in the NDK but
 

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:24.610
there's a lot of things in the NDK but
the real core of it the irreplaceable

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:24.620
the real core of it the irreplaceable
 

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:27.090
the real core of it the irreplaceable
piece of it is a set of headers that

00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:27.100
piece of it is a set of headers that
 

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:30.820
piece of it is a set of headers that
form a contract that Google has decided

binary interface and the key thing about

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:37.190
binary interface and the key thing about
 

00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:39.910
binary interface and the key thing about
that is it for your opengl calls those

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920
that is it for your opengl calls those
 

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.500
that is it for your opengl calls those
opengl calls will be essentially

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:41.510
opengl calls will be essentially
 

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:43.210
opengl calls will be essentially
identical because opengl is a standard

good example of that is that PVR GPUs do

00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:41.630
good example of that is that PVR GPUs do
 

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:43.450
good example of that is that PVR GPUs do
geometry sorting and they so they're

00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:43.460
geometry sorting and they so they're
 

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:46.240
geometry sorting and they so they're
almost completely incentive insensitive

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:46.250
almost completely incentive insensitive
 

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:49.600
almost completely incentive insensitive
to the way you submit geometry but they

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:49.610
to the way you submit geometry but they
 

00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:51.460
to the way you submit geometry but they
are very sensitive to how many state

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:51.470
are very sensitive to how many state
 

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:53.590
are very sensitive to how many state
transitions you do yes whereas Tegra

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:53.600
transitions you do yes whereas Tegra
 

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.690

GPUs are almost exactly the opposite

00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:55.700
GPUs are almost exactly the opposite
 

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:58.000
GPUs are almost exactly the opposite
that change state very fast but you want

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:58.010
that change state very fast but you want
 

00:38:58.010 --> 00:39:00.520
that change state very fast but you want
to always sort front to back exactly and

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:00.530
to always sort front to back exactly and
 

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:01.870
to always sort front to back exactly and
so to the real the real keeping and

so to the real the real keeping and
 

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:03.490
so to the real the real keeping and
that's certainly adds only one you know

00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:03.500
that's certainly adds only one you know
 

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:05.260
that's certainly adds only one you know
one issue there's there's also things

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:05.270
one issue there's there's also things
 

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:06.970
one issue there's there's also things
like if you want to use texture

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:06.980
like if you want to use texture
 

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:09.160

to use on Android done there's also you

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:15.710
to use on Android done there's also you
 

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:17.200
to use on Android done there's also you
know there are there are also issues in

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:17.210
know there are there are also issues in
 

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:19.540
know there are there are also issues in
terms of how you should write your your

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:19.550
terms of how you should write your your
 

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:22.090
terms of how you should write your your
shaders and you know making sure that

00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:22.100
shaders and you know making sure that
 

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:24.430
shaders and you know making sure that
you're really querying very carefully

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:24.440
you're really querying very carefully
 

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:27.100
you're really querying very carefully
also making sure that you do test those

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:27.110
also making sure that you do test those
 

00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:29.200
also making sure that you do test those
shaders on a variety of GPUs because you

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:29.210
shaders on a variety of GPUs because you
 

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:30.970
shaders on a variety of GPUs because you
will see different performance cliffs

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:30.980
will see different performance cliffs
 

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:32.650
will see different performance cliffs
from device to device that being said

00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:32.660
from device to device that being said
 

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:34.450
from device to device that being said
from a coding perspective you're

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:34.460
from a coding perspective you're
 

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:36.070
from a coding perspective you're
code is going to just is going to go

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:36.080
code is going to just is going to go
 

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:37.300
code is going to just is going to go
over the well you really have to look at

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:37.310
over the well you really have to look at
 

00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:39.670
over the well you really have to look at
is audio because the audio standards are

00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:39.680
is audio because the audio standards are
 

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:40.870
is audio because the audio standards are
very very different you're going to look

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:40.880
very very different you're going to look
 

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:43.660
very very different you're going to look
at touch and events which are very very

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:43.670
at touch and events which are very very
 

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:45.010
at touch and events which are very very
different networking actually if you're

00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:45.020
different networking actually if you're
 

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:47.290
different networking actually if you're
not using SSL you can just use sockets

00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:47.300
not using SSL you can just use sockets
 

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:49.150
not using SSL you can just use sockets
and secure socket code will come over

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:49.160
and secure socket code will come over
 

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:51.849
and secure socket code will come over
pretty much straight to be honest so

00:39:51.849 --> 00:39:51.859
pretty much straight to be honest so
 

00:39:51.859 --> 00:39:54.160
pretty much straight to be honest so
there's a lot you do get a lot even

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:54.170
there's a lot you do get a lot even
 

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:56.859
there's a lot you do get a lot even
actually you can actually use even

00:39:56.859 --> 00:39:56.869
actually you can actually use even
 

00:39:56.869 --> 00:39:58.420
actually you can actually use even
threading you can if you're using

00:39:58.420 --> 00:39:58.430
threading you can if you're using
 

00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:01.329
threading you can if you're using
standard pthreads you know as long as

00:40:01.329 --> 00:40:01.339
standard pthreads you know as long as
 

00:40:01.339 --> 00:40:03.130
standard pthreads you know as long as
you're not relying on making calls back

00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:03.140
you're not relying on making calls back
 

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:04.780
you're not relying on making calls back
into the dalvik virtual machine you can

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:04.790
into the dalvik virtual machine you can
 

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:06.640
into the dalvik virtual machine you can
actually use those very easily or you

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:06.650
actually use those very easily or you
 

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:08.560
actually use those very easily or you
can easily tell you can actually tie

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:08.570
can easily tell you can actually tie
 

00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:10.240
can easily tell you can actually tie
those back into dalvik threads and

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:10.250
those back into dalvik threads and
 

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:13.030
those back into dalvik threads and
there's actually a really nice library

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.040
there's actually a really nice library
 

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:14.880
there's actually a really nice library
than nvidia has provided for doing that

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:14.890
than nvidia has provided for doing that
 

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:17.530
than nvidia has provided for doing that
so there really are a lot of things you

00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:17.540
so there really are a lot of things you
 

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:19.660
so there really are a lot of things you
can do and really one of the main

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:19.670
can do and really one of the main
 

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:21.609
can do and really one of the main
reasons we do the NDK is to allow people

00:40:21.609 --> 00:40:21.619
reasons we do the NDK is to allow people
 

00:40:21.619 --> 00:40:25.410
reasons we do the NDK is to allow people
to take advantage of tested code

00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:25.420
to take advantage of tested code
 

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:27.250
to take advantage of tested code
sections that you you know code

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:27.260
sections that you you know code
 

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:30.010
sections that you you know code
libraries that you have written for

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:30.020
libraries that you have written for
 

00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:31.570
libraries that you have written for
another platform so from that

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:31.580
another platform so from that
 

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:33.550
another platform so from that
perspective that plus the standard api's

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:33.560
perspective that plus the standard api's
 

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:35.020
perspective that plus the standard api's
do provide a really nice basis

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:35.030
do provide a really nice basis
 

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:36.880

to take advantage of a lot of the
 

00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:42.280
to take advantage of a lot of the
Android Android standard UI patterns you

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:42.290
Android Android standard UI patterns you
 

00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:43.359
Android Android standard UI patterns you
know and those are you know there's a

00:40:43.359 --> 00:40:43.369
know and those are you know there's a
 

00:40:43.369 --> 00:40:44.589
know and those are you know there's a
lot of useful stuff in there even if it

00:40:44.589 --> 00:40:44.599
lot of useful stuff in there even if it
 

00:40:44.599 --> 00:40:46.030
lot of useful stuff in there even if it
comes to things like font rendering on

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:46.040

Java interfaces in Android are very very

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:00.770
Java interfaces in Android are very very
 

00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:02.440
Java interfaces in Android are very very
easy to use compared to c and c++

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:02.450

writing a lot less code a good example

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:08.630
writing a lot less code a good example
 

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:10.510
writing a lot less code a good example
of this is when you're doing your

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:10.520
of this is when you're doing your
 

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:14.079

system which of course is built-in to
 

00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:23.560
system which of course is built-in to
dalvik and into the Java framework so

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:23.570
dalvik and into the Java framework so
 

00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:25.030

you can actually save yourself a lot of

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040
you can actually save yourself a lot of
 

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.849
you can actually save yourself a lot of
time especially when you're dealing with

00:41:27.849 --> 00:41:27.859
time especially when you're dealing with
 

00:41:27.859 --> 00:41:30.160
time especially when you're dealing with
platform specific things but even even

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:30.170
platform specific things but even even
 

00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:32.650
platform specific things but even even
when you're not by going to dalvik or

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:32.660
when you're not by going to dalvik or
 

00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:34.540
when you're not by going to dalvik or
another virtual machine absolutely yeah

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:34.550
another virtual machine absolutely yeah
 

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:35.680
another virtual machine absolutely yeah
and there's plenty of places even in a

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:35.690
and there's plenty of places even in a
 

00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:37.089
and there's plenty of places even in a
game where it makes a lot of sense to

00:41:37.089 --> 00:41:37.099
game where it makes a lot of sense to
 

00:41:37.099 --> 00:41:39.010
game where it makes a lot of sense to
take advantage of android framework it

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:39.020
take advantage of android framework it
 

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:41.170
take advantage of android framework it
resources things like notifications for

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:41.180

built in SSL implementation all that
kind of stuff so there is a bunch of

00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440
kind of stuff so there is a bunch of
 

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:52.780
kind of stuff so there is a bunch of
stuff that it does make sense to

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:52.790
stuff that it does make sense to
 

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:56.740
stuff that it does make sense to
actually move code over to the dalvik

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:56.750
actually move code over to the dalvik
 

00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:59.410

virtual machine but that being said it's

00:41:59.410 --> 00:41:59.420
virtual machine but that being said it's
 

00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:00.970

00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:46.670
profitable games which I think makes us
 

00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:49.150
profitable games which I think makes us
look a lot like tools of the game

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:49.160
look a lot like tools of the game
 

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:51.520

actually a puzzle game and your goal is
 

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:43.900
actually a puzzle game and your goal is
to move things into the tractor you've

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:43.910
to move things into the tractor you've
 

00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:46.090

got a dual joystick control and then we
 

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:47.620
got a dual joystick control and then we
can we can actually take this stuff and

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:47.630
can we can actually take this stuff and
 

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:49.840
can we can actually take this stuff and
and move it into the into this dumpster

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:49.850
and move it into the into this dumpster
 

00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:53.320
and move it into the into this dumpster
here and it's actually pretty cool it is

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:53.330
here and it's actually pretty cool it is
 

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:56.560
here and it's actually pretty cool it is
not a racing game they didn't say race

00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:56.570
not a racing game they didn't say race
 

00:43:56.570 --> 00:43:58.710
not a racing game they didn't say race
again we said driving game it is sort it

00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:58.720
again we said driving game it is sort it
 

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:00.890
again we said driving game it is sort it
sort of are you driving a tractor

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:00.900
sort of are you driving a tractor
 

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:02.990
sort of are you driving a tractor
yes I think you're driving a tractor so

00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:03.000
yes I think you're driving a tractor so
 

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.020
yes I think you're driving a tractor so
I'm now for some reason I ganas snapping

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:06.030
I'm now for some reason I ganas snapping
 

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:08.630
I'm now for some reason I ganas snapping
fingers I because the reason why I don't

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640
fingers I because the reason why I don't
 

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:09.920
fingers I because the reason why I don't
have a dist Ablett plugged in so let's

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:09.930
have a dist Ablett plugged in so let's
 

00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:11.540
have a dist Ablett plugged in so let's
let's actually show you what i was doing

00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:11.550
let's actually show you what i was doing
 

00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:12.770
let's actually show you what i was doing
rather than have me just looking down

00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:12.780
rather than have me just looking down
 

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:14.930
rather than have me just looking down
that's why we we look at the monitor

00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:14.940
that's why we we look at the monitor
 

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:16.970
that's why we we look at the monitor
yeah exactly yeah that's what we have

00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:16.980
yeah exactly yeah that's what we have
 

00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:18.680
yeah exactly yeah that's what we have
yeah that's a good point so anyways oh

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:18.690
yeah that's a good point so anyways oh
 

00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:20.680
yeah that's a good point so anyways oh
it's backwards though that's really hard

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:20.690
it's backwards though that's really hard
 

00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:23.360
it's backwards though that's really hard
never mind he just glanced at it yeah

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:23.370
never mind he just glanced at it yeah
 

00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:27.530
never mind he just glanced at it yeah
exactly yeah so say we can actually take

00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:27.540
exactly yeah so say we can actually take
 

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:29.420
exactly yeah so say we can actually take
advantage of physics here to scoop up

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:29.430
advantage of physics here to scoop up
 

00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:32.330
advantage of physics here to scoop up
the rock into our little tractor and

00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:32.340
the rock into our little tractor and
 

00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:33.860
the rock into our little tractor and
then we can actually flip it all the way

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:33.870
then we can actually flip it all the way
 

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:35.870
then we can actually flip it all the way
around to the other side in order to

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:35.880
around to the other side in order to
 

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:37.250
around to the other side in order to
dump it back into the dumpster but it is

00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:37.260
dump it back into the dumpster but it is
 

00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:39.200
dump it back into the dumpster but it is
a puzzle game and it's cool you're

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:39.210
a puzzle game and it's cool you're
 

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:40.880
a puzzle game and it's cool you're
driving a tractor and it's something I

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:40.890
driving a tractor and it's something I
 

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:42.080
driving a tractor and it's something I
haven't seen before it is an Anand

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:42.090
haven't seen before it is an Anand
 

00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:43.670
haven't seen before it is an Anand
engine game which is always nice to see

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680
engine game which is always nice to see
 

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.860
engine game which is always nice to see
if you haven't actually used engine to

00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:45.870
if you haven't actually used engine to
 

00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:48.260
if you haven't actually used engine to
end engine before it is a really nice 2d

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:48.270
end engine before it is a really nice 2d
 

00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:50.630
end engine before it is a really nice 2d

nice I and and they're doing a lot of

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:02.190
nice I and and they're doing a lot of
 

00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:03.620
nice I and and they're doing a lot of
investment in it which is which is

the truck just just so I did a good job

00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:09.180
the truck just just so I did a good job
 

00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:10.640
the truck just just so I did a good job
of it there was you did you did know

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:10.650
of it there was you did you did know
 

00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:12.020
of it there was you did you did know
you're at the controls I you know the

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:12.030
you're at the controls I you know the
 

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:13.310
you're at the controls I you know the
controls work well you know there's

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:13.320
controls work well you know there's
 

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:14.960
controls work well you know there's
definitely some parts of this game where

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:14.970
definitely some parts of this game where
 

00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:17.420
definitely some parts of this game where
I want to see higher resolution artwork

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:17.430
I want to see higher resolution artwork
 

00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:19.850
I want to see higher resolution artwork
you know cut some some some more work

00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:19.860
you know cut some some some more work
 

00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:22.700
you know cut some some some more work
done on some of the textures to the so

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:22.710
done on some of the textures to the so
 

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:23.960
done on some of the textures to the so
that it looks less this sort of

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:23.970
that it looks less this sort of
 

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:25.250
that it looks less this sort of
repeating pattern that you're seeing

00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:25.260
repeating pattern that you're seeing
 

00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:26.630
repeating pattern that you're seeing
there at the bottom it just it just

00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640
there at the bottom it just it just
 

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:29.090
there at the bottom it just it just
screams I'm tiling something right we're

00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:29.100
screams I'm tiling something right we're
 

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:31.250
screams I'm tiling something right we're
going to do that by the way is to create

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:31.260
going to do that by the way is to create
 

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:33.230
going to do that by the way is to create
three or four random textures and just

00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:33.240
three or four random textures and just
 

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:35.480
three or four random textures and just
randomize them for a texture like this

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:35.490
randomize them for a texture like this
 

00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:37.310
randomize them for a texture like this
you can use there's actually some

00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:37.320
you can use there's actually some
 

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:39.620
you can use there's actually some
photoshop plugins to do this yeah you

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:39.630
photoshop plugins to do this yeah you
 

00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:42.170
photoshop plugins to do this yeah you
get something that has like four or five

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:42.180
get something that has like four or five
 

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:45.650
get something that has like four or five
different textures but they all tile

00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:45.660
different textures but they all tile
 

00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:48.530
different textures but they all tile
seamlessly along the edges and and then

00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:48.540
seamlessly along the edges and and then
 

00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:49.730
seamlessly along the edges and and then
you just pick them at random and yeah

00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:49.740
you just pick them at random and yeah
 

00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:50.840
you just pick them at random and yeah
actually looks really yeah it really

00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:50.850
actually looks really yeah it really
 

00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:52.250
actually looks really yeah it really
does and that same thing I would say

00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:52.260
does and that same thing I would say
 

00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:53.570
does and that same thing I would say
with the grass texture it's just like

00:45:53.570 --> 00:45:53.580
with the grass texture it's just like
 

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:56.120
with the grass texture it's just like
tile tile tile tile tile it would I

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:56.130
tile tile tile tile tile it would I
 

00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:58.100
tile tile tile tile tile it would I
would love to see a little bit of work

00:45:58.100 --> 00:45:58.110
would love to see a little bit of work
 

00:45:58.110 --> 00:45:58.880
would love to see a little bit of work
because there's so much work that

00:45:58.880 --> 00:45:58.890
because there's so much work that
 

00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:00.830
because there's so much work that
actually went into the vehicles in this

00:46:00.830 --> 00:46:00.840
actually went into the vehicles in this
 

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:02.930
actually went into the vehicles in this
game yeah they're cool and you know what

00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:02.940
game yeah they're cool and you know what
 

00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:04.280
game yeah they're cool and you know what
I dig the background too even though

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:04.290
I dig the background too even though
 

00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:06.650
I dig the background too even though
it's dead photo it's like out of focus

00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:06.660
it's dead photo it's like out of focus
 

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:08.810
it's dead photo it's like out of focus
yes depth of field effect to it good job

00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:08.820
yes depth of field effect to it good job
 

00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:10.730
yes depth of field effect to it good job
there yeah adequately let's move on

00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:10.740
there yeah adequately let's move on
 

00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:13.160
there yeah adequately let's move on
let's move on again not not not not not

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:13.170
let's move on again not not not not not
 

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:14.599
let's move on again not not not not not
a racing game another

00:46:14.599 --> 00:46:14.609
a racing game another
 

00:46:14.609 --> 00:46:15.920
a racing game another
one that's that's in the category of

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:15.930
one that's that's in the category of
 

00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:18.950
one that's that's in the category of
somewhat someone small someone smaller

games is a drag racing from Nitro nation

00:46:21.319 --> 00:46:21.329
games is a drag racing from Nitro nation
 

00:46:21.329 --> 00:46:25.249
games is a drag racing from Nitro nation
and it's good this game was was it is

00:46:25.249 --> 00:46:25.259
and it's good this game was was it is
 

00:46:25.259 --> 00:46:27.109
and it's good this game was was it is
kind of fun but it really just seemed to

00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119
kind of fun but it really just seemed to
 

00:46:27.119 --> 00:46:34.069
kind of fun but it really just seemed to
be an exercise in in trying to end up

00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079
be an exercise in in trying to end up
 

00:46:34.079 --> 00:46:36.229
be an exercise in in trying to end up
getting me to buy stuff which was a

00:46:36.229 --> 00:46:36.239
getting me to buy stuff which was a
 

00:46:36.239 --> 00:46:39.019
getting me to buy stuff which was a
little unfortunate you know it's like

00:46:39.019 --> 00:46:39.029
little unfortunate you know it's like
 

00:46:39.029 --> 00:46:41.210
little unfortunate you know it's like
what I found was that pretty much no

00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:41.220
what I found was that pretty much no
 

00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:43.130
what I found was that pretty much no
matter how well I did in the game if I

00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:43.140
matter how well I did in the game if I
 

00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:45.229
matter how well I did in the game if I
did not have a car that was that was

00:46:45.229 --> 00:46:45.239
did not have a car that was that was
 

00:46:45.239 --> 00:46:46.970
did not have a car that was that was
that was good enough and this was not an

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:46.980
that was good enough and this was not an
 

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:49.249
that was good enough and this was not an
example of that I was just going to lose

00:46:49.249 --> 00:46:49.259
example of that I was just going to lose
 

00:46:49.259 --> 00:46:51.049
example of that I was just going to lose
and mostly because just kind of minimal

00:46:51.049 --> 00:46:51.059
and mostly because just kind of minimal
 

00:46:51.059 --> 00:46:54.410
and mostly because just kind of minimal
controls here and I actually played this

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:54.420
controls here and I actually played this
 

00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:56.329
controls here and I actually played this
game not particularly well I should

00:46:56.329 --> 00:46:56.339
game not particularly well I should
 

00:46:56.339 --> 00:46:59.059
game not particularly well I should
actually be I was gonna say shifting you

00:46:59.059 --> 00:46:59.069
actually be I was gonna say shifting you
 

00:46:59.069 --> 00:47:00.710
actually be I was gonna say shifting you
see you get a good shift if you shift

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720
see you get a good shift if you shift
 

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:02.569
see you get a good shift if you shift
like a moron you're not going to get

back thing ya know maybe it's because

00:50:53.610 --> 00:50:53.620
back thing ya know maybe it's because
 

00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:54.990
back thing ya know maybe it's because
you need to think of it more as a

00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:55.000
you need to think of it more as a
 

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.550
you need to think of it more as a
dismissing rather than a movie yeah

00:50:56.550 --> 00:50:56.560
dismissing rather than a movie yeah
 

00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:59.220
dismissing rather than a movie yeah
continue continue actually does not when

turned out that actually was a different
 

00:51:35.170 --> 00:51:36.870
turned out that actually was a different
game with a really really similar name

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:36.880

just that uh one is that I'm not using

00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:49.150
just that uh one is that I'm not using
 

00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:52.920
just that uh one is that I'm not using
the standard android keyboard oh yeah so

00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:52.930
the standard android keyboard oh yeah so
 

00:51:52.930 --> 00:51:54.300
the standard android keyboard oh yeah so
you know so like the question is I'm

00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:54.310
you know so like the question is I'm
 

00:51:54.310 --> 00:51:56.550
you know so like the question is I'm
going to stick this in the dock now um

00:51:56.550 --> 00:51:56.560
going to stick this in the dock now um
 

00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:58.350
going to stick this in the dock now um
and the keyboard doesn't work number 2

00:51:58.350 --> 00:51:58.360
and the keyboard doesn't work number 2
 

00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:00.420
and the keyboard doesn't work number 2
count you in go to switch the camera

00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:00.430
count you in go to switch the camera
 

00:52:00.430 --> 00:52:03.180
count you in go to switch the camera
turn to camera two breathe breathe no

turn to camera two breathe breathe no
 

00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:05.820
turn to camera two breathe breathe no
that's no I right there right okay now

00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:05.830
that's no I right there right okay now
 

00:52:05.830 --> 00:52:07.710
that's no I right there right okay now
look look at what poor Dan is trying to

00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:07.720
look look at what poor Dan is trying to
 

00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:11.310
look look at what poor Dan is trying to
do here yeah ice I just quit the game

00:52:11.310 --> 00:52:11.320
do here yeah ice I just quit the game
 

00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:13.530

but I was trying to type my name and I

00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:13.540
but I was trying to type my name and I
 

00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:15.120
but I was trying to type my name and I
can't type on the keyboard he's just

00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:15.130
can't type on the keyboard he's just
 

00:52:15.130 --> 00:52:16.380
can't type on the keyboard he's just
amazingly frustrated with this whole

00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:16.390
amazingly frustrated with this whole
 

00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:18.630
amazingly frustrated with this whole
thing because because we're not using

00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:18.640
thing because because we're not using
 

00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:19.860
thing because because we're not using
one of the default input methods of

00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:19.870
one of the default input methods of
 

00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:21.390
one of the default input methods of
Android so I can't actually type my name

00:52:21.390 --> 00:52:21.400
Android so I can't actually type my name
 

00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:23.100
Android so I can't actually type my name
using the keyboard that's in front of me

00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:23.110
using the keyboard that's in front of me
 

00:52:23.110 --> 00:52:26.220
using the keyboard that's in front of me
so this is also so don't use your own

00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:26.230
so this is also so don't use your own
 

00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:27.720
so this is also so don't use your own
input method as a general rule even

00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:27.730
input method as a general rule even
 

00:52:27.730 --> 00:52:28.860
input method as a general rule even
though it looks really cool and you can

00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:28.870
though it looks really cool and you can
 

00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:31.620
though it looks really cool and you can
put Comic Sans on there which also i say

00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:31.630
put Comic Sans on there which also i say
 

00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:32.820
put Comic Sans on there which also i say
never use Comic Sans but that's a

00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:32.830
never use Comic Sans but that's a
 

00:52:32.830 --> 00:52:34.890
never use Comic Sans but that's a
different question yeah you just get the

00:52:34.890 --> 00:52:34.900
different question yeah you just get the
 

00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:41.610
different question yeah you just get the
vision so that's one thing this game is

00:52:41.610 --> 00:52:41.620
vision so that's one thing this game is
 

00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:42.600
vision so that's one thing this game is
this game is fun I want I definitely

00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:42.610
this game is fun I want I definitely
 

00:52:42.610 --> 00:52:44.850
this game is fun I want I definitely
want to see some higher resolution

00:52:44.850 --> 00:52:44.860
want to see some higher resolution
 

00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:46.470
want to see some higher resolution
graphics everything here is really

00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480
graphics everything here is really
 

00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:48.270
graphics everything here is really
really blurry yeah this what this game

00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:48.280
really blurry yeah this what this game
 

00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:49.800
really blurry yeah this what this game
wasn't really built for a tablet now

00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:49.810
wasn't really built for a tablet now
 

00:52:49.810 --> 00:52:50.690
wasn't really built for a tablet now
also the models

00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:50.700
also the models
 

00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:53.839
also the models
are really low res so you get the you

00:52:53.839 --> 00:52:53.849
are really low res so you get the you
 

00:52:53.849 --> 00:52:55.010
are really low res so you get the you
get the feeling that maybe this was

00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:55.020
get the feeling that maybe this was
 

00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:58.339
get the feeling that maybe this was
tuned for a much less capable device and

00:52:58.339 --> 00:52:58.349
tuned for a much less capable device and
 

00:52:58.349 --> 00:53:00.680
tuned for a much less capable device and
that's fine um but what you might want

00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:00.690
that's fine um but what you might want
 

00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:02.960
that's fine um but what you might want
to do and this is just a general game

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:02.970
to do and this is just a general game
 

00:53:02.970 --> 00:53:08.450
to do and this is just a general game
design idea um in general it's not very

00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:08.460
design idea um in general it's not very
 

00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:11.630
design idea um in general it's not very
difficult to make a model that's very

00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:11.640
difficult to make a model that's very
 

00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:14.060
difficult to make a model that's very
high polygon count and the hard part is

00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:14.070
high polygon count and the hard part is
 

00:53:14.070 --> 00:53:15.740
high polygon count and the hard part is
reducing it to a low Paul Young count

00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:15.750
reducing it to a low Paul Young count
 

00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:18.190
reducing it to a low Paul Young count
yeah so if you keep your sources and

00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:18.200
yeah so if you keep your sources and
 

00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:20.930
yeah so if you keep your sources and
just you know every now and then when

00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:20.940
just you know every now and then when
 

00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:25.220
just you know every now and then when
the state of Technology gets there put

00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:25.230
the state of Technology gets there put
 

00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:27.020
the state of Technology gets there put
some better models in your game actually

00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:27.030
some better models in your game actually
 

00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:28.430
some better models in your game actually
you know to be honest for me I actually

00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:28.440
you know to be honest for me I actually
 

00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:30.260
you know to be honest for me I actually
know the models i think the car models

00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:30.270
know the models i think the car models
 

00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:31.370
know the models i think the car models
are really good it's the rest of

00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:31.380
are really good it's the rest of
 

00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:33.829
are really good it's the rest of
everything else that that that that i

00:53:33.829 --> 00:53:33.839
everything else that that that that i
 

00:53:33.839 --> 00:53:35.180
everything else that that that that i
want to see you know the car models are

00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:35.190
want to see you know the car models are
 

00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:36.800
want to see you know the car models are
attractive of my point is they're low

00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:36.810
attractive of my point is they're low
 

00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:38.359
attractive of my point is they're low
pollock yeah and their end they all day

00:53:38.359 --> 00:53:38.369
pollock yeah and their end they all day
 

00:53:38.369 --> 00:53:39.650
pollock yeah and their end they all day
and they don't they don't really look

00:53:39.650 --> 00:53:39.660
and they don't they don't really look
 

00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:41.089
and they don't they don't really look
like anything else in the game you know

00:53:41.089 --> 00:53:41.099
like anything else in the game you know
 

00:53:41.099 --> 00:53:42.829
like anything else in the game you know
and i think it's cute there's some of

00:53:42.829 --> 00:53:42.839
and i think it's cute there's some of
 

00:53:42.839 --> 00:53:44.990
and i think it's cute there's some of
the design element but i would love to

00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:45.000
the design element but i would love to
 

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.510
the design element but i would love to
see you know some some even if the

00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520
see you know some some even if the
 

00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:48.440
see you know some some even if the
backgrounds are going to look like that

00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:48.450
backgrounds are going to look like that
 

00:53:48.450 --> 00:53:49.940
backgrounds are going to look like that
it'd be kind of cool if they were a

00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:49.950
it'd be kind of cool if they were a
 

00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:52.310
it'd be kind of cool if they were a
little bit soft focus that girl thing

00:53:52.310 --> 00:53:52.320
little bit soft focus that girl thing
 

00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:54.589
little bit soft focus that girl thing
now let's just move to camera two really

00:53:54.589 --> 00:53:54.599
now let's just move to camera two really
 

00:53:54.599 --> 00:53:58.450
now let's just move to camera two really
quick um you'll notice that my

00:53:58.450 --> 00:53:58.460
quick um you'll notice that my
 

00:53:58.460 --> 00:54:02.000
quick um you'll notice that my
excessively large hands you still have

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:02.010
excessively large hands you still have
 

00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:04.940
excessively large hands you still have
to kind of reach it get the yeah sorry

00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:04.950
to kind of reach it get the yeah sorry
 

00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:07.430
to kind of reach it get the yeah sorry
we're we're losing hd9 here and right I

00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440
we're we're losing hd9 here and right I
 

00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:10.910
we're we're losing hd9 here and right I
button there I mean there it really is a

00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:10.920
button there I mean there it really is a
 

00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:13.910
button there I mean there it really is a
stretch um yeah this is not this is an

00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:13.920
stretch um yeah this is not this is an
 

00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:15.290
stretch um yeah this is not this is an
example of buttons that are not scaled

00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:15.300
example of buttons that are not scaled
 

00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:17.420
example of buttons that are not scaled
based upon the pixel density of the

00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:17.430
based upon the pixel density of the
 

00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:18.710
based upon the pixel density of the
screen you know they're they're looking

00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720
screen you know they're they're looking
 

00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:19.970
screen you know they're they're looking
at there there there's they're stretched

00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:19.980
at there there there's they're stretched
 

00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:22.220
at there there there's they're stretched
based upon the screen size and it's a

00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:22.230
based upon the screen size and it's a
 

00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:23.300
based upon the screen size and it's a
kind of thing so we have two options

00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:23.310
kind of thing so we have two options
 

00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:25.010
kind of thing so we have two options
here one is we can look at pixel density

00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:25.020
here one is we can look at pixel density
 

00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:27.290
here one is we can look at pixel density
that thought that helps a little bit the

00:54:27.290 --> 00:54:27.300
that thought that helps a little bit the
 

00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:28.280
that thought that helps a little bit the
other thing is we can actually have a

00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:28.290
other thing is we can actually have a
 

00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:30.050
other thing is we can actually have a
temper a separate tablet layout that

00:54:30.050 --> 00:54:30.060
temper a separate tablet layout that
 

00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:32.980
temper a separate tablet layout that
would help even more yeah remember that

00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:32.990
would help even more yeah remember that
 

00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:35.569
would help even more yeah remember that
android has some really nice features

00:54:35.569 --> 00:54:35.579
android has some really nice features
 

00:54:35.579 --> 00:54:38.300
android has some really nice features
for putting together layouts for

00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:38.310
for putting together layouts for
 

00:54:38.310 --> 00:54:40.640
for putting together layouts for
different screens and a lot of game

00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:40.650
different screens and a lot of game
 

00:54:40.650 --> 00:54:42.020
different screens and a lot of game
developers say well that's that doesn't

00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:42.030
developers say well that's that doesn't
 

00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:43.490
developers say well that's that doesn't
affect me at all because i'm not making

00:54:43.490 --> 00:54:43.500
affect me at all because i'm not making
 

00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:46.700
affect me at all because i'm not making
views and i'm not using exactly but you

00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:46.710
views and i'm not using exactly but you
 

00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:49.400
views and i'm not using exactly but you
know what you don't have to use that for

00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:49.410
know what you don't have to use that for
 

00:54:49.410 --> 00:54:52.339
know what you don't have to use that for
just views or dialogue designs or UI

00:54:52.339 --> 00:54:52.349
just views or dialogue designs or UI
 

00:54:52.349 --> 00:54:55.460
just views or dialogue designs or UI
designs what you can do is put constant

00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:55.470
designs what you can do is put constant
 

00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:58.809
designs what you can do is put constant
values in there and then pull those out

00:54:58.809 --> 00:54:58.819
values in there and then pull those out
 

00:54:58.819 --> 00:55:01.490
values in there and then pull those out
based on the resource ID and you'll get

00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:01.500
based on the resource ID and you'll get
 

00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:03.950
based on the resource ID and you'll get
the different values based on

00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:03.960
the different values based on
 

00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:06.710
the different values based on
which screen size you're on or you know

00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720
which screen size you're on or you know
 

00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:08.300
which screen size you're on or you know
whatever you filtered on absolutely and

00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:08.310
whatever you filtered on absolutely and
 

00:55:08.310 --> 00:55:09.770
whatever you filtered on absolutely and
again you can you can you can do a

00:55:09.770 --> 00:55:09.780
again you can you can you can do a
 

00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:10.790
again you can you can you can do a
couple things one is you can actually

00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:10.800
couple things one is you can actually
 

00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:13.010
couple things one is you can actually
get the pixel density and you can just

00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:13.020
get the pixel density and you can just
 

00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:14.480
get the pixel density and you can just
imply that to what you're doing in

00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:14.490
imply that to what you're doing in
 

00:55:14.490 --> 00:55:16.640
imply that to what you're doing in
OpenGL so that you're actually getting

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:16.650
OpenGL so that you're actually getting
 

00:55:16.650 --> 00:55:18.620
OpenGL so that you're actually getting
something that's the correct physical

00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:18.630
something that's the correct physical
 

00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:19.820
something that's the correct physical
size which is really important because

00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:19.830
size which is really important because
 

00:55:19.830 --> 00:55:21.620
size which is really important because
what you want to make sure it's also if

00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:21.630
what you want to make sure it's also if
 

00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:24.589
what you want to make sure it's also if
if if this screen you know we're very

00:55:24.589 --> 00:55:24.599
if if this screen you know we're very
 

00:55:24.599 --> 00:55:26.120
if if this screen you know we're very
very small you'd still want those things

00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:26.130
very small you'd still want those things
 

00:55:26.130 --> 00:55:28.400
very small you'd still want those things
to be very very large and in any of this

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:28.410
to be very very large and in any of this
 

00:55:28.410 --> 00:55:29.690
to be very very large and in any of this
thing looks like it's just stretching

00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:29.700
thing looks like it's just stretching
 

00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:31.579
thing looks like it's just stretching
based on the size of the screen so

00:55:31.579 --> 00:55:31.589
based on the size of the screen so
 

00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:33.260
based on the size of the screen so
that's definitely one thing making it

00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:33.270
that's definitely one thing making it
 

00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:37.280
that's definitely one thing making it
automatic is really important to so yeah

00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:37.290
automatic is really important to so yeah
 

00:55:37.290 --> 00:55:38.990
automatic is really important to so yeah
one thing you can do actually in OpenGL

00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:39.000
one thing you can do actually in OpenGL
 

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:42.740
one thing you can do actually in OpenGL
that's like really super cool is define

00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:42.750
that's like really super cool is define
 

00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:46.670
that's like really super cool is define
your UI in in meters we sounds stupid

00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:46.680
your UI in in meters we sounds stupid
 

00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:48.890
your UI in in meters we sounds stupid
but trust me don't ever do like I've

00:55:48.890 --> 00:55:48.900
but trust me don't ever do like I've
 

00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:51.140
but trust me don't ever do like I've
been on projects where people like oh

00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:51.150
been on projects where people like oh
 

00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:53.650
been on projects where people like oh
maybe we want a little bit more you know

00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:53.660
maybe we want a little bit more you know
 

00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:55.460
maybe we want a little bit more you know
precision or whatever let's use

00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:55.470
precision or whatever let's use
 

00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:57.470
precision or whatever let's use
decimeters or something exactly and it

00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:57.480
decimeters or something exactly and it
 

00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:58.790
decimeters or something exactly and it
just screws up your physics system does

00:55:58.790 --> 00:55:58.800
just screws up your physics system does
 

00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:00.230
just screws up your physics system does
every though but define your UI in

00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240
every though but define your UI in
 

00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:03.849
every though but define your UI in
meters and then just have a matrix that

00:56:03.849 --> 00:56:03.859
meters and then just have a matrix that
 

00:56:03.859 --> 00:56:09.349
meters and then just have a matrix that
scales from meters to screen units and

00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:09.359
scales from meters to screen units and
 

00:56:09.359 --> 00:56:10.880
scales from meters to screen units and
you'll definitely detest this on a wide

00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:10.890
you'll definitely detest this on a wide
 

00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:13.010
you'll definitely detest this on a wide
variety of physical screen sizes but

00:56:13.010 --> 00:56:13.020
variety of physical screen sizes but
 

00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:15.290
variety of physical screen sizes but
it's it's much much easier than actually

00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:15.300
it's it's much much easier than actually
 

00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:18.020
it's it's much much easier than actually
trying to come up with you know lots and

00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:18.030
trying to come up with you know lots and
 

00:56:18.030 --> 00:56:19.490
trying to come up with you know lots and
lots of individual layouts to handle

00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:19.500
lots of individual layouts to handle
 

00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:21.079
lots of individual layouts to handle
every single set of that's every said

00:56:21.079 --> 00:56:21.089
every single set of that's every said
 

00:56:21.089 --> 00:56:22.700
every single set of that's every said
everything about combination and I'm not

00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:22.710
everything about combination and I'm not
 

00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:24.260
everything about combination and I'm not
going to lie to you this isn't easy

00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:24.270
going to lie to you this isn't easy
 

00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:26.359
going to lie to you this isn't easy
there is no simple thing yeah that you

00:56:26.359 --> 00:56:26.369
there is no simple thing yeah that you
 

00:56:26.369 --> 00:56:28.220
there is no simple thing yeah that you
can do especially if you're dealing with

00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:28.230
can do especially if you're dealing with
 

00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:31.849
can do especially if you're dealing with
different aspect ratios but it will be

00:56:31.849 --> 00:56:31.859
different aspect ratios but it will be
 

00:56:31.859 --> 00:56:33.500
different aspect ratios but it will be
worth it yeah I mean you know the key

00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:33.510
worth it yeah I mean you know the key
 

00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:35.390
worth it yeah I mean you know the key
thing you know you know if you're trying

00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:35.400
thing you know you know if you're trying
 

00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:37.220
thing you know you know if you're trying
to make the HUD look super attractive

00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:37.230
to make the HUD look super attractive
 

00:56:37.230 --> 00:56:38.810
to make the HUD look super attractive
and perfect it's definitely a bunch of

00:56:38.810 --> 00:56:38.820
and perfect it's definitely a bunch of
 

00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:40.430
and perfect it's definitely a bunch of
work oh yeah you know what your artists

00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:40.440
work oh yeah you know what your artists
 

00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:42.140
work oh yeah you know what your artists
you can do I'll show you exactly what

00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:42.150
you can do I'll show you exactly what
 

00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:43.700
you can do I'll show you exactly what
they're gonna say maybe like we have to

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:43.710
they're gonna say maybe like we have to
 

00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:45.589
they're gonna say maybe like we have to
be pixel perfect yeah otherwise it's no

00:56:45.589 --> 00:56:45.599
be pixel perfect yeah otherwise it's no
 

00:56:45.599 --> 00:56:50.900
be pixel perfect yeah otherwise it's no
good um and that actually uh is I said I

00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:50.910
good um and that actually uh is I said I
 

00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:52.460
good um and that actually uh is I said I
would never swear on this show it is not

00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:52.470
would never swear on this show it is not
 

00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:56.450
would never swear on this show it is not
true very good as well I know I I heard

00:56:56.450 --> 00:56:56.460
true very good as well I know I I heard
 

00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:57.829
true very good as well I know I I heard
coming and I heard like you know there's

00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839
coming and I heard like you know there's
 

00:56:57.839 --> 00:57:00.560
coming and I heard like you know there's
there there is there yeah exactly let me

00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:00.570
there there is there yeah exactly let me
 

00:57:00.570 --> 00:57:02.089
there there is there yeah exactly let me
tell you why it's not true so that was

00:57:02.089 --> 00:57:02.099
tell you why it's not true so that was
 

00:57:02.099 --> 00:57:04.940
tell you why it's not true so that was
extremely true back when we were working

00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:04.950
extremely true back when we were working
 

00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:10.550
extremely true back when we were working
with ntsc TVs or 480p or even you know a

00:57:10.550 --> 00:57:10.560
with ntsc TVs or 480p or even you know a
 

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:12.829
with ntsc TVs or 480p or even you know a
really high resolution on a big screen

00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:12.839
really high resolution on a big screen
 

00:57:12.839 --> 00:57:14.329
really high resolution on a big screen
but today everything is by letting your

00:57:14.329 --> 00:57:14.339
but today everything is by letting your
 

00:57:14.339 --> 00:57:16.250
but today everything is by letting your
filtered at least well not only that

00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:16.260
filtered at least well not only that
 

00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:16.890
filtered at least well not only that
yeah

00:57:16.890 --> 00:57:16.900
yeah
 

00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:19.800
yeah
so we're talking about these really

00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:19.810
so we're talking about these really
 

00:57:19.810 --> 00:57:21.990
so we're talking about these really
really dense displays now okay fine if

00:57:21.990 --> 00:57:22.000
really dense displays now okay fine if
 

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.700
really dense displays now okay fine if
you're supporting some random old thing

00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:23.710
you're supporting some random old thing
 

00:57:23.710 --> 00:57:27.900
you're supporting some random old thing
that has a very low density display yeah

00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:27.910
that has a very low density display yeah
 

00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:29.010
that has a very low density display yeah
you might want to think about both

00:57:29.010 --> 00:57:29.020
you might want to think about both
 

00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:30.930
you might want to think about both
really here's here's an example let's

00:57:30.930 --> 00:57:30.940
really here's here's an example let's
 

00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:33.090
really here's here's an example let's
take a look at Nexus 7 Nexus 7 can't

00:57:33.090 --> 00:57:33.100
take a look at Nexus 7 Nexus 7 can't
 

00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:35.850
take a look at Nexus 7 Nexus 7 can't
tell at Nexus 7 all the icons you see

00:57:35.850 --> 00:57:35.860
tell at Nexus 7 all the icons you see
 

00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:37.920
tell at Nexus 7 all the icons you see
here for every single app are actually

00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:37.930
here for every single app are actually
 

00:57:37.930 --> 00:57:39.990
here for every single app are actually
being scaled down we did not actually

00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000
being scaled down we did not actually
 

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.940
being scaled down we did not actually
come up with new icons for every single

00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:41.950
come up with new icons for every single
 

00:57:41.950 --> 00:57:43.770
come up with new icons for every single
app at this pixel density right you know

00:57:43.770 --> 00:57:43.780
app at this pixel density right you know
 

00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:46.650
app at this pixel density right you know
this is a 213 DPI and we scaled from

00:57:46.650 --> 00:57:46.660
this is a 213 DPI and we scaled from
 

00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:48.900
this is a 213 DPI and we scaled from
what 250 years or 220 yeah at some end

00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:48.910
what 250 years or 220 yeah at some end
 

00:57:48.910 --> 00:57:52.920
what 250 years or 220 yeah at some end
to 245 or tea yeah and and so we're

00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:52.930
to 245 or tea yeah and and so we're
 

00:57:52.930 --> 00:57:54.360
to 245 or tea yeah and and so we're
scaling down a purse are a small

00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:54.370
scaling down a purse are a small
 

00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:56.100
scaling down a purse are a small
fraction honestly on this high of a

00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:56.110
fraction honestly on this high of a
 

00:57:56.110 --> 00:57:57.540
fraction honestly on this high of a
density pixel density to display you

00:57:57.540 --> 00:57:57.550
density pixel density to display you
 

00:57:57.550 --> 00:57:59.250
density pixel density to display you
don't even notice it most of the time

00:57:59.250 --> 00:57:59.260
don't even notice it most of the time
 

00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:01.380
don't even notice it most of the time
you can't actually go and create icons

00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:01.390
you can't actually go and create icons
 

00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:04.740
you can't actually go and create icons
at at 213 DPI you want to but we looked

00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:04.750
at at 213 DPI you want to but we looked
 

00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:06.480
at at 213 DPI you want to but we looked
at it we said it's just not worth it and

00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:06.490
at it we said it's just not worth it and
 

00:58:06.490 --> 00:58:08.040
at it we said it's just not worth it and
so I think that I think that says a lot

00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:08.050
so I think that I think that says a lot
 

00:58:08.050 --> 00:58:10.230
so I think that I think that says a lot
about scaling down if you're you know

00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:10.240
about scaling down if you're you know
 

00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:12.390
about scaling down if you're you know
even even and again icons are the worst

00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:12.400
even even and again icons are the worst
 

00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:14.520
even even and again icons are the worst
thing you can scale typically because

00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:14.530
thing you can scale typically because
 

00:58:14.530 --> 00:58:17.210
thing you can scale typically because
they're really really information dense

00:58:17.210 --> 00:58:17.220
they're really really information dense
 

00:58:17.220 --> 00:58:19.890
they're really really information dense
except for text but even I got a lot of

00:58:19.890 --> 00:58:19.900
except for text but even I got a lot of
 

00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:21.750
except for text but even I got a lot of
icons contain text and a lot of icons

00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:21.760
icons contain text and a lot of icons
 

00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:23.940
icons contain text and a lot of icons
contain line art and details that needy

00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:23.950
contain line art and details that needy
 

00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:24.960
contain line art and details that needy
you would normally think oh this

00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:24.970
you would normally think oh this
 

00:58:24.970 --> 00:58:27.750
you would normally think oh this
shouldn't scale don't reality yeah the

00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:27.760
shouldn't scale don't reality yeah the
 

00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:30.270
shouldn't scale don't reality yeah the
reality is that and actually take one

00:58:30.270 --> 00:58:30.280
reality is that and actually take one
 

00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:31.590
reality is that and actually take one
left less look at the tablet I want to

00:58:31.590 --> 00:58:31.600
left less look at the tablet I want to
 

00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:33.330
left less look at the tablet I want to
look with the icon today five minutes

00:58:33.330 --> 00:58:33.340
look with the icon today five minutes
 

00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:35.310
look with the icon today five minutes
overtime and producer rato is like

00:58:35.310 --> 00:58:35.320
overtime and producer rato is like
 

00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:38.730
overtime and producer rato is like
packing up his stuff ready to go so just

00:58:38.730 --> 00:58:38.740
packing up his stuff ready to go so just
 

00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:40.560
packing up his stuff ready to go so just
just one thing out of all these icons

00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:40.570
just one thing out of all these icons
 

00:58:40.570 --> 00:58:42.630
just one thing out of all these icons
there are two icons that actually I

00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:42.640
there are two icons that actually I
 

00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:44.520
there are two icons that actually I
think are reasonable Android icons that

00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:44.530
think are reasonable Android icons that
 

00:58:44.530 --> 00:58:46.170
think are reasonable Android icons that
is the tractor digger icon believe it or

00:58:46.170 --> 00:58:46.180
is the tractor digger icon believe it or
 

00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:48.210
is the tractor digger icon believe it or
not in the GTA icon yeah every single

00:58:48.210 --> 00:58:48.220
not in the GTA icon yeah every single
 

00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:49.560
not in the GTA icon yeah every single
one at all just like it's been maybe

00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:49.570
one at all just like it's been maybe
 

00:58:49.570 --> 00:58:51.510
one at all just like it's been maybe
lifted from somebody else's yeah yeah

00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:51.520
lifted from somebody else's yeah yeah
 

00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:53.640
lifted from somebody else's yeah yeah
come on guys it's let's let's let's

00:58:53.650 --> 00:58:55.650
come on guys it's let's let's let's
let's try to make things every one of

00:58:55.650 --> 00:58:55.660
let's try to make things every one of
 

00:58:55.660 --> 00:58:57.270
let's try to make things every one of
those looks the same it's hard to

00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:57.280
those looks the same it's hard to
 

00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:59.070
those looks the same it's hard to
actually differentiate the content of

00:58:59.070 --> 00:58:59.080
actually differentiate the content of
 

00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:00.540
actually differentiate the content of
all those other ones but tracker digger

00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:00.550
all those other ones but tracker digger
 

00:59:00.550 --> 00:59:01.890
all those other ones but tracker digger
and GT are really really easy to

00:59:01.890 --> 00:59:01.900
and GT are really really easy to
 

00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:03.660
and GT are really really easy to
differentiate it's going to say mmm

00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:03.670
differentiate it's going to say mmm
 

00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:06.750
differentiate it's going to say mmm
