LAURENCE MORONEY (VOICEOVER):
Welcome to the Googleplex.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.180
This is an incredible place
with lots of great stuff being

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.960
worked on every single day.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.950
Before I worked here,
I always wondered

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.250
what it would be like to
come to the Googleplex,

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.750
meet up with a Googler,
and have coffee with them.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.260
And just chat about what
they do, how they do it,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.410
and why they do it.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.350
And today we're going
to do exactly that.

00:00:23.342 --> 00:00:24.800
Welcome to "Coffee
with a Googler."

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.630
I'm Laurence Moroney and today
I'm here with Jennifer Lin.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.444
And Jennifer's from
our App Indexing team,

00:00:29.444 --> 00:00:31.110
and she's going to
tell us all about it.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.284
So, Jennifer, welcome.

00:00:32.284 --> 00:00:33.950
JENNIFER LIN: Thanks
for having me here.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:34.850
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Thanks for being here.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.300
So, App Indexing, what is it?

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.400
What do you do with it?

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.910
JENNIFER LIN: So App Indexing
is where we get Android and iOS

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.220
apps into the Google index.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.095
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:00:43.095 --> 00:00:45.510
JENNIFER LIN: So we can
crawl, index, and surf content

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.745
for Maps, much like what
we've done with websites.

00:00:47.745 --> 00:00:48.620
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.470
JENNIFER LIN:
Developers are gonna

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.470
love App Indexing,
because it gets them

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.200
organic installs and
traffic to their app

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.900
from Google search results,
search auto-completions,

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:57.980
and now on Tap.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:58.085
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:00:58.085 --> 00:00:59.960
So if I understand this
right, it's like now,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.320
if I open my phone, instead
of me searching on the web

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.830
and finding a
website and viewing

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.360
that website in the browser,
I can actually search.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.220
And if that content is
within an app that I have,

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.930
then I can go
straight into the app

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.790
and get maybe a richer
experience than I

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.194
would in a mobile browser.

00:01:15.194 --> 00:01:16.360
Is that what it's all about?

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.735
JENNIFER LIN:
Yeah, that's right.

00:01:17.735 --> 00:01:19.340
So with App Indexing,
Google search

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.460
can help users find information
from apps that they've already

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.420
installed-- apps that they may
not have known have answers

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.610
that they're looking for.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:28.830
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.090
JENNIFER LIN: I've got
some exciting stats

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.150
that I want to share with you.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.233
LAURENCE MORONEY: Tell me.

00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:34.380
JENNIFER LIN: We've indexed
50 billion deep links

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.040
from thousands of apps, and
25% of our Google searches

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.015
return deep link results
to signed in Android users.

00:01:42.015 --> 00:01:42.890
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.973
JENNIFER LIN: We also have
several success stories

00:01:44.973 --> 00:01:47.030
from apps published
on our developer site.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.030
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.090
JENNIFER LIN: For example,
"Daily Mail", a newspaper app--

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.280
LAURENCE MORONEY: The
British newspaper, yeah.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.150
JENNIFER LIN: Yup.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.440
They have seen 22% boost
in search impressions

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.780
for their app users.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.460
And those app users spent
20% more time per visit

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.570
in the app, reading
and sharing articles.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.550
So that's great!

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.135
So I want to show
you an example.

00:02:07.135 --> 00:02:08.093
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah.

00:02:08.093 --> 00:02:08.600
Yeah, cool.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.680
JENNIFER LIN: So let's say I
am checking out the Grand Hyatt

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.750
Hotel in San Francisco.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.100
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.740
JENNIFER LIN: And
so I search for it,

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.810
and I get a bunch
of results from apps

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.835
that I have installed,
like TripAdvisor--

00:02:19.835 --> 00:02:20.710
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.310
JENNIFER LIN: --Yelp,
booking.com, Expedia.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.530
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.940
JENNIFER LIN: If I click
on any of these titles,

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.060
it'll take me directly to
the Grand Hyatt San Francisco

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.250
page in the app.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.090
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So it's really nice

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.000
that I can find this
content by searching,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.970
but what if I
don't have the app?

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.178
JENNIFER LIN: So if you
don't have the app installed,

00:02:38.178 --> 00:02:39.820
then Google search
will also help

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.240
users discover
your apps once you

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.980
integrate with App Indexing.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.440
So another example is let's say
I search for patio umbrellas.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.960
I see results from
wayfair.com; I also

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.820
get results from overstock.com.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.460
Now I'll also see
an option to install

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.580
the Wayfair app or
the Overstock app

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.650
to go and view their
information on patio umbrellas.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.410
And when I install, I'm
taken to the Play Store page.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.520
And I accept the
app permissions,

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.130
and the install happens.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.290
And I can hit the Continue
button to go directly

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.020
to the patio umbrellas
page in the Overstock app

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.090
without having to go
back to the home screen.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.510
LAURENCE MORONEY: Got it.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.135
So it's not like
breaking the workflow.

00:03:23.135 --> 00:03:25.561
I'm able to install and then
go straight to that content

00:03:25.561 --> 00:03:26.060
right away.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.610
JENNIFER LIN: Right.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.151
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That's pretty neat.

00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:31.110
So, I can see where this now
makes it very interesting

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.290
for you to market your app.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.060
That the apps with
the best content

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.260
are the ones that people
are going to see, right?

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.670
JENNIFER LIN: Mm hmm.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.240
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
so if I can build an app

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.760
with great content,
then people will

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.615
be able to find my app
as well as my content.

00:03:42.615 --> 00:03:43.740
JENNIFER LIN: That's right.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.080
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And that's what

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.380
you were talking about earlier
as potentially a new marketing

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.970
channel.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:47.380
JENNIFER LIN: Yes.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.290
LAURENCE MORONEY: So, I think
developers are gonna love this,

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.831
you're right.

00:03:49.831 --> 00:03:51.370
But how do they get started?

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.869
JENNIFER LIN: So
there are two steps

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:54.300
to get started
with App Indexing.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.090
The first step is
they have to add

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.630
HTTP deep links to their app.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.360
And then the second
step is they just

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.620
publish those HTTP deep links,
so Google can discover them

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.440
and we can start crawling
their deep links.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.440
LAURENCE MORONEY: I see.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.460
JENNIFER LIN: And
so the simplest way

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.500
to publish their HTTP deep
links is to associate their app

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.350
and their website.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.320
And all they have to do is just
go to the Google Play Developer

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.303
Console, log in, type in
their website address.

00:04:19.303 --> 00:04:21.469
And then they can log into
the Google search console

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:23.654
and accept that website
verification request.

00:04:23.654 --> 00:04:24.570
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.736
JENNIFER LIN: And that's it.

00:04:25.736 --> 00:04:29.140
Just make sure you test that
your deep links are working,

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.470
they open correctly.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.120
And then you get to measure the
performance of your deep links

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.125
on Google search with our
Google Search Console.

00:04:35.125 --> 00:04:36.340
LAURENCE MORONEY: It's
as simple as that.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.590
JENNIFER LIN: Yup.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.970
That's it.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:37.290
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.340
JENNIFER LIN: And you
can go to our website,

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.975
which is g.co/appindexing,
to find all this information.

00:04:43.975 --> 00:04:45.610
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So g.co/appindexing.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:46.360
JENNIFER LIN: Yup.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.980
LAURENCE MORONEY: That's a
pretty easy one to remember.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.600
Is there an app for
that that's app indexed?

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.308
JENNIFER LIN: No.

00:04:50.308 --> 00:04:50.809
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:52.391
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So thanks, Jennifer.

00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:53.419
That was really awesome.

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.710
And thanks everybody, and
hope you enjoyed this episode

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:56.950
of "Coffee with a Googler."

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.300
We've got lots more great
information on App Indexing.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.399
There's a great dev byte
that you can watch here.

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:04.440
And we've linked other
stuff into the description

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.185
of this video.

00:05:05.185 --> 00:05:08.190
