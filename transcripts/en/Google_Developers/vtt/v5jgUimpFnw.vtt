00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.530
VIC FRYZEL: Welcome to Google
I/O, and thank you for coming

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:06.520
to this talk.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.200
Today, what I'm going to be
doing is introducing a new way

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.890
to administer your business on
Google, specifically with

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.840
Google Apps.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.920
So just a quick poll.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.570
How many people in the room are
familiar with Google Apps

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.900
and the Admin APIs?

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.940
Everyone.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.030
OK, you're in the right room.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.180
So the Admin APIs are a set of
APIs that allow you to manage

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.150
your Google Apps for Business
domain or other additions, and

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.900
do things like create users
and manage your domain's

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.110
resources while also making
it easier to perform some

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.170
automated tasks.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.650
So this is a collection
of more than 15 APIs.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.970
It includes things today like
the Provisioning API, or the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.930
Group Settings API, or the
Reports API, et cetera.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.030
So the problem with this is that
thousands of applications

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.520
use these APIs every
single day.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.830
There's a large number of these
APIs, but the developer

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.810
experience of the APIs
can be a little bit

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.160
difficult to navigate.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.580
So if you break this down,
actually, this translates into

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.040
more than 125 million
requests per day.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.710
That's more than a lot of small
companies get for their

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.810
entire app.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.620
So here, these requests coming
in are doing things to manage

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.130
Google Apps for Business
domains.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.450
What we're going to talk
about today is

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.830
making things even easier.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.410
And if there's one thing that
you leave the room with today,

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.850
it should be with an
understanding that you should

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.200
go home, sleep, after Google
I/O, and then come into work

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.800
the next day and adopt what
we're about to launch, because

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.690
we're going to make your lives
significantly easier.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.190
So this is directly
for IT admins.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.620
Or if you're an ISV who's
developing software for users

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.010
of Google Apps for Business, if
you're a reseller of Google

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.200
Apps for Business, all
of this stuff is

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.960
going to apply to you.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.040
So we've, over the years, taken
a lot of requests from

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.060
developers.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.840
So the Google Apps Admin APIs
are actually one of our oldest

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.370
sets of APIs.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.280
I've worked at Google for almost
four years, and I've

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.520
worked on them since my first
day at Google, and then even

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.720
before that, they existed.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.960
So we've gotten a lot of
requests from developers over

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.350
the years, and today,
we're going to

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.260
address some of those.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.960
One of the top requests was the
ability to search and sort

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.890
your result sets just much more
easily from things in

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:22.620
your domain.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.170
Another one is batch requests.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.240
I need to, for instance, create
a bunch of users at

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.350
once or get a whole bunch of
information about a collection

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.680
of users at the same time.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.500
Enterprise attributes.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.870
And then more customizable
reporting.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.740
And then finally, I think the
biggest request has been for

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.070
functional parity with the admin
panel for Google Apps

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.820
for Business.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.670
So here, we have my
friend Namrata.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.850
This is all of her information
in my test domain.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.510
And you can see there's a whole
bunch of information

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.080
here that is pretty common.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.500
This represents Namrata in
a traditional business

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.210
environment.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.780
So I have things here like her
phone number, her email

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.820
addresses, which groups she
belongs to, and also her

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.970
username and profile photo.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.880
So today, there's a problem and
the problem is that to get

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.060
her profile photo, I have to
make a call out to the

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.730
Profiles API.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.080
And then to get her username and
other user information, I

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.680
have to make a call out to
the Provisioning API.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.330
Yet another API call, at least,
to get things like her

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.640
nickname or her aliases, and
then yet a fourth request to

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.050
get the groups to which
she belongs.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.400
So this is a little
bit too much.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.510
And just a quick show of hands,
how many people in the

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.750
room have run into
things like this?

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.180
Almost everybody raises
their hands.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.630
OK, so I have good
news for you.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.080
Today, we're launching
the Admin SDK.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.230
And the Admin SDK is a brand
new developer experience

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.300
around managing things
in your Google Apps

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.720
for Business domain.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.490
What we're going to do is talk
about how we're going to

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.170
simplify the developer
experience, and I'm going to

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.050
introduce a few new
APIs to you.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.030
And I think what you're going to
love about this is how easy

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.390
it is to integrate, and also
how easy it is to do more

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.250
advanced things in
your domain.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.000
So we're launching
two APIs today.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.070
The first one is the Directory
API, and the next one is the

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.079
Reports API.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.850
I'm going to go through
each one.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.220
The goal of the two APIs is to
be as simple as possible,

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.370
giving you all of the data you
need and all of the actions

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.520
you need while getting
out of your way.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.530
Consistent, so what we want to
do here is make sure that all

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.080
of our API surface areas look
identical so that you don't

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.950
have to do special tweaks or
integrations between multiple

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.990
APIs in order to get
things working.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.420
And then lastly,
comprehensive.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.370
We want to expose as much of
the functionality in the

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.830
Google Apps Admin Panel
as possible.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.640
So when you come away today,
know that these are our goals,

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.400
overall, for the platform.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.260
So the Directory API allows
you to manage

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.580
objects in your domain.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.340
So this includes the traditional
objects like

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.150
users, groups, and org units.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.680
However today, the Directory
API will also allow you to

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.850
manage devices in your domain.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.700
So to give you some sense of
what's going on here, here I

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.710
have a bunch of common endpoints
that you would use

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.350
today for things like the
Provisioning API or the

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.990
Profiles API.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.320
And what we're going to do is
boil all of these things down

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.880
into a single API called
the Directory API.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.780
And here you can see all of
those endpoints, they

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.450
roll up into one.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.050
So this is going towards the
simplicity goal that we have

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.920
for the Admin SDK.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.440
The next one is the
Reports API.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.780
So the Reports API is going to
allow you to create just

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.850
richer reports on things going
on within your domain.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.230
Here, you can see this graph was
able to be generated with

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.220
all of the data coming back,
and this is just usage

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.440
activity of each service
within your domain.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.880
Another way to generate a report
is just all of the

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.820
different activities going on
within your domain so that you

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.960
can, much more easily,
do things

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.940
like audits, for instance.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.410
So let's take a demo.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.885
So Ankur in the audience
wrote this demo app.

00:06:07.885 --> 00:06:09.780
It's called Device Explorer,
and this is

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.360
doing something new.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.220
So a few important points about
this application are

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.330
that it's hosted on App Engine,
so it's a third-party

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.930
application, and it's using
everything that I just talked

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.290
about to allow you to manage
devices within a Google Apps

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:24.510
for Business domain.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.140
Ankur did a few special
things.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:31.580
One, he allowed his admin to log
in with Google+ Sign In,

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.000
which is a new mechanism for
signing users into your

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.960
applications, and you can use
that with Google Apps for

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.360
Business domains.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.970
So that's definitely something
that you should consider

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.630
changing your application
to use.

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.670
It's just a lot easier
to implement.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:45.390
And also, it allows you to get
all of the same access that

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.190
you have with your application
today.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.280
The next thing is he used the
Directory API to create a

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.610
Device Explorer here.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.600
And this Device Explorer allows
you to manage devices

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.480
within your domain.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:03.910
So here, for example, if I click
on this device, this is

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.950
all of the information about
the owner of this device.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:10.230
And if I go back, if I click on
the device itself, you can

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.680
see all of the information
about the device.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.865
So this is important because on
occasion, what will happen

00:07:14.865 --> 00:07:19.000
is one of your users may
register a non-approved device

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.880
on your domain or somebody
would lose their device--

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.180
maybe leave it on a train or
something to that effect.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.530
And what you as the admin have
to do is be able to disable

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.470
this device quickly
and easily.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:34.550
Now, it really gets a lot easier
to do mass changes with

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:35.660
tools like this.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.670
So obviously, in your own
business or in your own

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.440
software, you may need to do
some advanced things like

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.440
provision 1,000 devices, and
that's not something you want

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.830
somebody clicking around
and doing manually.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.870
So that's where the Directory
API really shines.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:54.210
It allows your application to
do more advanced concepts.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:58.620
So here, just to take a simple
example, what I can do is

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.040
select this device from Ken, and
I can do various things.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.560
Its current status is Approved,
but I can also block

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.180
it or delete it.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.740
So if I block it and take this
action, it says Done.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:14.800
And if I reload the page, you
can see, after the Wi-Fi

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.530
cooperates, that the device from
Ken is now blocked, and

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:21.620
this has also been applied in
the Google Apps Admin Panel.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:22.750
So this is one of
the new features

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:23.330
we're launching today.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.440
And this demo application is one
way to kind of see what's

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.730
going on there.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:38.380
So if I come back to the
presentation, the next thing

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.880
we're going to do is walk
through the code that made

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.039
that application possible.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:45.430
So just to give you an idea of
how the code is structured,

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:49.390
it's a very common model
view controller set up.

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:52.650
Here, the servlets act as
controllers, and the view is

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:53.600
index.html.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.580
That's really just a template.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:59.140
And then we have our servlets
talk to the client library.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.420
Our data model here is
completely represented by the

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:02.440
Directory API.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.500
So that's important to note.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.410
We don't really have
a local data model.

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.940
So the first thing we're going
to do is query mobile devices

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.330
in the domain.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:13.430
So here, you can see a method
on the devices servlet to do

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:16.480
that, and you can see actually
how simple it is.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.300
So here, just with four lines
of code, I'm able to get a

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.370
list of devices within the
domain and then print them to

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:23.470
the screen.

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:26.140
This is one of the ways that
we're really trying to address

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:27.750
that simplicity factor again.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.150
Just making it easier for you to
get the data that you need

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.400
out of your Google
Apps domain.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:41.280
The next thing we can do is
query for individual devices,

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.240
and then just return the list.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.790
So the previous method just
printed a list, and here, we

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:49.270
actually get the list of
devices themselves.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:51.710
And then we can also get
matching devices with a query.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:53.530
So I don't know if you noticed
this in the sample

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:55.600
application, but there was
a search mechanism.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.340
And I can apply that search
mechanism here.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.150
In case I have thousands of
devices in my domain, I don't

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.490
have to find each
one by scrolling

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:05.600
through hundreds of pages.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:10.260
That add row to device table
method is really just a view

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.400
generator method that creates a
table row with the device's

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.610
information.

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:16.870
And then taking action
on a device.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:18.730
For instance, I blocked
a device.

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:20.730
You can see how that's
done here via

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:22.510
this take action method.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:26.420
So the take action method is
really just a wrapper around

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.940
these five lines of code.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.010
So these five lines of code
create a new directory object,

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:35.890
which allows you to interact
with the Directory API.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:38.360
And then a mobile device action,
I which create a new

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.260
action object that
I want to set.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.970
In this case, it
might be block.

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:46.390
And that action parameter is
just a string representing the

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:47.930
action's name.

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:51.180
And then I set up the request,
and I call Execute.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.280
And once I call Execute, this
makes a request out to the API

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.180
and blocks the device.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:01.540
So one thing that we've noticed
is that an easy way

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:05.220
for us to guarantee that there
is feature parity between the

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:10.500
Google Apps user interface and
the Admin SDK is to use our

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:14.380
own Admin SDK to build the
Google Apps interface.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.710
So what does that mean?

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:20.710
Well, I'm going to switch over
here to my demo tablet.

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:22.990
And this is something
launching towards

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:23.740
the end of the month.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:26.380
It's a mobile C panel.

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.970
So this mobile C panel allows
me to manage my users and

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:32.600
groups and other domain
resources while on the go.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.060
So this works on my phone or
on my tablet, and this is

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.740
something that Google
is going to release.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.965
The important thing to note
about this entire application

00:11:38.965 --> 00:11:42.030
is it's built using our
Admin SDK, so we're

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:43.450
eating our own dog food.

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:45.670
We know that the Admin SDK works
and works well, because

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.490
we have to use it as well.

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:50.700
So here if I click Users,
you can see all of

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.280
the users in my domain.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.600
And if I click Ankur, I can
find out more information

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.930
about Ankur.

00:11:56.930 --> 00:12:00.930
So here, I can do other things,
like I can edit

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:03.100
Ankur's information.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.700
So I could change his name,
I could change his email

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:06.710
address, or change
his phone number.

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:08.602
I could add a new
phone number.

00:12:08.602 --> 00:12:13.160
I'll just punch in a random
phone number here, click Done,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.210
and OK, and it updated
the user on the spot.

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:18.860
So what that just did was make
a call out to the Admin SDK

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.110
and save that new
phone number.

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:25.710
If I come back, click Done,
I can do other things.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:28.220
I can also suspend the user
or delete the user.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.240
And then if I come back to this
menu, I can also do other

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.180
things like manage groups.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:35.620
So if I look at the All Managers
@ACME Group, here you

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:42.470
can see this admin@ankurt10sep
is one of the users, but I've

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:43.940
decided that I want to
make this user an

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:44.860
owner of this group.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:49.970
So I edit the role, and I click
Owner, and I click Save.

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:54.170
And when I click Save, Ankur is
now an owner of this group.

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:59.500
So you can see there, using
this app that we've built,

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.530
we're actually using a lot of
the features that you would

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:03.700
have to use in order to build
your own applications with

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.950
maybe more advanced use cases.

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:07.650
So this is something that's
becoming super important to us

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:09.460
and it's a goal for us
in the long term.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.700
And I really want to sell that
point because I realize that

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.540
previously, there has been
somewhat of a disconnect

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.730
between the Google Apps Admin
UI and what was available to

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:19.910
do via the API.

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:21.280
And this is something that
we're really keen on

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:21.810
addressing.

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:24.240
I know that a lot of you in the
audience need to do some

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:29.180
edge case that the UI allows
and the API doesn't.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:31.350
And so what you have to tell
your users is, oh, by the way,

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:32.820
you can't do that in my tool.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.440
You have to go to the
Apps Admin UI.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.430
We are addressing that
point directly.

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:38.280
So in the coming months, you'll
start to see that get

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.560
better and better and better.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.420
So what's next?

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:48.310
The next things that we have
going on are essentially

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:50.570
improving the developer
experience across the board.

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:58.760
So here, in the documentation--

00:13:58.760 --> 00:13:59.080
forgive me.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.720
Let me switch my screen.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.350
Pretty noob mistake
right there.

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:06.480
So let me show you the
documentation here.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:10.200
This is how it looks today, and
you can see that huge list

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.710
of APIs I mentioned
previously.

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:14.970
And it's also kind of difficult
to find out what you

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:17.710
need to do in order to address
your use case.

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:20.540
Today, we're launching this,
and it's our new developer

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.490
experience for the Admin SDK.

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:25.560
So here you can see, we've moved
to more documenting the

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:30.240
use cases and not so much
documenting individual APIs.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.560
So if you need to manage users,
for instance, or if

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.340
you're new to the Admin SDK, you
probably don't really care

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.260
that that's the Directory API.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.560
Rather, you just want to see
how to do it and then later

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:43.340
on, you'll start to learn our
own terminology as you become

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:44.710
more and more of an expert.

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:47.620
So we're working on making it
easier for new users of the

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:50.560
Admin SDK while also keep
keeping it as good reference

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.320
material for advanced users.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.760
And we're also working on
keeping it very up-to-date

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:58.450
when we add new features
to the Admin SDK.

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:01.910
So in making integration easier,
again, we're working

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:04.970
on reproducing the simplicity
and consistency of the two

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:10.480
APIs, both Directory and
Reporting, into other APIs

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.530
that will be a part
of the Admin SDK.

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:15.330
And we're also looking at giving
more feature complete

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.980
sample applications in a broad
range of languages.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:21.010
What's important to note is that
these two new APIs are on

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:23.930
our new API infrastructure
at Google.

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:26.740
You'll know that some of the
previous APIs have been on

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:30.300
this thing called G Data, and
G Data had custom client

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.350
libraries for every
single API.

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:35.080
Whereas with the new API
infrastructure, the client

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.690
libraries are consistently
kept up-to-date in a more

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:41.350
automated way so that, for
instance, the Java client

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:43.370
library, if you download the
latest version, you will

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:46.340
immediately have access to the
latest features of the API.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.610
There's no delay there.

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:52.380
The other thing, again, that
we're really focusing on is

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:54.590
continued feature parity
with Google UX.

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:58.240
And we're starting to do this by
developing the applications

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.640
for Google using our
APIs first and then

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:05.050
adding features second.

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:08.570
So with that, the upcoming
features.

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.330
We're going to add more
enterprise objects in the API.

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.850
We know this is a huge feature
request, and we're working on

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:17.650
making the availability of
data just much wider.

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:20.510
We're also working on giving
powerful structured search.

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:23.800
The worst thing on the planet
that I'm sure everybody in the

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.740
room has encountered is having
to fetch a full list of

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:28.450
resources and then manually
search them

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:30.640
yourself, and that sucks.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.750
So we're working on making that
just a lot better so that

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:36.260
you don't have to do a lot of
that processing on your end.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.900
Also, we're giving an extensible
user schema--

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:41.850
and this is a big one-- so that
you can set more and more

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:45.980
properties on a per user basis
so that you don't have to have

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:48.390
a separate data store for some
properties about your users

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:52.840
and then use Google Apps for
the other properties.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.520
We're going to give you a
login activity audit.

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.020
Again, I think this
has been a pretty

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:59.600
popular feature request--

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.870
the ability to just detect
logins from users.

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:06.440
And then lastly, we're going to
give G+ reports and let you

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.200
find out exactly how
your users are

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.790
interacting with Google+.

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:12.730
So with that, thank you.

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:15.410
And what I'd like to do
now is take questions.

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:16.450
There's two microphones.

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:22.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:22.810
AUDIENCE: Hey Vic.

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:24.740
It's Charlie Wood.

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:27.170
A couple of questions.

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:29.315
First of all, I know there was
talk about push notifications

00:17:29.315 --> 00:17:30.760
in at least some
of these APIs.

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.190
Is that included?

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.810
Is it roadmap?

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:36.820
VIC FRYZEL: That's
in the roadmap.

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:40.050
AUDIENCE: Second, what is the
process, or is there a

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:44.230
process, for increasing
API quotas?

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:47.400
VIC FRYZEL: So that's a
very good question.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.660
So these two new APIs are
managed in the Google APIs

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.190
Console, which I didn't show.

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:53.600
If you've used any other Google
API really, I'm sure

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.000
you're familiar with the
Google APIs Console.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.700
When you go there, there is, as
of today, this new option

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.520
called Admin SDK.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.720
And when you can flip Admin SDK
on and off, you can also

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.090
request more quota.

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:08.580
And what that does is it sends
an automated item into our

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.110
system and then we review
it each week.

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:13.750
And then that would allow
you to get more quota.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:16.960
AUDIENCE: And then finally, this
is kind of a detail, but

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.230
when you're fetching a long
list and you're paging 100

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:23.870
results at a time, did it make
it in to where the total

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:26.840
number of requests and the total
result set is actually

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:27.980
in each page?

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:29.740
VIC FRYZEL: You mean the result
size, like the total

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:30.950
number of users in each page?

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:31.420
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:32.610
VIC FRYZEL: Yeah,
that made it in.

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:33.540
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:34.990
Thanks.

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:37.020
VIC FRYZEL: I'll take
one from the back.

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:37.050
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:39.520
My name's Scott Howell.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:43.940
I'm curious about the Google
Sign In for external websites

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:48.020
and how this Admin SDK--

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:52.640
can you assign different levels
of rights to those

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:58.210
users for those external sites,
ie, say I have, I don't

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:03.680
know, 500 users in my Google
domain and I want to give them

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:08.510
access to an external website,
can I manage those user levels

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:09.660
through this?

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.350
VIC FRYZEL: So you mean access
to use Google+ Sign In on

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:13.480
another website?

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.990
AUDIENCE: On an external
website not part of--

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:17.710
VIC FRYZEL: I'm with you.

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:19.440
AUDIENCE: Not a Google App.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.800
VIC FRYZEL: So currently, you
can't manage that per

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:22.790
application basis.

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:26.600
What you can do is
revoke access

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:27.640
after it's been granted.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:29.820
And what we're working on is
making it so that you can

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:32.140
control individual access.

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:35.120
Let's hypothetically say that
you wanted to add an

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.140
application to all of your
users, and you want to give

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.820
them access to that application
specifically, but

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.750
not to all of the other
applications on the web,

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:43.020
that's something that
we're working on.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:43.680
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:43.920
Great.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.220
Thank you.

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:45.485
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:19:45.485 --> 00:19:47.620
I'm [INAUDIBLE] from Sears.

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.000
The question that I had is when
you are trying to add the

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.620
objects, do have the ability to
maintain the history of the

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:56.240
changes that have been done
on the user profiles?

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.670
Like for example, my phone
number was XYZ.

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:01.420
Phone number now is ABC.

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.220
Can I track the XYZ as well?

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.220
VIC FRYZEL: Yeah, so that's part
of this new SDK as well.

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:05.710
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:06.160
Thanks.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.920
VIC FRYZEL: Thank you.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.250
AUDIENCE: Is this new API going
to be available, or is

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:14.620
it available already, for
Google Apps Script?

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:15.550
VIC FRYZEL: For Google
Apps Script?

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:16.130
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:20.440
VIC FRYZEL: So the existing apps
interface exists already

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.390
on Apps Script, and what we're
working on is updating it to

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:23.950
use the new SDK.

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:27.160
I don't have a timeline for you,
but it should be soon.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:27.590
Hi.

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.760
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:28.860
This is [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.320
from SAP.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:34.250
We had an example of device
management with a device

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.060
approved and rejected.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:40.290
What are the plans for Google
regarding remote device

00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:41.210
management?

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:42.300
VIC FRYZEL: Remote device
management?

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:42.990
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:47.770
For example, when the company
has a set of employees with

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:53.680
mobile devices, does Google
have plans to set up more

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:58.000
capabilities to manage maybe
remote device wipe or those

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.840
type of features?

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.950
VIC FRYZEL: So what we have
today is the ability to

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:06.990
install an application on your
device that lets you know the

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:11.120
state of the device remotely.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.900
However, I don't have anything
to announce today about our

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:16.970
plans there in the
longer term.

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:17.080
Thanks.

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.262
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:21:19.262 --> 00:21:19.700
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:20.730
My name's Raoul.

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:21.990
I have two questions.

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:27.110
One, any update on auto
sign out or time

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:29.540
out for Google Apps?

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:32.950
Or if a user is signed in and
he is not active for 30

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:37.160
minutes, is there something
which we can trigger that will

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:38.780
sign him out of the session?

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:39.490
That's one.

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:43.755
And second question is, though
there is an audit trail which

00:21:43.755 --> 00:21:48.470
you have started on Google
Docs, does it cover the

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:50.640
external files also
which we upload?

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.560
VIC FRYZEL: The external
files that you upload?

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.070
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:56.610
VIC FRYZEL: Both of your
questions I think I have a

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:58.750
solution to, but they're a
little bit more advanced.

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:00.050
Come find me afterward,
and I'd be

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:00.970
happy to walk you through.

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:01.390
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:04.040
Thanks.

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:04.350
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:06.760
I'm Jeff Williams from the
University of Minnesota.

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.490
At the University of Minnesota,
we have five

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:12.230
different domains that are each
with a different account

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:15.600
and they're not merged
together.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.510
Is there any way that we could
leave the data in place but

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:21.940
have you update the metadata to
consolidate the domains so

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:26.210
that we have a single human
domain instead of having five

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:27.590
separate domains?

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:30.711
VIC FRYZEL: A single domain
instead of five separate.

00:22:30.711 --> 00:22:31.930
So you want to merge
the domains

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:33.550
without merging the domains?

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:36.460
AUDIENCE: We want to merge them,
but we don't want to

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:39.480
copy all of the data that's in
there back to our servers and

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:43.010
lose fidelity, and then copy it
back to your servers again.

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:44.410
Because why?

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:46.430
You've got all of the documents
for all of the

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:51.330
different campuses, so if we
could log in as admin on the

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:53.990
source and the destination
domain, we might be able to

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:57.440
migrate the users over by just
updating on your side the

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:00.310
metadata that describes the
access permissions that they

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:02.050
have to the various pieces.

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:03.300
VIC FRYZEL: That's a really
good feature request.

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.710
Come find me afterward, and
I'd like to take some

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:07.590
requirements about that, and
then I could make sure that

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:08.840
that lands.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:12.830
AUDIENCE: Frank LoCascio,
Esource Capital,

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:16.180
a Google Apps reseller.

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:20.970
On the APIs, is there going to
be work done on the APIs that

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:23.900
go after the data in the
reseller console?

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:25.210
VIC FRYZEL: Are there
any APIs that what?

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:28.200
AUDIENCE: Go after the data
in the reseller console.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.370
VIC FRYZEL: We do have a
set of APIs for this.

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:31.665
Come find me afterward,
and I can point you

00:23:31.665 --> 00:23:32.470
in the right direction.

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:35.350
AUDIENCE: OK, and a little bit
different than APIs, another

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:36.110
quick question.

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:39.580
Will there ever be the ability
to change the primary domain?

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:42.560
VIC FRYZEL: Change the
primary domain?

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:45.822
I don't think so.

00:23:45.822 --> 00:23:46.960
AUDIENCE: We have companies
changing

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.370
their names, and it's--

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:50.340
VIC FRYZEL: Yeah, freaking
companies, man.

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:54.498
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:54.498 --> 00:23:55.890
VIC FRYZEL: Hey.

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:56.300
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:56.630
I'm Chris.

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:58.750
I'm with June Star.

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:04.430
I support maybe 12, 15 companies
in Google Apps, and

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:08.010
depending on when they were
deployed, I have to juggle two

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:11.670
different admin consoles, resort
to GAM to get a lot of

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:13.340
stuff done that I can't
get done through

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:14.340
various ones of those.

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:17.760
And keeping track of who's on
where and who knows what is a

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:18.520
bit of a hassle.

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:22.010
Is this going to supplant all
of that juggling, or?

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:23.570
VIC FRYZEL: It's going to
definitely make a lot better.

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:26.680
Do you develop your
own applications?

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:30.530
AUDIENCE: As little as I
can, but I do have to

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:31.780
do some of it sometimes.

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:35.600
VIC FRYZEL: Two things
I would say.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.060
One is that we're working on
making the admin panel just

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.530
more robust.

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:42.380
I'm sure there are certain edge
cases that you're having

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:45.170
trouble telling your users to
do, and that's where your

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:47.360
application comes into play.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.870
I'm not sure specifically
in your case what

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:50.260
those edge cases are.

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:54.430
I'd be happy to discuss them
on a one by one basis.

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:56.230
But we're working on making
the admin panel just more

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:58.650
robust so that you can do
more of these things.

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:02.650
The other thing I would say is
that as we're working to hit

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:07.030
feature parity between the Admin
SDK and the Admin UI,

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:10.170
everything that you can do in
the UI, you'll be able to do

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:10.900
in the SDK.

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:14.740
So in those cases in which
you're sending a user just to

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:16.800
the admin panel to do one
thing and then to your

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.960
software to do something else,
they could eventually have one

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:20.660
destination.

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:22.620
It's either going to be
in the admin panel

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:25.230
itself or in your software.

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:26.360
So come find me afterward.

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.980
I'd be happy to talk about
your specific edge cases.

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:29.340
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:30.340
VIC FRYZEL: Thanks.

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:31.750
Hey.

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:32.030
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:35.320
Miguel from the [INAUDIBLE]
company.

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:38.650
Does this Admin SDK
plan to have PKI

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:40.840
management at one point?

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:41.640
VIC FRYZEL: I didn't hear
the last part, sorry.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.030
AUDIENCE: PKI.

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:44.170
VIC FRYZEL: Can you--

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:48.750
AUDIENCE: PKI, certificate
management.

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:49.520
VIC FRYZEL: Sorry.

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.640
I totally did not get
your abbreviation.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:52.320
Public Key Management?

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.900
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.030
VIC FRYZEL: I don't
think that we have

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:57.960
that in the near future.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:01.610
I would say that that's a really
good feature request.

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:05.740
The entire product team for the
Admin SDK is in this room,

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:07.220
so they're hearing everything
that you say.

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:08.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:11.080
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:12.770
VIC FRYZEL: Hey.

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:15.570
AUDIENCE: So I wanted to plus
one Charlie's request for the

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:17.440
push notifications and the
change feed for the--

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:17.950
VIC FRYZEL: Absolutely.

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:19.400
That's definitely
in the pipeline.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:22.720
AUDIENCE: And also, the
[? three LO ?], understanding

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:26.560
what's been authorized by
someone within the domain.

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:27.790
VIC FRYZEL: Understanding what's
been authorized by

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:30.100
somebody in the domain?

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:31.840
AUDIENCE: Someone approves
certain requests in the

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.610
marketplace, someone within your
domain, so just to know

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:38.130
what has been approved by which
users within the domain.

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:38.440
VIC FRYZEL: Got it.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.150
That's something we
can help you with.

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:42.190
AUDIENCE: Today?

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:44.320
VIC FRYZEL: You can view that
data today, but you can't

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.120
programmatically access
it in the SDK today.

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:48.700
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:51.970
Lastly, Charlie was also talking
about the quotas.

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:54.430
So I understand the per day
quota, but for us, I think the

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:56.810
bigger bottleneck, especially
when you're trying to run in

00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:59.670
parallel, is the per second
quota, the server limits.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:01.520
So is that--

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.540
VIC FRYZEL: We can help
you out there.

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:05.950
Worst case, we just
multiply your per

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:09.830
second quota by 80,000.

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:12.210
But I think we can help
you out there.

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:16.190
I don't know if we have a
specific per second quota set.

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:17.530
I'm sure we do.

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:18.570
No?

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:20.010
No.

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:22.520
So come find me afterward and
we can talk about how to get

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:23.730
your-- like I understand
that case.

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:26.910
Like you migrate a university
and while migrating that

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:30.670
university, you're making
constant requests in one day.

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:32.470
And you're trying to finish your
migration in less than a

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:33.480
week or something, right?

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.760
That's what you're
talking about?

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.320
So I understand that in that
week, your QPS is going to be

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:39.170
through the roof.

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:41.150
And then next week, you
go on vacation.

00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:42.420
You've been paid, right?

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:48.560
And so we can set a very, very
high queries per day limit,

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:49.990
and that would still suffice.

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:52.370
And since there's no queries per
second limit, I think you

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:53.990
would be OK.

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:57.680
The other thing you could do
to make that even faster is

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.550
just set up concurrent
requests.

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:02.000
So if you thread this stuff
out, you can actually send

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.540
your QPS up very, very high
and still get a high

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:08.870
throughput rate for migrating
accounts or whatever.

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:11.756
AUDIENCE: So there's
no per second rate?

00:28:11.756 --> 00:28:13.006
VIC FRYZEL: No.

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:16.460
Hold on.

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:17.240
I misspoke.

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.427
There is one, I just don't
know what it is off

00:28:19.427 --> 00:28:20.100
the top of my head.

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:23.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:25.232
VIC FRYZEL: Sorry, man.

00:28:25.232 --> 00:28:26.160
Hey.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:26.610
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:28.830
Jeff Williams from
the U of M again.

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:31.020
So you might not be the right
person, but I'm going to ask

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:32.275
anyway, just in case.

00:28:32.275 --> 00:28:37.620
When we rename a user with the
API, sometimes the user's

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:40.080
rename doesn't go through
very quickly.

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:44.810
They don't get an alias or
nickname, because we've got

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:47.290
many domains that are there.

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:51.330
So they can't get mail for
potentially a day.

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:52.610
Most of the time,
it's not a day.

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:54.370
Most of the time,
it's right away.

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:56.810
But then sometimes when it's
not, then apparently there's

00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:59.420
some process that Google does
to catch up on the ones that

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.020
didn't make it successfully.

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:03.620
And then there's sometimes ones
that don't make it from

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:06.320
the first and the second
layer of that process.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.540
And we've had tickets with
Google about it, and every

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:12.980
time, it's all happy and good
until we get to the third or

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:18.080
fourth level, and then it's
like, oh yeah, well, sorry.

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.970
VIC FRYZEL: So forgive me.

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:23.300
That is Google's problem,
and it's something

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:24.530
we're working on.

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:25.830
I'm sorry that you had
to endure that.

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:28.230
I realize that's a bad
experience, and it's something

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:29.980
that we really care about
and are fixing.

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:32.730
I'm familiar with that specific
issue, and it's

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:34.300
something that we've been
working on for a while.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.600
It's a very complicated
problem on our end.

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:41.460
A lot of people don't quite
understand this, but

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:43.910
essentially when you create a
user at Google, that touches

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:46.530
more than 1,000 machines
instantly within

00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:47.730
a matter of a minute.

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:50.860
And so keeping those machines
in sync can

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:52.550
sometimes be tricky.

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:54.860
So feel free to come find me
afterward or find any of the

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:58.040
team here, and I'd be happy to
help you address that as soon

00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.030
as possible.

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:01.030
Thanks.

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:01.180
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:06.760
Just had a question about the
Google+ Profiles API versus

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.930
the Google Profiles API.

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:15.290
Where it does seem that, if
you have a Google+ profile

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:19.540
that is locked for some reason
because you've contravened a

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:26.570
naming convention, then the user
in the Google Profiles

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:30.290
API is not returned, which
doesn't seem to be documented.

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:32.310
Is that just the
documentation?

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:34.130
VIC FRYZEL: I think that is
a documentation error.

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:35.350
I can help you get that fixed.

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:37.014
Sorry about that.

00:30:37.014 --> 00:30:38.010
Hi.

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:38.180
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:39.720
So there have been a couple
questions about

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.550
quotas and the like.

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:43.070
And one of the reasons that's
been an issue for--

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:45.070
hasn't really been an issue
for us, but it could be a

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:47.900
potential issue is that the
result set size when trying to

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:49.945
get user information from the
Provisioning API previously

00:30:49.945 --> 00:30:54.285
has only been 100 results
per query.

00:30:54.285 --> 00:30:57.690
Is that going to change
with this API?

00:30:57.690 --> 00:30:59.372
VIC FRYZEL: I think
that's changing.

00:30:59.372 --> 00:31:00.720
It's 500 now.

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:01.180
AUDIENCE: 500?

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:01.640
Excellent.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.020
Thanks.

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:03.530
VIC FRYZEL: Hey again.

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:04.380
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:07.100
Do we have an Active Directory
equivalent coming out soon?

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:08.950
VIC FRYZEL: Forgive me,
I didn't hear you.

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:10.235
AUDIENCE: Active Directory
equivalent coming out soon for

00:31:10.235 --> 00:31:12.182
Google Apps?

00:31:12.182 --> 00:31:14.140
VIC FRYZEL: I don't have
anything to announce today.

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:15.010
AUDIENCE: Active Directory
for Exchange.

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:16.540
There is an Active Directory
for Exchange,

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:17.400
so similar to that.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.620
VIC FRYZEL: I'm familiar, but
I don't have anything to

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:19.726
announce today.

00:31:19.726 --> 00:31:20.976
Sorry.

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:25.280
Other questions?

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:27.010
I think I told half of you in
the room to come find me

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:31.130
afterward, so it might
take a while.

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:34.330
But make sure that you come to
our Office Hours, which are on

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:37.040
the third floor.

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:37.900
A whole bunch of us
are going to be

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:39.190
there answering questions.

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:41.690
And then make sure to attend the
rest of the apps sessions

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:42.400
throughout the rest
of the day.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.000
There's a lot of interesting
content.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.020
Thank you very much.

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:50.630
[APPLAUSE]
