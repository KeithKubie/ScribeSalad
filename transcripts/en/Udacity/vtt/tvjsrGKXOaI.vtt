00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.590
Historically the gold standard for

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.860
developing new medical knowledge
was the controlled clinical trial.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.150
Give two randomly selected groups
of patients alternate therapies or

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.810
perhaps a new therapy and a placebo and
see who does better over time.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:19.970
These are difficult to do.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.910
Finding the right patients can be hard,
these trials take a long time,

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.300
and as a result of these and
other factors, they're expensive.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.250
However, if the question is
which treatment works best

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.110
in actual human patients, there's
currently not a good alternative.
