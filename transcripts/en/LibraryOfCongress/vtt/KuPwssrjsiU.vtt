&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington D.C.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:18.070
[ Silence ]

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.180
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson: Hi everyone.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.620
I'm Betsy Peterson, Director
of the American Folklife Center

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.070
and on behalf of the staff and
everyone here at the library,

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.270
I want to welcome you all today to
the latest Benjamin Botkin lecture.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.000 position:56%
The Botkin series, lecture series,
allows the American Folk Life Center

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.660
to do a couple of things, most
importantly, present the work

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.230
of leading scholars and folklore,
ethnomusicology, world history,

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.510
and cultural heritage studies.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.180
It also allows us to
enhance our own collections.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.590
All of the lectures here are
videotaped and become a part

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.490
of our permanent collections at
the American Folklife Center.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.020 position:56%
They also eventually make their way
up to our website, and our webcasts,

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.630
so that people around the
world and people for future --

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.020
and people in future
generations can listen

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.930 position:56%
and hear what you are hearing today.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.940
So with that message, just let me
ask you if you have a cellphone

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.710
or any other device turned on,
please turn it off at this point.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.560
And today, I have the great
pleasure of introducing researcher

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.430
and scholar Ian Nagoski, who
is the Founder and Director

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.720
of Baltimore's Canary Records.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.580
For more than two decades now, Ian
has been involved in collecting

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.740
and researching examples of
early 20th Century sound media,

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.690
particularly 78s, and in the past
ten years, he's produced dozens

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.670
of reissues on the music,
particularly emphasizing the music

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.240
of immigrants to the United States.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.890
Last year, as part
of the AFC Symposium,

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.940
which is when I first met him,

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.580
the symposium was documenting
culture in the 21st Century.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.140
Ian gave a wonderful talk
about his research on late 19th

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.600
and early 20th Century Greek
and Turkish performers.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.900
And the biographical

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.570
and sociological contexts
of those performances.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.120
Today, drawing on Canary
Record's recent digital release,

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.970
and we're sort of moving into
new realms here, called "Ecstatic

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:40.100 position:56%
and Wingless: Bird Imitation on Four
Continents, Circa 1910 to 1944,"

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.610
Ian will explore the
largely forgotten art form

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.070
of bird imitator -- of bird
imitators and illuminate the world

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.490 position:56%
of vaudevillians, bird fanciers, and
the performers who studied birds,

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.160
poeticize them and try to be them.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.920
Before I turn the mic over, I also
want to say that this research,

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.340
this most recent research on
historical brood recordings,

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.410
is getting a little bit of
notice, most particularly

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.410
and recently it was
highlighted by the New Yorker,

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.470 position:56%
I believe it was last week, because
one of the recordings from "Ecstatic

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.070
and Wingless" is a recording of
a nightingale made in Bremen,

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.630
Germany in 1913, and
rediscovered by Ian.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.750
And it has been selected
for inclusion in Moon Ark,

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.520 position:56%
the first permanent art installation
on the moon, which is being curated

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.110
by Frank-Ratchye Studio
for Creative Inquiry

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.670
at Carnegie Mellon University.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.070
And so today, we're delighted to
have Ian join us and talk to us

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.790
about Canaries, Nightingales,
Whistlers and Transcribers,

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.420
Birdsong, Bird Imitators,

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.780
and the Early 20th
Century Recording Industry.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.450
So please join me in
welcoming Ian Nagoski.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.250
Ian.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:10.400
[ Applause ]

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.700
&gt;&gt; Ian Nagoski: Thanks so much.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.350
I'm deeply fortunate,
very grateful, to be here.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:22.070
What an amazing and strange
turn of events in life.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.590
As Betsy said, I'm
a music researcher

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.480
and reissue record producer.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.260
I live in Baltimore,
Maryland, "Bird City."

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.820
My name is Ian Nagoski.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.840
I have a little record
label called Canary Records.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.960
My main project over the
past ten years or so has been

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.980
on immigrant musics
to the United States

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.550
from the collapsing Ottoman Empire.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.680 position:56%
So primarily, Greek, Turkish,
Armenian, and Arabic speaking people

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.300
who arrive in the U.S.,
end of the 19th,

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.870
beginning of the 20th Centuries.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:04.820 position:56%
Spending a decade swallowing as many
stories as possible of the lives

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.080
of people who immigrated from the
Near East to the United States,

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:16.790
I have absorbed enormous amounts
of material related to their exile,

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:26.420
exploitation, murder, ethnic
conflict, genocide, you know?

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.840
And I'm tired.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.140
I am. I'm exhausted.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.850
The whole thing has beaten me up.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.920
It's hard.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.430
So, in response to that emotional
problem, five years ago or so,

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.190
I started another project
which would try

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.850
to keep me sane, was the idea.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.820
All of my work originates in
the process of just digging

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.300
through detritus, of leftover
records that nobody wants.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:00.770 position:56%
Just junky old, remains that are not
being actively collected or studied

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.600
or if they are, it's
only by a handful

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.050
of basement dwelling weirdos.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.910
My people.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:14.570 position:56%
So among the records that I was
digging through and noticing were --

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.810
you know, there's lot of them
around that say on the label,

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.810
"Bird Imitation with Piano,"
or with cello or something.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:30.760
And it was a big, popular genre in
sort of first two or three decades

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.870
of the 20th Century, where you
would get some lady doing a little

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.920
like twittering, whistle
bird imitation,

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.510
over top of some guy playing
"Beautiful Dreamer" on piano

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.090
or some other kind of
like sentimental schlock.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.620
They're not good records,

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:52.380
but the fact that there were
human beings imitating animals was

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.700
interesting enough that
when I noticed records

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:59.160
of people imitating birds
without "Beautiful Dreamer"

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.060
or somebody playing a cello or
whatever, I said, "Well okay,

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.040
these I'm going to listen to and
these I'm going to pay attention to

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.340
and you know, store those aside."

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.300
And then gradually, I began
to notice also recordings

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.850
of birds themselves
laying around in piles.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.600
So I said, "Okay, well there's
something going on here.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.810
Why are there records of birds?

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.910
What purpose could it serve to
have a record player in your room

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:31.030
and play a record of a bird for
fun in 19 say 15 for instance?"

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:36.350
So, gradually I began to dig into
this and go down this rabbit hole

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:39.090
and I learned the story and that's
the story I'm going to tell you

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:43.410
for the next 52 minutes or so.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:47.620
I will begin the story with a
quote from a certain Royal Dixon

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.990
who wrote a book in 1917 called
"The Human Side of Birds."

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.510
He is vastly more enthusiastic
about birds than I am.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:58.100
I actually don't really
like birds that much.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.400
They freak me out.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.220
They are an alien, reptile,
dinosaur intelligence

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.870
that makes me uncomfortable.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:10.310 position:56%
However, he does get to the heart of
a certain kind of a personal urgency

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:13.840 position:56%
in the mission of all of this, which
is why I want to read this to you.

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.620
He begins, "It is strange indeed
that so few human beings are

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.410
yet aware of the divine songstry
[assumed spelling] of the birds.

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:24.910
We pay large sums of money to hear
concert music and we never stop

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:29.390
to think that the pieces we are --
they're only the musician's ideal

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:31.630
of some aspect of nature.

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.960
In his complex civilization,
man has grown away from accord

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.500
with the world of the wild things,
that he cannot give its essence

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.110
so truly as his feathered
brothers of the air.

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:45.490
Birds render in their music the
glorious spirit of the universe

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:49.360
as it really is and ever will be.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.540 position:56%
The indifference of a large part of
the human race to the natural beauty

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:57.890
that everywhere, reminds one
of Stevenson's apt words,

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:01.960
'If God would charge so much a
head for sunsets, or send a drum

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.010
around at the blossoming
of hawthorns,

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.640
perhaps then man would
better appreciate

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.530
and adore what has been
his neglected heritage

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:17.630
since first his race began.'"
So music, where does it start?

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:21.710
My contention is that at every
point in the development of music,

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:26.180
every change in its technology,
there has been relationship

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:30.500
and a dialogue with
birdsong, oddly enough.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:34.740
We will start with the first known
musical instrument discovered

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.450
in a cave in Southern
Germany just a few years ago,

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:41.300
apparently made 40,000 BCE.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:44.710
It's a three-fingered flute.

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:47.060
Plays the pentatonic
scale apparently.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.220
And it is made from
the bone of a bird.

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.520
So we start there.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.990
Okay, jump cut 25,000
years, the cave paintings

00:09:55.990 --> 00:10:01.100
of Lascaux included depiction of a
bird headed or a bird-masked man.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:07.590
Jump cut further, 1414 BCE, one of
the first comedies ever written.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:11.690
Aristophanes, "The Birds,"
includes the earliest known textual

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:13.860
transcription of a birdsong.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:18.990
In this case, a hoopoe which goes
"Epoy, poy, poy-poy, epoy-poy,

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:23.890
poy-poy, tio, tio, tio, tio, tio,
tio, tio, tio, [inaudible], bricks,

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:31.270
toro, toro, toro, toro, toro,
toro, toro, ticks, kiko-bau, toro,

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:34.980
toro, toro [inaudible] ticks."

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:42.450
Around the same time, Archytas
published a diagram of a dove,

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:46.840
a mechanical dove, which through a
system of cantilevers and pulleys

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:52.270 position:56%
and pipes, not only flaps its wings,
but also creates birdlike sounds.

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:55.840
It is in fact the first robot
ever created by human beings

00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:00.690
and it is the first lifelike moving
mechanical object human beings

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:02.760
ever theorize.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.350 position:56%
You know, he publishes this diagram.

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:08.270
It's then republished in a book
called "Pneumatica," in Alexandria,

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:12.260
the First Century A.D. And devices
are actually built from this.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.910 position:56%
And we have the first bird automata.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:21.920
Through the beginning of the early
modern era, end of the Medieval

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:28.390 position:56%
or the Renaissance, bird robots like
this become common place in Italy

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:33.480
and are part of the
gardens of nobility.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:38.600
There is debate among scholars
throughout several hundred years

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.940
whether or not birdsong
is actually music.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:47.390
In 2007, Cornell published
"Song Birds: Music, Nature,

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:51.630
and Poetry in the Latter Middle
Ages," by Elizabeth Eva Leach,

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:54.890
which over several hundred pages
tries to answer the question,

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:58.910
"Was birdsong considered music
or not in the late Medieval

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:00.980
and early Renaissance Europe?"

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:02.600
The short answer is no.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.570
It was not seen as rational.

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:09.510
Well, times have changed and
rationality seems not to be

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:11.760
as important as it once was.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:19.580
From there, we'll jump cut to 1650.

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:23.590
The first staff notation
transcriptions made in Europe,

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:28.860
of birdsong, occur in 1650
by Athanasius Kircher.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.100
I've given this talk
about a half dozen times.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.720
People often approach me
afterward and say, "Oh,

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.240
you know about Olivier Messiaen,

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.490
this composer of the
mid-20th Century

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:40.500
who cataloged birdsong
starting in the late 1940s,

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:44.030
and then used the material
of his cataloging of birdsong

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:48.390
to build from, to compose.

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:53.030
Messiaen was the dying gasp of
a 400-year tradition of trying

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:57.230 position:56%
to notate, trying to take
birdsong, control it, manipulate it,

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:00.920
and communicate it through
the media of staff notation.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:05.730
Okay, 1717, we get to
the publication of the

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:08.700
"Bird Fanciers Delight,"
or "Choice Observations

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.200
and Directions Concerning
the Teaching of All Sorts

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.670
of Singing Birds with Lessons
Properly Composed with the Compass

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:17.330
and Faculty of Each Bird."

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:21.880
It is a compilation of
tunes for the block flute,

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.180
for an instrument we
call the recorder.

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.420
Did you have to play the
recorder when you were a kid?

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:27.720
I did too.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.380
Do you know why it's
called a recorder?

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.410
Because it's the instrument
that was used

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:36.650
to record songs in
the minds of birds.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:42.610
The word record, is in fact --
it's the core, is the heart.

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:45.100
It is repeating over and
over so that it is remembered

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.390
by heart is what the word means.

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:53.110
Anyway, so the recorder was this
popular flagellate instrument used

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:55.210
to play to birds, and you would try

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:57.510
to train them to sing
these melodies.

00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:59.810
Now you can do it really
well with like bullfinches.

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:01.110
It was a big thing.

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:03.880
You could train a bullfinch
maybe four or five little songs

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:07.400 position:56%
and like the Queen of England would
pay you know, the equivalent of tens

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:08.920
of thousands of dollars
for one of these birds

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.160
that could sing four melodies.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.230
So it is a time consuming process.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:16.510
You have to -- 20 times a day,
you have to whistle to the bird.

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:17.810
You have to fall in love with it.

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:19.540
It has to fall in love with you.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.350
And then you sell it to some woman
and it won't sing for the woman,

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:24.150
and then the man comes
home with a beard

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.470
and the bird starts singing
like, "Oh, I like you."

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:32.540
Anyway, so they sold this book
to people to try to get people,

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.890
like "Okay, you play these on
your recorder over and over again,

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:37.660
to your bird -- there's a half
a dozen different birds, linnets

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:41.940
and all these things, and your
bird will learn these songs."

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.990
And it was totally just malarkey.

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:52.210
It was like a Popeil, late night TV
you know, jive infomercial thing.

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:53.530
It was a scam, is what
I'm trying to say.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:54.910
It was a scam.

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:58.440
However, a bunch of the
melodies in that book from 1717,

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.760 position:56%
wind up going into English folklore.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:04.750
One just a few years later, winds
up in Gay's "The Beggar's Opera."

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:08.230
Eighteen-ten, Johann Bechstein
publishes several textual

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:12.630
transcriptions of nightingales that
he knows personally in his book,

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:15.860
"The Natural History of Cage Birds:
Their Management, Habits, Food,

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:26.110
Diseases, Treatment, Breeding,
and the Methods of Catching Them."

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:31.440
For instance, he introduces one
by saying, "This is the song

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.740
of a fine nightingale

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:35.470
without including its delicate
little variations, for among these

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:38.460
as other musicians, there
are some great performers

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:40.370
and many middling ones.

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:43.220
This song is so articulate,
so speaking,

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.230
that it may be very well written.

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:47.880
The following is a trial which
I've made on that of a nightingale

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:52.510
in my neighborhood, which passes
for a very capital singer."

00:15:52.510 --> 00:16:31.040
[ Bird imitation ]

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:35.360
And then it gets hard and I
can't do the last ten lines.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.390
I keep trying and I keep failing.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.760
Under Bechstein's influence in
1871, in the "Descent of Man,

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.200
and Selection in Relation to Sex,"

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.540
Darwin describes attending
a canary singing competition

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.130
in London in a tavern.

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:54.440
Like record collectors,
canary breeders

00:16:54.440 --> 00:17:00.450
and fanciers would gather together
and show off what they had,

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:03.490
get drunk, avoid their
wives and children,

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.830
and would have their birds
singing against each other.

00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:09.700
Now, the singing -- in modern
times is for quality of tone,

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.820
and we'll be talking about
that with canaries momentarily.

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:15.410
At the time, it was mainly for one
of the few things we know for sure,

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:20.150
that female canaries or any bird,
female any birds, like is stamina.

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:25.080
So, Darwin says that, "A first
rate bird will sometimes sing

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:29.070
until he drops down almost
dead," or according to Bechstein,

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:33.290
"quite dead," "from rupturing
a vessel in the lungs."

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:35.240
I don't know if you've known
any musicians in your life.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:39.480
I've known a few who match
that description quite well.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.210
Eighteen-ninety-six, Charles A.
Witchell publishes, "The Evolution

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:45.190
of Birdsong, With Observations
on the Influence of Heredity

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:48.010
and Annotation," and includes
graphical representation

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:49.770
of birdsongs.

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:51.940
Grids of various sized
black dots as well

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:55.670
as 37 automata poetical
words for bird sounds.

00:17:55.670 --> 00:18:00.350
You can find those on my website,
www.Canaryrecords.tumblr.com.

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:05.370
Most of them are not safe
for work, it just so happens.

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:10.060
Okay, 1896, finally,
we get to records--

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:15.290
1896, the first bird
imitation records are made here

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:20.690
in Washington D.C. for
Berliner's Gramophone Company.

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:26.320
February 15th, 1896, one N.R.
Wood cuts a recording called

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.730
"Morning on the Farm."

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:32.430
He had to rerecord it five
more times to keep it in print

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:35.950
over the next five years.

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:39.760 position:56%
In the early days of recordings, the
masters would wear out real quick,

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.740
so in order to keep a record in
print, the performer had to go

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.180
in and rerecord the piece.

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:48.490
The record company's catalog
described the recording this way.

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:51.380
"A realistic farmyard scene
illustrating the different sounds

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.880
attending the early
morning rising on the farm.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:58.660
This reproduction clearly and
accurately brings out the bleating

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:01.280
of sheep, the lowing the
cattle, crowing of the cock,

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.750
the cackle of hens,
squeal of the guinea hen,

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:06.730
and gobble of the turkey, all
being answered by the cries

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.380
of the neighboring hawk,
crow, and other birds.

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.280
So real is the arrangement
and so exact the imitation,

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:15.410
that it requires but the slightest
stretch of the imagination

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:18.190
to place oneself in that
delightful position.

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:22.440
The result of which is the drinking
in of copious drafts of fresh air,

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.950
and numerous other pleasures
attainable only on the farm."

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:33.520 position:56%
So, 1896, you have a record player
the last decade in the 19th Century.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:37.340
One of the first disc players made.

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:41.620
And you have available to you a
human being imitating the sounds

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:45.540
of farm animals, because it gives
you an emotional association

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.370
with the pleasures of the farm.

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:53.670
Two years later, 1898, one Milton
M. Clark recorded only one side

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:58.470
in his whole career for the
Gramophone Company, that March,

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:00.110
called "Imitation of Birds."

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:02.000
I have so far not been
able to find a copy,

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.750
but I know that such
a record did get made.

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:08.480
So those two are the
first recordings

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.870
that we know of on disc recordings.

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:15.100
One Joe Belmont may have released
cylinders earlier, but not by much.

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:17.310
Belmont's career lasted
another 20 years actually,

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:19.080
doing bird imitation.

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:28.210
The first recording of actual
birds occurs 1899, made by a --

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:31.050
one Ludwig Koch in Berlin.

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:37.950
Ludwig Koch was the son of wealthy
financiers and they were so wealthy

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:43.010
that they were able to buy sound
recording equipment in 1899

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:46.590
for their eight-year-old
son who then proceeded

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:50.710
to record his own pet Indian shama.

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:54.410
Now, that in and of itself
probably wouldn't be notable except

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:59.140
for the fact that Koch fled
Germany during the 30s,

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.520
and landed in London.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.210
Became a prominent fixture

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:06.210
as a newspaper writer
and a radio broadcaster.

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:12.040
The London Times, May 13th,
1940, he wrote, "War or no war,

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.630
birdlife is going on,
and even the armed powers

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:17.980
of the three dictators
cannot prevent it.

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:21.100
I would like to advise
anybody in a position to do so,

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:23.630
to relax his nerves in
listening to the songs,

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:26.280
now so beautiful, of the birds.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:30.630
If one watches carefully, one
can be sure of surprises."

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:38.310
Nineteen-ten, another German
begins recording birds.

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:40.400
His name was Karl Reich.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:44.010
And Karl Reich had
already gotten very famous

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:47.250
for having taught a
canary a nightingale song.

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:50.200
It was a big deal in the
bird fancier community.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.330
He wrote a bunch of
articles about it, you know,

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:56.970
lectured about it widely, and then
he did something else which was

00:21:56.970 --> 00:22:02.520
that he taught a nightingale
to perch inside the horn

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.870
of a gramophone recorder,
so that he was able

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:08.120
to get the first really
good, clear recordings

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:11.390
of nightingales in particular.

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:14.650
He recorded a number of birds.

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:20.030
There in Bremen, in 1913,
this recording that he made

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:26.130
of a nightingale had become
something of a thing for me.

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:28.920
I'm going to play it for you now.

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.220
How are we doing -- oh good.

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:31.520
Yes, okay, good.

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.390
Alright, so this is a particular
nightingale, recorded acoustically

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:38.820
in Bremen, Germany
by Karl Reich, 1913.

00:22:41.510 --> 00:23:29.290
[ Bird singing ]

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:32.720
Typically, over the years and years
of lecturing, I've always tried

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.620
to not speak over recordings.

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.900
I've always tried to let them
play on their own in respect

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:42.310
to the performers, out of you know,
a sense of dignity to the lives

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:45.280
of those who sang, played.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.600
I don't have that luxury today.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.160
I've got to blast through
this stuff really quick.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.340
I'm sorry.

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:54.960
So, this record is --

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:59.350
was an insanely hot
seller, all over the world.

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:01.390
You go on EBay and get yourself one

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:04.190
in like perfect day it was
made condition, right now,

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:08.710 position:56%
for like a dollar, maybe five if you
really wanted to shell out for it.

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:10.110
It's all over the place.

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:13.520
There are tons and tons
of copies of this record.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.440
It is junk.

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.890
It's really good.

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:22.400
So, why was it such a big seller?

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.650
Well, there's a lot of reasons.

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:31.090 position:56%
One of them is because
nightingales are found from England,

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:33.600
all the way through Europe,
through parts of Northern Africa,

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:38.900
all the way through the
Balkans, Turkey, Persia,

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:43.180
down through Central Asia, down
into India, and into Indonesia.

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:51.360
They occur in poetry from Sapho,
Milton, Shakespeare, Homer, Byron,

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:57.980
Keats, Shelley, of course who knows
how many hundreds of thousands

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:01.590
of Turkish and Persian poems
are about nightingales,

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:04.250
particularly the nightingale's
relationship with the rose.

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:12.150
The nightingale you see cannot help
but pour forth the most varied,

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:15.910
the most elaborate, the
most beautiful song,

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:18.990
of any creature on earth probably.

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:23.360
And it when it gets going,
during that period in the spring,

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.710
it will sing all night long.

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:30.110
It will go without repeating
itself for like 12 hours.

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:34.740
It is so much better than Mozart,
Ornette Coleman or Charlie Parker.

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:40.250
It's like the best
outpouring of endless melody.

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:42.450
It is the impassioned lover.

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:44.670
It is the poet himself.

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:48.640
So it's like this perfect metaphor
and it occurs over and over

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:54.090
and over again through western
literature of you know, all kinds.

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:58.910
There are no nightingales in
the Americas or in Australia

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:01.520
or New Zealand or you know,
anything for that matter.

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:09.600
So, all of those continents
in 1913, 1915, 1920, had --

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.610
most of those people had
never heard nightingales.

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:15.030
They'd read about nightingales
all their lives.

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:21.550
Here, a nightingale in Bremen,
Germany escapes through records

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:24.120
and is sold all over the
world to people who now get

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:27.420
to hear what a nightingale
actually sounds like.

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:32.150
Now, part of this was also
delightful and intriguing

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:38.580
because in 1924, a
composer in Italy, Respighi,

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:40.480
composed this piece,
"The Pines of Rome."

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:44.080
Very famous kind of orchestral
suite thing, tone poem.

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:51.230
And he notates the end of the
third movement, the last few bars,

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:54.670
he writes by catalog
number that this record

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:58.520
of this nightingale should be
played during the last few bars

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:01.140
and into the silence, which
proceeds the fourth movement,

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:05.850
which is the very first time
in the history of recorded --

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:10.740
of music, that a prerecorded
sound gets played during a concert

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.220
performance as part of the piece.

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:18.370 position:56%
I have looked at recent performances
and listened to recent performances

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:22.210
and they do not use this
recording, and I object.

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:27.040
Oddly enough, so yes, there
was a reference earlier

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.580
to this Moon Ark project.

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:32.050 position:56%
I was asked to contribute a birdsong

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:36.800
and there's a ring that's being
inscribed in a titanium object,

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:41.930 position:56%
that is 16 microns thick and is the
waveform of that particular birdsong

00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:46.930
as a contribution to that project,
the Conceptual Art Project.

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:52.570
Part of the reason for that is
because of Karl Reich's other claim

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:59.080
to fame, which is that he and
another guy, Duncker, Hans Duncker,

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.560
created the first red canary.

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:03.740
Canaries are what color?

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:05.040
&gt;&gt; Audience

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.340
[ In unison ]

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:07.640
: Yellow.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:08.940
&gt;&gt; Ian Nagoski: Canaries are green.

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.240
They are. They're green.

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.190
They're all green in
the wild, all of them.

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:14.730
We made them yellow, and
then we made them white,

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:17.650
and then in about 1920, Karl Reich

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:20.190
and Hans Duncker created
the first red canary

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:23.520
which people had been trying
to make for hundreds of years,

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:28.410
and they did it because it was
the first genetic modified animal,

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:33.360
decades before Dolly the sheep,
by splicing in genetic material

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:35.370
from a South American siskin.

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:38.050
Anyway, that's the other reason

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:42.350
that that particular
song is going into space.

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:50.400
Okay. So, oy, vey, vey, vey.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:53.090
So canaries, canaries --

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:57.030
oh, nightingales where the
preeminent songbird all over Europe

00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:00.620
and parts of the Near
East for centuries.

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:03.290
They're great to have
around the house.

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:06.060
You catch them at the
right time, you know,

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:09.410
you really just got a few week
window where the males sing,

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:12.290
particularly preceding the
arrival of the females.

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:17.220
If you -- after they've
paired, after they've mated,

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:19.730
if you take the males --
they're still singing.

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:24.300
If you take them away, they
will go mute and they will die,

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.040
apparently of heartbreak.

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:30.100
But if you get them just
in a couple of week window

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:34.750
when they arrive before the
females do in migration,

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:38.320
you can get them to
sing for you at home.

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:42.340
You have to get a -- you get a
wineglass, and you turn it upside

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:45.160
down and you put mealworms
inside and then you surround

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:49.910
that with meat, ground meat, and
gradually, because they're going

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:52.990
for the mealworms and pecking
at the upside down wineglass,

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:55.330
they will get some meat in their
mouth and they will realize

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:57.460
that they can live on
that and they like it.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:59.400
So you can keep them
around the house.

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.900
Otherwise, they have
to have live food.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:06.120
Also, they defecate wet.

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:10.560
So, there are pros and cons
to having nightingales.

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:15.430
This other bird was found on the
islands off the coast of Africa,

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:17.980
the Canary Islands
they're called which is --

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:21.070
their islands are named
for a dog -- right.

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:23.920
The bird is named for the
island named for the dog.

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:26.000
Keep that straight.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.870
Canaries, it turns out, sing kind
of just as good as nightingales,

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:36.060
and they're shit is dry,
and they eat dry food.

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:38.710
So there are like lots
of benefits immediately.

00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:40.010
Also, they're kind of exclusive.

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:43.240
So it was like the Spanish
territory, the birds first go

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:46.520 position:56%
to Spain and they get, you know, to
France, and then they get from there

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:50.160
to other parts of Northern Europe.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.850
I began looking at canaries
and nightingales in particular

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:56.430
because I was interested
in Greece, Turkey, Armenia,

00:30:56.430 --> 00:31:01.160
and the Levant as I mentioned.

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.430
Part of the impetus
was because Greeks have

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:06.320
like millions of songs
about canaries.

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:09.780
Turks had like millions of
songs about nightingales.

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:13.240
There are like almost no
Greek songs about nightingales

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:17.870
and almost no Turkish
songs about canaries.

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:21.090 position:56%
So there's like an
ornithological, ethnological divide.

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:23.850
You know, they're just
split up where they fall

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:27.080
on that ethnic bird line.

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.710
But this is the beginning of it.

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:33.490
It's early 16th Century,
canaries are imported into Europe,

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:35.320
and breeding begins immediately.

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:38.310
The royalties start hiring
people specifically to take care

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:40.130
of their nightingales
and begin getting them

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:42.410
to sing the appropriate
kind of song.

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:48.390
Canary song was already
radically different in captivity

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:52.830
by Darwin's time, than
it was in the wild.

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:57.780
We have taken out a lot of
the tropics from their song.

00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:59.440
All the squawky, "parroty"
[phonetic] stuff,

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.180
like that's all gone.

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:06.620
Over time, we've developed an
ideal canary song by a combination

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:08.270
of breeding and tutelage.

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:12.000
You see, songbirds learn
essentially like human beings

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.480
where elders teach younger ones.

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:17.020
And so by exposing younger
birds to elder birds that you

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:20.270
like particularly, you
can over time develop

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:23.110
and build a line, a
tradition of song.

00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:26.780
So canary song, as it exists now
in captivity and has done for 3

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:30.490
or 400 years, is a
human composition.

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:34.530
So, I'm going to play you one
of these kind of at its peak.

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:37.390
This is a recording
made in Berlin in 1937,

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:40.520
by the aviary of one F.
Blanc [assumed spelling].

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.660
We don't know who he
was unfortunately,

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:49.090
but Germany had been the
hotbed for canary birdsong,

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:52.790 position:56%
in particular for hundreds of years.

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:55.620 position:56%
Villages around the Hartz Mountains
in particular, you're maybe familiar

00:32:55.620 --> 00:33:00.390
with the Hartz Pet Food Company,
comes from bird supply stuff.

00:33:00.390 --> 00:33:02.580
And the canary and coal mine comes

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:05.750
from the silver mines
of the Hartz Mountains.

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:08.470
Canaries were incredibly common
and there were whole villages

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:10.910
where half the population of
the village would be involved

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:15.610
in canary breeding for
export all over the world.

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:21.070 position:56%
So in Berlin in 1937, this record is
produced as a commercial recording

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:25.100
of a private aviary
for home listening.

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:29.990
This is not an outdoor, field
recording bit of nature.

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:35.680
This is not Royal Dixon's like,
vision of like God in the sunset

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.870
and the blooming of a hawthorn.

00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:44.400
This is an ideal manmade aviary,
to be listened to by people

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:48.540
who knew what it m[inaudible]
and knew exactly how good it was.

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:55.940
Assuming -- oh.

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:58.240
Human error.

00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:01.840
Compounded upon human error.

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:05.090
There we go.

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:56.720
[ Birds singing ]

00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:00.630
Now my background is
in electronic music,

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:05.810
and it occurs to me immediately how
similar this particular sound is

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:08.610
to mid-20th Century
German electronic music,

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:11.340
it just so happens.

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:18.210
I have no evidence to see a
one to one correlation, but-- .

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:22.230
Now, in order to create this sound
over these hundreds of years,

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:26.900
beginning in 1630, there
was the invention in France

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:30.620
by one Monsieur Bennard
about whom we know nothing,

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:33.430
except that he invented an
instrument called the serinette,

00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:37.620
which is the name for
canary in French.

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:42.910
It was a barrel organ,
specifically tuned and created

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:46.710
to teach a canary an ideal song.

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:49.380
So, human manmade instruments
specifically

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:52.780
for teaching music to birds.

00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:55.760
Well, then we have the
invention of the record player,

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:59.000
where we have human beings
listening to birdsongs

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.630
at home for various pleasures.

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:06.860
And we also have the use of
records to teach birds now.

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:10.910
We have mechanical recordings
to play for your birds.

00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:13.200 position:56%
This is one of the records that
sent me down this whole rabbit hole,

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.420
and I'm going to play
you a brief minute of it.

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:19.260
It was made about 1920 in Richmond,

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:21.540
Indiana at the Gennett
Recording Studios.

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:23.520
I don't know if you're
familiar with Genet Records.

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:29.770
It was an offshoot record label
run by the Starr Furniture Company,

00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:34.290
and a lot of -- well, Jelly
Roll Morton recorded there.

00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:36.720
A lot kind of foundational
blues and country,

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:39.710 position:56%
and you know a substantial amount
of popular music was recorded there.

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:43.210
This was a privately made,
privately pressed recording,

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:47.380 position:56%
made by a Canary Breeders
Association in Louisville, Kentucky.

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:52.530
And what it is, is a human
performance, two people, a duet.

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:53.830
One's playing a flute.

00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:55.130
The other one is playing
what is referred

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:57.090
to on the label as a water organ.

00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:59.960
I don't really know
what a water organ is.

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.120
I've looked at various designs.

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.570
I don't see one that
correlates to the sound I hear.

00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:07.720
I believe what it is, is
a pump organ of some kind

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:12.300
with little vessels, some kind
of bulb of water at the bottom.

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:14.540
The air blows through over
the surface of the water,

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:18.400
caused a warbling sound,
similar to the sound of a canary.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:22.630
So this is a recording of these two
human beings, in 1920 in Richmond,

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:26.100
Indiana, to be listened to.

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:30.050
To be played over and over
for aviaries of canaries

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:33.030
to teach them an ideal song.

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:35.660
The record is the same
on both sides.

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:38.850
Both sides were worn to nothing.

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:41.870
So it's a very difficult listen.

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:43.670
I'm sure you can take
it for a minute though.

00:37:43.670 --> 00:38:32.080
[ Birdsong ]

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:36.770
So, we have a performance of human
beings imitating animals in order

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:40.240
for the animals to imitate them,
so that the animals will be as good

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.440
as we want them to
be, which is like us.

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:49.010
Now, at what point did human
beings begin imitating animals?

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:54.490
I suspect, just a guess, preceding
anything we would call music

00:38:54.490 --> 00:38:55.790
or language.

00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:57.090
People, whatever people are,

00:38:57.090 --> 00:39:00.350
were making sounds
like their environment.

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:01.650
Like animals around them.

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:07.470
I know some people
who can imitate birds.

00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:11.290
They're all hunters who were
taught to do so, not from records,

00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:13.550
but from like their parents.

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:16.340
Human beings have created
not just the serinette,

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:20.760
but hundreds of different devices
and instruments to imitate birds

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:24.670
for various reasons, many of
which have to do with dinner.

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:27.820
But then there's also the business

00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:33.040
of entertaining people
by sounding like a bird.

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:35.150
This is something that
of course you know,

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:37.830
we talked about the
Berliner recordings made here

00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:39.900
in D.C., end of the 19th Century.

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:43.260
It became a thing in -- on records.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:44.630
On early records.

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:50.670
Such that recording in
India began in 1906.

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:53.580
In 1908, there were
already recordings made

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:55.910
in India by bird imitators.

00:39:55.910 --> 00:40:00.130
The first one was one
Venugopal Chari.

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:07.510
This one is recording from about
1920, just to give you an idea.

were dozens if not hundreds

of people who made their
living partially at least,

00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:38.050
from imitating birds on stage.

00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:42.210
I'm going to play for you two,
in particular from America

00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:44.760
that I am especially fond of.

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:50.420
The first one is significant
because it represents a new moment

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:53.560
in the history of women in America.

00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:56.310
Parallel with the suffragette
movement, through the end

00:42:56.310 --> 00:43:00.770
of the 19th and beginning of the
20th Century, it became possible

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:05.990
for a woman to stand in public,
pucker her lips, make weird faces,

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:09.000
and whistle in front
of other human beings

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.560
for the first time
in American history.

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:15.470
There are literally
hundreds of articles,

00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:17.870
published between the last
decade of 19th Century,

00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:20.230
and the first two decades
of the 20th Century,

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:25.070
that begin with the old saw,
which I'd never heard before,

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:27.210
"A whistling woman
and a crowing hen,

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:29.480
never will come to any good end."

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:33.080
And then the article goes on the
say, "Well, can you believe it?

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:34.470
Not anymore.

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:37.350
Now women can whistle too
and it's perfectly okay

00:43:37.350 --> 00:43:40.210
and here's a lady who's coming to
our town and she's going to whistle

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:42.310
for us, and it's going to be great.

00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:44.940
And you're going to like it."

00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:48.080
For instance, there's a San
Francisco Chronicle article

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:51.770
from June 26th, 1904,
called "Whistling is an Art

00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:53.630
and Drawing Pretty
Lips to a Pucker."

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:57.480 position:56%

may whistle, but girls must sing.

00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.480

why can't girls too?

in the world to do."

one Dr. L.K. Herschberg [phonetic],
A.B., M.A., M.D., of Johns Hopkins,

"Wishes to reassure you that
your daughters and wives will

00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:22.850
in no way be harmed by whistling."

00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:25.840
He says thus, "The
hygienic advantage

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:28.980
of whistling is only beginning
to be recognized by psychologists

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:30.710
and public health officials.

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:32.010
Most medical men, however,

00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:35.810
especially in the strict laboratory
kind, scoff at the very idea.

00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:38.700
Yet, as an aid to health,
whistling is the equal

00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:43.460
of most muscular exercises, and far
superior to medicines, mud baths,

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:47.160
and morbid medica-mentations."

It's science folks.

00:44:48.830 --> 00:44:52.170
It's perfectly okay.

00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:54.800
Now, so women began
publicly whistling

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.950
and doing bird imitation
in particular.

00:44:56.950 --> 00:45:00.180
One woman named Agnes Woodward,

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:02.530
opened the California School
for Artistic Whistling.

00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:05.120
It was one of only -- it
was one of several schools

00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:07.930
of artistic whistling opened
around the country about the time,

00:45:07.930 --> 00:45:11.040
and it graduated the two most
famous whistlers, female whistlers,

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:12.620
of the early 20th Century.

00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:18.110
One of them, who's name I've
forgotten, but you know her.

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:19.840
You've heard her, because she sings

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:22.540
in the first five Disney
feature films.

00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:25.750
Snow White, "At the Wishing
Well, I'm wishing," and the bird

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:27.660
in the tree whistles
the melody back.

00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:28.960
That's that lady.

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:31.240
And she's not credited in any
of the films because it's Disney

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:35.510
and that was what he did, but
anyway, she was a graduate

00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:38.770
of Agnes Woodward's California
School for Artistic Whistling.

00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:43.370
The other most famous female
whistler of the early 20th Century,

00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:47.350
was this woman, Margaret
McKee, who was born 1898.

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:50.110
Started performing as a
whistler at the age of 9,

00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:54.020 position:56%
before studying with Agnes Woodward.

functions, private homes,

1915 to 1918, including Chautauqua.

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:01.370
Are you familiar with Chautauqua?

00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:03.060
It's a similar situation
as this, right?

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:06.450 position:56%
Yes, yes, yes, so it's infotainment.

00:46:06.450 --> 00:46:08.650 position:56%
Somebody gets up and does
something entertaining and you know,

00:46:08.650 --> 00:46:11.260
gives you a talk about how you
should live a tempered life

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:15.950
or ladies get dressed up like and
do you know, tableaus and togas

00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:19.350
of Greek sculpture and stuff.

00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:22.160
Yes, it's similar to you
know, this kind of nonsense

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:25.300
that I'm doing right now.

00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:26.600
So she does that.

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:29.870
By 1921, she performed at the
hippodrome in San Bernardino,

00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:33.160

from the rafters in a giant cage,

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:34.460
dressed in yellow feathers.

00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:39.650
She toured Europe from 1922 to
'26, and the returned home first

00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:43.750
to California and made radio
broadcasts, and then toured

00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:47.500 position:56%
around like, opening for like our
gang movies in Reading, Pennsylvania

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:50.270
and stuff, until 1929
when she struck

00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:53.520
up with a Brooklyn Baptist
evangelist named Russell Brower

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:56.400
[phonetic], with whom she
performed twice a week, every week,

00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:00.380
until 1935, for six years,
opening for lectures titled,

00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:04.960
"The Virtuous Life," and
"Suicide: Is it Ever Justifiable?"

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:07.190
She returned to California
after those six years,

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:11.050
still with her maiden name and
went back to live with her parents.

00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:15.070
Recorded into the 30s and 40s at
ladies' teas and women's functions.

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:17.950
She was a great virtuoso
of whistling and made many,

00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:21.310
many records, accompanied
and unaccompanied.

00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:24.990
This is a little sample
of one from the late 20s.

00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:26.450

00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:28.180

[ Birdsongs ]

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:46.250
So, for what it's worth,
Agnes Woodward, her teacher,

00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:49.180
published in 1937 a book
on artistic whistling,

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:53.010
half of which is dedicated to
bird imitation specifically.

00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:55.540
So that book is probably here
in the library somewhere.

00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:57.080
It's available online for free.

00:48:57.080 --> 00:49:00.320
I do recommend it if you're
interested in pursuing the subject

00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:03.490
as very few people
seem to do anymore.

00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:05.990
Why do people not imitate
birds so much anymore,

00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:09.150
and why are there these old
records of them, the question is?

00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:11.290
Okay, so old records, the deal was

00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:16.650
when there first was a record
business, you would put on a record

00:49:16.650 --> 00:49:21.400
and if your ears were to be
believed, there was like the sound

00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:25.100
of a human voice or someone
playing an instrument or something.

00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:28.180
And yet, you could not see them.

00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:31.920
And so for people who for millennia
had been trained from infancy

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:36.760
to expect a sound to be accompanied
by something that you can see,

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:43.580 position:56%
you know, a source making that
sound, it was a dissociative feeling

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:46.960
and a source of wonder and
joy for a great many people.

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:50.070
Similarly, if a person
is standing on stage,

00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:54.350
and the sound of a bird
is coming out of person,

00:49:54.350 --> 00:50:00.550
it is a similar dissociative
experience, and kind of amazing.

00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:06.150
Kind of -- "Wow, you sound just
like a-- " whatever animal it is.

00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:10.320
So the two kind of
cancel each other out.

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:14.100
You put on a record, you can't see
the person causing you the wonder

00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:15.810
because the wonder is the record,

00:50:15.810 --> 00:50:18.310
and then people became
desensitized to that wonder.

00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:22.130
Well, it still goes on
privately in various places.

00:50:22.130 --> 00:50:26.140
There are still bird imitation
competitions in various places.

00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:27.790
There have been a couple
of TV stars.

00:50:27.790 --> 00:50:31.450 position:56%
There was a guy about 20 years ago
in Italy who made a name for himself

00:50:31.450 --> 00:50:34.620
on like Star Search type shows
doing great bird imitations.

00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:38.250
But, he was not as good
as Charles Kellogg.

00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:43.150
Charles Kellogg was the best there
ever was, and he got very rich

00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:46.820
and very famous imitating
birds, among other things.

00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:48.500
So I'm going to try and
tell you real quick,

00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:49.800
the story of Charles Kellogg,

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:52.110
who I could have spent
this entire hour on.

00:50:52.110 --> 00:50:54.730
I love Charles Kellogg.

00:50:54.730 --> 00:51:01.780
Charles Kellogg was born
October 2nd, 1868 in a small town

00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:04.570
in the Sierra Nevada
mountains in California.

00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:08.480
His father ran a provision
store for goldminers.

00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:10.980
His mother is out of the picture

00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:12.410
by the time he's two
or three years old.

00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:13.710
We don't know where she went.

00:51:13.710 --> 00:51:16.230
We don't know if she died or
abandoned the family or what.

00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:17.730
But anyway, she's gone.

00:51:17.730 --> 00:51:20.430
And Charles and his
brother are mainly raised

00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:23.800
by Native American
women and a Chinese guy.

00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:27.850
So, he grows up actually around
very little English language

00:51:27.850 --> 00:51:29.150
for a lot of the time.

00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:34.430
And furthermore, he spends pretty
much all the time of his childhood,

00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:38.560
up until he's nine years old,
out in the woods, by himself.

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:42.640
And he teaches himself during
that period, to do this thing

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:48.390
with his throat where he would make
the sounds back to various animals.

00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:52.470
Snakes, and bears, and birds,
and all kinds of stuff.

00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:54.920
He developed a way of
singing with his mouth closed

00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:56.540
and imitating animals back.

00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:59.630
Now, his father grew alarmed when
he got to be about nine years old

00:51:59.630 --> 00:52:01.910
that he was kind of growing up
this wild boy, and he sent him

00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:05.890
out to upstate New York to
live with rich relatives.

00:52:05.890 --> 00:52:08.970
They taught him woodworking.

00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:11.770
They you know, taught him how to
you know, sit at the dinner table.

00:52:11.770 --> 00:52:13.230
They sent him to Syracuse.

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:16.030
He graduated during which
time he started a men's choir.

00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:17.960
Liked singing.

00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:24.360 position:56%
Just after graduating from Syracuse,
he performed at Chautauqua.

00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:25.820
And he was a hit.

00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:29.460
What he did is he got up on stage

00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:31.920
and he did this thing he'd
learned how to do as a kid

00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:35.350
where he would sing like a
bird with his mouth closed.

00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:37.110
And people went like,
"That's great."

00:52:37.110 --> 00:52:39.580
And he went, "I've got a career."

00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:41.110
And he went on tour.

00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:47.340
And he toured relentlessly
for the next 50 years.

00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:50.280
Where to begin.

00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:54.050
Okay, so we've got to plow
through Charles Kellogg.

00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:57.810
So Charles Kellogg, what he would
do, he would come out on stage.

00:52:57.810 --> 00:53:00.620
The backdrop is painted
to look like the woods.

00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:01.970
He comes out dressed
like a woodsman.

00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:03.270
He's got this mustache.

00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:04.570
He's really good looking.

00:53:04.570 --> 00:53:06.520
He looks like a Brooklyn hipster.

00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:10.490
He's like super cute, and he
comes out and this bird sound is

00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:12.680
like coming out of his throat
as he comes out on stage

00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:13.980
with the woods behind him.

00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:15.930
And people are going like,
"Wow, that's amazing."

00:53:15.930 --> 00:53:18.860
And then, he stops and he
begins to address the audience

00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:21.670
and he tells them all about
nature and how wonderful it is.

00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:25.390
And if only you just go into the
woods and approach the animals

00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:27.890
without fear, and with
love in your heart,

00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:29.670
everything will always be fine.

00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:32.650
Now, I told this to my daughter
at one point, who's ten years old

00:53:32.650 --> 00:53:36.010
at the time, and she said,
"Is that how he died?"

00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:44.280
His big break came in a
San Francisco Call article,

00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:47.860
December 4th, 1910 after
he'd already been touring

00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:49.160
for about a decade.

00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:53.660
In that, the writer writes,
"He has the utmost faith

00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:55.520
in the power of love and kindness.

00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:57.260
'It is all love,' he says.

00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:00.070
'Anybody who goes into the woods
with a spirit of love in his heart,

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:02.450
without the faintest desire
for destruction or possession,

00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:06.580
can make friends with the birds if
he is merely tactful and patient.

00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:09.920
Birds can read the hearts
of men better than men can.

00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:12.550
They know their friends and
they're ready to love them.'

00:54:12.550 --> 00:54:16.070
In Kellogg's mind, there is
no place for fear or hatred.

00:54:16.070 --> 00:54:17.430
Fear creates fear.

00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:18.810
Hatred brings hatred.

00:54:18.810 --> 00:54:20.210
Love engenders love.

00:54:20.210 --> 00:54:23.630
These are the cardinal
tenets of Kellogg's creed."

00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:26.560
So that's what he does onstage.

00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:28.090
He lectures you.

00:54:28.090 --> 00:54:32.600
Sometimes for like
two hours about love,

00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:37.210
while he's like intermittently
doing demonstrations of bird sounds

00:54:37.210 --> 00:54:39.960
or you know, taking out snakes and
having children come up on stage

00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:44.090
and play with the "grass
dollies," he calls them.

00:54:44.090 --> 00:54:47.310
And the topper -- okay, so
apparently he'd gotten his hands

00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:51.040
on the early edition in
English of Hermann Helmholtz's

00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:54.730
"On the Sensations of Tone," a book
on acoustics, foundational work.

00:54:54.730 --> 00:54:58.450
So, apparently he'd read this
and it sort of blew his mind

00:54:58.450 --> 00:54:59.750
and he got this idea

00:54:59.750 --> 00:55:01.630
of an experiment that's
in Helmholtz's book.

00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:07.430
So he gets a gas flame Bunsen
burner, and a glass tube,

00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:11.480
and he demonstrates that by just
using his throat and the vibrations

00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:14.410
of the air, he can
make the flame dance.

00:55:14.410 --> 00:55:20.510
And then, he can blast a
note so high and so loud,

00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:22.880
that you can't hear it, but
it extinguishes the flame

00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:24.180
and "That's the end
of the show folks.

00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:28.140
Ladies and gentlemen, Charles
Kellogg," and the house goes crazy.

00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:31.410
Nobody'd ever heard of it, so he's
fascinated with vibration and love

00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:34.840
and fire and animals and it's
all this one, big package.

00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:39.980
And he just tours it relentlessly
and he knows how to keep the press

00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:42.030
and the media interested.

00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:46.790
By 1915, 1920, when he's playing
in Chicago at the big theaters,

00:55:46.790 --> 00:55:53.070
he's making the equivalent
of $100,000 a week.

00:55:53.070 --> 00:55:55.420
Like Oprah money.

00:55:55.420 --> 00:56:01.530
But then one of the heiresses
of the Kodak fortune seems

00:56:01.530 --> 00:56:02.830
to fall in love with him.

00:56:02.830 --> 00:56:05.050
She piles a bunch of
money on top of him.

00:56:05.050 --> 00:56:08.470
He builds this house out in the
mountains called The Mushroom,

00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:12.370
which is a single room with an open
roof, and a fireplace on a track

00:56:12.370 --> 00:56:14.540
on wheels that can go around.

00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:15.890
He's a vegetarian his whole life.

00:56:15.890 --> 00:56:18.150
He never takes a gun into
the woods with him ever.

00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:19.830
Takes lots of photographs.

00:56:19.830 --> 00:56:23.700
When the interest in his work
starts to fade in the 20s,

00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:26.740
he goes to the Redwoods, he
cuts a giant section of a tree

00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:30.820
and carves it out with
a couple of axmen.

00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:33.620
Builds a room inside the
tree, mounts it on the chassis

00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:35.230
of a tank, and then drives it.

00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:37.220 position:56%
It will only go seven miles an hour.

00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:41.030
Drives it down the west coast, up
and down making whistle stop tours,

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:45.440
no pun intended, telling people
about the woods and birds

00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:49.130
and how great he is, and
he calls the vehicle --

00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:53.640
there's been no such thing as
an RV before, remember, in 1925.

00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:57.600
He calls it the "Travel
Log," har, har, har, har.

00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:01.750
Anyway, okay so I'll play
you some of Charles Kellogg.

00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:04.530
Among Kellogg's various claims
that he would make was that he --

00:57:04.530 --> 00:57:07.230
well, at first he said he had a
nine and a half octave vocal range.

00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:08.970
And then he changed that.

00:57:08.970 --> 00:57:11.970
He said, no, he had a ten and
a half octave vocal range.

00:57:11.970 --> 00:57:15.020
In any case, it was
enormous, whatever it was.

00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:19.880
He also claimed, as you will hear,
to have the actual physical larynx,

00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:24.460 position:56%
the syrinx, of a bird in his throat,
which was such total bologna.

00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:28.170
However, he did also claim, and
this is true, he spent a full day

00:57:28.170 --> 00:57:29.480
with Auguste Rodin, who fell in --

00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:32.060
you know, who was crazy
about Kellogg.

00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:33.720
And even though they didn't
speak the same language,

00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:36.670
they hung out all day and you
know, looked at art and had dinner

00:57:36.670 --> 00:57:38.970 position:56%
and smiled at each other apparently.

[ Charles Kellogg Show ]

00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:12.390
The whole record is four
minutes on the side,

00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:13.690
so I'm going to skip ahead.

00:59:13.690 --> 00:59:18.510

a little bit of the end.

00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:36.130
My sentiments exactly.

00:59:36.130 --> 00:59:41.710
So, just to finish up real quick, I
just want to say that May of 1929,

00:59:41.710 --> 00:59:45.490
the first recordings of
birds are made in the wild.

00:59:45.490 --> 00:59:49.760
The first non-captive, non-caged
bird recordings by Arthur Allen

00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:54.040
from Cornell's Ornithology
Lab made on film.

00:59:54.040 --> 01:00:01.520 position:56%
Nineteen thirty-two, Albert A. Brand
issues a two 12-inch 78 rpm disk set

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:06.480
called "Bird Songs Recorded
from Nature," recorded outdoors

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:08.590
with a parabolic microphone.

01:00:08.590 --> 01:00:14.050
And this folks, is about where
captive bird recording ends.

01:00:14.050 --> 01:00:19.170
From that point on, we
have various recordings

01:00:19.170 --> 01:00:25.470
of folkloric examples
of bird imitation.

01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:30.990
So for instance, oh Friday May
6th, 1938, here in Washington D.C.

01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:34.500
at the National Folk Festival,
Fred Colby's group from Nashville,

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:38.800
Tennessee includes a
recording of a bird imitation.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:41.810
It's not very good.

01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:47.120
in Mato Grosso, Brazil in 1938.

of it, but he's one

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:24.780
of the better performers, I think.

that we continue to tell
ourselves about who we are.

01:02:34.370 --> 01:02:37.240
We're actually much better,
weirder, more interesting,

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:39.960
and more fun than what
we claim to be.

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.260
You've all been very
kind and patient.

01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:43.060
Thank you very, very much.

01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:57.700
[ Applause ]

01:02:57.700 --> 01:03:01.500
Thanks. Nancy has asked if -- first
of all, if anybody's got to go,

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:03.940
like you're not going
to hurt my feelings.

01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:05.240
Perfectly fine.

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:06.540
I know there's -- you
know, life goes on.

01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:10.680
Nancy's asked if anybody
wants to ask a few questions?

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:12.470
I'll try. Yes?

01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:15.230
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: You
know, I've been listening

01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:16.870
to our recording series

01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:19.080
at the American Folklife
Center for a long time.

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:21.880
One of the best known French
traditional folksongs,

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:24.390
and it's sung everywhere
where French is spoken,

01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:28.490
is called "Nuit Sauvage," which
means, "Wild Nightingale."

01:03:28.490 --> 01:03:34.350
And the trope of the song is
the lover asking the nightingale

01:03:34.350 --> 01:03:39.350
to teach him its language so that
he can woo his girlfriend, right?

01:03:39.350 --> 01:03:40.650
Because--

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:41.950
&gt;&gt; Ian Nagoski: Yes.

01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:43.250
&gt;&gt; Audience member: -the
nightingale is so good at that.

01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:44.550
&gt;&gt; Ian Nagoski: Right.

01:03:44.550 --> 01:03:45.880
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And so, I
mean it gets into this question

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:49.070
of bird imitation and why people
would do it, and that's one sort

01:03:49.070 --> 01:03:51.730
of traditional answer
to the question.

01:03:51.730 --> 01:03:56.120
And I wonder in others -- you know,
you mentioned that for example

01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:58.710
in Turkish songs, there are many,
many songs about the nightingale.

01:03:58.710 --> 01:04:02.210
What it is about the nightingale
that's being discussed?

01:04:02.210 --> 01:04:03.970
&gt;&gt; Ian Nagoski: Oh, there's a
million things about nightingales.

01:04:03.970 --> 01:04:06.500
Okay, so in the Turkish-Persian
tradition,

01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:08.800
the nightingale sings to the rose.

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:11.940
Male sings to female.

01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:18.790
It's a metaphor of you know,
masculine desire and ability

01:04:18.790 --> 01:04:23.570 position:56%
to speak to -- now it also,
nightingales nest low to the ground,

01:04:23.570 --> 01:04:25.790 position:56%
sort of briars and bushes and stuff.

01:04:25.790 --> 01:04:28.290
And so there's this long
tradition of the idea

01:04:28.290 --> 01:04:34.090
of them intentionally piercing
their own breasts with thorns

01:04:34.090 --> 01:04:37.180
out of like the agony of love.

01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:38.480
So there's that.

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:40.630
There's another whole tradition
having to do with the fact

01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:44.110
that they do sing all night
long, so they are worried,

01:04:44.110 --> 01:04:47.460
they are unrestful, they're
looking out for something,

01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:50.390
something's bothering
them, they're --

01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:53.930
there's one story that nightingales
originally only had one eye,

01:04:53.930 --> 01:04:58.030
and worms had one eye, and the
nightingale borrows the eye

01:04:58.030 --> 01:05:02.790
from the worm, and then
doesn't give it back.

01:05:02.790 --> 01:05:05.510
And then has to stay up all
night watching out for the worm,

01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:09.620
because the worm's going to try and
come back and get his other eye.

01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:13.640
Yes, so you know, what is
it about ache and yearning?

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:18.020
I mean, the song is thought of as
sad, and you know, I can hear why.

01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:21.240
But it's a -- you know, there
are all these projections.

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:23.430 position:56%
Nightingales are also remarkably one

01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:25.210
of the least interesting
looking birds.

01:05:25.210 --> 01:05:29.100
I mean they are as boring
and drab as you can get.

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:32.660
They're brown and middle sized
and just nothing looking.

01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:34.210
And they sing the best.

01:05:34.210 --> 01:05:36.940
So there's all this other
stuff about you know,

01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:39.710 position:56%
God sort of gave colors and all
these great things to all the birds,

01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:41.120
and the nightingale
was last in line.

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:42.420
And he said, "Well, I'm all out.

01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:43.720
You get song instead."

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.460 position:56%
You know, so all that kind of stuff.

01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:47.170
Like there's so many stories.

01:05:47.170 --> 01:05:50.430
There's a Bulgarian story
that came up earlier

01:05:50.430 --> 01:05:53.760
about a woman her makes
a bet with a nightingale

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.060
about who can sing better.

01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:56.360
[ Inaudible audience response ]

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:59.460
Oh, I beg your pardon, thank you.

01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:02.050
What is her name again, Mag-- ?

01:06:02.050 --> 01:06:03.350

01:06:04.650 --> 01:06:05.950
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:07.250
Yes, I can't remember the story.

01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:09.300
&gt;&gt; Thea Austen: He challenges
her and he says, "If you lose,

01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:11.510
you have to cut off your hair.

01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:13.690
And if I lose, I'll
cut off my wings."

01:06:13.690 --> 01:06:14.990
&gt;&gt; Ian Nagoski: Right.

01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:16.290
&gt;&gt; Thea Austen: And she wins.

01:06:16.290 --> 01:06:17.590
&gt;&gt; Ian Nagoski: Right, but
she doesn't cut off his wings.

01:06:17.590 --> 01:06:18.890
[ Inaudible audience response ]

01:06:18.890 --> 01:06:20.190
&gt;&gt; Ian Nagoski: Because she's nice.

01:06:20.190 --> 01:06:21.490
[ Inaudible audience response ]

01:06:21.490 --> 01:06:22.790
&gt;&gt; Ian Nagoski: Yes.

01:06:22.790 --> 01:06:29.880
&gt;&gt; Thea Austen: So are they known
for being competitive in vain?

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:31.180
I mean is it-- ?

01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:32.480
&gt;&gt; Ian Nagoski: Nightingales?

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:33.780
&gt;&gt; Thea Austen: Yes,
are they thought

01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:35.100
to be competitive [inaudible]?

01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:39.040 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ian Nagoski: No, they appear -- I
can't think of an instance of that.

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:41.170
They appear in Aristophanes',
"The Birds,"

01:06:41.170 --> 01:06:44.130
and in "The Conference of Birds."

01:06:44.130 --> 01:06:47.150
In both cases, they're lovers who
want nothing to do with conflict.

01:06:47.150 --> 01:06:50.410
They're like checked out
and only want to love.

01:06:50.410 --> 01:06:52.120
And that, you know.

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:53.800
So. Yes?

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:57.900
&gt;&gt; Audience member: So
nightingales are connected

01:06:57.900 --> 01:07:02.340
with romance and passion.

01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:04.120
What are canaries known for
within Greek song [inaudible]?

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.420
&gt;&gt; Ian Nagoski: Oh,
yes, yes, yes, right.

01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:07.220
Well, they're [inaudible]--

Technical problem. ]

01:07:57.310 --> 01:08:03.080
-that nightingale, or
also what ends the idea

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:07.070
of recording a companion
[inaudible] nightingale, you know?

01:08:07.070 --> 01:08:10.680
Does that answer your question?

01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:11.980
Yes?

01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:15.540
&gt;&gt; Audience member: How
does the lark sound?

01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:23.310
You know, there's a poem, "And
the lark will fly up and sing,"

01:08:23.310 --> 01:08:26.910
and I'm always curious
how it sounds.

01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:30.690
&gt;&gt; Ian Nagoski: The Cornell
Ornithology Lab contains a massive

01:08:30.690 --> 01:08:33.890
archive of recordings of
lots and lots of birds.

01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:36.830
And it's all available,
hundreds of thousands of them,

01:08:36.830 --> 01:08:38.640
are available for free online.

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:40.170
I cannot recommend highly enough.

01:08:40.170 --> 01:08:44.940
It's such a great resource for
listening to any kind of birdsong.

01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:47.200
I can't imitate any birds.

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:50.290
So, I can't really --
I can't do it for you.

01:08:50.290 --> 01:08:51.590
I wish I could.

01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:53.520
&gt;&gt; Audience member: And
this is only in England.

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:54.820
&gt;&gt; Ian Nagoski: Yes, the lark.

01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:56.120
&gt;&gt; Audience member: Yes.

01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.420
&gt;&gt; Ian Nagoski: Yes.

01:08:57.420 --> 01:08:59.490 position:56%
I'd never heard a nightingale
before myself until I was in Germany

01:08:59.490 --> 01:09:03.440
in April, several years ago,
and it was remarkable walking

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:07.480
down the street and immediately
going like, "I know what that is.

01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:09.140
Oh man, this is really happening.

01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:11.880
I'm really inside of this life."

01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:13.780
&gt;&gt; Audience member:
[Inaudible] it flew

01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:16.870
up in its early dawn,
right [inaudible].

01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:20.290 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ian Nagoski: Lark of the Morning.

01:09:20.290 --> 01:09:21.590
&gt;&gt; Audience member: He always--

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:22.890
&gt;&gt; Ian Nagoski: Oh, yes.

01:09:22.890 --> 01:09:24.190
Von Williams.

01:09:24.190 --> 01:09:25.490
Yes, yes.

01:09:25.490 --> 01:09:27.850 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Audience member: He always hears
it when he comes back from courting.

01:09:27.850 --> 01:09:31.400
&gt;&gt; Ian Nagoski: Oh yes, yes.

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:33.740
Those associations are important.

01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:40.580
There's a line in Dante in the
Purgatory which is, "Lord I,"

01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:47.810
I can't remember what
the line is but in Latin,

01:09:47.810 --> 01:09:53.070
it's actually onomatopoeia for
a blackbird singing in February,

01:09:53.070 --> 01:09:55.600
too early to hasten
along the spring.

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:58.300
So it's layered with not
only the literal meaning

01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:01.160
of the words themselves, but
also with the association

01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:03.790
of the onomatopoeia of the bird.

01:10:03.790 --> 01:10:07.830
There are these things that kind of
occur in poetry in the onomatopoeia

01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:11.800
of all the birdsongs
that are kind of fun.

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:13.100
So.

01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:14.400
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: I'm sorry.

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:15.700 position:56%

01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:22.400
to thank Ian Nagoski
