00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.950
So I've got a whole
pizza here, and let's say

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.590
that I were to cut it
into two equal pieces.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:11.040
Let me cut it right over
here into 2 equal pieces.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.940
And let's say that I ate
one of those 2 equal pieces.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.840
So let's say I ate all
of this right over here.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.910
What fraction of the
pizza have I eaten?

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.360
Well, I took the
whole and I divide it

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.430
into two equal pieces, and
then I ate one of those pieces.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.630
So I ate 1/2 of the pizza.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.150
Now, let's imagine that instead
of cutting that pizza into only

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.730
2 equal pieces,
let's imagine instead

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.590
that decide to cut it
into 4 equal pieces.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.290
So let's draw that.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.820
So 4 equal pieces.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.520
So I could cut once
this way and then

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.950
I could cut it once this way.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.860
And so here I have
4 equal pieces.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.060
But let's say that I want to
eat the same amount of pizza.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.180
How many of these 4 equal
pieces would I have to eat.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.520
I encourage you to pause the
video and think about that.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.110
Well, I would eat this piece.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.770
You could imagine me eating
this piece and this piece right

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:21.560
over here.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.140
I've eaten the same
amount of the pizza.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.840
Each of these pieces you could
imagine got cut into 2 pieces

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.010
when I cut the whole
pizza this way.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.350
And so now I have to
eat 2 slices of the 4,

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.850
as opposed to 1 slice of the 2.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.250
So I just ate 2 out
of the 4 slices.

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:44.210
I'm using different
numbers here.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.014
Here I'm using a
1 in the numerator

00:01:47.014 --> 00:01:48.055
and 2 in the denominator.

00:01:48.055 --> 00:01:49.554
Here, I'm using a
2 in the numerator

00:01:49.554 --> 00:01:51.340
and a 4 in the denominator.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.800
These two fractions
represent the same quantity.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.410
I ate the same amount of pizza.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.530
If I eat 2/4 of a pizza, if I
eat 2 out of 4 equal pieces,

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.590
that's the same
fraction of the pizza

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.780
as if I eat 1 out
of 2 equal pieces.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.930
So we would say that
these two things

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.930
are equivalent fractions.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.960
Now let's do another
one like this.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.190
Instead of just dividing
it into 4 equal pieces,

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.735
let's divide it
into 8 equal pieces.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.780
So now we could
cut once like this.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.040
So now we have 2 equal pieces.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.880
Cut once like this.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.510
Now we have 4 equal pieces.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.300
And then divide each of
those 4 pieces into 2 pieces.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.320
So I'll cut those
in-- So let's see.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.695
I want to make
them equal pieces.

00:02:40.695 --> 00:02:43.410
Those don't look as
equal as I would like.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:51.480
So that looks more equal, and
that looks reasonably equal.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.500
So now how many equal
pieces do I have?

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.090
I have 8 equal pieces.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.180
But let's say I wanted to eat
the same fraction of the pizza.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.410
So I could eat all of these
pieces right over here.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.090
Well, how many of those 8
equal pieces have I eaten?

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.110
Well, I've eaten 1, 2, 3,
4 of those 8 equal pieces.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.400
And so once again, this
fraction, 4 of 8, or 4/8,

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.230
is equivalent to 2/4,
which is equivalent to 1/2.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.780
And you might see a little
bit of a pattern here.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.580
Going from this scenario
to this scenario,

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.400
I got twice as
many equal slices.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.060
Because I had twice
as many equal slices,

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.810
I needed to eat two times
the number of slices.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.970
So I multiply the
denominator by 2,

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.370
and I multiply the
numerator by 2.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.820
If I multiply the numerator
and the denominator

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.510
by the same number,
then I'm not changing

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.860
what that fraction represents.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.640
And you see that over here.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.170
Going from 4 slices to 8
slices, I cut every slice,

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.140
I turned every slice
into 2 more slices,

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.401
so I had twice as many slices.

00:03:59.401 --> 00:04:01.150
And then if I want to
eat the same amount,

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:07.020
I have to eat twice
as many pieces.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.590
So all of these, 1/2, 2/4, four
4/8, and I could keep going.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.520
I could do 8/16.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.170
I could do 16/32.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.262
All of these would be
equivalent fractions.
