00:00:04.737 --> 00:00:05.838 align:start position:0% line:85%
BRING IT UP!

00:00:05.871 --> 00:00:06.806 align:start position:0% line:85%
THANK YOU!

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.175 align:start position:0% line:85%
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:09.709 align:start position:0% line:85%
CALM DOWN!

00:00:09.742 --> 00:00:13.446 align:start position:0% line:85%
THANK YOU, THANK YOU!

I AM SO EXCITED TO BE HERE.

00:00:15.114 --> 00:00:16.783 align:start position:0% line:85%
MAN, SO EXCITING.

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:19.886 align:start position:0% line:91%
I FEEL LIKE THERE'S SO MUCH TO
TALK ABOUT.

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:23.523 align:start position:0% line:91%
ESPECIALLY IF I HAD THE SHOW A
YEAR AGO!

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:26.225 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
ALL OF THE GOOD BAD RACE STUFF

00:00:26.258 --> 00:00:28.261 align:start position:0% line:85%
HAPPENED ALREADY!

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:28.995 align:start position:0% line:85%
THERE'S NONE LEFT.

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:31.931 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE'RE DONE.

00:00:31.964 --> 00:00:35.068 size:88% position:44% line:85%
HAPPY M.L.K. DAY, EVERYBODY!

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:40.773 line:91%
ACTUALLY, WAIT, THERE'S A 2015
INJUSTICE THAT'S BUGGING ME.

00:00:40.806 --> 00:00:42.508 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'M TALKING, OF COURSE, ABOUT
THE OSCAR NOMINATIONS.

00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:45.178 align:start position:0% line:85%
OR LACK THEREOF.

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.947 align:start position:0% line:91%
A VERY POWERFUL MOTION PICTURE
WAS SNUBBED.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.216 align:start position:0% line:91%
THIS FILM'S MESSAGE IS AS
POIGNANT TODAY AS IT WOULD HAVE

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:53.419 align:start position:0% line:85%
BEEN WHEN I WAS A KID.

00:00:53.452 --> 00:00:57.790 align:start position:0% line:91%
("EVERYTHING IS AWESOME" SONG
FROM THE LEGO MOVIE)

00:00:57.823 --> 00:01:00.159 align:start position:0% line:91%

00:01:00.192 --> 00:01:02.228 align:start position:0% line:91%

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:06.766 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: NO, EVERYTHING IS
NOT AWESOME!

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.235 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
HOW DID THE LEGO MOVIE NOT GET
NOMINATED FOR BEST PICTURE?

00:01:09.268 --> 00:01:12.638 align:start position:0% line:85%
GOD, THIS WAS SHOCKING!

00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:14.774 align:start position:0% line:91%
IN LESS SHOCKING NEWS, THIS ALSO
HAPPENED.

00:01:14.807 --> 00:01:17.610 line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHILE THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVIE
"SELMA" EARNED A BEST PICTURE

00:01:17.643 --> 00:01:21.714 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOMINATION, DIRECTOR AVA
DUVERNAY WAS SNUBBED.

00:01:21.747 --> 00:01:23.249 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SO WAS LEAD ACTOR DAVID
OYELOWO.

00:01:23.282 --> 00:01:25.351 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OH, BLACK PEOPLE
DIDN'T GET NOMINATED FOR AN

00:01:25.384 --> 00:01:28.588 align:start position:0% line:85%
OSCAR?

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:31.357 align:start position:0% line:85%
YEAH, I'M MAD, I GUESS.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.893 align:start position:0% line:85%
DON'T GET ME WRONG.

00:01:33.926 --> 00:01:35.995 line:91%
AVA DUVERNAY SHOULD DEFINITELY
HAVE BEEN NOMINATED FOR BEST

00:01:36.028 --> 00:01:38.331 align:start position:0% line:85%
DIRECTOR.

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:40.299 align:start position:0% line:85%
BUT DAVID OYELOWO?

00:01:40.332 --> 00:01:47.940 align:start position:0% line:91%
HE'S A BRITISH BROTHER. I DON'T
REALLY CARE ABOUT THEM

00:01:47.973 --> 00:01:52.912 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO WHAT DO WE AS A PEOPLE NEED
TO DO?

00:01:52.945 --> 00:01:54.480 align:start position:0% line:91%
I WISH THERE WERE A BLACK
HOLLYWOOD EXPERT WHO COULD GO TO

00:01:54.513 --> 00:01:59.785 align:start position:0% line:85%
BAT FOR US.

00:01:59.818 --> 00:02:01.654 line:91%
&gt;&gt; REVEREND SHARPTON CALLED FOR
AN EMERGENCY MEETING HERE IN

00:02:01.687 --> 00:02:04.190 align:start position:0% line:91%
HOLLYWOOD NEXT WEEK TO DISCUSS
POSSIBLE ACTION AROUND THE

00:02:04.223 --> 00:02:06.092 align:start position:0% line:85%
ACADEMY AWARDS.

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:08.327 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: SHARPTON?

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.565 align:start position:0% line:85%
AGAIN?

00:02:12.598 --> 00:02:14.467 line:85%
NO ONE ELSE CAN REPRESENT US?

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.369 align:start position:0% line:85%
LOOK, AL, SLOW DOWN.

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:19.238 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU DON'T HAVE TO RESPOND TO
EVERY BLACK EMERGENCY.

00:02:19.271 --> 00:02:24.810 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU'RE NOT BLACK BATMAN OR OUR
RACIAL FIRE CHIEF.

00:02:24.843 --> 00:02:27.046 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'M BEGINNING TO THINK A TYPICAL
DAY AT AL SHARPTON'S OFFICE

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.750 align:start position:0% line:85%
LOOKS LIKE THIS.

00:02:30.783 --> 00:02:32.752 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:35.888 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE GOT ONE!

00:02:35.921 --> 00:02:40.426 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; Larry: TRUE.

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:41.093 align:start position:0% line:85%
TRUE.

00:02:41.127 --> 00:02:42.261 line:85%
LOOK AT YOURSELF, AL SHARPTON.

00:02:42.294 --> 00:02:43.996 align:start position:0% line:91%
I APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS, PUT
YOU'RE LITERALLY STRETCHING

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:46.699 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOURSELF THIN.

00:02:46.732 --> 00:02:53.773 align:start position:0% line:85%
TAKE A BREAK, MAN.

00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:54.373 align:start position:0% line:85%
SERIOUSLY.

00:02:54.407 --> 00:02:56.576 size:81% position:41% line:85%
THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:57.410 align:start position:0% line:85%
AL,

00:02:57.443 --> 00:02:58.177 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU NEED TO EAT FOOD.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.614 align:start position:0% line:85%
NOT JUST AIR TIME.

00:03:01.647 --> 00:03:02.582 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:03.683 align:start position:0% line:91%
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS JUST
DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT.

00:03:03.716 --> 00:03:05.651 align:start position:0% line:91%
ARE WE PROTESTING TOO MANY
THINGS HERE?

00:03:05.684 --> 00:03:09.088 align:start position:0% line:91%
SINCE IT'S M.L.K. DAY, AND SINCE
HE'S THE PATRON SAINT OF

00:03:09.121 --> 00:03:13.292 align:start position:0% line:91%
NON-VIOLENT PROTESTERS -- SUCK
IT, GANDHI!  --

00:03:13.325 --> 00:03:16.729 line:91%
WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE
STATE OF THE BLACK PROTEST.

00:03:16.762 --> 00:03:19.498 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND THERE WERE A LOT OF THEM
THIS YEAR.

00:03:19.531 --> 00:03:22.535 line:91%
THERE WAS THE FERGUSON PROTEST,
THE GARNER PROTEST, AND THEN THE

00:03:22.568 --> 00:03:26.138 align:start position:0% line:91%
NYPD PROTEST OF THE HANDLING OF
THAT PROTEST.

00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:29.742 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEN THERE WAS A BLACK BRUNCH
PROTEST.

00:03:29.775 --> 00:03:32.878 align:start position:0% line:91%
YESTERDAY IN OAKLAND, PEOPLE
WERE PROTESTING POLICE VIOLENCE.

00:03:32.911 --> 00:03:34.580 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND EVEN AS I SPEAK TONIGHT,
THERE'S A DEMONSTRATION GOING ON

00:03:34.613 --> 00:03:37.350 align:start position:0% line:91%
IN GRAND CENTRAL STATION,
BECAUSE THERE'S NO BETTER WAY TO

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:40.319 line:91%
WIN THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF
WHITE PEOPLE THAN MAKING THEM

00:03:40.352 --> 00:03:44.290 line:85%
MISS THEIR TRAIN TO CONNECTICUT.

00:03:44.323 --> 00:03:50.563 align:start position:0% line:91%
(APPLAUSE)
&gt;&gt; Larry: IT'S TRUE!

00:03:50.596 --> 00:03:53.566 align:start position:0% line:85%
THEY HATE THAT (BLEEP)!

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.037 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
NO, I GET IT.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.038 size:88% position:44% line:85%
SOME PEOPLE ARE DISCOURAGED.

00:03:59.071 --> 00:04:00.640 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY THINK PROTESTS DON'T WORK
ANYMORE.

00:04:00.673 --> 00:04:01.540 align:start position:0% line:85%
BUT PROTESTS CAN WORK.

00:04:01.573 --> 00:04:02.641 line:85%
LET ME GIVE YOU A FEW EXAMPLES.

00:04:02.674 --> 00:04:05.144 size:84% position:42% line:91%
400,000 PEOPLE MARCHED IN
NEW YORK TO PROTEST CLIMATE

00:04:05.177 --> 00:04:07.546 align:start position:0% line:91%
CHANGE IN SEPTEMBER, AND IT
SUCCEEDED AS AMERICA AND CHINA

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.049 align:start position:0% line:91%
SIGNED A CLIMATE ACCORD A FEW
MONTHS LATER.

00:04:10.082 --> 00:04:12.652 align:start position:0% line:85%
WOW.

00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:17.823 size:81% position:41% line:85%
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD, RIGHT?

00:04:17.856 --> 00:04:22.828 align:start position:0% line:91%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I MEAN, MORE POWER TO THESE

00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:24.563 line:91%
FOLKS BECAUSE IF WE DON'T FIGURE
THIS OUT, THEN IT WON'T JUST BE

00:04:24.596 --> 00:04:30.169 align:start position:0% line:91%
BLACK PEOPLE SAYING "I CAN'T
BREATHE."

00:04:30.202 --> 00:04:33.773 align:start position:0% line:91%
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
OH, TOO SOON?

00:04:33.806 --> 00:04:35.574 align:start position:0% line:85%
TOO SOON?

00:04:35.607 --> 00:04:40.680 align:start position:0% line:91%
YEAH, I CHOKED HIM, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

00:04:40.713 --> 00:04:42.715 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND DON'T FORGET THE
MINIMUM-WAGE PROTEST LAST YEAR.

00:04:42.748 --> 00:04:44.483 line:91%
FAST FOOD WORKERS TOOK TO THE
STREETS DEMANDING A RAISE IN

00:04:44.516 --> 00:04:45.517 align:start position:0% line:85%
THEIR PAY...

00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:46.886 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND IT WORKED -- THE
MINIMUM-WAGE ROSE IN 21 STATES

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.654 line:91%
TO START THE NEW YEAR, LEAVING
UNDERPAID CHIPOTLE EMPLOYEES

00:04:48.687 --> 00:04:53.426 align:start position:0% line:91%
MUCH CLOSER TO ONE DAY BEING
ABLE TO AFFORD CHIPOTLE.

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:55.761 align:start position:0% line:91%
ONE DAY, GUYS, IT'S COMING ONE
DAY.

00:04:55.794 --> 00:05:01.767 line:85%
DON'T TRY TO GET IT ALL AT ONCE.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.969 line:91%
AND FINALLY, GUYS, THIS IS THE
MOST AMAZING PROTEST OF THEM

00:05:04.002 --> 00:05:05.905 line:85%
ALL, AND I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP.

00:05:05.938 --> 00:05:11.977 line:91%
THE ORGANIZATION "HARRY POTTER
ALLIANCE" WAGED A FIGHT WITH

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.414 line:91%
WARNER BROTHERS TO ENSURE THAT
ALL CHOCOLATE SOLD WITH HARRY

00:05:15.447 --> 00:05:24.090 size:88% position:44% line:91%
POTTER'S LIKENESS WAS FAIR
TRADE, AND EVEN THAT WORKED!

00:05:24.123 --> 00:05:24.457 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHAT?

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.825 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT WORKED!

00:05:25.858 --> 00:05:30.930 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND I HAVE TO SAY, AS HAPPY AS I
AM FOR THE

00:05:30.963 --> 00:05:32.932 line:91%
GRYFFINDOR WIN, AFTER FERGUSON
AND GARNER, IT BUGS ME A LITTLE

00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:38.304 align:start position:0% line:91%
BIT THAT IN 2014 THIS IS THE
ONLY CHOCOLATE THAT GOT JUSTICE.

00:05:38.337 --> 00:05:47.580 align:start position:0% line:91%
(APPLAUSE)
BUT MY POINT IS, IT SUCCEEDED.

00:05:47.613 --> 00:05:50.349 align:start position:0% line:85%
SO THEY CAN WORK!

00:05:50.382 --> 00:05:53.586 align:start position:0% line:91%
LET'S LOOK AT THE REAL
SITUATION.

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:58.691 align:start position:0% line:91%
MANY CRITICS CALLED THE RECENT
BLACK PROTESTS UNFOCUSED.

00:05:58.724 --> 00:05:59.325 size:81% position:41% line:85%
I WON'T MENTION ANY NAMES.

00:05:59.358 --> 00:06:00.926 align:start position:0% line:91%
(COUGHS)
OPRAH.

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:01.727 align:start position:0% line:85%
SORRY.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.132 align:start position:0% line:91%
I HAD SOMETHING STUCK IN MY
STEDMAN.

00:06:06.165 --> 00:06:11.670 line:91%
NOT CALLING ANYBODY OUT, BUT IN
FAIRNESS IT'S NOT COMPLETELY

00:06:11.703 --> 00:06:12.871 align:start position:0% line:85%
INACCURATE.

00:06:12.904 --> 00:06:13.639 line:91%
YOU SEE, IT'S NOT THAT THESE
PROTESTS ARE LESS FOCUSED, IT'S

00:06:13.672 --> 00:06:15.174 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT THE GOALS ARE LESS
TANGIBLE.

00:06:15.207 --> 00:06:18.544 line:91%
IN THE OLD DAYS, IT WAS ABOUT
BEING ABLE TO SIT AT A LUNCH

00:06:18.577 --> 00:06:20.346 align:start position:0% line:91%
COUNTER OR GOING TO THE SAME
SCHOOLS OR EVEN VOTING.

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:22.148 line:91%
TODAY WE'RE JUST TRYING TO NOT
GET SHOT ON OUR WAY TO WORK.

00:06:22.181 --> 00:06:26.752 line:91%
NOW LOOK, I KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE
I'M EXAGGERATING AND PEOPLE MAY

00:06:26.785 --> 00:06:32.057 line:91%
THINK, "LARRY, CALM DOWN, POLICE
AREN'T TARGETING BLACK GUYS ."

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.560 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY, ROLL 122.

00:06:34.593 --> 00:06:37.563 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; TONIGHT, A SOUTH FLORIDA
FAMILY IS OUTRAGED BY THIS IMAGE

00:06:37.596 --> 00:06:39.732 align:start position:0% line:85%
RIGHT HERE AND OTHERS.

00:06:39.765 --> 00:06:43.102 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY SAY NORTH MIAMI BEACH
POLICE USED IT AND THE IMAGES OF

00:06:43.135 --> 00:06:47.706 align:start position:0% line:91%
FIVE OTHER MINORITIES AS TARGETS
DURING WEAPONS TRAINING.

00:06:47.739 --> 00:06:49.642 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; PEOPLE THAT ARE OUT THERE
SUPPOSED TO BE PROTECTING US ARE

00:06:49.675 --> 00:06:51.444 size:88% position:44% line:85%
USING US AS TARGET PRACTICE.

00:06:51.477 --> 00:06:53.813 size:75% position:38% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT STORY WAS
REPORTED WAY BACK IN...

00:06:53.846 --> 00:06:58.918 align:start position:0% line:85%
TODAY.

00:06:58.951 --> 00:06:59.719 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY?

00:06:59.752 --> 00:07:01.287 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
THE POLICE IN FLORIDA ARE

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.590 size:84% position:42% line:91%
LITERALLY USING PICTURES OF
YOUNG BLACK MEN AS TARGETS!

00:07:04.623 --> 00:07:06.292 size:88% position:44% line:91%
HOW CAN WE SEE THAT AND BE
SURPRISED WHEN IT HAPPENS IN

00:07:06.325 --> 00:07:08.027 align:start position:0% line:85%
REAL LIFE?

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.296 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'M NOT SURPRISED WHEN KOBE HITS
A JUMPER.

00:07:10.329 --> 00:07:14.533 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT DUDE PRACTICES!

00:07:14.566 --> 00:07:15.899 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
