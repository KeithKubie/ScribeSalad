00:00:00.112 --> 00:00:02.479
Welcome to unit 2. It's good to see you again.

00:00:02.479 --> 00:00:05.977
In the last unit you learned about the fundamentals of the GPU programming model

00:00:05.977 --> 00:00:08.787
and the basics of writing a simple program using CUDA.

00:00:08.787 --> 00:00:10.686
In this unit we're going to build off of that.

00:00:10.686 --> 00:00:15.218
We'll learn about important parallel communication patterns like scatter and gather and stencil.

00:00:15.218 --> 00:00:18.126
And we'll dive a little deeper into the GPU hardware

00:00:18.126 --> 00:00:20.757
and learn about things like global memory and shared memory,

00:00:20.757 --> 00:00:23.793
and we'll put these together to learn how to write efficient GPU programs.
