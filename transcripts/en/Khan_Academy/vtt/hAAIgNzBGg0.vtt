00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:01.770
Now ready for part b.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.200
And I've wiped all the
salt off of my fingers,

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.450
and I've had a glass of water.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.360
So now I'm ready
for some business.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.640
Find the second derivative
of W with respect

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.290
to t in terms of W. Use
this second derivative

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.880
to determine whether your answer
in part a is an underestimate

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.620
or overestimate for the
amount of solid waste

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.490
that the landfill contains
at time t equals 1/4.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.100
So let's do the
first things first.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.440
Let's find the second
derivative in terms of W.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.627
And we already have the
first derivative over here.

00:00:32.627 --> 00:00:34.960
And in part a, I rewrote it
just with slightly different

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:35.497
notation.

00:00:35.497 --> 00:00:37.830
But I'll just use this just
because I need to write down

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.996
here and I can still
refer to this thing.

00:00:39.996 --> 00:00:41.370
So let's just take
the derivative

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.350
of both sides of this
differential equation

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.990
with respect to t.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.160
So you take the derivative
of this left-hand side

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.180
with respect to t, you
get the second derivative

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:57.070
of W with respect to t as a
function of t is equal to-- now

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.570
you take the derivative
of this with respect to t.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.220
This is the same thing
as 1/25Wt minus 12.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.720
And so when you
take the derivative,

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.620
that constant part drops
off, and you're just

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:15.872
left with 1/25 times
the derivative of Wt.

00:01:15.872 --> 00:01:16.830
Let me make that clear.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:26.950
This is the same thing as 1/25W
as a function of t minus 12.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.370
1/25 of 300 is 12.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.910
And you take the
derivative of this,

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.810
you get 1/25 times the
first derivative of W

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.710
and then the derivative of this
with respect to t is just 0.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.710
A constant, obviously, does
not change with respect to t.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.445
And so we get this
right over here.

00:01:41.445 --> 00:01:42.820
Now this is the
second derivative

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.072
in terms of the
first derivative.

00:01:45.072 --> 00:01:47.280
But the question asks us,
write the second derivative

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.260
in terms of W. But
lucky for us, we

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.950
know how to express
this as a function of W.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.036
They gave that to
us in the problem.

00:01:57.036 --> 00:01:57.660
This was given.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.159
This is just me rewriting
it in a different notation.

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:01.700
So this is going to
be the same thing

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:09.710
as 1/25 times the derivative
of W. And the derivative of W

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:10.462
is this.

00:02:10.462 --> 00:02:11.920
The differential
equation literally

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.030
tell us the derivative
of W is this over here.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:22.940
So 1 over 25 times Wt, the
function W as a function of t,

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.510
minus 300.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.327
And so we can say the
second derivative--

00:02:29.327 --> 00:02:31.660
let me write it a little
smaller so I don't waste space.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.460
The second derivative
of W as a function of t

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:42.840
is equal to 1/625 times
W as a function of t,

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.110
which is a function
of t, minus 300.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.650
So we've done the first part.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.710
We've found out the
second derivative of W

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.160
in terms of just W.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.980
Now let's try to address the
second part of their question.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.660
So we did the first part.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.220
Now use what we just
figured out to determine

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.505
whether your answer in
part a is an underestimate

00:03:02.505 --> 00:03:05.490
or an overestimate of
the amount of solid waste

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.000
that the landfill
contains at time 1/4.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.090
So in part a, we
found the slope.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.360
We found the slope of the
tangent line at time equals 0,

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.010
and we used that slope
to extrapolate out

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.070
to 3 months, or time
equals 1/4, 1/4 of a year.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.780
Now if the function
W's slope over that 1/4

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.340
was exactly the same as the
slope of the tangent line,

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.780
or if that slope did not
change, then our extrapolation

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.480
would be exactly right.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.330
If W's slope is
increasing over that time,

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.160
then our estimate would
be an underestimate

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.470
of the correct thing.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.900
And if the slope is
decreasing over that time,

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.990
then our estimate would
be an overestimate

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.079
of the actual amount
in the landfill.

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.120
And to figure out whether
the slope is increasing

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.690
or decreasing, we
just have to look

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.070
at the value of the
second derivative.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.300
If the second
derivative is positive,

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.264
that means our
slope is increasing,

00:03:57.264 --> 00:03:58.930
which means that our
extrapolation would

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:59.997
be an understatement.

00:03:59.997 --> 00:04:01.080
Let me just be clear here.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.380
Let me draw this.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.500
Let me make it very clear.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.510
So let me just draw
a random function.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.760
So let's say that's W. So this
is a case where W's slope is

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.899
increasing faster,
or W's slope is

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:18.709
increasing from
that starting point.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.990
So our starting point--
this was our slope.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:24.060
And then W's slope keeps
increasing from there.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.640
And in this case,
our estimate is

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.900
going to be underestimate
of where W actually

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.840
is after 1/4 of the year.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.230
If W's slope is exactly the same
as our function over the course

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.470
of the first three months, it
would look something like that.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.300
Maybe it diverges later on.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.490
And in this case,
our approximation

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:44.850
would be really good.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.380
It would probably
be exact for W.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.010
And if W's slope,
for whatever reason,

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.160
goes negative after that point,
and they already tells us

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.170
it's an increasing function,
so that is not likely.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.580
Or it could-- it doesn't
have to even go negative.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.139
If W's slope decreases, it
could still stay positive.

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:05.430
And the way I drew it, it
doesn't-- let me draw it like

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.690
this, just to make it clear.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.670
So let's say we find out that
the slope looks something

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.790
like this.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.380
This is the slope of the
tangent line at time equals 0.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.000
If W's slope increases
from that point,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.440
then w might look
something like that.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.970
And then our answer to part
a would be an understatement,

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.500
would be an underestimate
of where W actually

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.930
is after a fourth of a year.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.140
Let me draw it and make it
clear to you what I'm doing.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.970
So this is my w-axis.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.320
So this is right at our
initial condition of 1,400.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.350
And then this right over
here is our time axis,

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.120
and this is that 1/4.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.960
So in the last
video, we said, hey,

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.200
this is sitting right at 1,411.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.660
If W's slope increases
from that point,

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.040
then this is an underestimate.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.540
If W's slope stays
the same, then this

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.880
is actually a very good
estimate because then we're

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.950
going to hit that
point directly with W.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.160
And if W's slope decreases--
so you can imagine maybe

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.920
W looks something like this.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.480
It has that slope of the
tangent line when it starts,

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.630
but then the slope decreases.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.280
And it's still an
increasing function,

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.446
but the slope is decreasing.

00:06:19.446 --> 00:06:23.580
And in that case, we would
have an overestimate.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.220
And this is a situation--
so this first situation,

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.490
slope is increasing.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:34.051
That means W prime
prime is positive.

00:06:34.051 --> 00:06:35.050
The slope is increasing.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.270
The second derivative
is positive.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.830
This would be a
byproduct of or this

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.590
would cause the second
derivative to be negative.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.500
Our slope is decreasing.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.520
And this would be our
second derivative.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.130
Our second derivative is 0.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.089
If your slope isn't changing--
if your slope is constant,

00:06:53.089 --> 00:06:54.630
if your first
derivative is constant,

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.360
your second derivative
is going to be 0.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.880
So let's just see what
our second derivative is

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.600
at our initial
condition, and then we'll

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.391
have a pretty good
sense of whether we have

00:07:03.391 --> 00:07:06.300
an overestimate or an
underestimate for part a.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.830
So let's just figure out
what our second derivative

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.790
at time 0.

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:17.880
It's going to be equal to 1/625
times W of 0, which we know,

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.670
minus 300.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.690
Well W of 0, the amount of
waste we have at time 0,

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.830
they told us in the
problem, is 1,400 tons.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.940
1,400 minus 1,300 is 1,100.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.970
And then 1,100 minus--
or 1,100 divided by 625

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.010
is a small number.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:35.580
It's 1.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:36.250
something.

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:37.900
But it is a positive number.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.910
And that's the
important thing here.

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:44.770
So this thing, all of this
business, it is positive.

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:47.130
So the second
derivative is positive,

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:49.040
which means the
slope is increasing.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:53.220
At least right at our starting
point, our slope is increasing.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.875
Since our slope is increasing
from that point-- and frankly,

00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:57.375
the fact that it's
increasing at all

00:07:57.375 --> 00:07:59.810
and that we know the W is
an increasing function--

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:04.220
tells us that our estimate in
part a is an underestimate.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.290
So this is the case
that we're dealing with.

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:11.910
So our estimate in part
a is an underestimate

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:15.300
of the actual amount of solid
waste in the landfill at time t

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.009
equals 1/4.
