00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.780
 

00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.640
Let's review a little bit of
what we had learned many, many

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.640
videos ago about gravitational
potential energy and then see

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.005
if we can draw the analogy,
which is actually very strong,

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:12.640
to electrical potential
energy.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.380
So what do we know about

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.660
gravitational potential energy?

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.930
If we said this was the surface
of the Earth-- we

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.390
don't have to be on Earth, but
it makes visualization easy.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.460
We could be anywhere that has
gravity, and the potential

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.850
energy would be due to the
gravitational field of that

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.800
particular mass, but let's
say this is the

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.500
surface of the Earth.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.270
We learned that if we have some
mass m up here and that

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.610
the gravitational field at this
area-- or at least the

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.770
gravitational acceleration-- is
g, or 9.8 meters per second

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.775
squared, and it is h-- we could
say, I guess, meters,

00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:52.070
but we could use any units.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.690
Let's say it is h meters above
the ground, that the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.900
gravitational potential energy
of this object at that point

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.340
is equal to the mass times the
acceleration of gravity times

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:11.870
the height, or you could view
it as the force of gravity,

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.550
the magnitude of the
force of gravity.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.172
You know, it's a vector, but
we can say the magnitude of

00:01:15.172 --> 00:01:19.790
the vector times height.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.250
And so what is potential
energy?

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.010
Well, we know that if something
has potential energy

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.740
and if nothing is stopping it
and we just let go, that

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.580
energy, at least with
gravitational potential

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.840
energy, the object will start
accelerating downwards, and a

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.350
lot of that potential energy,
and eventually all of it, will

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.990
be converted to kinetic
energy.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.730
So potential energy is energy
that is being stored by an

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.180
object's situation or kind of
this notional energy that an

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.530
object has by virtue
of where it is.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.550
So in order for something to
have this notional energy,

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.200
some energy must have
been put into it.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.700
And as we learned with
gravitational potential

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.600
energy, you could view
gravitational potential energy

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.780
as the work necessary to move
an object to that position.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.840
Now, if we're talking about work
to move something into

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.050
that position, or whatever, we
always have to think about,

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.000
well, move it from where?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.720
Well, when we talk about
gravitational potential

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.610
energy, we're talking about
moving it from the surface of

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.990
the Earth, right?

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.180
And so how much work is required
to move that same

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.040
mass-- let's say it was here at
first-- to move it from a

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.140
height of zero to
a height of h?

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.950
Well, the whole time, the
Earth, or the force of

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.940
gravity, is going to
be F sub g, right?

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.890
So essentially, if I'm pulling
it or pushing it upwards, I'm

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.670
going to have to have-- and
let's say at a constant

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.130
velocity-- I'm going to have to
have an equal and opposite

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.940
force to its weight
to pull it up.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.240
Otherwise, it would accelerate
downwards.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.870
I'd have to do a little bit more
just to get it moving, to

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.510
accelerate it however much, but
then once I get it just

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.510
accelerating, essentially I
would have to apply an upward

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.830
force, which is equivalent to
the downward force of gravity,

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.110
and I would do it for a
distance of h, right?

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.720
What is work?

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.850
Work is just force
times distance.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.850
Force times distance, and it
has to be force in the

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.860
direction of the distance.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.650
So what's the work necessary
to get this mass up here?

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:25.370
Well, the work is equal to the
force of gravity times height,

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.620
so it's equal to the

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.870
gravitational potential energy.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.110
Now this is an interesting
thing.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.550
Notice we picked the reference
point as the surface of the

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.470
Earth, but we could
have picked any

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.620
arbitrary reference point.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.900
We could have said, well, from
10 meters below the surface of

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.170
the Earth, which could have been
down here, or we could

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.410
have actually said, you know,
from a platform that's 5

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.156
meters above the Earth.

00:03:47.156 --> 00:03:50.520
So it actually turns out, when
you think of it that way, that

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.980
potential energy of any form,
but especially gravitational

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.400
potential energy-- and we'll
see electrical potential

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.430
energy-- it's always in
reference to some other point,

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.800
so it's really a change in
potential energy that matters.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.490
And I know when we studied
potential energy, it seemed

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.620
like there was kind of an
absolute potential energy, but

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.720
that's because we always assume
that the potential

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.710
energy of something is zero the
surface of the Earth and

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.210
that we want to know the
potential energy relative to

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.459
the surface of the Earth, so it
would be kind of, you know,

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.440
how much work does it take to
take something from the

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.440
surface of the Earth
to that height?

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.710
But really, we should be saying,
well, the potential

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.320
energy of gravity-- like this
statement shouldn't be, you

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.480
know, this is just the absolute

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.890
potential energy of gravity.

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.330
We should say this is the
potential energy of gravity

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.230
relative to the surface of the
Earth is equal to the work

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.420
necessary to move something, to
move that same mass, from

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.780
the surface of the Earth to
its current position.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.630
We could have defined some other
term that is not really

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.520
used, but we could have said
potential energy of gravity

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.310
relative to minus 5 meters
below the surface of the

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.080
Earth, and that would be the
work necessary to move

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.070
something from minus 5 meters
to its current height.

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.130
And, of course, that
might matter.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.500
What if we cut up a hole and
we want to see what is the

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.350
kinetic energy here?

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.520
Well, then that potential
energy would matter.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.170
Anyway, so I just wanted to do
this review of potential

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:22.960
energy because now it'll make
the jump to electrical

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.890
potential energy all that
easier, because you'll

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.380
actually see it's pretty
much the same thing.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.170
It's just the source of the
field and the source of the

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.630
potential is something
different.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.570
 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.550
So electrical potential energy,
just actually we know

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.270
that gravitational fields are
not constant, we can assume

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.140
they're constant maybe near the
surface of the Earth and

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.770
all that, but we also know that
electrical fields aren't

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.180
constant, and actually they
have very similar formulas.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.720
But just for the simplicity of
explaining it, let's assume a

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.900
constant electric field.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.190
And if you don't believe me that
one can be constructed,

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.620
you should watch my videos that
involve a reasonable bit

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.930
of calculus that show that a
uniform electric field can be

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:12.520
generated by an infinite
uniformly charged plane.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:18.210
Let's say this is the side view
of an infinite uniformly

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.960
charged plane and let's
say that this

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.700
is positively charged.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.480
 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.490
Of course, you can never get
a proper side view of an

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.370
infinite plane, because you
can never kind of cut it,

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.390
because it's infinite in every
direction, but let's say that

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.890
this one is and this
is the side view.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.560
So first of all, let's think
about its electric field.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.230
It's electric field is going to
point upward, and how do we

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.740
know it points upward?

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.450
Because the electric field is
essentially what is-- and this

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:47.530
is just a convention.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.330
What would a positive charge
do in the field?

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.090
Well, if this plate is positive,
a positive charge,

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.530
we're going to want to
get away from it.

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.440
So we know the electric field
points upward and we know that

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.360
it's constant, that if these
were field vectors, that

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.510
they're going to be the same
size, no matter how far away

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:07.240
we get from the source
of the field.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.310
And I'm just going to pick
a number for the

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:10.050
strength of the field.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:15.050
We actually proved in those
fancy videos that I made on

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.340
the uniform electric field of an
infinite, uniformly charged

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.010
plane that we actually proved
how you could calculate it.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:28.130
But let's just say that this
electric field is equal to 5

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:29.060
newtons per coulomb.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.700
That's actually quite strong,
but it makes the math easy.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:38.020
So my question to you is how
much work does it take to take

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:42.280
a positive point charge-- let
me pick a different color.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.340
 

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.200
Let's say this is the
starting position.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.770
It's a positive 2 coulombs.

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:55.440
Once again, that's a massive
point charge, but

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.700
we want easy numbers.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:04.950
How much work does it take it to
move that 2-coulomb charge

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:09.240
3 meters within this field?

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:09.830
How much work?

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.510
So we're going to start here
and we're going to move it

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:15.110
down towards the plate 3
meters, and it's ending

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:18.120
position is going to be
right here, right?

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.300
That's when it's done.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.790
How much work does that take?

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:25.600
Well, what is the force of
the field right here?

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:30.430
What is the force exerted on
this 2-coulomb charge?

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:34.840
Well, electric field is just
force per charge, right?

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.950
So if you want to know the force
of the field at that

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:41.570
point-- let me draw that
in a different color.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:46.090
The force of the field acting on
it, so let's say the field

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:51.010
force, or the force of the
field, actually, is going to

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:57.040
be equal to 5 newtons per
coulomb times 2 coulombs,

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.590
which is equal to 10 newtons.

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:00.160
We know it's going to be upward,
because this is a

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:04.090
positive charge, and this is a
positively charged infinite

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:07.960
plate, so we know this is an
upward force of 10 newtons.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:12.190
So in order to get this charge,
to pull it down or to

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:14.710
push it down here, we
essentially have to exert a

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:17.690
force of 10 newtons
downwards, right?

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.800
Exert a force of 10 newtons in
the direction of the movement.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.610
And, of course, just like we did
with gravity, we have to

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.820
maybe do a little bit more than
that just to accelerate

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:27.985
it a little bit just so you have
some net downward force,

00:09:27.985 --> 00:09:31.020
but once you do, you just have
to completely balance the

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:31.920
upward force.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.930
So just for our purposes, you
have a 10-newton force

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:38.110
downward and you apply that
force for a distance of 3

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:41.870
meters, the work that you put to
take this 2-coulomb charge

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:49.050
from here to here, the work
is going to be equal to 10

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:53.850
newtons-- that's the force--
times 3 meters.

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:58.350
So the work is going to equal
30 newton-meters, which is

00:09:58.350 --> 00:09:59.920
equal to 30 joules.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.540
A joule is just a
newton-meter.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:07.000
And so we can now say since it
took us 30 joules of energy to

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.810
move this charge from here to
here, that within this uniform

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:18.650
electric field, the potential
energy of the charge here is

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:21.880
relative to the charge here.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.400
You always have to pick a point
relative to where the

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.600
potential is, so the electrical
potential energy

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:35.310
here relative to here and this
is electrical potential

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:41.690
energy, and you could say P2
relative to P1-- I'm using my

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.140
made-up notation, but that gives
you a sense of what it

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:50.830
is-- is equal to 30 joules.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:51.870
And how could that help us?

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:54.680
Well, if we also knew the mass--
let's say that this

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.930
charge had some mass.

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:02.690
We would know that if we let go
of this object, by the time

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:06.000
it got here, that 30 joules
would be-- essentially

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.600
assuming that none of it got
transmitted to heat or

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.180
resistance or whatever-- we know
that all of it would be

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.200
kinetic energy at this point.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.870
So actually, we could
work it out.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:24.090
Let's say that this does have
a mass of 1 kilogram and we

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:27.210
were to just let go
of it, right?

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:32.330
We used some force to bring it
down here, and then we let go.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.755
So we know that the electric
field is going to accelerate

00:11:34.755 --> 00:11:36.320
it upwards, right?

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.160
It's going to exert an upward
force of 5 newtons per

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.990
coulomb, and the thing's going
to keep [COUGHS]--

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:44.920
excuse me-- keep accelerating
until it gets

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.260
to this point, right?

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.290
What's its velocity going
to be at that point?

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:51.610
Well, all of this electrical
potential energy is going to

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.610
be converted to kinetic
energy.

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:57.970
So essentially, we have 30
joules is going to be equal to

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:01.040
1/2 mv squared, right?

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:05.450
We know the mass, I said, is 1,
so we get 60 is equal to v

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:09.250
squared, so the velocity is the
square root of 60, so it's

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:13.930
7 point something, something,
something meters per second.

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:16.930
So if I just pull that charge
down, and it has a mass of 1

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:20.070
kilogram, and I let go, it's
just going to accelerate and

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:22.120
be going pretty fast once
it gets to this point.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.785
Anyway, I'm 12 minutes into this
video, so I will continue

00:12:24.785 --> 00:12:27.270
in the next, but hopefully, that
gives you a sense of what

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:30.990
electrical potential energy
is, and really, it's no

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:32.970
different than gravitational
potential energy.

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:35.080
It's just the source of the
field is different.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.650
See you soon.

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:37.150
