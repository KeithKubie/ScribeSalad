00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.879
Hi. I'm Stan Muller, this is Crash Course
Intellectual Property, and today we're going

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:07.759
to be talking about copyright law. As you
might have guessed, the law of copyright relates

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:13.839
to the right to copy, the copy right as it relates
to copies of copyrightable works. You copy?

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:22.420
[Theme Music]

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.520
Right. So, the right to copy or reproduce
copyright protected works is only one of the

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.619
exclusive rights granted by the law of copyright.
We're also gonna discuss what types of things

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.079
can actually be copyrighted, what we call
the subject matter. But first, let's talk

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.359
a little bit about the history of copyright
law in the United States. Why the United States?

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.360
Not because the US is exceptional and not
because I'm a cultural imperialist trying

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.429
to erode the identity and fabric of foreign
nations. Mostly it's just because we're making

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:50.690
this video in the United States and copyright
law is territorial.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.999
So, in 1709, England passed the Statute of
Anne, which is widely considered to be the

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:58.920
first copyright law. The Statute of Anne was
the first law to grant ownership rights to

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.049
individual authors rather than to publishers
or printers. Throughout the 18th century,

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:07.630
several of the American colonies adopted copyright
and copyright-like laws based on the Statute

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.270
of Anne. The drafters of the US Constitution
inserted what is commonly called the intellectual

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.649
property clause in Article 1, Section 8, Clause
8 and reads, "The Congress shall have the

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:22.060
power to promote the progress of science and
useful arts by securing for limited times

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.000
to authors and inventors the exclusive rights
to their respective writings."

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.520
So listed right up there with Congress's power
to lay and collect taxes and to declare war

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.359
and gather armies is the power to promote
the progress of learning and knowledge through

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:38.450
the grant of a limited monopoly to authors
and inventors in the form of copyrights and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.030
patents. It is, without question, the coolest
of the Congressional powers. Stan, does that

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.079
seem biased? Oh, I'm Stan, oh, uh, Mark, does
that seem biased? No? Good. The law has undergone

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:53.039
several major revisions in the past 225 years,
and it's currently in the process of a major review.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.200
So let's talk about what types of works are
eligible for copyright protection and what

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.950
rights authors or owners have in those works.
Copyright law protects original works of authorship.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.400
Originality in the context of copyright means
only that the work owes its origin to the author.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.220
That is, it's independently created
and isn't copied from other works.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.250
How creative do these original works have
to be though? Not very, at all. For a work

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.750
to be copyrightable, there only needs to be
a minimal amount of creativity. Adult judges

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.570
in court have described in in court as a scintilla,
a dab, even a glimmer. So why is the bar for

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.220
creativity set so low? Well, it's because
lawmakers and judges probably aren't the best

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.720
people to decide what types of creative works
promote the progress of knowledge. Supreme

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.070
Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes said,
"It would be a dangerous undertaking for persons

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.930
trained only to the law to constitute themselves
judges of the worth of pictorial illustrations

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.880
outside of the narrowest and most obvious
limits." Holmes may have been speaking specifically

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.780
about pictorial illustrations in this case, but
the principle applies to any type of creative work.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.180
Anyway, Holmes clearly feels that judges
don't necessarily make the best art critics.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.660
So what does Holmes mean by "narrow and obvious
limits"? Well, words and short phrases like

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.200
names (John Green), titles (like The Fault
in Our Stars), slogans ("one sick love story"),

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.840
fonts, coloring, mere listings of ingredients
or contents, familiar symbols or designs (like

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.050
an 8-ball), none of this is protectable under
copyright law. Are they protected by any other

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.250
branch of intellectual property? Ask again
later.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.020
One quick note: In order for a work to be
protected by copyright, it need not in and

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.040
of itself promote the progress of science.
From literary novels to the most graphic pornography,

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.610
it's probably protectable. The courts have
concluded that it isn't a question of whether

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.370
a work promotes the progress of knowledge
but that all works are granted equal protection.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.400
In this way, the law encourages people to
create a diverse array of stuff. At the end

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.560
of the day, it's the system that promotes the
progress of science and not the individual works.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.260
Copyright law protects original works of authorship.
Works of authorship fall into any of the eight

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.680
categories that are listed in the copyright
act. Literary works are basically anything

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.310
that can be embodied by letters or numbers,
including novels, blogs, computer programs,

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.390
websites, databases, and possibly really creative
tweets. Musical works refers to the actual

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.480
musical notation of a song by say, T-Swizzy.
Sound recordings are the actual music embodied

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.650
in the record or the CD or an MP3 that extends
to things like audiobooks. That's what you

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.130
actually hear. Dramatic works, which are basically
stage productions like Wicked or Cats or Waiting

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.490
for Godot. Pantomimes and choreographic works.
Pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:26.100
Motion pictures, and even architectural works,
all of these are considered to be writings.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.940
Congress has indicated that this list isn't
exhaustive, and it's vague on purpose, because

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.410
humans are coming up with new ways to express
themselves all the time. Believe it or not,

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.520
this is not the apex of human creativity.
So imagining the Guggenheim or a mime routine

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.420
as writing can feel like a stretch. In order
for any of these works to be considered bona

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.040
fide writings in the Constitutional sense,
they must be fixed in any tangible medium

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.550
of expression, be that a book, an MP3, source
code, choreography, a blueprint, or whatever.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.330
The only requirement for a tangible medium
of expression is that we as humans either

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.560
on our own or by using a computer or some other device be able to perceive it in the form of a copy or record.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.800
This brings up a widely misunderstood aspect
of copyright: copyright protection extends

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.480
to the intangible material, the literary work,
not the physical copy of the work. You may

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.820
own the copy of the book, but you don't own
the copyright. Also, copyright extends only

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.790
to expression and not to ideas. If you come
up with a million dollar idea for the best

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.360
movie ever made or the greatest novel in history,
until you actually write these masterpieces

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.800
and fix them in a tangible medium, copyright
law doesn't protect you.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.770
And you can't copyright facts. Let's say you
do some research and discover that Matthias

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:37.590
Buchinger was born in Germany on June 3, 1674
without hands or legs. He was a famous artist,

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.380
calligrapher, and magician. He was called
"The Little Man of Nuremberg" and "The Greatest

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:46.480
German Living", and he was married four times,
fathered at least 14 children by eight different

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.080
women. Even if you spend your entire academic
career uncovering these fascinating facts,

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.140
facts alone aren't copyrightable. A biography
of Buchinger would qualify for copyright protection,

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.270
but only the narrative expression would qualify.
Subsequent biographers could use the facts

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.730
you uncovered in your research but would be
prohibited from expressing those facts using

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.840
your words. They'd have to make up their own.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.560
"Scènes à faire" or scenes that must be
done are not copyrightable either. These are

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.510
well-worn storylines like a pair of star-crossed
lovers from feuding families or fables or

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.450
folklore. This sounds to me like a cliche.
You can't copyright stuff like the idea of

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.090
a dastardly villain tying a damsel to a train
track.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.380
Finally, works created by the Federal Government
can't be copyrighted. That's why we can show

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.980
you this and this and this, no charge. Thanks,
federal employees!

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:34.669
So who can get a copyright? Well, according
to the 1976 Copyright Act, ownership initially

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:38.340
goes to the author or authors of the work.
One of the only limits to this rule is that

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.400
the individual author has to be a human being.
If the work is created by an entity other

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.280
than a human, like say a monkey or a mindless
automaton or an employee, that creator is

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.620
not an author. I'm kidding, okay? Employees
are humans, but that does bring us very nicely

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.600
to the idea of works made for hire. Let's
go to the Thought Bubble.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.710
So, if your boss tells you to create something,
then your boss or the company you both work

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.600
for, is considered to be the author of that
something. A work made for hire can be a work

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.020
prepared by an employee within the scope of
his/her employment, or certain works that

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.880
are specially ordered or commissioned. Many
employment contracts spell out what constitutes

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.919
work made for hire. If they don't or if there's
no clear employee/employer relationship, courts

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:19.889
look at things like whether the employee used
the employer's computer, created the work

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:24.150
during normal work hours, or was directed
by a supervisor during the creation process.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:28.090
If it seems that there was an employer/employee
relationship and the employee created the

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:32.370
work while acting within the scope of that
employee's duties, it probably was a work

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:36.570
made for hire. So in these cases, the employer
is considered to be the author. The actual

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:41.169
people who created the work have no economic
rights in the work, other than the fact that

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:45.370
they were compensated for their efforts. This
video is a work for hire. Frank's script,

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:49.550
my performance, Mark's directions, Zulaiha's
script supervision, Brandon's editing, Thought

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:54.130
Café's animations, Jason's music, these are
all components of this motion picture work

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:58.570
and they all belong to the company we work
for. One interesting question here is what

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:03.460
rights, if any, you may have if you support
Crash Course via Patreon. Are you as a paying

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:08.120
supporter functioning as our employer? Did
you commission this work? Is this a work made

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.430
for hire, authored by tens of thousands of
supporters? If you participate in a crowdfunding

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:16.070
scheme where subscribers vote on or suggest
the direction of the creative work, are you

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:23.020
joint authors? Magic-8 Ball? Huh. Better not
tell you now. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.960
So authors have a bundle of exclusive rights
in their copyrighted works. They get these

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.900
rights at the moment the work is created.
Authors don't have to register their works

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:35.360
to be protected, but there are benefits to
registration. For example, authors can't go

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.990
to federal court to enforce their copyrights
unless they've registered it. The reproduction

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:43.409
right is, put simply, the right to copy. Under
US law, reproduction relates only copying

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:47.970
the producer's copy or photo records, which,
as we just learned, have to be fixed, tangible,

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:51.589
and intelligible. In a lot of ways, our modern
digital world is just an intricate network

00:08:51.589 --> 00:08:55.269
of copying. Think about how this video got
from me to you. I don't even know where the

00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:59.610
actual copy of this work resides. We have
a master copy on a hard drive in the closet

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:03.519
over there, but the copy you're viewing has
been uploaded and copied to Google's servers

00:09:03.519 --> 00:09:07.149
and then it gets transferred and copied from
server to server across the Internet until

00:09:07.149 --> 00:09:11.240
it reaches you, where an intricate sequence
of copying takes place in your device's processor

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:15.329
and memory so that you can stream it and view
it. So in this system where damages pile up

00:09:15.329 --> 00:09:21.579
for every instance of infringement and statutory
damages can be as much as $150,000 every time

00:09:21.579 --> 00:09:27.819
an infringing copy is made, get out the confetti
cannon, because we are rich! What? Most of

00:09:27.819 --> 00:09:33.329
these temporary copies aren't fixed or tangible?
Are you sure? We're not rich? Let's get an

00:09:33.329 --> 00:09:38.609
employee or a mindless automaton in here to
clean up all this confetti. Hey, a Roomba!

00:09:38.609 --> 00:09:41.040
Roomba is a registered trademark of the iRobot
Corporation.

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:44.689
Okay, so, the adaptation right means that
copyright owners have the exclusive right

00:09:44.689 --> 00:09:50.110
to create or authorize, "any translation,
musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization,

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:54.670
motion picture version, sound recording, art
reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:59.740
any other form in which the work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted." Under the distribution

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:03.569
right, copyright owners have the right, "to
distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted

00:10:03.569 --> 00:10:08.329
work to the public by sale or other transfer
of ownership or by rental, lease, or lending."

00:10:08.329 --> 00:10:11.300
This seems pretty straightforward until the
Internet happened.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:16.439
In the digital world, what counts as a distribution?
Things like streaming video services, torrent

00:10:16.439 --> 00:10:20.179
sharing, even the idea of licensing media
for marketplaces like iTunes are fairly new,

00:10:20.179 --> 00:10:24.089
and the law has struggled to keep pace with
the emerging technology. Really, all we can

00:10:24.089 --> 00:10:31.480
do is ask our trusty liquid filled dye agitator.
Reply hazy, ask again later. You know, I don't

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:35.509
think this thing is magic at all. These answers
are ambiguous and they seem to be arbitrary

00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:37.839
and I don't think you should make your decisions
based on this.

00:10:37.839 --> 00:10:42.069
But anyway, the public performance right allows
copyright owners, "to recite, render, play,

00:10:42.069 --> 00:10:47.089
dance, or act any copyright protected work,
either directly or by means of any device

00:10:47.089 --> 00:10:51.209
or process." The Supreme Court recently ruled
that Aereo, an online video service, made

00:10:51.209 --> 00:10:55.399
an illegal public performance when it let
customers view broadcast television over the

00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:59.429
Internet. Aereo argued that since each of
their customers were assigned an individual

00:10:59.429 --> 00:11:05.170
antenna, when they would transmit the over-the-air
broadcast to each user, it was a private performance.

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:08.749
The court disagreed. Under the public display
right, copyright owners have the exclusive

00:11:08.749 --> 00:11:14.329
right to display their works. In 1995, a sixth
right, digital audio transmission was created.

00:11:14.329 --> 00:11:17.889
This is what comes into play whenever you
stream music on Spotify or Pandora.

00:11:17.889 --> 00:11:22.320
Under the most recent version of the US Copyright
Law, these exclusive rights last for the lifetime

00:11:22.329 --> 00:11:27.670
of the author plus 70 years. For works made
for hire, terms last for 95 years from publication

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:32.360
or 120 years from the date of creation, whichever
is shorter. So that means this video won't

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:39.110
end up in the public domain until January
1, 2111. That is a long time. A lot of people

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:43.270
think that's too long. Some people think
that's not long enough. What do you think?

Tell us in comments, and we'll see you next week.

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:49.860
Crash Course Intellectual Property is filmed
at the Chad and Stacey Emigholz studio in

00:11:49.869 --> 00:11:53.759
Indianapolis, Indiana and it's made by all
of these nice workers for hire. If you'd like

00:11:53.759 --> 00:11:57.980
to keep Crash Course free for everyone forever,
you can fund the series on Patreon, a crowdfunding

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:01.670
platform that allows you to support the content
you love. You can get awesome rewards for

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:06.080
your support, but you do not get ownership
of the Crash Course copyright. Sorry.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:10.920
The greatest reward, though, is helping people learn stuff. Thanks for watching, and we'll see you next week.
