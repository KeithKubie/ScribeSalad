insensitivity in passion the simple way
of thinking about an SSRI is that you

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350
of thinking about an SSRI is that you
 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.410
of thinking about an SSRI is that you
have two brain cells and one is a

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420
have two brain cells and one is a
 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.479
have two brain cells and one is a
picture and one is a catcher so pitch

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489
picture and one is a catcher so pitch
 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.930
picture and one is a catcher so pitch
catch pitch catch so this nerve cell is

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940
catch pitch catch so this nerve cell is
 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.209
catch pitch catch so this nerve cell is
throwing serotonin across and this one

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219
throwing serotonin across and this one
 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.670
throwing serotonin across and this one
is catching it what the medicines do is

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680
is catching it what the medicines do is
 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.389
is catching it what the medicines do is
they block the recycling back into the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399
they block the recycling back into the
 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.760
they block the recycling back into the
pitcher so you know I'm throwing I'm

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770
pitcher so you know I'm throwing I'm
 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.500
pitcher so you know I'm throwing I'm
throwing some of this gets caught some

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510
throwing some of this gets caught some
 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.760
throwing some of this gets caught some
of it gets dropped it just doesn't get

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770
of it gets dropped it just doesn't get
 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.410
of it gets dropped it just doesn't get
over there but I'll suck it back in and

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420
over there but I'll suck it back in and
 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.680
over there but I'll suck it back in and
try again so if you block the recycling

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690
try again so if you block the recycling
 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.200
try again so if you block the recycling
more is in the middle to get across so

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210
more is in the middle to get across so
 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.149
more is in the middle to get across so
there's more you know the space between

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159
there's more you know the space between
 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.039
there's more you know the space between
the nerve cells is called the synapse if

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049
the nerve cells is called the synapse if
 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.350
the nerve cells is called the synapse if
you block the recycling of the serotonin

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360
you block the recycling of the serotonin
 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.899
you block the recycling of the serotonin
into the releasing cell more is

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909
into the releasing cell more is
 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.030
into the releasing cell more is
available for the catching cell so it

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040
available for the catching cell so it
 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.670
available for the catching cell so it
ends up enhancing the transmission how

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680
ends up enhancing the transmission how
 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.710
ends up enhancing the transmission how
enhanced serotonergic transmission

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720
enhanced serotonergic transmission
 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.390
enhanced serotonergic transmission
translates into feeling better and

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400
translates into feeling better and
 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.100
translates into feeling better and
feeling less anxious is much more

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110
feeling less anxious is much more
 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.170
feeling less anxious is much more
complicated but you know the simplistic

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180
complicated but you know the simplistic
 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.660
complicated but you know the simplistic
way to think about it is that if you

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670
way to think about it is that if you
 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.670
way to think about it is that if you
have higher levels of serotonin if your

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680
have higher levels of serotonin if your
 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.550
have higher levels of serotonin if your
transmission is better you will be more

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560
transmission is better you will be more
 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.620
transmission is better you will be more
relaxed and more happy it's a little

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630
relaxed and more happy it's a little
 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.210
relaxed and more happy it's a little
easier to smile it's a little harder to

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220
easier to smile it's a little harder to
 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.969
easier to smile it's a little harder to
cry so you know I've had patients come

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979
cry so you know I've had patients come
 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.289
cry so you know I've had patients come
to me say you know I've tried

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299
to me say you know I've tried
 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.760
to me say you know I've tried
antidepressants before but they always

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770
antidepressants before but they always
 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.200
antidepressants before but they always
made me feel like a zombie or they

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210
made me feel like a zombie or they
 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.969
made me feel like a zombie or they
didn't make me feel like myself or you

didn't make me feel like myself or you
know I had a patient who said like I cut

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110
know I had a patient who said like I cut
 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.200
know I had a patient who said like I cut
my finger and I looked down and I saw

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210
my finger and I looked down and I saw
 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.999
my finger and I looked down and I saw
that it was bleeding and I saw that it

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009
that it was bleeding and I saw that it
 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.560
that it was bleeding and I saw that it
was my blood but I didn't really feel

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570
was my blood but I didn't really feel
 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.020
was my blood but I didn't really feel
like connected to my finger the blood

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030
like connected to my finger the blood
 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.490
like connected to my finger the blood
you know things like that that are

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500
you know things like that that are
 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.160
you know things like that that are
really really worrisome or I've had

really really worrisome or I've had
patients say you know I was in the

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399
patients say you know I was in the
 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.429
patients say you know I was in the
situation where I knew I should be

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439

so these antidepressants do

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050
so these antidepressants do
 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.730
so these antidepressants do
scale-back a lot of expression of

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740
scale-back a lot of expression of
 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.130
scale-back a lot of expression of
emotion and feeling emotion even sort of

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140
emotion and feeling emotion even sort of
 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.620
emotion and feeling emotion even sort of
thinking emotional thoughts if you're

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630
thinking emotional thoughts if you're
 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.480
thinking emotional thoughts if you're
terribly depressed and you need

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490
terribly depressed and you need
 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.100
terribly depressed and you need
antidepressants to get out of bed and

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110
antidepressants to get out of bed and
 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.270
antidepressants to get out of bed and
function and go to work

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280
function and go to work
 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.520
function and go to work
I get it that's one thing but what I'm

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530
I get it that's one thing but what I'm
 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.360
I get it that's one thing but what I'm
worried about is more and more women

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370
worried about is more and more women
 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.560
worried about is more and more women
deciding to go on antidepressants

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570
deciding to go on antidepressants
 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:36.940
deciding to go on antidepressants
because their friends are doing it and

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950
because their friends are doing it and
 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.320
because their friends are doing it and
that's what's you know more and more

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330
that's what's you know more and more
 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.910
that's what's you know more and more
women who are at work are taking these

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920
women who are at work are taking these
 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.380
women who are at work are taking these
SSRIs so that they can not cry not get

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390
SSRIs so that they can not cry not get
 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.560

flustered keep going forward you know I

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570
flustered keep going forward you know I
 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.730
flustered keep going forward you know I
think it's it jives with the sort of

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740
think it's it jives with the sort of
 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.700
think it's it jives with the sort of
forward momentum agenda that so many of

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710
forward momentum agenda that so many of
 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.640
forward momentum agenda that so many of
us have and especially in the workplace

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650
us have and especially in the workplace
 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.700
us have and especially in the workplace
but you know I would say at what cost

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710
but you know I would say at what cost
 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.980
but you know I would say at what cost
you know it is true that SSRIs can help

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990
you know it is true that SSRIs can help
 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.330
you know it is true that SSRIs can help
you get ahead and there have been really

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340
you get ahead and there have been really
 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.420
you get ahead and there have been really
interesting animal studies where you

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430
interesting animal studies where you
 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.810
interesting animal studies where you
know the the primates who are on SSRIs

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820
know the the primates who are on SSRIs
 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.970
know the the primates who are on SSRIs
ascended up the the dominance hierarchy

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980
ascended up the the dominance hierarchy
 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.270
ascended up the the dominance hierarchy
and the ones who became dominated over

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280
and the ones who became dominated over
 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.100
and the ones who became dominated over
got stressed out and had lower serotonin

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110
got stressed out and had lower serotonin
 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.800
got stressed out and had lower serotonin
levels so there does seem to be some

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810
levels so there does seem to be some
 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.770
levels so there does seem to be some
component of serotonin effecting

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780
component of serotonin effecting
 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.210
component of serotonin effecting
dominance hierarchies and you know the

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220
dominance hierarchies and you know the
 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.420
dominance hierarchies and you know the
ability to move ahead or to lean in so

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430
ability to move ahead or to lean in so
 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.820
ability to move ahead or to lean in so
you know I totally get that there are

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830
you know I totally get that there are
 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.680
you know I totally get that there are
advantages to being on an SSRI in the

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690
advantages to being on an SSRI in the
 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.990
advantages to being on an SSRI in the
workplace but you're going to miss out

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000
workplace but you're going to miss out
 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.690
workplace but you're going to miss out
on knowing what's right because you feel

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700
on knowing what's right because you feel
 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.100
