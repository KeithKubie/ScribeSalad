00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.905
- [Voiceover] Let F of X be
equal to one half X to the third

00:00:02.905 --> 00:00:04.948
plus three X minus four.

00:00:04.948 --> 00:00:07.603
Let H be the inverse of F.

00:00:07.603 --> 00:00:10.435
Notice that F of negative
two is equal to negative 14.

00:00:10.435 --> 00:00:13.908
And then they're asking us
what is H prime of negative 14?

00:00:13.908 --> 00:00:16.729
And if you're not familiar
with the how functions

00:00:16.729 --> 00:00:20.488
and their derivatives
relate to their inverses

00:00:20.488 --> 00:00:21.960
and the derivatives of the
inverse, well this will

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.556
seem like a very hard thing to do.

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:25.752
Because if you're attempting
to take the inverse of F

00:00:25.752 --> 00:00:27.592
to figure out what H is

00:00:27.592 --> 00:00:29.656
well, it's tough to find, to take

00:00:29.656 --> 00:00:32.692
to figure out the
inverse of a third degree

00:00:32.692 --> 00:00:36.424
a third degree polynomial
defined function like this.

00:00:36.424 --> 00:00:37.687
So, the key

00:00:37.687 --> 00:00:40.991
the key, I guess property to realize,

00:00:40.991 --> 00:00:42.489
or the key truth to realize

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.406
if F and H are inverses

00:00:46.101 --> 00:00:47.518
then H prime of X

00:00:48.447 --> 00:00:49.447
H prime of X

00:00:50.385 --> 00:00:52.855
is going to be equal to

00:00:52.855 --> 00:00:55.296
is going to be equal to one over

00:00:55.296 --> 00:00:56.796
F prime of H of X.

00:00:59.336 --> 00:01:01.586
One over F prime of H of X.

00:01:02.528 --> 00:01:04.350
And you could now use this

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.552
in order to figure out what H prime of

00:01:06.552 --> 00:01:08.537
negative 14 is.

00:01:08.537 --> 00:01:10.195
Now I know what some of you are thinking,

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:11.752
because it's exactly
what I would be thinking

00:01:11.752 --> 00:01:14.169
if someone just sprung this on me is

00:01:14.169 --> 00:01:16.303
where does this come from?

00:01:16.303 --> 00:01:18.870
And I would tell you,
this comes straight out

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.432
of the chain rule.

00:01:20.432 --> 00:01:24.183
We know that if a function and its inverse

00:01:24.183 --> 00:01:26.417
we know that if we have a
function and its inverse

00:01:26.417 --> 00:01:30.000
that F of F of the
inverse of our function.

00:01:31.122 --> 00:01:32.372
So F of H of X.

00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:34.706
F of H of X.

00:01:34.706 --> 00:01:37.571
We know that this is going to be to X.

00:01:37.571 --> 00:01:39.400
This literally, this is

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.847
comes out of them being
each others inverses.

00:01:41.847 --> 00:01:43.769
We could have also said H of F of X

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:45.743
will also be equal to X.

00:01:45.743 --> 00:01:47.103
Remember, F is going to map

00:01:47.103 --> 00:01:50.700
or H is going to map
from some X to H of X.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.333
And then F is going to map
back to that original X.

00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:55.286
That's what inverses do.

00:01:55.286 --> 00:01:57.525
So that's because they are inverses.

00:01:57.525 --> 00:01:59.700
This is by definition,
this is what inverses

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.759
do to each other.

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.232
And then if you took the derivative of

00:02:02.232 --> 00:02:03.719
both sides of this

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.066
what would you get?

00:02:05.066 --> 00:02:05.949
Let me do that.

00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:07.447
So if we took the derivative

00:02:07.447 --> 00:02:08.853
of the both sides of this

00:02:08.853 --> 00:02:12.004
D D X on the left hand side.

00:02:12.004 --> 00:02:14.800
D D X on the right hand side.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.188
I think you see where this is going.

00:02:16.188 --> 00:02:18.090
You are essentially gonna
get a version of that.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.768
The left hand side used the chain rule.

00:02:19.768 --> 00:02:22.935
You're going to get F prime of H of X.

00:02:24.315 --> 00:02:25.732
F prime of H of X

00:02:28.012 --> 00:02:29.996
times H prime of X

00:02:29.996 --> 00:02:31.436
comes straight out of the chain rule

00:02:31.436 --> 00:02:34.797
is equal to, is equal
to the derivative of X

00:02:34.797 --> 00:02:36.533
is just going to be equal to one.

00:02:36.533 --> 00:02:38.567
And then you derive,
you divide both sides by

00:02:38.567 --> 00:02:39.828
F prime of H of X

00:02:39.828 --> 00:02:42.037
and you get our original property there.

00:02:42.037 --> 00:02:43.421
So now with that out of the way

00:02:43.421 --> 00:02:45.506
let's just actually apply this.

00:02:45.506 --> 00:02:48.662
So, we want to evaluate H prime of 14.

00:02:48.662 --> 00:02:51.488
Or sorry, H prime of negative 14.

00:02:51.488 --> 00:02:53.986
Is going to be equal to

00:02:53.986 --> 00:02:55.569
one over F prime of

00:02:58.355 --> 00:02:59.772
H of negative 14.

00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:02.890
H of negative 14.

00:03:04.815 --> 00:03:08.002
Now had they given us H of negative 14.

00:03:08.002 --> 00:03:09.564
But they didn't give it to us explicitly,

00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:12.099
we have to remember that
F and H are inverses

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:13.003
of each other.

00:03:13.003 --> 00:03:15.274
So F of negative two is negative 14.

00:03:15.274 --> 00:03:18.063
Well, H is gonna go from
the other way around.

00:03:18.063 --> 00:03:19.857
If you input negative 14 into H

00:03:19.857 --> 00:03:21.667
you're going to get negative two.

00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:23.250
So H of negative 14

00:03:24.383 --> 00:03:26.416
well, this is going to be equal to

00:03:26.416 --> 00:03:27.467
negative two.

00:03:27.467 --> 00:03:29.889
Once again, they are
inverses of each other.

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.682
So H of negative 14 is equal to

00:03:32.682 --> 00:03:34.594
negative negative two.

00:03:34.594 --> 00:03:36.621
And once again, I just
swapped these two around.

00:03:36.621 --> 00:03:38.816
That's what the inverse function will do.

00:03:38.816 --> 00:03:40.782
If you're wrapping from if F goes from

00:03:40.782 --> 00:03:41.989
negative two to negative 14

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.033
H is going to go from negative 14

00:03:44.033 --> 00:03:45.783
back to negative two.

00:03:47.216 --> 00:03:50.998
So now we want to evaluate
F prime of negative two.

00:03:50.998 --> 00:03:54.313
Well, let's figure out
what F prime of X is.

00:03:54.313 --> 00:03:56.646
So, F prime of X is equal to

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:01.932
remember the power rule,
so three times one half

00:04:01.932 --> 00:04:03.182
is three halves

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.929
times X to the three minus one power

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:08.550
which is the second power.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:09.876
Plus the derivative of three X

00:04:09.876 --> 00:04:13.276
with respect to X which
that's just going to be three.

00:04:13.276 --> 00:04:15.545
And you could do that,
it's just the power rule.

00:04:15.545 --> 00:04:16.933
But this was X to the first power,

00:04:16.933 --> 00:04:18.161
one times three,

00:04:18.161 --> 00:04:19.504
X to the zero power,

00:04:19.504 --> 00:04:21.204
but X to the zero is just one

00:04:21.204 --> 00:04:22.148
so you're just left with three.

00:04:22.148 --> 00:04:24.328
And derivative of a concept
that's just gonna be zero.

00:04:24.328 --> 00:04:25.800
So that's F prime of X.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.967
So F prime of, F prime of negative two

00:04:30.341 --> 00:04:33.379
is going to be three halves

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:36.763
times negative two squared
is four, positive four.

00:04:36.763 --> 00:04:38.124
So plus three.

00:04:38.124 --> 00:04:40.392
So, this is going to be equal to

00:04:40.392 --> 00:04:43.333
two times three plus three.

00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:46.307
So, six plus three is equal to nine.

00:04:46.307 --> 00:04:49.010
So this denominator here is
going to be equal to nine.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.515
So this whole thing is
equal to one over nine.

00:04:52.515 --> 00:04:55.993
So this involved, this
was something you're not

00:04:55.993 --> 00:04:56.974
going to see every day.

00:04:56.974 --> 00:04:59.655
This isn't that typical
problem in your calculus class.

00:04:59.655 --> 00:05:01.405
But it's interesting.
