00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.789
So, if we walk these two distances, we know we need to add them together to find

00:00:03.801 --> 00:00:07.425
our total distance. I can't add the fractions yet because they have unlike

00:00:07.437 --> 00:00:11.326
denominators. I want you to find the common denominator for these two fractions.

00:00:11.416 --> 00:00:12.589
Type in your answer here.
