00:00:00.235 --> 00:00:04.270
Let's move on to another trait. Osteogenesis

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.290
Imperfecta, OI. Sometimes known as Brittle Bone Disease.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.300
Now, people with OI are born with defective

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.320
connective tissue. Or sometimes without the ability to

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.040
make it. Usually because of a deficiency

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.035
in collagen. You may have heard of collagen

00:00:20.035 --> 00:00:23.002
before maybe even in commercials or something like

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:25.417
that but when we talk about collagen it's

00:00:25.417 --> 00:00:28.177
a huge and important structural protein in your

00:00:28.177 --> 00:00:30.694
cells. It's kind of what makes your skin

00:00:30.694 --> 00:00:32.926
so pliable and durable all at the same

00:00:32.926 --> 00:00:37.000
time, it serves many important structural purposes. In the

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.280
case of Osteogenesis Imperfecta it doesn't work the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.210
way it normally should. Now the incidence of OI

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.000
is about one in every 20,000 live births.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.432
Let's take a look at our fictional individual Sadie

00:00:50.432 --> 00:00:53.360
who has a European American background. And

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.450
here is a fictional pedigree of Sadie's family.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:03.320
Here we see that Sadie is, is not affected by OI, but her brother, her mother,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.240
her maternal uncle and her maternal grandmother

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.310
are all affected by Osteogenesis Imperfecta. Now just

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.700
like we've done for the last two traits

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.340
before we get into the genetic cause here,

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.509
first I want you to tell me a little bit about

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.370
the inheritance pattern of OI. Basing on the pedigree shown here,

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.870
what you've learned about inheritance patterns, I want you to tell

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.630
me if you think that this trait resembles an autosomal, sex linked

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.595
or maternal inheritance pattern. And then I want you to identify

00:01:31.595 --> 00:01:34.460
whether or not you think it's dominant, or recessive. If you

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.998
have any trouble answering this, you can go back and check

00:01:36.998 --> 00:01:40.550
out lesson five where we first learned about pedigrees and this kind

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:41.280
of dominance.
