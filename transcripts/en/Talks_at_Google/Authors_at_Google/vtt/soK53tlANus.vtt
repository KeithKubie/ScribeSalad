[GOOGLE JINGLE]

00:00:05.868 --> 00:00:07.160
JAMIE METZL: Thank you so much.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.770
And thank you to all
of you for coming.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.740
If you just open the newspaper
or open any news site,

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.928
what do you see?

00:00:15.928 --> 00:00:16.720
What do we all see?

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.220
We see Trump.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.930
We see the Mueller report.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.990
We see Brexit.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.120
When we look back
at today 10 years

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.210
from now, 20 years from
now, 50 years from now

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.930
and ask what was the story
of this moment in our lives,

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.800
this moment in the history of
our species, it won't be Trump,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.020
and it won't be Mueller,
and it won't be Brexit.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.820
It'll be that, after 3.8
billion years of evolving

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.450
by this set of rules we
call Darwinian evolution

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.390
of random mutation
and natural selection,

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.960
this was the
incredible moment where

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.660
we took the reins at our
own evolutionary process.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.019
We took the reins increasingly
of managing and manipulating

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.610
biology.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.770
And think about that.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.230
This is a power that, for
our whole recorded history,

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.840
we have ascribed to the gods.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.470
But now we are assuming
the power of those gods

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.080
that we have imagined.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.750
When Watson and Crick identified
the double helix structure

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.080
of DNA in the 1950s,
what they were doing

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.160
was recognizing that
there is a book of life.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.420
And the book of life is
structured into the famous DNA

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.200
double helix.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.500
And when the Human Genome
Project came to fruition

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.340
in 2003, what was
being identified

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.650
was that the book
of human life could

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.090
be read in the As, and the
Cs, and the Ts, and the Gs.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.200
And now with the advent of
our world of precision gene

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.100
editing, we're recognizing
that this book of life

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.900
can be written.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.440
And so we're at Google now.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.710
And when we think about,
what are technologies

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.250
that are readable, and
write-able, and hackable,

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.990
this is the house that
IT built. But what

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.460
if we come to see
our biology as being

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.650
as readable, and write-able,
and hackable as our IT?

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.440
And that is where we are going.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.040
We have this view, which
doesn't really make sense,

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.780
that our IT is
variable, which is

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.740
why we expect that every
new version of our iPhone

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.840
is going to be
better than the last.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.210
But we also have
this strange sense

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.320
that our biology is fixed,
that we are biologically

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.770
going to be like our parents,
that our kids are biologically

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.627
going to be kind of like us.

00:02:50.627 --> 00:02:52.210
But when you take a
step back and look

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.710
at this from a
historical perspective,

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.168
well, it doesn't
really make sense.

00:02:55.168 --> 00:02:57.550
Because somehow, 3.8
billion years ago,

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.800
we were single-cell organisms.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.070
And then we got to be what
we are now, Homo sapiens.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.570
We've only been this
for about 300,000 years.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.580
And with all the
changes that happen

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.310
in an evolution
of any species, it

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.100
would be crazy to imagine
that Homo sapien was just

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.080
the end of this
evolutionary journey.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.680
So we know that
we are on a path,

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.860
that we are going to evolve.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.150
We are not going to stay
Homo sapiens forever.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.900
And yet, it's so hard for
us to internalize that.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.310
And yet, we are beginning
this genetic revolution

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.040
that is going to
fundamentally transform

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.090
the way we think about all
of life, including our own.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.850
And it has and will have
just tremendous upsides.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.190
We are going to be able to fix
a lot of the bugs in humanity.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.890
And some of those
bugs we call fate.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.370
Right now when people die
of terrible genetic diseases

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.560
including little kids, we
say, god, it's terrible,

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.230
what a terrible fate,
what a terrible tragedy.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.090
And right now when an
older person gets dementia

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.860
or Alzheimer's--

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.170
we have a whole
lifetime of investment

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.839
in learning and getting wisdom
in building relationships,

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.890
and it's just thrown away.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.110
It's this incredible loss.

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.770
Imagine if people had five
more years of healthy life

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.480
what a tremendous
contribution that

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.810
would be not just to
them but to all of us--

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.610
how we would make the world
so much better by unlocking

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.885
these secrets of our biology.

00:04:35.885 --> 00:04:36.760
And that's wonderful.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.680
And we have to embrace that.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.270
And yet, there are some very
real dangers and downsides

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.110
of taking this power
that we have, as I said,

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.670
attributed to the gods.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.810
Having this ability to
recreate all of life

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.000
comes with a tremendous
responsibility.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.010
And the challenge is that
this future is arriving

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.260
far sooner than most
people-- most of us,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.900
myself included-- fully
understand or appreciate.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.640
And we're not ready.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.900
And that means everyone, you,
and me, and everybody else,

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.900
we need to recognize that
this future is coming.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.950
And we have to prepare not just
for ourselves, but because all

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.940
of us have a responsibility
in shaping this revolution

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.350
to maximize the upside
and minimize whatever

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.800
potential harms there may be.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.680
And it's really up to us.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.122
So as many of you know, my
new book "Hacking Darwin,

00:05:38.122 --> 00:05:40.080
Genetic Engineering and
the Future of Humanity"

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.890
is out this week.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.580
The reason why I've written the
book, the reason why I'm here

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.490
speaking with you today
is I want everybody

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.340
to recognize that the
genetic revolution isn't

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.890
some crazy sci-fi future.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:53.590
It's now.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:54.630
And it's here.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.880
And how it plays
out is up to you.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.900
And you need to see
yourself as an essential hub

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.690
in that process.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.230
So this revolution
is going to play out

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.900
and is already playing
out in three major areas.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.400
The first one is
in our health care.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.630
We still live in a world of
generalized health care based

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.240
on population averages.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.700
And that means that, if you go--
and you're taking most drugs--

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:28.560
you get a drug that is
it is given to you based

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.500
on a guess based on
population averages.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.060
Let's say you have a cancer.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.140
For 88% of people in the United
States, you get a cancer drug.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.750
And it's not based
on you individually,

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.010
your own individual biology.

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:43.890
It's just based on the type
of cancer, in many cases,

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:44.610
that you have.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.790
And it's not just a
third, a third, a third.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:49.380
But let's just
say it is for now.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.680
Let's say, there's a third
of a chance it'll help you,

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.200
a third of a chance
it'll do nothing,

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.398
and a third of a chance
it'll harm you or kill you.

00:06:58.398 --> 00:07:00.690
And so if it helps you, great,
you found the right drug

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.190
on the first try.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.160
If it doesn't, then
you have a new drug

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.430
with the same percentage
chances of each outcome.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.405
And that's a crazy way to do
medicine if we can do better.

00:07:13.405 --> 00:07:14.280
And we can do better.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.050
And we're starting to do better.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.850
And that is leading
us into this world

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:21.630
of personalized or precision
medicine based on each person's

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:25.080
individualized biology.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.460
And what that means is that,
when you go to your doctor,

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.430
you will get, for
example, drugs prescribed

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.010
based not just on
population averages

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:39.000
but based on your personal
biology understood

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.510
through genome sequencing, and
biometrics, and other things.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:44.070
When you have cancer--

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.380
right now, there's
a revolution in how

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.280
cancers are being treated.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:53.370
You will be treated based on the
sequencing of your cancer cells

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.812
and your cancer tumors to
get treatments based on you.

00:07:56.812 --> 00:07:58.770
When you think of all
kinds of treatments where

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.980
there's an n of thousands--

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.320
right now, there
are new treatments

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.620
called gene therapies, where you
have-- we can call it cancer.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.660
Your cells are taken out.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:14.640
They are manipulated to boost
your natural cancer-fighting

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:15.210
capabilities.

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:18.250
And those cells are put
back into your body--

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:19.170
those stem cells.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:23.770
And then they proliferate and
can be used to fight cancer.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.250
And so in all of
these, it's an n of 1.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.980
And that n is you.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.860
And what that means, though,
is that, to gain access

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.409
to the world of
precision medicine,

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:37.830
everyone is going to need to
have their genome sequenced.

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:41.730
And we're going to need to have
uniform health and other life

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.080
records.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.080
And what does that mean?

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.100
Well, it means that,
right now, we are in--

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.650
maybe low millions
of people have had

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:51.220
their whole genome sequenced.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.720
But we are moving
into a world where

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.550
it will be millions, tens of
millions, hundreds of millions.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.180
And in very short order,
billions of people

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.415
will have had their
genome sequenced.

00:09:02.415 --> 00:09:04.620
It's estimated that
2 billion people

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.232
will have their whole genome
sequenced within a decade.

00:09:07.232 --> 00:09:08.190
So what does that mean?

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:13.530
Now you've got 2 billion
people with sequenced genomes.

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.650
And you have access
to these roughly--

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:19.230
or uniform-enough electronic
health and life records.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:23.400
And then humans become a
big data analytics problem.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.480
We're here at Google.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.670
You guys understand
big data analytics.

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:29.850
100 years ago, 200
years ago, people

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:34.530
thought there was this
inexplicable magic in humans.

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.350
But I think many of us would
recognize that humans are

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.300
just-- "just"--

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.840
single-cell organisms gone
wild over a billion years

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.680
of evolution.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.930
And just as we can
understand pretty well how

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:49.140
single-cell organisms function
with the tools we have today,

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:52.860
with the tools that people
like you are developing,

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.700
we are going to have the ability
to understand much more not

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:01.500
just of our genomics but of the
complex systems of our biology.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.940
And the easy graph or that is
the complexity of our biology

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.230
has remained constant
for millions of years,

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.350
but the sophistication
of our tools

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:13.750
is on an exponential J curve.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:17.940
So now we are increasingly
being able to understand

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.250
not just the simple
genetics, because we

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:23.460
have a number of diseases,
disorder, and traits that

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:27.570
are single-gene mutation,
meaning it's like an on/off

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:31.140
switch, whether it's Tay-Sachs,
or sickle cell disease,

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.870
or Huntington's disease,
so-called Mendelian disease,

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:37.920
or genetically relatively simple
traits, like hair color and eye

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:38.670
color.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:40.170
But we are moving
into a world where

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:43.200
we are going to use something
called polygenic scoring to be

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:48.390
able to make predictions of
complex diseases, disorders,

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:48.970
and traits.

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:50.880
And that's going
to move health care

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.690
from this world of
precision very quickly

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:57.700
into a world of prediction.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.900
And so you are going
to have information--

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.900
your parents will have
information from a few days

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:07.230
after your egg is fertilized.

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:11.040
Or people will have information
about their children

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.440
from the moment of birth.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.270
And that is going to
include information

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:19.050
about the percentage greater
than average risk of having

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:22.680
some bad things happen or the
percentage greater than average

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.770
probability or possibility of
having great things happen,

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:30.720
like having super capabilities,
whether it's health or anything

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.780
else.

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.170
And so the second change
that that's going to push is

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:36.990
a change where genomics--
which right now,

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:39.600
we think of in the
context of health care--

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.330
is going to move way, way,
way beyond health care.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:45.702
Because our genome isn't
just about health care.

00:11:45.702 --> 00:11:47.160
We don't have a
health care genome.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.680
We have a human genome.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:54.518
And that human genome tells us
about who we are in every way.

00:11:54.518 --> 00:11:55.560
You look around the room.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.210
I don't see a bunch
of health care.

00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:01.890
I see a bunch of people who have
a different genetic foundation.

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:03.190
That's why you look different.

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:04.750
That's why you are different.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.360
Yes, environment still matters.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.200
But we are primarily
genetic beings.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:14.850
And we are going to understand
a lot more of the underlying

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:17.380
genetics of what it
means to be human.

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.170
So right now, I'm
sure many of you

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:24.030
have done your mouth swabs
through companies like 23andMe.

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:26.730
And you get information
back and certainly

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.100
about your carrier status,
which is about these on/off

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.380
switch single-gene
mutation disorders.

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:33.360
That's actually relevant.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.800
There's some fun stuff
like your ancestry.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.010
I'm actually 0.01% Yakut.

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:44.040
Shout out to any
Yakuts in the house.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:47.070
I guess there aren't any.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.970
But in the future, you,
parents and people,

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:53.370
are going to have a
lot of information

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.320
about all sorts of traits.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.510
Like, I have a
greater-than-average

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:02.820
possibility of being really
excellent at abstract math,

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:07.470
or sprinting, or having
an outgoing personality.

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:12.430
Anything that is
partly genetic, we

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:15.450
are going to be able
to increasingly predict

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:19.410
the genetic component--
health care, non-health care,

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:22.260
everything that has
a genetic foundation.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
That means that the
genetics and genomics

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:30.570
revolution is moving way
way, way beyond health care.

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:33.750
But the third application,
the killer application,

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:36.390
is in reproduction.

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:39.420
Right now, most people--
this is like a test.

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:46.307
Right now, most people on
Earth create babies through--

00:13:46.307 --> 00:13:46.890
AUDIENCE: Sex.

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:47.598
JAMIE METZL: Sex.

00:13:47.598 --> 00:13:48.960
Good, good, good.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.840
This is why Google has
such a high market cap--

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.190
smart people like you--

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:54.480
through sex.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:58.500
And sex has really worked
well for our species

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.570
for hundreds of
millions of years.

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:04.600
It's how we got here.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:08.010
But there's a risk
that's woven into sex.

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:11.370
And that risk is that
about 3% of all children

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:16.230
are born with some kind of
harmful genetic abnormality.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:20.490
And we are going to be able
to reduce that risk very

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:24.810
significantly, provided
that we don't conceive

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:26.580
our babies through sex.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:30.090
Because the way
to do this will be

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.730
to use IVF, which is a
technology that's been around

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:37.890
for more than 40 years, and
screen embryos using a process

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:40.500
called pre-implantation
genetic testing.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.540
It's been around for
more than 30 years.

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:46.830
And right now, this
is used to screen

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:51.570
for these simple genetic
diseases, and disorders,

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:54.450
and chromosomal abnormalities.

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:58.920
But as we develop this
greater knowledge of genomics

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.990
in very short
order, we are going

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:02.850
to be able to use
this kind of screening

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:09.880
with a lot of knowledge about
very human traits, height, IQ,

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.480
personality style, so
many other things that

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.250
have a genetic component.

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:19.580
As I said, life has
a genetic component.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.280
And then beyond
that, we are going

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.240
to use stem cell technology.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:26.980
The 2012 Nobel Prize was
given to Shinya Yamanaka, who

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.260
developed a process
for creating what

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.900
are called Induced Pluripotent
Stem cells, IPS cells.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.720
And what IPS cells are is--

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:37.300
that process allows
us to take adult cells

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.010
and induce them into stem cells.

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:42.470
And then those stem cells
can be turned, in this case,

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:47.920
into egg precursor cells and
egg precursor cells into eggs.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.230
And so now with the average
woman undergoing IVF

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:51.940
has about 15 eggs extracted.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:54.490
Now using IPS
cells, we are going

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:57.290
to be able to have
thousands, tens of thousands,

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.500
hundreds of thousands, millions.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.088
So let's call it 10,000.

00:16:01.088 --> 00:16:03.130
Because if you're using,
let's say, a skin graft,

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:05.650
there's millions of skin
cells in a skin graft.

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:07.480
The average male ejaculation--

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.150
I don't know if this is the
way you guys talk at Google.

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:13.910
But average male ejaculation
has about a billion sperm cells.

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:16.780
So that's readily available.

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:19.360
Fertilize 10,000 eggs.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.310
Grow them all for
about five days.

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:23.980
Extract a few cells from each.

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:24.850
Sequence them.

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:26.290
And the cost of
genome sequencing

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:29.590
has gone down from about
a billion dollars in 2003,

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:33.850
to about $800 today, to
really negligibility in

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:35.420
under a decade.

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:41.530
So sequence 10,000 of these
early-stage pre-implanted

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:42.850
embryos.

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:47.420
And then you have to pick
what you're looking for.

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:50.080
Some of you may have seen my
editorial in "The New York

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.910
Times" last week about this.

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:53.980
But in that editorial,
I was imagining,

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:57.190
what will it be like to go to
a fertility clinic in 2045?

00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:59.680
And basically, what you're
going to need to do is say,

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:00.970
here are my priorities.

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:04.859
So certainly, health will be at
the top of everybody's priority

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:05.359
list.

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:07.790
I want to have a kid
who's going to be healthy,

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:09.339
who's not going to,
for example, die

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:12.760
of some terrible
genetic disease.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.930
But when it will be an option to
choose healthy lifespan, to say

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:19.460
that we know that there are
genetic patterns that would

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:23.349
allow or increase the odds that
somebody could live a longer

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:27.369
and healthier life than many
of the other embryos that

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:31.390
would be the options might,
people will want that.

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:36.450
And right now, we can
make a pretty good guess.

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:39.490
Of your 15 fertilized
eggs, we can probably

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:43.120
rank them pretty well
from tallest, potentially,

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.060
to shortest, provided they
get the necessary inputs

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.400
like healthy food.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.520
But in 10 years, in
20 years, I think

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.520
it's quite likely we're
going to be able to say,

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:56.590
we can make a pretty
rough but informed guess

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:59.650
ranking your
pre-implanted embryos

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:04.330
based on which is likely to
have the highest to lowest

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:07.060
genetic component of IQ.

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:09.400
And that's a very,
very different way

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.170
of thinking about
making babies than what

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:13.390
we've done in the past.

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:18.250
And then beyond that, there is
the technology of gene editing.

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:20.140
Many of you have
heard of CRISPR.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.200
Many of you know what
happened in China last year,

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:28.270
where it was announced in
November that two Chinese twins

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:34.360
had been born the month before
in October whose genomes had

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:38.770
been edited by an
extremely unethical

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:40.990
Chinese biophysicist--
not a biologist, not

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:43.870
a physician, a biophysicist.

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:47.080
But we are in the era of
precision gene editing.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:50.690
And even had this not
happened last year,

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:53.560
it would have happened next
year or the year after.

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.810
It would have been done
much more responsibly

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:57.860
in a much more transparent way.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:01.900
And it would have been done
to address an actual threat

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.818
to these future children,
not to attempt--

00:19:04.818 --> 00:19:06.610
and it looks like it
was a failed attempt--

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:10.570
to confer an enhancement
or an advantage.

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:15.280
But we are moving toward the
era of precision gene editing

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.455
of pre-implanted embryos.

00:19:16.455 --> 00:19:17.830
I don't think
we're going to do--

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:20.590
I'm speaking at a panel
at Harvard later tonight

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:23.170
with George Church.

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:26.020
And George is leading
a process for making

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.300
multiple genetic
changes simultaneously.

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.950
And that can work
well in plants.

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:33.072
It probably can work
well in animals.

00:19:33.072 --> 00:19:34.780
But in humans, I think
that's going to be

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.100
risky for a very long time.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.590
But we will absolutely
be able to make

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:40.610
a small number of
genetic changes,

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:43.570
either to reduce
or eliminate risks

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:48.100
and/or to confer benefits.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.930
And that's where we are going.

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:55.660
And this science is advancing
extremely, extremely rapidly.

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:59.410
And it's expanding
in the context

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:03.830
of our humanity and our world.

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:06.070
And it's a world where
people are different.

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:07.850
Communities are different.

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:09.790
And countries are different.

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:12.807
So within any country--
certainly, within this country,

00:20:12.807 --> 00:20:14.890
the United States-- there
are going to be people--

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:16.750
and many of you know them--

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:20.590
who are these trans-humanist
biohackers who say,

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:23.320
this is great, no holds barred.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.200
Let's race into this
trans-humanist future.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.300
And there are others
who are going to say,

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:29.710
this is really scary.

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:31.630
We are, quote unquote,
"playing god."

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:33.710
We can't do it.

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:34.960
And there will be differences.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:39.190
And people are going to try
to do whatever is in line

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:41.698
with their value system.

00:20:41.698 --> 00:20:43.240
And the same thing
is going to happen

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.570
on an international level.

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:47.690
There may be entire countries--
this may be one of them--

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:51.340
that decide to entirely
opt out, just to say,

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.900
this is really scary.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:57.260
We don't know enough to start
making these kinds of changes.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:00.460
There are certainly going to
be unintended consequences.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.350
Better we not do
it at all-- better

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:05.170
we forego potential
benefits, because we

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:06.820
think the risk is too high.

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.240
And that's a legitimate choice
that some countries will make.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.830
And there will be
other countries

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:15.170
that will say, hey, we recognize
that, using this technology,

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:19.470
we can dramatically reduce,
potentially, health care costs.

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:22.380
We can confer all
kinds of advantages,

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:25.780
whether on an individual
or a population level.

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:29.130
And that's going to be
appealing to some countries.

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:31.710
And this process is going
to be pushed forward

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:34.980
in a very significant
way because we

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.660
live in a competitive world.

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:38.947
People are competing
with each other,

00:21:38.947 --> 00:21:40.780
and countries are
competing with each other.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:44.070
I have a good
friend in Korea who

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:48.750
has 12 tutors coming every week
for his 11-year-old daughter--

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:50.040
coming to the house.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:54.870
In Korea, they have a law now
that national cram schools

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:57.150
have to close at 10:00 PM
because people were having

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.400
their seven and eight-year-old
kids staying out

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.660
until after midnight
every night,

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.920
seven days a week
prepping for exams

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:09.150
that they were going to take
10 years into the future.

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:10.330
And when I asked my friend--

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:13.440
I said, hey, if you could
select among your natural

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.470
pre-implanted embryos to try
to pick the one that was going

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:19.988
to have a competitive
advantage by potentially having

00:22:19.988 --> 00:22:21.780
a higher-- at least,
genetic component of--

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:24.000
IQ than the others--

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.680
he looked at me
like I was insane.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:28.740
He's like, is that
even a choice?

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.157
And when I said,
of the people you

00:22:30.157 --> 00:22:34.652
know who are competing for
access to these universities,

00:22:34.652 --> 00:22:36.360
if they had a choice,
what would they do?

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.713
And just honestly,
he looked at me--

00:22:38.713 --> 00:22:40.380
they used to say,
like, I was from Mars.

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:42.690
Now being from Mars is normal--

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:46.350
like, from Pluto.

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:49.200
And that's where we are heading.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.610
There are all of these kinds
of competitive pressures.

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:55.650
And because the
science is moving

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:58.470
so quickly, because there are
all these forces propelling it

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:01.470
forward, now is
the time where we

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:05.070
need to say, hey, what are
the values that we need

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:11.640
to apply to make sure that this
great hope, this great dream

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.260
doesn't become a nightmare?

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.422
And there's a lot of real
things to be worried about.

00:23:16.422 --> 00:23:17.880
Certainly, what
we're talking about

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.500
are incredibly complex systems.

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:23.070
The genome is complex enough.

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:26.850
But the genome is embedded
within the multiomic system

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:30.030
biology of what
makes us human, which

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:32.670
is dynamic and interactive.

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:36.990
And then our entire biology
is constantly interacting

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:39.250
with the environment around us.

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:41.490
So nothing is static.

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:43.380
It would be very
difficult if you

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:46.770
understood a human
perfectly in one moment.

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:48.840
In the next moment,
everything would change.

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:51.390
And you would need to
understand the human perfectly

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:56.230
in that next moment to maintain
your level of comprehension.

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:59.700
So we need to be cautious
about meddling with systems

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.650
that we don't fully understand.

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:04.650
And equity issues-- right
now, if this technology

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:09.770
is as powerful as I
believe it will be,

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:12.990
what happens if some
communities, and groups,

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:16.930
and even countries have a
lot more access than others?

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:18.330
We need inequality.

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:21.330
There have to be first
movers with any technology.

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:23.370
And that will have
to be the case here.

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:26.640
But we've also seen
what happens when there

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.280
are too great of divisions.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.780
It can be very disruptive.

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:33.700
It can be disruptive
internally within a country.

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.850
It can be disruptive
internationally

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:40.650
because there are all these
differences, as I said.

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:43.650
So we really need to be
mindful of the equity issues.

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:47.520
Diversity-- I come, and I
look around a room like this.

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:50.670
You say, well, it's great
that we have this diversity.

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:52.680
And I'm sure that
having diversity

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:56.280
makes Google a stronger company.

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.900
But that's not
what diversity is.

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:00.240
I mean, it's a one
manifestation of it.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:05.220
Diversity, in its essence,
is our sole survival strategy

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:06.480
as a species.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.790
If we didn't have
diversity, you could

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:11.430
say we'd still be
single-cell organisms.

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:12.780
But we wouldn't even be that.

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:16.500
Because what we call diversity,
Darwin called random mutation.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:19.620
And if we were all
exactly the same,

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:21.840
the environment
wouldn't have sustained

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.960
this exact same single-cell
organism for 4 billion years.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.910
We wouldn't even be here.

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:28.410
And so we think
about making changes

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:29.950
that even make a
lot of sense to us,

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:33.540
like, for example
eliminating disease risk even

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:37.140
of these relatively simple
Mendelian disorders.

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:39.450
We think we're doing
something good because it's

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:42.960
scary to be a carrier of
some kind of potentially

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.340
deadly disease.

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:47.570
But if you use the classic
case of sickle cell disease,

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:49.320
it's terrible to have
sickle cell disease.

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:52.290
And you will, in most
cases, die very young.

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:55.470
But if you are a carrier
of sickle cell disease,

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:58.930
you actually have increased
resistance to malaria.

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:01.290
So we could eliminate
some kind of thing

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:02.910
that we think is
terrible, but it

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:05.760
could have some kind of
benefit that we don't know,

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:08.250
because it hasn't been
tested in the world

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:09.540
that we have known to date.

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:11.610
But maybe that will be
tested in the future.

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:15.530
So we really need to be
mindful of our diversity.

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:18.740
And the challenge is
that this technology

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:21.580
is moving extremely rapidly.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:24.820
And we're going to have
to make very big decisions

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:27.790
before we fully understand
the consequences

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:30.730
of the decisions we will make.

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:33.190
And that is a really
big challenge.

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:35.860
And it's a really
big responsibility.

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:40.660
And good news for us, though,
is that, while the technology is

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:44.050
new, the values that
we're going to need

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:48.130
to bring to bear to use it
wisely are, in many cases,

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:48.770
very old.

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:53.320
We are really going to have
to ask ourselves, who are we?

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.250
What are our values?

00:26:55.250 --> 00:27:01.060
How do we apply those values
in making the huge decisions

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:04.540
that we are going to have to
make over the coming years?

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:09.510
Because the genetics
revolution is not just coming.

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:11.950
The genetics revolution is here.

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:12.670
It's here.

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:13.870
It's here now.

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:14.860
It's happening.

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:17.200
It's changing the
world around us.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:22.060
But that speed of change
is only going to pick up.

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:27.370
And it's going to touch us
in very, very intimate ways.

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:30.070
And the difference between
having this play out

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:34.420
in a way that does as much
as possible to help us

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:37.090
and bring us together
and having it

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:39.520
play out in a way
that could harm us--

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:42.970
in many ways, for an
unnecessary reasons,

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:45.250
because we haven't done a
good enough job of applying

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:46.190
our values--

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:50.430
the difference between
those outcomes is us.

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:53.740
And so the reason why I've
written this book is I

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:56.810
feel that this revolution
is so important.

00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:58.510
We can't leave it
to the experts.

00:27:58.510 --> 00:27:59.890
The scientists
are actually doing

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:02.180
a very good job of meeting.

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:05.830
I'm participating in many
of those conversations.

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:07.960
But this isn't an issue
just for the scientists.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.190
This is about our future.

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:12.950
It's really up to all of us.

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:15.940
So on an individual level,
what are responsibilities?

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:18.970
So everybody needs
to be informed.

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:21.670
And everybody needs to
recognize that, if there

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:25.630
is going to be a bottom-up
push to encourage

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:28.720
our representatives and
others to really address

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:31.630
these issues in a way they
can optimize the good stuff

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:33.730
and minimize the
harm, we are all going

00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:35.180
to have to be part of that.

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:38.140
So I really want
everybody here to feel

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:40.990
that you are now
informed and that you

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:44.750
can be a hub in this
kind of conversation.

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:47.350
But then on a national
level, we really

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:50.200
need to make sure that
all of our countries

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.590
have the regulatory
infrastructures that can

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:56.030
manage these kinds of issues.

00:28:56.030 --> 00:29:00.700
The United Kingdom, in my
mind, is the gold standard

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:04.750
for what a well-regulated
country on this set of issues

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:05.950
looks like.

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:07.660
And the US is somewhere
in the middle.

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:11.770
The FDA is actually a
very effective agency

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:15.190
and does a pretty good job of
weighing risks and benefits

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:17.428
of various interventions.

00:29:17.428 --> 00:29:18.970
But there are parts
of the world that

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:23.050
are either under-regulated
or have good rules that

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:24.310
aren't well-enforced.

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:27.740
And China is certainly
an example of that.

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:30.430
And then there are places which
are regulatory black holes,

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:32.250
where there's really nothing.

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:33.220
And that can't be.

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:37.330
Because if we have the
kind of medical tourism

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:40.000
that we've had very
dangerously for stem

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.850
cell treatments
for this, it could

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:47.890
have very, very
significant consequences

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:50.230
and on an international level.

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:53.530
So on a national
level, every country

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:56.820
needs to have a
regulatory system.

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:58.190
It doesn't need to be the same.

00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:01.070
It needs to be based
on best practices.

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:04.960
It needs to be based on each
country's traditions, values,

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.160
and ethics, and culture.

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:10.150
But every country
needs something.

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:12.950
And then on an
international level,

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:17.080
we really need to begin a
process of coming together

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:18.580
to develop global rules.

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:20.710
I'm on the World Health
Organization International

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:25.630
Advisory Committee on the
Future of Human Genome Editing.

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:27.340
And we're trying to
think about, what

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:30.310
might an international
system look like?

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:35.090
But we, collectively, are
a long way from there.

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:37.570
And so what we
need to do is have

00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:40.390
what I'm calling a species-wide
dialogue on the future

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:42.220
of human genetic engineering.

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:44.560
Everybody needs to
be part of that.

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:47.530
As a matter of fact, my website
is a very humble first step--

00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:52.480
hackingdarwin.com-- where
people can go and share views.

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.450
But then what we need
to do is to make sure

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:58.510
that those conversations on an
individual level, on a group

00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:01.550
level can feed up
through governments.

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:04.870
One of the reasons that my
publisher and I are making

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:07.300
this book, "Hacking
Darwin," available for free

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:10.900
to any member of parliament
of any country in the world

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:13.540
is we think it's so
important that we

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:16.420
have these conversations on the
individual, and the communal,

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:18.010
and on the national level.

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:21.170
What we have to do
is work to make sure

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:25.760
that these conversations
lead to norms which

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:30.770
lead to standards which lead to
regulations which lead to laws.

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:32.360
Because what we
are talking about

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:35.540
here is the future of life.

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:37.670
And it must be regulated.

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:41.360
But it must be regulated well.

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:44.390
And because we are at
this incredible inflection

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:47.780
moment at the beginning
of this revolution

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:50.000
that's going to
change our lives--

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.460
because the difference
between the greatest

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:57.380
upside and the most
frightening downside is us--

00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:00.090
we all need to feel empowered.

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:03.410
We all need to
recognize that we are

00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:08.120
the shapers of this future
in which we and our children

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.590
will live.

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:12.480
And I welcome you to
join me on this journey.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.940
So, thank you.

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:18.350
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:25.550
AUDIENCE: Do you think this
system of-- whatever mechanism

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:29.400
is the thing that is actually
allowing us to choose like, IQ,

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.560
better traits, what have you--

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:35.880
do you think it's even possible
to have that exist ethically

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.475
in a market economy
or a market system?

00:32:38.475 --> 00:32:41.680
JAMIE METZL: Yeah,
it's a great question.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.240
I don't know the answer.

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:44.850
But I do know that
people are going

00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:47.140
to be making these choices.

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:48.990
I do know that we
aren't going to want

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:51.090
people to choose anything.

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:54.390
And there will have to be
some kind of restrictions.

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:56.490
And that doesn't
mean that we don't--

00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:59.520
there will be all kinds
of very sensitive issues

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:03.190
that will be raised on
issues like skin color.

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:05.850
But also, there will be people--
and there already are people--

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:07.200
who are saying--

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:12.377
for example, deaf parents who
want to have a deaf child.

00:33:12.377 --> 00:33:14.460
And this is already happening
in the United States

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:16.110
where this is legal--

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:21.150
who are choosing embryos to
guarantee that those children

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:21.990
will be deaf.

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:24.900
Is that something we're
going to be comfortable with?

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:28.770
When it's a choice, will we
be comfortable with parents

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:33.600
choosing to implant embryos
that will have genetic disorders

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:37.530
or diseases that will kill
those kids at an early age?

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:39.710
I think we're going to be
uncomfortable with that.

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:41.730
There will be all kinds
of other options--

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:43.563
and just as you mentioned
in your question--

00:33:43.563 --> 00:33:45.780
IQ, height.

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:48.480
And I think that
people are going

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:51.400
to want to make those choices.

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.650
And then the question is,
where does ethics come from?

00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:55.470
Does ethics come from law?

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:57.600
Or does ethics
come from culture?

00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.812
And I think that, in
different societies,

00:33:59.812 --> 00:34:01.770
different societies will
have different answers

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:02.520
to that question.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:03.630
In the places where
it comes from law,

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:04.950
there will be restrictions.

00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:06.542
This may be one of those places.

00:34:06.542 --> 00:34:09.000
There will be other places
where it will come from culture.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.420
And then there may well
be places like black holes

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:14.778
where people go to do
whatever they want.

00:34:14.778 --> 00:34:16.320
AUDIENCE: I was
actually questioning,

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.639
do you think the system
at all can exist?

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:19.350
Like, not even
just the mechanism

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:22.290
by which we edit
genes but the systems

00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:24.929
themselves could exist
on a bi-nation basis?

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:30.056
Because if you even consider
something like IQ or turning

00:34:30.056 --> 00:34:31.889
towards like a certain
trait-- fast running,

00:34:31.889 --> 00:34:35.040
or certain pattern
recognition, or what have you--

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.540
at that point, we
would have to have

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:38.983
some sort of an international
regulation on discrimination

00:34:38.983 --> 00:34:39.900
based on those things.

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:41.790
Because if someone
who is, quote unquote,

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:44.040
"selected genetically" by
their parents to run quickly

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.929
or to do something
like that, if they

00:34:45.929 --> 00:34:48.012
were to go get a job at
something that wasn't what

00:34:48.012 --> 00:34:53.070
they were effectively built
for, is it wrong to say, no--

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:55.480
in my case, if I listened
to what my parents did,

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:56.969
I wouldn't be here right now.

00:34:56.969 --> 00:34:59.790
I would be a doctor
or a lawyer somewhere.

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:02.940
But I'm not sure if it's
fully ethical or even

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:05.273
in any way possible for that
to exist ethically in any--

00:35:05.273 --> 00:35:07.565
JAMIE METZL: Yeah, I think
it's a very legitimate view.

00:35:07.565 --> 00:35:09.180
And there are many
others who believe

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:11.250
that and who will believe that.

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:13.950
And as I mentioned when I was
talking about the diversity,

00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:16.830
there will be others
who believe differently.

00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:18.972
And in an ideal world--

00:35:18.972 --> 00:35:20.430
and I'd love to
live in that world.

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:22.763
And I'm doing my best with
the World Health Organization

00:35:22.763 --> 00:35:24.810
to try to do a little
bit toward building it--

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:28.280
we would have some international
standards about what happens

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.280
and what doesn't happen.

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:31.770
I had a piece come
out in court yesterday

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:34.678
about how I think
that this issue could

00:35:34.678 --> 00:35:35.970
lead to international conflict.

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:38.820
Because a society that's opt
out for exactly the kinds

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:40.552
of ethical reasons
that you describe,

00:35:40.552 --> 00:35:42.760
what are they going to do
if another country opts in?

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.908
Are they going to make it
illegal for their people

00:35:44.908 --> 00:35:46.950
to procreate with people
from that other country?

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:51.210
Are they going to do genetic
testing of every woman who may

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:53.220
be pregnant who's coming in?

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:54.730
These issues are really tough.

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:55.840
There's no easy answer.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:58.470
But ethics are at the
core of everything.

00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:01.560
And either, we're going
to find a way that's

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:04.440
better than what we have
now to apply ethics,

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:06.000
or this could get very ugly.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.610
AUDIENCE: No,
certainly, even in just

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:10.973
in the case you
mentioned, the most

00:36:10.973 --> 00:36:13.140
quickly upcoming, which is
the sequencing of genomes

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:17.470
to predict medical maladies
as you go through life--

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:20.530
if you consider that
in America alone--

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:21.780
forget pre-existing condition.

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:23.280
You don't have to show
a preexisting condition

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:23.970
to know that you have that.

00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:25.980
JAMIE METZL: Well, everybody
has a pre-existing condition

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:27.300
for something once we
look under the hood.

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:28.300
AUDIENCE: No, of course.

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:31.013
But now it's not that we require
a look under hood to see that.

00:36:31.013 --> 00:36:32.430
You don't actually
have to present

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:33.720
that preexisting
condition anymore.

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.970
An insurance company can
just know, oh, we have access

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:37.200
to your genetic information.

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.870
And we can charge
you a shitload more.

00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:40.620
JAMIE METZL: Yeah,
so, yes, right now,

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:43.440
we have the Genetic Information
Nondiscrimination Act, GINA,

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.570
which makes it illegal
for insurance companies

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:46.980
to discriminate
against you based

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:48.370
on your genetic information.

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:51.430
But it's still legal for life
insurance companies to do so.

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:54.300
So maybe we'll give a chance for
other people to ask questions.

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:58.110
But these are the issues.

00:36:58.110 --> 00:36:59.310
And they're not easy.

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:01.127
And the point is
there aren't answers.

00:37:01.127 --> 00:37:02.335
Your question is a great one.

00:37:02.335 --> 00:37:04.530
We have to be struggling
with them now.

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:07.080
But we're spending so
much of our time focusing

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:09.062
on these issues that
are less important.

00:37:09.062 --> 00:37:11.520
And this is something where
everybody needs to be involved.

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:13.350
We need our leaders
to be involved,

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:15.780
because the exact issues
that you described

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:17.800
are the ones we need
to be wrestling with.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:20.220
AUDIENCE: So I believe
this is coming.

00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:23.240
And human to have a hard time
putting genies back in bottles.

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:26.520
So the first people to do
this will probably be rich.

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:27.908
JAMIE METZL: Yes.

00:37:27.908 --> 00:37:29.700
AUDIENCE: And we're
talking about something

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:34.592
that could give crazy advantages
to additional entrants.

00:37:34.592 --> 00:37:35.300
JAMIE METZL: Yes.

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:37.690
AUDIENCE: And we could--

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:39.220
I was listening
to an NPR article.

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:42.110
And they were saying, we could
have two different species,

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:45.020
the rich-person species and
the poor-person species.

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:47.220
JAMIE METZL: The Eloi
and the Morlocks.

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:50.930
AUDIENCE: And so, what is
the World Health Organization

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:52.640
doing about this or
thinking about this?

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:53.462
JAMIE METZL: Yeah.

00:37:53.462 --> 00:37:55.420
I'm working with the
World Health Organization.

00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:57.800
The answer is something.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.820
But nobody is doing enough.

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:02.960
I mean, this is such
an important issue.

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:05.540
And it's just being
massively under-addressed.

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:08.750
So there will be first
adopters of this technology,

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:10.587
like every technology.

00:38:10.587 --> 00:38:12.170
But we've seen what
happens when there

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:15.310
are first adopters
of the machine gun.

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:18.050
You can really skew the
way the world looks.

00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:22.015
And on one hand, there will
be some democratic pressures,

00:38:22.015 --> 00:38:23.390
just in the sense
that there will

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:27.860
be huge savings to at least
rational health care systems

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:30.290
that these
technologies can bring.

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:32.930
And from a theoretical
perspective,

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:36.410
in a country like the UK where
you have a national health

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:39.870
system and a rational regulator,
you can think about, well,

00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:43.310
if we're going to eliminate
lots of genetic diseases

00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:47.960
that cost hundreds of billions
of pounds per year or more

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:51.680
to treat and we distribute that
benefit across the population

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:55.100
by providing free IVF and embryo
screening to everybody who

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:57.908
wants to have a baby,
that is a rational thing.

00:38:57.908 --> 00:39:00.200
But even in that system,
there are going to be people--

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:02.750
because we are humans,
and humans are crazy--

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:04.860
who want more.

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:09.760
And again, it's a
very, very real issue.

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:11.780
What I will say about
these equity issues,

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:14.230
which are so serious,
in the future--

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:16.160
that if we care, if
those are our values

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:19.460
that we don't want to
live in a world that's

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:22.550
divided genetically in
the future, the best

00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:26.000
way to fix that is to
look at our values now.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.150
If we're perfectly comfortable
having an average kid born

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:32.570
in the Central African Republic
being born with brain damage

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:34.250
because his mother
is malnourished--

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:38.450
and so that kid's brain will not
function as well as our kids'

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:39.980
brains will function.

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:43.970
Even though it's not
based on genomics,

00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:45.680
if we're comfortable
with that world,

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:48.200
and that world is OK
for us, how can we

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:51.840
expect that there's going to be
a different us in the future?

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:56.630
But if we say our values are to
live our principles of equity

00:39:56.630 --> 00:40:00.560
today, when we get to the
future, we'll know who we are,

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:02.840
and we'll be able to
apply those values.

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:03.500
Yeah?

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:05.420
AUDIENCE: I just want to start
by saying this conversation

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:06.613
made me super uncomfortable.

00:40:06.613 --> 00:40:08.030
But that's exciting
because I like

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:10.310
when things sort of disrupt
my expectations of what's

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:11.090
going to come.

00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:12.202
I live for those moments.

00:40:12.202 --> 00:40:14.410
I live for that moment where
you walk into the water,

00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:16.030
and you take a
couple extra steps,

00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:17.270
and then you're floating.

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:19.580
So what I think is
kind of interesting

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:22.122
is you're talking about
this continuum of stuff.

00:40:22.122 --> 00:40:23.080
You've got your genome.

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:25.820
And if we can edit it to
make you more healthy to live

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:27.320
longer, that's one definition.

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:30.770
That's a belief system for
saying, that's a better life.

00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:33.300
I think, when you talk about
making someone more intelligent

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:35.300
or making someone run
faster, it's pretty clear,

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:36.080
this is a superlative.

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.190
You're making them better.

00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:40.043
But what about the lens
of not the IQ but the EQ?

00:40:40.043 --> 00:40:41.460
What about the
emotional quotient?

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:43.220
What about the
space of creativity,

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:45.110
the space of cultural
norms, the fact

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:47.600
that forgetting things means
the things you remember

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:48.530
are meaningful?

00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:51.290
And certainly, this is less of
a technology-driven question--

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:53.500
more of a question about
what makes us human.

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:56.505
And I guess, just at a
high level, I'm curious,

00:40:56.505 --> 00:40:58.380
how does that work its
way into your thoughts

00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:00.260
as you start to extend
beyond medicine?

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:01.010
JAMIE METZL: Yeah.

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:03.230
It's such an essential question.

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:05.570
Because if we--
any of us-- think

00:41:05.570 --> 00:41:08.870
of this as a conversation
about science,

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:10.970
we've missed the whole point.

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:15.630
This is a conversation about
humanity's values and ethics.

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:20.510
And it's set in the context
of a revolutionary technology

00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:22.220
and revolutionary science.

00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:26.400
So we have to be
focusing on those things.

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:30.860
But the challenge for us is that
diversity for the last almost 4

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:35.360
billion years has just been
something that happens to us.

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.670
I didn't say, oh,
I want to be born

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:39.530
looking like
whatever I look like

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:43.190
or having whatever genetic
inheritance that I have.

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:45.590
My parents didn't say that,
other than in the process

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:47.520
of meeting each other.

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:49.370
But now these things
that have just happened

00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:52.297
are going to increasingly
become choices.

00:41:52.297 --> 00:41:54.380
And that's essentially the
point that I was making

00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:56.780
when I talked about diversity.

00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:58.730
We are going to have
to articulate something

00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:00.180
that just happened to us.

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:04.970
And if we think that the only
way to have value in this world

00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:10.460
is to have 15, or 20, or 50
higher points on an IQ test,

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:13.263
we are going to
destroy our humanity.

00:42:13.263 --> 00:42:14.930
And not only that,
we're going to become

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:19.520
less good at a lot of things
that we collectively do.

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:21.950
And as a matter of
fact, what I am saying

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:24.290
is, if everybody starts
making the same choices based

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:28.580
on our cultural biases of
things that seem perfectly good

00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:31.382
and we don't have a
conversation about diversity--

00:42:31.382 --> 00:42:33.840
which is essentially the core
point of what you're making--

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:35.880
and how we value
it and how we're

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:40.740
going to realize that in a world
where biology is manipulable

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:45.120
and a choice, we are
going to drive ourselves

00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:48.540
into potentially even an
evolutionary cul-de-sac.

00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:52.740
And the drivers won't be
authoritarian governments.

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:56.640
The drivers will be the
most well-meaning parents

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:59.790
who are trying to give
advantages for their kids

00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:01.890
in the world as they see it.

00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:05.430
And so I totally agree with
the premise of your question.

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:08.740
And I'm sorry that I have the
same answer to every question.

00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:14.100
But that's why we have a
little bit of a head start now.

00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:17.430
Imagine if we could have
had an open conversation

00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:20.160
at the beginning of the
Industrial Revolution

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:22.650
or the beginning of the
nuclear revolution about,

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:24.880
well, we know this
stuff is coming.

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:28.270
What are the values that we
want to weave into everything?

00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:31.560
And we have a little window
before everybody retreats

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:32.485
to their barricades.

00:43:32.485 --> 00:43:33.360
And that will happen.

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:34.240
And it will happen soon.

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.310
So this is that window.

00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:37.230
And one of the
reasons why I like

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:39.120
speaking with groups
like you is that I

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:43.560
feel like this is a conversation
that we're all part of.

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:47.990
And we all need to be
hubs in that conversation.

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:49.510
Yeah?

00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:52.150
AUDIENCE: Do you see
abortion laws today

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:58.990
that we have in this country
in the world as any indicator

00:43:58.990 --> 00:44:03.100
of how the World
Health Organization

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:04.330
rules are being laid out?

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:07.720
Because I feel, like
you aptly mentioned,

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:09.470
that there's always
going to be two sides.

00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:10.630
JAMIE METZL: Yeah.

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:15.420
AUDIENCE: And how
do you see your work

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:16.818
being compiled into that?

00:44:16.818 --> 00:44:18.610
JAMIE METZL: So that
the debates that we've

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:21.790
had over issues like abortion
and genetically-modified crops

00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:25.300
are highly relevant to
where we may be going.

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:30.340
And they're also a warning that,
with abortion in the abortion

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:35.020
debate, there are people on the
various sides who have staked

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:39.130
out extremely rigid positions.

00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:42.640
And here in the United States,
the politics of abortion

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:44.560
makes it much more
difficult to have

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:47.260
these kinds of conversations
on a national level

00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:49.610
than is the case
in other places.

00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:53.908
And again, the United Kingdom
is a good example of that.

00:44:53.908 --> 00:44:56.200
But when we look at abortion,
you have to ask yourself,

00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:59.980
if you believe that life
begins at conception, why is it

00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:03.190
that we have picketers and
protesters in front of clinics

00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:05.360
where abortions
are taking place,

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:08.200
but we don't have them in
front of fertility clinics?

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:10.480
Because if life
begins at conception,

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:13.840
the place where abortions
are happening, that's retail.

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:16.157
But the fertility clinics,
that's wholesaling.

00:45:16.157 --> 00:45:18.490
If you think that's murder,
that's where it's happening.

00:45:18.490 --> 00:45:21.230
But why aren't the
picketers there?

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:24.280
And the reason is because this
technology has normalized.

00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:26.260
And people in those
communities, they

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:29.140
see these parents
who have benefited

00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:32.960
from the miracle of life who,
otherwise, wouldn't have.

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:34.970
And they don't like to admit it.

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:38.620
But they recognize that there
is a cost and a benefit.

00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:42.190
And genetically-modified
crops are another example

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:45.520
where the scientists actually
did a pretty good job

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:48.040
of setting ground rules
and behaving responsibly

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:50.480
since the 1970s.

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:54.150
But the general
public, on average,

00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:56.150
didn't feel that they
were part of that process.

00:45:56.150 --> 00:46:00.370
And so now you have pretty much
all of the science Nobel Prize

00:46:00.370 --> 00:46:03.520
winners alive who are
repeatedly saying,

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:07.070
GMOs are safe for human
consumption-- which they are.

00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:09.610
And yet, people have this
gut feeling, particularly

00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:12.400
but not exclusively in
Europe, that there's something

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:16.360
wrong with GMOs, because
it's not "natural."

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:19.450
And now, millions
of people need to be

00:46:19.450 --> 00:46:22.180
harmed in Africa and
South Asia, because they

00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:23.620
can't grow GMO crops.

00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:26.080
Because if they do they won't
be able to export to Europe.

00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:30.120
And agriculture is
their main industry.

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.930
And I keep coming back
to the same points.

00:46:31.930 --> 00:46:36.160
So if we want to have a
meaningful conversation that

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:39.130
can guide us and lead
us toward optimizing

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:42.190
the benefits of this incredibly
powerful and, in many ways,

00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:45.020
wonderful technology,
we all need to engage.

00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:47.410
We need to see
ourselves as shapers

00:46:47.410 --> 00:46:49.210
of this information
and ultimately

00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:50.530
regulatory environment.

00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:51.580
Yes?

00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:53.110
AUDIENCE: I was
very happy to hear

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:55.673
the piece about skin cells--

00:46:55.673 --> 00:46:57.340
being able to turn
those back into eggs.

00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:00.340
Because the undertone
of a lot of this

00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:06.020
is medicalization and control
for how women reproduce--

00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:09.140
not as a goal but
as a consequence.

00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:12.220
And it ties back to
the comments about,

00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:15.010
why don't people
pick at IVF clinics,

00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:17.890
has a lot more to
do with control--

00:47:17.890 --> 00:47:19.910
one can always argue about that.

00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:21.490
And then you take this also--

00:47:21.490 --> 00:47:22.930
you tie it to what
we already see

00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:25.810
happening across
Asia in terms of sex

00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:30.340
discrimination, abortion, which
is warping the population.

00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:34.010
We already have experience
that this has done poorly.

00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:36.880
And so one of my
concerns, as you

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:39.200
go in the world
working on this, is

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:40.450
that there are actually women.

00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:43.750
And there's work going
the reproduction side.

00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:45.553
You said, toss IVF off.

00:47:45.553 --> 00:47:46.470
Oh, yes, this is here.

00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:47.530
It's standardized.

00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:50.550
And we have a lot more multiple
births, which are hugely--

00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:51.280
JAMIE METZL: Well,
that's going down.

00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:51.680
Yeah.

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:52.263
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:52.263 --> 00:47:55.930
But they're riskier-- the chance
of it, the medicalization.

00:47:55.930 --> 00:47:57.940
This all has huge implications.

00:47:57.940 --> 00:48:00.220
We talk about, oh,
wouldn't it be lovely

00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:01.990
if your kids are smarter?

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:03.610
I have three smart kids.

00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:05.260
And asynchronous
development-- there's

00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:08.770
all of these societal
implications that are embedded

00:48:08.770 --> 00:48:10.120
in the culture assumptions.

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:11.150
Oh, this must be great.

00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:14.740
But getting there is
hugely challenging.

00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:16.390
JAMIE METZL: I totally
agree that there

00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:20.020
are huge issues of women's
health, reproductive health.

00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:24.730
And we are moving into
a new world of biology

00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:26.500
and how biology works.

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:29.710
So I've talked about
how egg cells will

00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:32.830
be created from adult cells.

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:35.390
We already have--
in the last year,

00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:40.570
two male mice have had their own
100% related biological child.

00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:44.260
Two female mice have
had their own 100%

00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:46.390
related biological child.

00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:50.160
We are moving into a
world where biology

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:54.870
is fundamentally different
than what we have known.

00:48:54.870 --> 00:49:00.030
And the possibilities that that
will bring are, in many ways,

00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:02.200
beyond most of our imagination.

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:03.090
Thank you so much.

00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:05.640
It's really been a
pleasure speaking with you.

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:09.590
