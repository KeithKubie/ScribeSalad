00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:10.580
Rejoice island hoppers you’ve got a new
spot to hop!

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.530
Hey guys Julia here for news

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.040
The new island off the coast of Tonga, a group
of polynesian islands in the Pacific, is just

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.900
a baby, barely a month old.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.680
It’s thought that the island formed when
an underwater volcano exploded then expanded.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.640
The new cone-shaped landmass is about a mile
long and according to locals from a nearby

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.460
island, the surface is still warm and smells
of sulfur.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.620
So I wouldn’t go visiting just yet.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.350
But how often are new lands formed?

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.539
Well surprisingly, pretty often.

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:41.890
Usually through a process like volcanic activity,
and it happens often around what’s called

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.159
“The Ring of Fire”.

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:48.539
This ring is a hot bed of volcanoes and seismic
activity, with over 75% of all active volcanoes

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.049
and nearly 90% of all earthquakes happening
around this region.

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:54.579
This volatile zone is the result of plate
tectonics.

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.730
It’s where the Pacific Plate meets the North
American Plate and other smaller plates.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.690
As the plates slip and slide over and under
each other, the Earth rumbles and sometimes

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.280
volcanos erupt to relieve the pressure.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.860
Sometimes when volcanoes erupt they can build
islands.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.150
Some islands come and go.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.740
But some stick around.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.100
To build a lasting island, a volcano must
build up faster than waves can erode it.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.640
Lava that solidifies on land is pretty strong
and given enough time, like millions of years,

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.420
islands could become habitable, like the Hawaiian
islands.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.640
While other processes like erosion, glacial
retreat and other mechanisms can form islands

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.939
too, most of the more recent islands were
formed by volcanic activity, like the one

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.140
off the coast of Tonga and like another recently
found in 2013 near Japan.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.840
The island is small, only 660 feet in diameter
and sits over 600 miles south of Tokyo.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.539
It’s near another uninhabited island in
the Bonin Island chain.

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:47.969
This chain sits on top of the Ring of Fire,
so there’s a chance it could produce more

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:48.969
islands.

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:51.560
But the Ring of Fire doesn’t have monopoly
over creating new lands.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.929
A rift line off the coast of Yemen created
a few new islands too.

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.640
The Zubair islands sit on top of an underwater
volcano in the Red Sea.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.740
In 2011 and 2012 a mound of lava and ash about
2,000 feet across piled up during an eruption.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.940
In 2013 a new found island, YaYa, was discovered
off the coast of Northern Russia by a helicopter

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:10.940
crew.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.400
Researchers think the island might not be
new per se, it may have first appeared in

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.570
the 20th century.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.230
It formed when another, larger ice island
melted.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.800
It’s called YaYa, because in Russia Ya means
I, and when the helicopter crew first say

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.550
the island they yelled “I, I discovered
it”.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.710
The discovery of the tiny, sandy island might
have expanded the economic exclusive zone

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.470
by a few hundred square miles.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.780
Unfortunately the last island on our list
is here for a short time.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.410
It’s sinking back into the water.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.760
It’s already sunk at least 10 feet since
it appeared a few years ago.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.330
Zalzala Koh is a tiny piece of land, about
300 feet across, that popped up off the coast

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.250
of Pakistan after a 7.7 magnitude Earthquake
in 2013.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.780
On September 26, 2013, NASA’s Earth Observing-1
satellite captured images of that new island.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.380
The surface is a mixture of mud, sand, and
rock.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.050
Some scientists think it’s a “mud volcano”
which forms when the earth pushes out a mud

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.410
like substance made from a slurry of dirt,
water, and gases.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.780
Unlike volcanic islands, it’s pretty unstable
so if you want to visit, you gotta go soon.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.920
