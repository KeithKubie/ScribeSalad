00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.939
In this lesson we'll talk about PowerBoost which is a traffic shaping

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:09.890
mechanism that was first deployed in commercial broadband

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:15.010
networks in June 2006 by Comcast. The PowerBoost allows

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:20.070
a subscriber to send at a higher rate for a

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.400
brief period of time. So if you subscribed at a rate of ten megabits per second,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.290
then PowerBoost might allow you to send at a higher rate for some period of time

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:37.484
before being shaped back to the rate at which you were subscribed at. So,

00:00:37.484 --> 00:00:40.820
PowerBoost targets the Spare Capacity in the

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.000
network for use by subscribers who don't put

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.580
a sustained load on the network. There are two types of PowerBoosts. If the rate

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.970
at which the user can achieve during this burst window is set to not exceed

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:02.212
a particular rate. Then we say that the policy is capped PowerBoost, otherwise

00:01:02.212 --> 00:01:05.248
the policy, or the shaping, is called

00:01:05.248 --> 00:01:09.364
uncapped PowerBoost. Now in the uncapped setting,

00:01:09.364 --> 00:01:15.629
the configuration is simple and as we described in the last lesson. The area

00:01:15.629 --> 00:01:20.770
here is the PowerBoost bucket size. That's the maximum amount

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.030
of traffic that can be sent that exceeds the sustained rate.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.030
The maximum sustained traffic rate is simply Rho,

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.770
as we've defined it before. Now suppose that we wanted to cap the rate that

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.810
the sender could send during the power boost window. Well all we need to do

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:47.520
in that case is to simply apply a second token bucket with another value of

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.503
Rho. That token bucket limits the peak sending rate for Power Boost eligible

00:01:54.503 --> 00:02:00.378
packets to the rate Rho C, where Rho C is larger than Rho. Remember

00:02:00.378 --> 00:02:05.805
that this value of Rho also affects how quickly tokens can refill in the bucket,

00:02:05.805 --> 00:02:08.395
so it also plays the role in the maximum

00:02:08.395 --> 00:02:12.250
rate that can be sustained during a power boost window.
