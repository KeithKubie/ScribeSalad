00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.400
Fill in the table
with whole numbers

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.200
to write 430 in
five different ways.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.980
So let's think about
this a little bit.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.120
We could literally view
this 4 as 4 hundreds.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.530
So it's 4 hundreds.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.910
And the 3 is in the tens
place, so it's 3 tens.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.109
So this is 4
hundreds and 3 tens.

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:19.900
But we could rearrange
things a little bit.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.540
For example, we might
only have 3 hundreds.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.140
So we took a hundred
from the hundreds place,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.050
and we could give it
to the tens place.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.570
So if you take that hundred
and give it to the tens place,

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.040
a hundred is 10 tens.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.450
So you've got 10 tens, and
then you already had 3 tens.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.762
So you're going to have
13 tens right over here.

00:00:39.762 --> 00:00:41.220
Now, this seems a
little confusing.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.580
Remember, this is 430.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.910
This is 300 plus 130.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.890
That's still 430.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.150
Likewise, you could view
this as 200 plus 230.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.260
230 is the same
thing as 23 tens.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.764
Same way, you could view
this as 100 plus 330.

00:01:02.764 --> 00:01:06.090
33 tens is 330.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.460
And finally, you could view
it as 0 hundreds and 43 tens.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.350
43 tens is 430.
