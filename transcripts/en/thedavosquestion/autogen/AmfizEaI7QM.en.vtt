the burden of mental disorders and brain

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550
the burden of mental disorders and brain
 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.450
the burden of mental disorders and brain
disorders is not considered enough in

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460
disorders is not considered enough in
 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.910

the media by political leaders and

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920
the media by political leaders and
 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.609
the media by political leaders and
leaders in general there is a true

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619
leaders in general there is a true
 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.189
leaders in general there is a true
burden at the economic human and

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199
burden at the economic human and
 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.280
burden at the economic human and
societal level that is related to these

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290
societal level that is related to these
 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.069
societal level that is related to these
brain disorders issues and so far there

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079
brain disorders issues and so far there
 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.049
brain disorders issues and so far there
is very little attention compared to the

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059
is very little attention compared to the
 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.389
is very little attention compared to the
importance this question so we tried to

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399
importance this question so we tried to
 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.490
importance this question so we tried to
address it at the neurological level but

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500
address it at the neurological level but
 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.979
address it at the neurological level but
also a cognitive or some of the work

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989
also a cognitive or some of the work
 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.319
also a cognitive or some of the work
we're doing on the neuroscience decision

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329
we're doing on the neuroscience decision
 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.840
we're doing on the neuroscience decision
making is quite interesting for that

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850
making is quite interesting for that
 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.400
making is quite interesting for that
matter and this is why we enjoy

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410
matter and this is why we enjoy
 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.520
matter and this is why we enjoy

example there's decision-making and

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719
example there's decision-making and
 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.459

media and Maggie munication because we

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049
media and Maggie munication because we
 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.899
media and Maggie munication because we
want to understand what is going on in

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909
want to understand what is going on in
 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.219
want to understand what is going on in
people's head whether we're talking

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229
people's head whether we're talking
 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.800
people's head whether we're talking
about a citizen or a decision-maker so

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810
about a citizen or a decision-maker so
 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.600
about a citizen or a decision-maker so
that they don't consider decision and

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610
that they don't consider decision and
 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.999
that they don't consider decision and
this is very interesting because it

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009
this is very interesting because it
 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.469
this is very interesting because it
mixes very neurological approach to the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479
mixes very neurological approach to the
 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.200
mixes very neurological approach to the
brain but also the more cognitive your

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210
brain but also the more cognitive your
 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.740
brain but also the more cognitive your
