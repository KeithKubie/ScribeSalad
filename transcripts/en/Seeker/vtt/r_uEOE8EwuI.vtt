00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.560
Popular opinion is that you should get eight hours
of sleep a night, but it might not actually be the

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.880
number of hours you sleep, but the quality
of your sleep that matters.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.740
Scientists aren’t totally sure why we evolved
to sleep.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.119
When we sleep we’re unconscious to the world
leaving us vulnerable to predators, but every

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.689
species that has been studied in detail sleeps,
so there’s something beneficial to it!

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.210
Not sleeping well isn’t just annoying, it’s
linked to poor overall health, lack of focus,

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.210
memory loss, and Alzheimer’s disease.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.210
We’ve talked about sleep a lot.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.180
Broadly speaking, there are two kinds of sleep,
non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.240
movement (REM) sleep.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.520
Together they encompass the stages of sleep
that are vital for feeling rested in the morning.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.110
If sleep is cut short we don’t go through
all these phases.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.430
This can lead to anxiety, depression, fatigue,
physical pain, and sleep disorders ranging

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.210
from insomnia to hypersomnia, which is sleeping
too much.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.490
Bad sleep can even stop us from forming memories.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.940
A new study looked at dendrites, branching
outgrowths from neurons that carry electrical

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.840
signals from synapses to the cell body.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.080
Activity in dendrites increases during sleep.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.980
That increase is linked to short and repetitive
brain waves called spindles.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.570
These spindles peak at the beginning and end
of a non-REM sleep cycle, the latter-end is

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.340
marked by slow wave activity in the brain.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.940
During that peaking you’re in a deep-sleep
phase.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.640
And without it, your memories suffer.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.670
So it’s that deep-sleep phase right before
REM sleep that we really need.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.980
The slow waves are associated with the most
prominent brain activity during sleep.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.670
They help transfer memories from the hippocampus
to the prefrontal cortex where they are consolidated

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:29.800
and stored.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.580
These slow waves are also linked to attention
in wakeful hours, heart health, metabolic

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.070
regulation, and overall cognition.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.210
By the way, missing out on that deep sleep
can be as simple as having anxiety.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.980
When we’re stressed, our bodies are primed
to respond to situations by waking up.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.740
When you’re stressed the amygdala’s “fight
or flight” response doesn’t totally shut

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.740
down.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.940
This means, you can’t enter that deep sleep
restorative phase!

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.659
Without this restorative sleep, we don’t
restore our brain to a baseline condition.

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.380
And over the years this adds up.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.950
The link between poor sleep and Alzheimer’s
isn’t from a few bad nights, it’s from

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.060
YEARS of poor sleep that doesn’t allow the
brain to properly repair itself.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.060
So what can you do?

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.709
A lot of research points to sleep hygiene
as a simple place to start.

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.510
The same way you shower to clean your body
you want to clean your sleeping space.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.739
Establishing healthy sleep habits like avoiding
caffeine in the afternoon, not napping late

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.779
in the day, keeping screens out of the bedroom,
and exposing yourself to light patterns that

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:23.269
mimic your circadian rhythm.

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.790
Of course, the stresses that are keeping your
brain from fully relaxing are less simple

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.180
to fix, but worth working on it if means healthy
sleep for a healthy life.

And speakin of…

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.569
Did you know, some birds can sleep while flying
by keeping part of their brain awake!

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.500
I wish I could do that.
