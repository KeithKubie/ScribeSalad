00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.220
Thanks to graphene, ultra-high pitched sonar
is now possible.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.669
Graphene you are like the Superman of materials.

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:07.669
Or…

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:09.050
Would sonar make it more like Batman?

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:16.440
I don’t know stuff about comics.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.420
Hi science lovers, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.320
I’m sure the majority of you know what sonar
is but just in case, I’ll explain.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.680
Sonar stands for SOund Navigation And Ranging,
and it involves sending out a sound wave and

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.140
bouncing it off an object.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.679
Timing how long it takes to come back will
tell you how far away the object is, which

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:34.739
is the same principle as radar.

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.219
Humans use it mostly under water because the
mechanical sound waves travel well through

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.499
it, while the electromagnetic waves from radar
get attenuated by the water much more quickly.

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:46.539
People with satellite TV who lose signal on
really stormy days know what I’m talking

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:47.539
about.

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.889
Sonar is said to have been invented in 1490
when Leonardo Da Vinci stuck a tube in water

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:54.710
and listened to ships pass but really, a tube?

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.159
Does that count as an invention?

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:58.049
That’s just sloppy, Leo.

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:01.949
Anyway, sonar has been around long before
Da Vinci came along and invented everything.

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.390
Famously dolphins and bats use high frequency
sounds to echo-locate and communicate.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.280
We’re talking really high frequency too.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.520
A human can hear sounds from 20 Hz to 20,000
Hz, and that’s if they have amazing hearing

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.619
and are young and never go to concerts.

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.670
We hear best where human speech speech lives,
in the 1000 to 5000 Hz range, or 1-5 kHz.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.900
Some species of bats can hear as low as 1
kHz too, but a bat’s hearing may be as high

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.289
pitched as 200 kilohertz.

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:31.490
Literally 10 times higher than humans.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.920
It’s not easy for our equipment to detect
or emit sounds that high.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.960
Dynamic microphones work when sound waves
vibrate a diaphragm, which in turn causes

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.749
a magnet to move around a wire and generate
an electrical current, and speakers work the

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:44.479
same way but in reverse.

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.600
The diaphragms in these mics and speakers
are usually paper or plastic, which aren’t

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.140
sensitive enough for detecting ultra-high
frequencies.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.850
Now, thanks to the wondiferous material of
graphene, a huge range of frequencies can

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.299
be detected and reproduced.

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.259
It’s because graphene is so thin.

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.180
It’s just, say it with me now, one atom
thick.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.710
Scientists at UC Berkeley realized this would
make it an ideal diaphragm, and have created

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.420
microphones and speakers that work well below
20 Hz and all the way up to 500 kHz.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.580
Yeah, you thought you were bad, bats.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.580
Now what?

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.610
Actually studying bats was one of the first
tests for these new microphones.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.050
The researchers took them to a nearby park
to test them out and found the mics pick up

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.600
the bats chirps well across the spectrum.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.630
Plus they’re so small they can actually
be mounted on the bats themselves.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.580
Aside from studying bats, the mics and speakers
could have loads of other uses.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.050
The speakers can emit sharp pulses at high
frequencies, meaning they can be used for

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.140
measuring distance much more accurately than
traditional methods.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.730
The researchers envision a world where ultrasound
is part of your cell-phone’s arsenal for

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:43.730
communication.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.710
I’m thinking that’s not creative enough
though.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.440
What about a personal sonar device for the
blind?

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.140
Or since these graphene speakers are 99% efficient
at turning electricity into sound, compared

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.690
to the 8% efficiency of your headphones, why
not have some killer and lightweight portable

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.690
stereos?

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.990
The researchers even claim the sound waves
can penetrate objects like steel, something

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.200
radio waves can’t do.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.510
If you can convert those sound waves into
an image…

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.870
X-Ray vision, anyone?

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.630
Let’s innovate, guys!

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.340
One company that’s innovating all over the
place is Intel.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.620
With processors, wearables, datacenters, devices
on the internet of things, and of course,

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.380
in your Mac or PC, Intel is driving innovation.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.810
If there’s Intel inside, you’re going
to have a better experience outside.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.860
They’re creating breakthrough technologies
that make amazing experiences possible, and

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.640
they like us, so they make DNews possible
too.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.540
Bat sonar is pretty incredible but nature
is an arms race, and some moths have evolved

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.960
a way to go stealth mode.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:46.270
Check out the amazing story here.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.030
How would you used these graphene mics and
speakers?

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.910
Do you have some ingenious use I didn’t
come up with?
