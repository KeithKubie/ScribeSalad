1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,410
What will happen. The Joe Rogan
experience. I love what Jon Anik said too.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,430
He loves when he fights cause then
Bruce buffer has to say, your boy,

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,010
boy,
boy.

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,630
Hey, why does it, where
does keep a suits man?

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,390
He's got a new suit is a
bad mother fucker dude.

6
00:00:21,391 --> 00:00:23,820
The insides of always has
like different decorations.

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,900
Shit come ever eight different places
where we're at. Bruce Buffer, he's,

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,670
he's got style. I just imagined him
have a level on his house just, Oh yeah,

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,150
I'm all, you know what I mean? Like
you go do it Nordstrom or something,

10
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:40,080
but his is just all the suits. That
was Warren before. I mean I'm less,

11
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,680
he donated so he might
donate them to charity now.

12
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,960
That might be one of the art auction
them for charity or something like that.

13
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:48,720
That'd be good. Yeah.
He's a, he's a fun dude.

14
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,070
He's the best ring announcer
of all time to men.

15
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,520
When that guy starts wailing and
he gets so pumped up, seriously,

16
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:58,980
this is fucking hurt. Gets right.
It's like he's so intense, man.

17
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,840
I give you watched boxing,
they're much more smoothly. Yeah.

18
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,680
Bruce buffer gets into
it, man. He digs in.

19
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:11,340
I remember seeing him first yell at like
at Tj Dillashaw and he was like, oh.

20
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,630
I was like, Oh shit. It gives
you goosebumps. It really does.

21
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:18,540
It gives you goosebumps. Yeah. You just
feel the energy, right? You're just like,

22
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:20,850
I'm there waiting, ready for a
fight. Look, I'm kind of nervous.

23
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:24,360
And then Bruce comes over like, yeah,
out of the blue corner. You're like,

24
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,020
all right.

25
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,490
Talking about dude who blew his ACL out
from jumping up in the rear while he was

26
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:33,990
reading his name. Oh my God. 10
gets bruised here at tough duty.

27
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,650
Okay.
