1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,380
[inaudible].

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,000
All right, so let's do this. I
want to do gun one on one with you.

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:12,860
All the things that we should know about
nuns and then I want to do the most

4
00:00:12,861 --> 00:00:17,120
common misconceptions about guns because
I think part of the issue right now is

5
00:00:17,121 --> 00:00:20,330
every time something happens,
every time there's a shooting,

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,210
half the people don't know
anything about guns. On one hand,

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,630
half the people then give you
all of those misconceptions.

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,680
It gets it confusing for everybody.
And even the people who I generally trust,

9
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,230
I sense don't know exactly
what they're saying.

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,600
So I want to do a video
with you right now.

11
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:40,820
Every time one of these incidences
happen and someone starts asking me this,

12
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,110
asking me that I want to go,

13
00:00:42,111 --> 00:00:45,740
I've got the thing that I can point
to with the answers. So let's do gun.

14
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:50,030
What on one? What do we need to know
about guns? All right. First and foremost,

15
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,950
ar does not stand for assault rifle.

16
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,730
So when I say ar 15 that's not assault
rifle does not mean assault rifle.

17
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,360
And the assault rifle is a gun
that is fully automatic, right?

18
00:00:59,361 --> 00:01:01,910
That means I pulled the trigger,
I hold it back and an expense,

19
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,030
all of the ammunition into a magazine.
So that's,

20
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:08,320
that's Jesse Ventura in Predator. Boom.
Okay, that's a great guy. Love that guy.

21
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:13,280
I can argue about, not going to say, I
wouldn't mind owning again. Um, so okay,

22
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,960
so that's automatic yet just hold it
down and down. It will fire every round,

23
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,980
uh, subsequently until it's
completely out. Okay. Right.

24
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,890
And does so at a very high rate of
speed. Okay. Generally speaking,

25
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:29,330
somebody automatic so that there's been
this thing where people conflate this or

26
00:01:29,331 --> 00:01:34,250
use somebody automatic as a kind of a
hyperbolic way of characterizing guns as

27
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:38,750
death killing machines. Right? Virtually
every modern gun is semiautomatic.

28
00:01:38,751 --> 00:01:41,420
And what that means is
one press of the sugar,

29
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,530
you get one bullet versus holding the
trigger down once and getting all of the

30
00:01:45,531 --> 00:01:47,900
bullets. Okay. So that's a
great distinction right there.

31
00:01:47,901 --> 00:01:50,630
Cause often when this happens,
you see people saying,

32
00:01:50,631 --> 00:01:55,270
we have to band semiautomatics
semiautomatic. That's
virtually every month. Yeah.

33
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,090
He's just so it's not because all that,
the only difference between that and uh,

34
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,270
what I guess it's fully automatic stuff.
Well,

35
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,990
what's one that you're just loading
one bullet in the that. Okay.

36
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:07,950
So that would be a bolt action,
right?

37
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,830
So there's fully automatic semi
automatic and bolt actions, right?

38
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,960
Bolt action more. Uh, it was more
aligned to like, like hunting, right,

39
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,420
or high purpose,
high precision shooting.

40
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,560
And it's a bolt because it allows you
to build the gun up in such a way where

41
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,250
you [inaudible] at the tighter constraints
within a gun and it allows you to be

42
00:02:25,251 --> 00:02:28,970
more accurate without certain mechanism
moving back and forth, causing,

43
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,080
throwing off the accuracy of the shot.
So you would say then that when,

44
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:36,080
when all of these people come out and
say we have to ban semiautomatics,

45
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,120
that they are actually just flat out
confused or intentionally conflating or a

46
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,620
obfuscating what the truth is
related to them? Yes, absolutely.

47
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,040
And so it's either they're ignorant or
they're doing a purpose for like you just

48
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,610
stated. Okay. So what is the, so
let's do some NRA stuff while we're,

49
00:02:52,611 --> 00:02:53,444
while we're doing this,

50
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,980
what does the NRA stance on automatics
just being able to hold and, and shoot.

51
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,110
I mean the, it's currently
regulated is the way it stands.

52
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:05,170
Like right now there's this like
in order to get an automatic gun,

53
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:08,660
there's a certain process you have to
go through in order to get them and that

54
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,380
and that. It's been that way
for a very long time now.

55
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,670
And that's been that it
exists as it does now. Um,

56
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,750
and that's essentially war where the
stance is that fully automatic guns,

57
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:24,280
what are people using fully
automatic guns for? So, um,

58
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,050
cause I think this is where
you'll hear people go,

59
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:28,330
well no one needs an automatic to huh.
We'll see. Here's the thing though,

60
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,380
it's the idea of putting it under
the guise of a needing, right,

61
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,550
their name another right. Where we
use that same standard, you know,

62
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,790
begs the question. It's
so it's like, okay,

63
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,240
you haven't fully automatic gun and you
have semiautomatic gun shot, bolt action.

64
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:46,030
There are different reasons why
you would want each of these guns.

65
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,710
Now I can delve into that.

66
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:52,620
But then that starts getting into the
very nerdy side of firearm ownership where

67
00:03:52,621 --> 00:03:54,850
they're enthusiasts aspect
of that comes into it.

68
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:59,440
It's understanding tactically why you
would want certain things. And so for me,

69
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,900
I'm not personally, I don't have a problem
with people on a fully automatic gun.

70
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,170
Personally.
I,

71
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:10,060
I just don't see that as a significant
danger above and beyond say owning a

72
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:12,070
nuclear suitcase.
Right?

73
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,160
So if people tried to make that absurd
argument to me before, it's like,

74
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:17,680
well then walled true real other than,
well that's because there's a,

75
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:21,630
there's a cost benefit ratio that
doesn't make any sense, right? The,

76
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,710
that you just, that's inherently
self destruction. So how was,

77
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,930
how is that protecting you in any way
from the very thing that you're supposed

78
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:29,800
to be taking yourself against?

79
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,520
Do you think there should be a higher
threshold to be able to get an automatic

80
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,700
than some of the other records
you're talking about? Me Personally?

81
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:41,230
Threshold in what respect? Like in terms
of either hire back, graded background,

82
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:43,290
Chang's or references.
So let's,

83
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,010
so let's talk about background
checks for a minute.

84
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,730
So there's this identity
[inaudible] notion that we
don't have background checks

85
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:53,380
for guns. We do. And the funny
thing is we in the gun community,

86
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:55,330
because I've become a
victim of technology,

87
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,090
and what I mean by that is people think
that just because I can go into a guns

88
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:03,070
if I really wanted to, I can go on gun
store right now by gun within two minutes.

89
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,710
Just like that. You can, yeah,
because you've done all of
the background stuff. See,

90
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:12,490
that's the thing though. I'm still going
under. I'm undergoing the same processes.

91
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,750
So I go into a store, I find
the gun, I like this gun.

92
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,980
I said I want to buy this gun.

93
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,780
I fill out the 40 four's a form 44 73
which asked me a series of questions.

94
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,650
Then they take that information and they
submit it to the FBI database and they

95
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,880
do a background check. But it
happens instantly because technology,

96
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,320
right people,

97
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,500
it's interesting because there's a lot
of people who feel like I should undergo

98
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,320
some type of CIA investigation
before I buy a gun.

99
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,700
The same people who also hate the
government. Exactly. Right. So when they,

100
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,230
the instant aspect of the background
check causes people who don't know very

101
00:05:47,231 --> 00:05:50,020
much about the process to think
that there isn't one. Right.

102
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:53,110
Just because I can buy the gun easily
doesn't mean it was done thoroughly.

103
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,230
You know what I'm saying?
I underwent the background check.

104
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,580
There's a system there,
they checked it against the system.

105
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,970
I don't have any felonies or anything
that prevents me from owning a firearm.

106
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,660
I'm allowed to buy the gun. Okay.
So when people say there are,

107
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:09,290
there are no background checks are
background checks aren't tight enough or

108
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,910
however you want to extrapolate that,

109
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:15,140
is there any credence to any of that
that that you can, so now let's talk.

110
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:15,921
So I think what you're,

111
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:18,950
what you're kind of going into is the
universal background checks, right?

112
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:23,000
So when they say universal back now
they do conflate these terminologies.

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,960
There's universal background check
is a very specific statement.

114
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,690
It's not like saying coke,
right?

115
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:31,340
Cause people here universal
background checks on all the,

116
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:34,310
here's the background check part.
That universal means something.

117
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,960
And what that means is it's a requirement
that on every single transaction you

118
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:41,840
have to undergo a background check,
even private transactions. Right?

119
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,110
So right now in California,
if I had a gun, right,

120
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,260
I can bring a gun into California. Just
can't carry it. But you were like, hey,

121
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:50,250
you know what kinds I liked
that gun you have, right?

122
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,630
I want to buy from you in California.

123
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:58,010
I can't sell it to you right
now. What? Here's what I can
do. I can say, all right,

124
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,050
cool.
When I get back to Texas,

125
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,560
I'll transfer the gun to a
gun store here in California,

126
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:07,610
if it's on the specific list that allows
you to actually own that gun. Right?

127
00:07:07,611 --> 00:07:10,850
Cause Cause California has a
designated or exactly I stuff. Yeah.

128
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:16,150
And then you would have to go to the
gun store and then buy it right now

129
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,220
let's say I decided to
give you the gun anyway,

130
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,180
privately right now in this room.
No one else is here.

131
00:07:24,181 --> 00:07:28,090
But you went on and I saw the, the gun.
Let me shut the cameras, Huh? Yeah. Yeah.

132
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:32,370
I don't have any plans on going to
jail. But, and I sell you the gun,

133
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,940
you and then let's say you have the gun,

134
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,190
what is there to check against what
databases that are check against to

135
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,990
determine whether or not you got a
background check for that gun now just

136
00:07:42,991 --> 00:07:46,260
completed two issues right now. Yeah,
so, well if we did it on the DL there,

137
00:07:46,261 --> 00:07:47,340
there's no,
there's no way.

138
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,920
And that's what the whole concept of
the universal background check is.

139
00:07:49,921 --> 00:07:54,570
It is to require a background check
for every private transaction. Now,

140
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,010
legally,
right now I can't do it,

141
00:07:56,011 --> 00:08:00,960
but like in Texas I can sell a gun to a
friend and as long as I know he's not a

142
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:05,880
prohibited person and I know he's
not a felon, I can sell him that gun.

143
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,180
No problems.
That's completely illegal.

144
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,980
What the universal background check
idea s suggested I should have,

145
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,340
I should be required to
undergo a background check
before I can sell in that gun.

146
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:18,780
And that would mean you,

147
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,380
he and I would have to go to a gun
store and undergo a background check.

148
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,980
Then he can go and buy the gun from me.
So is the problem with the way it is,

149
00:08:25,981 --> 00:08:27,120
Carly say in Texas,

150
00:08:27,121 --> 00:08:31,020
the way you're describing that you
just would not know potentially enough

151
00:08:31,021 --> 00:08:34,290
information about the person you were
selling it to? Yes. That's a potential.

152
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,303
Absolutely.

153
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:39,780
And so the reason why I'm against the
universal background check is because

154
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:44,160
there is no other way to enforce it.
But for a national gun registry,

155
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,490
because otherwise you have nothing
to check it against. Right.

156
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,070
To say if a cop walks on the street
and you have a gun, he was like,

157
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,540
do you get a background
check for that gun? Yeah.

158
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,550
How's it going to prove otherwise?

159
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,700
Unless there's a national registry
and then as I was, okay, fine,

160
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,310
well then let's have a national registry.
No,

161
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:03,330
because we've seen time and time again
that when the governments have a national

162
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:06,300
registry for firearms, they
subsequently use it to confiscate guns.

163
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:11,010
Now the problem is when you say that
they try to put the tin foil hat on you,

164
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:16,290
right. Except because what
they, what they envision is,

165
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,210
you know,
roaring truck,

166
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:21,180
black military trucks coming down the
street pulling guns from people's houses.

167
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,560
No, that's not what happens or how
they do it. It's a constructive.

168
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,800
And then when you have potential
presidential candidates
like Hillary Clinton's

169
00:09:29,801 --> 00:09:32,670
suggesting we should take apart,
we should take up the Australia model,

170
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,250
which did that very thing.
They use the national,

171
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:39,060
they use a national gun registration
to tell people to say, you know what,

172
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:44,460
you need to turn in your guns.
It's a voluntary buyback. No,

173
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:48,060
it's an NGO. It's a, it's a
mandatory buyback. Right. So,

174
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:51,270
and if you don't sell your guns
back, guess what? You go to jail.

175
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,500
That's a confiscation. Yeah,
it's a constructive confiscation,

176
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:57,210
but a compensation nonetheless.

177
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,330
Just because they didn't roll the military
trucks down the street and pull them

178
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:04,230
out of your house doesn't mean it isn't
confiscation. And so that's why I'm,

179
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,720
I'm adamantly against
universal background checks.

180
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:10,500
Unless you can demonstrate away from me
for it to be applied in such a way that

181
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:11,970
would now require gun registry.

182
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,860
Because I do not trust my government
not to exploit that registry in their

183
00:10:16,861 --> 00:10:20,310
favor. Yeah. So how much of this
then, cause we've talked about it,

184
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,930
you said to me right before we started,

185
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:25,260
you're sort of a libertarian I
think is exactly what he said.

186
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:26,280
I don't want to put words in your mouth.

187
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,650
How much of this does go back to that
states should be able to make the

188
00:10:31,651 --> 00:10:33,240
decisions that they see fit.

189
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:37,410
I mean I suspect you probably wouldn't
be that thrilled living in California.

190
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:42,310
So that's in the weather. I, I'm here in
California. Whether the women the food.

191
00:10:42,311 --> 00:10:46,590
Yeah. But yeah, it's pretty good
food in Texas. Yeah, we do. Yeah.

192
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:51,330
I'm not complaining about that. Um,
so see that's just it too. It's like,

193
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,060
well how far those stay towards go from
the standpoint of violating my second

194
00:10:54,061 --> 00:10:57,420
amendment. Right. Right. I believe in
states' right. Try them to a point.

195
00:10:57,421 --> 00:10:59,130
You start violating my
constitutional ones.

196
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:03,660
And so when you have places
like California, which I think,

197
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,020
I think I'm being currently violated now,
the fact that I can't carry my gun,

198
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,390
what is the difference I can take?

199
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:14,100
I can take my car with my Texas license
and drive it right into California.

200
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,270
No one has a problem with that.

201
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,540
I can drive up and down these
roads and as fast as I want,

202
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:21,510
as recklessly as I want. Yeah. That
might be illegal, but I still do it.

203
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,500
Does that potentially do it?

204
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:27,501
But yet I can't carry the thing that I
carry to protect my life with the same

205
00:11:27,961 --> 00:11:28,794
license.

206
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:34,790
That doesn't make no sense to me like I
am I any in any less danger here than I

207
00:11:34,951 --> 00:11:38,090
would be in Texas. If anything, I can
make the argument that I'm more, I,

208
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,950
there's more danger from me here in
that I don't know the area very well.

209
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,920
So in a weird way, you're actually making
a non states' rights argument here,

210
00:11:43,921 --> 00:11:47,580
right? Because if you're saying you
want the same thing everywhere, that's,

211
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,490
that's not a states' rights argument.
It's not that. But that's what I'm saying.

212
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,050
Yeah.
Because,

213
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:56,320
but that's under guise of meat feeling
like me not being able to carry as a

214
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:59,280
violation of my constitutional
right. Right. Because states rights,

215
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,190
it doesn't allow them to violate those
constitutional rights. And that's,

216
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,940
that's the argument I'm making now.

217
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:07,990
It's difficult because then
you start talking about the
idea of having a uniform,

218
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,640
like concealed carry platform, right? Um,

219
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:14,740
where one license allows you to
carry a gun everywhere, right?

220
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,630
Then you start getting into the weeds of,
okay,

221
00:12:16,631 --> 00:12:18,070
well that's violating state's rights,

222
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,420
but that's only if you don't see my
ability to carry a firearm as a, as a, um,

223
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,350
sorry,
uh,

224
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,290
my ability to carry a firearm as a
violation of my constitutional rights.

225
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,620
It's an interesting philosophical
place to talk because it's like,

226
00:12:29,621 --> 00:12:31,140
it just depends where you start.
Yeah.

227
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,750
Because even though I'm definitely
a states' rights guy, I,

228
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,670
I hear what you say there. And then on
the other hand, as a state's rights guy,

229
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,421
to me,

230
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:42,280
if a state wants to have stricter
laws and you are a big gun guy,

231
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:44,950
then you actually are allowed to leave.
It's kind of it as,

232
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:48,340
I would say for virtually every
other situation, it's kind of shitty.

233
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,100
It doesn't feel great to have to
leave a place that you want to be at.

234
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:54,850
But if they're doing things as part of
their state experiment that you don't

235
00:12:54,851 --> 00:12:58,110
like, well it's on, it's on you
to get gold. Yeah. But if that,

236
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,860
if that same state creates a law that
violates my right to privacy, right.

237
00:13:02,861 --> 00:13:06,970
Well we have constitutional rights that
supersede. So I get, I get the trailer.

238
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:08,950
Are we missing anything
else on the technical front?

239
00:13:08,951 --> 00:13:11,400
Cause we did that pretty calm,
uh,

240
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,210
from a mechanical standpoint just for
them and the mechanical standpoint or,

241
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,370
or just any of the language that we use
related to this. Okay. Okay. So yeah.

242
00:13:21,371 --> 00:13:24,130
So then of course there's some
people can say it's trivial,

243
00:13:24,131 --> 00:13:28,410
some people say it's not. So the
magazine versus clip, it's general terms.

244
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,030
It's actually, it's called a
magazine, a clip as an actual thing.

245
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:35,410
It's just different from a magazine that,
that that's kind of slightly trivial,

246
00:13:35,411 --> 00:13:40,411
but it does typically kind of exposed
people who don't really know much about

247
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:43,240
guns.
When you say clip versus magazine,

248
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,540
cause the proper terminology
would be magazine. Um,

249
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,330
as far as any other mechanical components,
well,

250
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,500
what do I need to know about the magazine
though? Well, that's just terminology.

251
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,790
This is semantics,
right?

252
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:59,830
I don't always go about correcting people
because I feel like it just creates it.

253
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,920
It kind of makes me look
like an ass to a degree,

254
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,280
but that's why we're doing this.
I want to clean up.

255
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,940
The biggest thing is just the
assault weapon thing, right?

256
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:14,480
Because the Ar 15 is this
a villian weapon? It's,

257
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:19,550
it's designated as the biggest difference
between an ar 15 and an assault rifle

258
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:24,190
is that the assault rifles,
fully automatic and they are 15 isn't,

259
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:28,990
that's the biggest distinction
between the two. Now of course,

260
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:31,420
then you could make the argument,
well that's some very minor distinction.

261
00:14:31,421 --> 00:14:33,610
You know, there's a lot of
people who make that argument,

262
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:38,970
but I don't look at the Ar
15 any differently than I
look at the handgun in that

263
00:14:40,451 --> 00:14:40,860
sense.

264
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,700
So every time when one of these happens
and we hear the Ar 15 is a weapon of war

265
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,020
and Solo handguns,

266
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,840
you would basically put their 15 in
the handgun in the same category. Yes.

267
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:55,550
As pulling ones. Yeah. She
even once, yeah. So that
would not be categorized as a,

268
00:14:55,551 --> 00:14:58,400
as a weapon of war. We'll see
that steam, that estimation,

269
00:14:58,401 --> 00:15:01,320
that terminology is designed to,

270
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:06,410
to manipulate the emotions of people
who don't know anything about guns.

271
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:10,100
So when you hear, if you don't know
anything about firearms and you here,

272
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:15,080
he used a weapon of war, technically
speaking all guns or weapons before,

273
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:18,530
right? So words can be weapons
of war. Exactly. Yeah. So,

274
00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:20,210
but what that does mentally,

275
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,070
like they understand language
very well and I tell you, they,

276
00:15:23,071 --> 00:15:25,240
they liked turned like 90 human.
But

277
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:30,410
in terms of the,
I call it the anti gun side of it,

278
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,950
of things they understand the use
of language very well. And um,

279
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,660
and they confuse it purposely.

280
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,030
So when you hear someone who doesn't
know anything about firearms,

281
00:15:38,031 --> 00:15:38,864
think about it.
Like if,

282
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,350
if I'm already kind of how I'm a little
scared of firearms and enter here,

283
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:47,360
he used a weapon of war.
What image comes up in your mind?

284
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,360
It's, it's Rambo, you
know, just running down.

285
00:15:50,361 --> 00:15:53,090
They're just going crazy and
that's exactly what he's doing.

286
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:56,940
He could do the same thing with
the handgun. And so the, the,

287
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,370
the biggest thing that I like to,

288
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,790
when I'm having these conversations with
people, you're going to walk away with,

289
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,640
we gonna walk away with two with two
points of two trains of thoughts.

290
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,420
I'm either going to get you to admit
you just want to ban all guns or you can

291
00:16:08,421 --> 00:16:12,650
see my perspective because if you're,
if you're willing to say, you know what,

292
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,280
we need to get rid of all
this salt weapons as they,

293
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,050
as they understand them to be,

294
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:21,740
which is essentially ar fifteens but now
it's actually become even more broader.

295
00:16:21,741 --> 00:16:23,930
Like we to get rid of all
semiautomatic weapons, right?

296
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,460
That's virtually every modern gun.

297
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:30,940
So let's say that they want a band aid
off fifteens air 15th rifles aren't even

298
00:16:31,521 --> 00:16:32,870
used. Like the, the,

299
00:16:32,871 --> 00:16:37,871
the percentage that rifles are used in
actual shootings is so low and marginal.

300
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:43,340
It's, it's unreal. So then why
are we focusing on that? But okay,

301
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,910
so then what are emotions
are hand guns. Yeah. Right?

302
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,160
So if you get rid of that,

303
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:53,060
and we got rid of Ar 15 and then we have
another shooting happened because the

304
00:16:53,061 --> 00:16:56,990
are most deadliest school mass shooting
was Virginia Tech and he used the hangar.

305
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,050
So then what happens
if that happens again?

306
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,260
So now what are you going to
ban you in the band handgun?

307
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,440
And that's when you're stuck having
to confront the fact that okay,

308
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:10,640
either you really just want to ban
all guns or you understand that the

309
00:17:10,641 --> 00:17:13,040
distinction is irrelevant,
right?

310
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:18,070
With God to get to the absolute point of
issue in why these things are happening

311
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:22,160
and focusing on gun is doing a
disservice to the conversation.

312
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:26,090
It sounds like I'm just utilizing,
I'm using the bigger issue as a scapegoat,

313
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:29,470
but in reality, if you really sit
down and think about it, right?

314
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,250
We have over 300 close to 400 million
guns in this country and not going

315
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:39,080
anywhere and understanding that you've
got to then sit down and say to yourself,

316
00:17:39,081 --> 00:17:39,914
all right,

317
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:44,330
if we're going to try to fix this issue
of gun violence or just violence in

318
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:47,840
general, we've got to get to the root
of issue of why people are doing it.

319
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,960
And then understanding that staying
within the context of reality,

320
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:54,810
we've got to understand
well in the process,

321
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:58,670
I still have to protect myself and
because people are still stupid,

322
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,080
still gonna be able to get their
hands on guns, whether illegal or not,

323
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:04,440
and and use them to commit crimes
in the Brighton people's lives.

324
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:09,280
I've got to be put in a
situation to defend against
that so you can bend all the

325
00:18:09,281 --> 00:18:10,410
Ar 15 what does it mean?

326
00:18:10,411 --> 00:18:13,980
It's going to stop somebody from getting
one on a black market. So now, yes,

327
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:18,900
I don't run from the fact that the ar
15 is a more powerful platform that I

328
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:21,420
agree with and I don't think I,
I don't run from that.

329
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:23,910
They're going to be people on there who
are going to be mad at me for saying

330
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:24,390
that.

331
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:27,240
But the reason why it'll rough on me
just because that's the very reason why I

332
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:29,910
want an ar 15 when it
comes to defending my life.

333
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,410
I don't want it to be a fair fight.

334
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:32,563
Hmm.

335
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:33,660
Period.

336
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,720
I don't want to have to confront someone
with an ar 15 with a hand gun if I

337
00:18:36,721 --> 00:18:40,470
don't have to. If you come in my
house, I'm not grabbing a handgun.

338
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,380
I'm grabbing in the office.

339
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,930
Okay, let's see. We have this strange
thing. It's like when people will say,

340
00:18:44,931 --> 00:18:46,180
I'm okay.
Well the,

341
00:18:46,181 --> 00:18:49,160
the Second Amendment says the right
to bear arms and then they'll put up a

342
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:52,770
picture of, you know, the type of
arms that existed way back when and,

343
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,140
and it's like, well then we
should be have the right to that.

344
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,530
Cause that's what they
were talking about it.

345
00:18:56,531 --> 00:18:59,090
It's like this is so
disingenuine very disingenuous.

346
00:18:59,091 --> 00:19:03,170
It's like they were also talking about
why you should be able to form a militia.

347
00:19:03,171 --> 00:19:07,220
And it's like the thing that we'd be
fighting against now has a lot more power.

348
00:19:07,221 --> 00:19:08,960
And it doesn't mean that just
cause you have some guns,

349
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,840
you're gonna be able to stop the guys
in the black trucks as you talked about

350
00:19:11,841 --> 00:19:15,680
earlier. But maybe you could defend
yourself a little bit longer.

351
00:19:15,681 --> 00:19:17,810
And who knows what happens
with a little bit of time.

352
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,600
I mean fruit and be real with it.

353
00:19:19,601 --> 00:19:22,270
They're still fighting in Afghanistan
and those guys over there just use an AK

354
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,790
47 huh?
You get what I'm saying?

355
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,240
So like we can't just because we're
going to lose anything that you just lie

356
00:19:28,241 --> 00:19:32,710
down and do it, you know?
And the whole notion of like,

357
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,380
um, ah man, I just lost
the train of thought.

358
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:41,210
This idea of owning firearms
to combat the government.

359
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,310
It's in and they think it's preposterous.
But I'm like,

360
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,660
ask the people in Venezuela

361
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,760
what's going on? And again,
these are now the people,

362
00:19:50,761 --> 00:19:52,150
at least in this current moment,

363
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,950
people who say that the government is
run by Orange Hitler. Exactly, man.

364
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,610
It's it really well. Well this is a
good spot to I think change to mind.

365
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,370
And as I said to you before we sat down,

366
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:06,960
I've never considered myself a gun
person per se. Uh, I'm interested in,

367
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:09,240
I'm always interested in
talking about these things,

368
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,360
but I do find myself now more pro gun.

369
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:14,530
It's probably not even the
right phrase to say, yeah,

370
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,340
then I've ever been in my life and I,
but that had for me,

371
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,410
it has more to do with that.

372
00:20:19,411 --> 00:20:24,411
I really understanding what rights are
in a much clearer way and what I want the

373
00:20:24,721 --> 00:20:28,530
government to do and not do. And
once you understand that, then

374
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,990
you know, it's tough. It's tough
to take other positions. It is.

375
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:38,490
So is there anything to you that when
they always say sensible gun control and

376
00:20:38,491 --> 00:20:40,680
I'll always see the pro gun,
people will say,

377
00:20:40,681 --> 00:20:43,560
well the people that always say that just
don't know what they're talking about.

378
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,280
And I sense you're probably in that spot
cause that you were just saying what

379
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,620
they do with language.
Yeah.

380
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,080
So sensible gun control.

381
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,690
Most of the time when people say that
they actually advocate things we already

382
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:57,370
have. So bad background checks,
things of that nature. Right.

383
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:01,730
And then you like, and you
have other language like the,
the loop, uh, the gun show,

384
00:21:01,731 --> 00:21:05,170
the gun, the gun show loophole.
Yeah, let's talk about
that. That's not a loophole.

385
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:09,250
All the, all that is, is a private
transaction. That's all that is.

386
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:12,730
And it's just happening, happening and
just so happened to happen at a gun show.

387
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,820
If you bought a gun from an
actual dealer at a gun show,

388
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,700
you still have to undergo
a background check. So the,

389
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,310
when they say loophole with a loose
saying is that if you are at a gun show,

390
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:29,320
you're not a dealer, you can actually
sell that gun at the, if you are,

391
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:32,710
if one the person's not a prohibited
possessor, you are from the same state,

392
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:36,580
then yes. If they, if there's nothing
that precludes them from owning a firearm,

393
00:21:36,581 --> 00:21:40,090
legally I can sell them a
gun at a gun show. Right.

394
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,270
So the only slippery part of that
is what we talked about earlier,

395
00:21:43,271 --> 00:21:46,840
which is you just may not know all the
information. Exactly. Cause there is a,

396
00:21:46,841 --> 00:21:49,960
there is, I guess there's a little
bit of a gray area and that one,

397
00:21:49,961 --> 00:21:52,570
is that a fair in terms of the yeah,

398
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:55,030
that you're sort of taking
somebody's word for it at that point.

399
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:58,090
[inaudible] meets somebody that day and
they're like, I want to buy that gun.

400
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,760
And you say to them, you ask them
all the appropriate questions,

401
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:04,410
they could be lying to you.
Absolutely. But that's just, yeah.

402
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:08,840
But then that sold in the way the
response that they have to that is the

403
00:22:08,841 --> 00:22:12,250
universal background check. But
as I pointed out, how do you,

404
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,860
how do you enforce it
without a national registry?

405
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,550
And then with that national registry,
even with the national registry,

406
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:21,690
it doesn't stop anything.
Right? We, we, we,

407
00:22:21,691 --> 00:22:25,810
we tend to go down this
road of just wanting to do
things to make ourselves feel

408
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,730
better.
But in reality,

409
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:32,800
namely one mass shooting that would've
been prevented with the universal

410
00:22:32,801 --> 00:22:35,230
background check.
Now one,

411
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,220
because even the people who had gone
to aren't supposed to have them,

412
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:41,590
they got them illegally.
Right.

413
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,380
It wasn't because there wasn't a universal
background check that stopped him

414
00:22:44,381 --> 00:22:48,820
from getting it. No, it wasn't. So I
have to, I have to ask the question,

415
00:22:48,821 --> 00:22:51,940
I go then why are we doing this other
than just to make ourselves feel better

416
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:55,870
cause it's literally doing nothing.
Nothing.

417
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:00,910
And so that's why like the person who
who bought and sold a gun privately at a,

418
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:05,290
at a gun show could have done that
in the parking lot of the gun show,

419
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,050
could have done it at their house
before going to the gun show.

420
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,063
You get what I'm saying?

421
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,910
But what it does is when you frame
it within the context of the gun show

422
00:23:12,911 --> 00:23:13,744
loophole,

423
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:17,650
it makes it seem like it's this bizarre
where everyone comes there together and

424
00:23:17,651 --> 00:23:21,190
sells illegal guns. Right, right. That's
the image that's created in the mind.

425
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,890
Like it's barter town.
Exactly. Like they feed on,

426
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,430
they feed on the ignorance of people.
Right. Because like they're not,

427
00:23:27,431 --> 00:23:30,190
everybody knows that much about guns.
It's like, it's one of those things,

428
00:23:30,191 --> 00:23:31,480
it's like,
I don't know.

429
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:35,080
I don't know a lot about a lot of other
things that people may know a lot about.

430
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,920
Right.

431
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,700
So if you tell me something and I'm not
really researched and schooled on that

432
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:43,390
issue, you can give me the beliefs
from pretty kooky stuff. Yeah.

433
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,980
And that's what I'm talking to you.
I mean,

434
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,020
that's what you consistently see every
time we talk about this and you know,

435
00:23:48,021 --> 00:23:51,470
there's this other piece of it where
it's like every time a shooting happens,

436
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,860
you know, there's this pile on where it
would not now we should talk about it.

437
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:55,490
Yeah.

438
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:58,730
And then there's this other part of us
where it's because we go from one crisis

439
00:23:58,731 --> 00:24:02,420
to another. Yeah. That there's never
re, it seems to me at this point,

440
00:24:02,421 --> 00:24:06,260
we never really have time to really
ever fully unpack any of these things.

441
00:24:06,261 --> 00:24:10,080
I think. I think there's moments like
this, but on a national level, we're,

442
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:13,180
we're not particularly good at these
conversations because then what it does is

443
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,170
just turns into a political
sparring match. Yeah.

444
00:24:15,171 --> 00:24:17,520
I mean right after the last
shooting and when, when, uh,

445
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:22,340
Dana Lotion and Rubio are on that CNN
town hall. I mean it was made them,

446
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,070
I mean the gladiatorial fest,
it was a disaster.

447
00:24:25,071 --> 00:24:26,960
I mean it was everything
I hate about cable news.

448
00:24:26,961 --> 00:24:30,560
It was everything I hate about just
the quick bites and of all of this and

449
00:24:30,561 --> 00:24:35,280
flashiness and just who can we take out
right now? It was a disaster. And then,

450
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,520
and I sat in,
I pointed this out,

451
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:42,940
how can we have a real honest conversation
when they try to paint program people

452
00:24:43,551 --> 00:24:48,160
as crazy when we say no,
the ultimate goal is to band dones.

453
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:53,560
But then I can watch CNN live town hall
where we will suggest you do realize

454
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,660
banding all somebody automatic guns is
essentially banning all guns and the

455
00:24:59,661 --> 00:25:04,310
entire stadium erupts in
applause and cheers. Yeah.

456
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,550
So then it goes,
Yo Rubio said exactly what you said.

457
00:25:07,551 --> 00:25:12,551
He may started cheering even even when
confronted with the core because Rubio

458
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:15,890
said, look, you want to bet on
somebody might have guns here,

459
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:19,010
let me educate you really quickly
and tell you that virtually all guns.

460
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,850
So even when he corrected them so
it wasn't, they can't, they can't,

461
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,480
they can't claim they were ignorant on
it cause he just explained to them that

462
00:25:26,481 --> 00:25:29,540
means manning virtually
all guns and they rocked it

463
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,190
so it goes, okay, so now you
have all those programs are like,

464
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:39,460
we just going to go back to our clients.
There's no discussion because while,

465
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:43,010
while we're trying to be fair, you're
ultimate goal is to try to ban them all.

466
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,660
Yeah.
There was that moment.

467
00:25:44,661 --> 00:25:47,810
I'm sure you remember this after the
Parkland shooting when they had the big

468
00:25:47,811 --> 00:25:51,350
rally and one of the survivors got up
there and said, we're going to come.

469
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,550
What was the line?

470
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:56,420
Do you remember the exact line where she
said basically we're going to come for

471
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:58,100
the semiautomatics now,

472
00:25:58,101 --> 00:25:59,790
but we're going to come for
everything later or something.

473
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:04,760
Something to that effect. I'm slightly
butcher, but I thought, wow, now,

474
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:09,020
now you're flat out saying
and you're just giving,

475
00:26:09,021 --> 00:26:11,860
you're telling them now. So
I could see why. You know, I,

476
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:14,270
I see this with all my frustrations
with the left all the time.

477
00:26:14,271 --> 00:26:17,120
It's like I know they're never gonna stop.

478
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,720
I've seen it so consistently and that's
why I'm staking out some positions.

479
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,600
But sometimes it's, it's kind of
sucky to have to just be like,

480
00:26:23,601 --> 00:26:26,180
well the people that I'm fighting against,
so to speak,

481
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:30,050
they're not dealing in the same
world that I'm dealing in. And I,

482
00:26:30,051 --> 00:26:33,800
and that makes it more important
for me to stake out a position.

483
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:38,690
But the thing that's most frustrating
about it is the way they'll color it in

484
00:26:38,691 --> 00:26:43,260
the mainstream media is
that were unreasonable. We
don't want to move on inch.

485
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:47,070
We've dug her heels in. All we want
is we don't care about anything.

486
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,740
And really what it is is no,

487
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:54,980
I let you into my house and now you're
trying to take my house from me.

488
00:26:55,830 --> 00:27:00,030
So get out. Cause that's essentially
what they're saying is all right.

489
00:27:00,031 --> 00:27:02,100
So they'll say, well, common sense.

490
00:27:02,101 --> 00:27:05,610
That's why we hate that word common
sense because it cause it's disingenuous.

491
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:09,180
It's like, well we need common sense
measures after a shooting. All right,

492
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,320
then another shooting happens.

493
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:13,620
We need more common sense measures
in another shooting happened.

494
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,600
We need even more common sense measures.

495
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:19,530
Windows common sense measures stopped
being common sense and just intruding on

496
00:27:19,531 --> 00:27:22,910
my rights and I can see the, you know,
you know my thing for guns to use,

497
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,680
free speech to me and it's like
I can see this coming with that.

498
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:28,200
If these guys took control,
you'd start seeing,

499
00:27:28,201 --> 00:27:32,310
well we can have free speech but we
need some common sense controls around

500
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:36,750
actually. So I, so I do understand that
position. Like I tell people all the time,

501
00:27:36,751 --> 00:27:41,100
I'm like, there are over 300
federal gun laws in this country.

502
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,490
I think we've been reasonable.

503
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,670
I think we were really
truly being unreasonable.

504
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,490
We wouldn't have over 300 federal gun
laws and I can't begin to tell you how

505
00:27:50,491 --> 00:27:52,230
many we have on a state level,
right?

506
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:56,010
So it's incredibly disingenuous to
think that we're just being hard,

507
00:27:56,070 --> 00:28:00,540
hard assets who don't want to
move one inch on the issue. Right?

508
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,610
No one's saying it
should be a free for all,

509
00:28:02,611 --> 00:28:05,940
where we're just handing out guns
to everyone like Oprah, right?

510
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,090
I don't think anybody has a problem
inherently with background checks.

511
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,120
Now we start talking about
universal background checks.
That's a different thing.

512
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,630
But since nobody, since they never
want to make that distinction, right?

513
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:20,340
No one ever knows that you can't, you
can't. Exactly. And then the idea of like,

514
00:28:20,341 --> 00:28:22,350
you know, we can talk about
gun free zones, right?

515
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:26,070
And it begs the questions
like what does that,

516
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,080
what does that sticker on when
they're going to do for me?

517
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,430
So now I have to make like people don't
really like to sympathize with gun

518
00:28:32,431 --> 00:28:35,790
owners in a sense of like, we
all want the same result, right?

519
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:38,370
We want the killing the stock.
We want the violence to stop.

520
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,120
Notice I said violence and killing,
not just gun violence. Right?

521
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,290
Because we can't just focus on gun
violence because violence is violence.

522
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,570
However you die, you die and
it's bad. All the way around.

523
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,460
But when I have to make a decision about
whether or not I potentially break a

524
00:28:53,461 --> 00:28:58,461
law to go into an establishment that may
or may not cause me to need my gun at

525
00:28:59,851 --> 00:29:02,280
some point, man, that's messed up.

526
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:06,360
And I know that there are a lot of people
who don't see it that way because they

527
00:29:06,361 --> 00:29:09,330
don't see value in the second amendment
because they're not firearm owners.

528
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,320
Right?

529
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,350
There are a lot of people who look at
the second amendment is useless because

530
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:14,520
they don't own firearms.

531
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,820
But when you have a group of people who
understand the importance of it and how

532
00:29:17,821 --> 00:29:21,060
it fits into their lives, and they
understand that at the end of the day,

533
00:29:21,061 --> 00:29:25,320
when something happens, the only person
who's gonna be there to stop it is you.

534
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,593
That's a big deal.

535
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:31,800
So it's not just me trying to protect
a piece of metal because I just want to

536
00:29:31,801 --> 00:29:35,940
have fun with my guns. No,
it's much bigger than that.

537
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:41,070
It's this idea that I have to rely on
myself. You can tell me all day long,

538
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,180
police are going to be there,
the police are going to be there,

539
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,960
but they're not going to be,
they're just not.

540
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:51,610
And then you can you name or at Parkland.
Exactly right.

541
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:54,340
So then you can you add kids,

542
00:29:54,341 --> 00:29:58,750
family into the mix that ratchets it
up to a whole nother level. So that,

543
00:29:58,751 --> 00:30:01,480
what about the piece of this that
just sort of optics. So you know,

544
00:30:01,481 --> 00:30:05,800
every now and again you'll see a picture
of like three dudes with big ass guns

545
00:30:05,801 --> 00:30:10,450
at Aaa. You know, like an open car. Now I
know if I was, if I walked into Napoleon,

546
00:30:10,451 --> 00:30:15,320
three guys came in with big ass guns
on their back. Yeah. Pro Notice.

547
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:18,820
Well I would take notes and I
probably leave. I probably would,

548
00:30:18,821 --> 00:30:20,620
I would just be like, you
know, and again, I'm here,

549
00:30:20,621 --> 00:30:23,670
I'm here in California where that
would be so, so out of the norm.

550
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:29,320
But for the person that's living in Texas,
right, you can do this. If I was in AAA,

551
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:33,910
right, and it's three guys walking
in, I probably would leave no one.

552
00:30:33,911 --> 00:30:34,960
Everything that you just said there,

553
00:30:34,961 --> 00:30:38,650
knowing that these guys are probably
NRA members and and as far as I know,

554
00:30:38,651 --> 00:30:43,060
no NRA member has ever done a a mass
shooting. Right. Okay. So you know,

555
00:30:43,061 --> 00:30:44,870
cause you see this all the time,
these celebrities, Michael,

556
00:30:44,871 --> 00:30:48,160
Ian Black like that on the show who's on
this rampage telling everyone that you

557
00:30:48,161 --> 00:30:49,930
guys are terrorists.
I mean really that you're,

558
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:54,100
you're part of a terrorist organization
and saw all the other 5 million members.

559
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,610
But I think there is certainly
about some of the optics of that.

560
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,700
You know what I mean? Like I would be
nervous now. I get your point would be,

561
00:31:00,701 --> 00:31:03,360
well those guys are going to protect you
when the other guy walks in or whatever.

562
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:06,850
Then some of that may be feelings
over facts right there, but it just,

563
00:31:06,851 --> 00:31:10,540
it just is the interesting thing about
it that is a big debate within the gun,

564
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,650
the gun community as a whole. The idea
of open carry versus concealed carry.

565
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:20,010
I don't ever open carry except for maybe
if I'm out hunting or I'm on the range

566
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:23,410
or something like that. But
that's, that's a personal decision.

567
00:31:23,411 --> 00:31:27,110
I'm choosing my own for various
reasons. One, sometimes I, I,

568
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,360
I'd rather not have the attention.

569
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:33,310
And tactically I liked the advantage
of having the element of surprise.

570
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:35,860
You don't know I have a gun on me,
so if I had to use it,

571
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,880
I'm going to be reacting. Right? I'm
not going into a place to shoot it up.

572
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,170
If somebody decides to come into
a place where she could about,

573
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,600
I'm going to be reacting to that.

574
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:46,450
So I need all the advantages I
get from my personal perspective.

575
00:31:46,451 --> 00:31:48,220
So I want the element of surprise.

576
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,740
There are some people who
think only alternative,

577
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:55,770
they feel like just the mere presence of
that gun is a deterrent from anyone who

578
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:56,980
wants to come in and do some bad.

579
00:31:56,981 --> 00:32:00,310
So for guys casing out a couple of
stores and then he sees there are certain

580
00:32:00,311 --> 00:32:04,150
citizens in there with long guns and
some that have a hand guns on the side of

581
00:32:04,151 --> 00:32:07,480
your hip, then that's
a deterrent. Right? Um,

582
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:12,570
I understand the alarm that people who
don't necessarily engage in interact with

583
00:32:12,671 --> 00:32:16,420
fire arms get when they see people walking
around with rifles. Right. Even I've,

584
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,440
I've,
I've ever been,

585
00:32:17,441 --> 00:32:21,610
I've seen a couple of people in Texas
do it and initially my gut reaction and

586
00:32:21,611 --> 00:32:24,340
I'll admit was like what's going on here?
Um,

587
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,400
now I'm very versed firearms
and I have a gun too.

588
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,830
So at that point I
actually almost welcome it.

589
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,530
And the reason why is because
if you're going to do something,

590
00:32:35,531 --> 00:32:38,770
I now get to see you attempt to do it.
You get what I'm saying?

591
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,640
It does a telegraph. They were in
a unique case on this one. Yes.

592
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:47,570
But I'm speaking from purely a place,
a personal preference, right? Yeah.

593
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:49,850
And not to be getting on the whole
for anyone else or anything like that.

594
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:54,680
Me Personally, I would rather like to
know you have it right. If I can see it,

595
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:58,490
cause then I know where to
focus my attention versus
me kind of being alone to a

596
00:32:58,491 --> 00:33:01,040
state of complacency
because of its absence.

597
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,770
And then all of a sudden somebody stands
up and decides he wants to shoot the

598
00:33:03,771 --> 00:33:08,600
place up and then I have to react to that.
Um, but again, that's tactics, right?

599
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:11,480
That, that's just personal
preference in that regard. However,

600
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:14,600
I do understand the alarm that somebody
who would have seen you three guys

601
00:33:14,601 --> 00:33:18,440
walking into AAA with the, with
rifles, because it seems seemingly,

602
00:33:18,441 --> 00:33:22,190
especially to them, they seems like that's
a bit excessive. I'm, I allowed to you.

603
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:23,690
If I can conceal carry a rifle,

604
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:27,740
I would because it's better at defending
me than a handgun was the only reason.

605
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,090
The only reason I have a handgun,

606
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,950
it was because of small
enough for me to conceal.

607
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,950
It allows me to live my
life in an uninterrupted,

608
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,500
otherwise I'd walk around with a rifle.
Okay.

609
00:33:36,501 --> 00:33:40,460
So we can't end without doing sort of
what I think would be the big question for

610
00:33:40,461 --> 00:33:41,520
everything we've talked about here.

611
00:33:41,521 --> 00:33:44,900
And for someone that works with the NRA
and your show is on NRA TV and all that.

612
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:50,380
So what is going on in America right now
that seems to be unique to our society?

613
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,660
We do have more shootings here than I,

614
00:33:55,810 --> 00:34:00,320
and I think virtually all other
western nations combined. Um,

615
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:05,250
so, okay. I forget to fact check me on
that if I that one. But it does seem it's,

616
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,340
and even if I'm slightly, oh no,
no, you're good. You're good.

617
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:12,110
It seems that there is something uniquely
happening here now I would argue then

618
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:16,190
there's all sorts of mental health issues
and probably a prescription drugs and

619
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,680
maybe nonprescription drugs
and all sorts of other stuff.

620
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,590
So there's a couple of things.
So I'll try to,

621
00:34:21,591 --> 00:34:23,960
I'll try to keep this as concise as
possible because we are going to get into

622
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:27,230
weeds for a split second here. So first
of all, let's talk about mass shootings,

623
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:29,210
right? Our school school,
Mexican silver instance.

624
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:33,530
I recently just read a study
from Northwestern university,
I'm not too long ago,

625
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:37,310
which talked about comparing the number
of school shootings back in the 90s

626
00:34:37,311 --> 00:34:39,020
versus the versus today.

627
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:44,150
And what they concluded essentially was
the perception is that it's happening

628
00:34:44,151 --> 00:34:45,200
more frequently,
but it's not,

629
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:49,610
it's actually on par or even
less now than it was then.

630
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,000
Now you can, people who are
going to seem like, oh my God,

631
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:56,930
how could you possibly say that? Google
it. It's a Northwestern university, uh,

632
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:01,160
research. Uh, I can't remember the
actual title of their actual research,

633
00:35:01,161 --> 00:35:05,090
but we're going to grab it from you
after this and [inaudible] link to it.

634
00:35:05,091 --> 00:35:07,910
And absolutely.
So that being said,

635
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:10,910
mass shootings account for a very,
very,

636
00:35:10,911 --> 00:35:14,840
very marginal percentage of
shootings in this country.

637
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:18,350
Let's start off with the overall.
So 35,

638
00:35:18,351 --> 00:35:22,340
35 to 36,000 people each
year die from guns, right?

639
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:25,230
I didn't specify gun violence, but
just guns. Cause they don't do that.

640
00:35:25,231 --> 00:35:26,690
They'll just say gun violence.
Right?

641
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:31,880
So 60 about 60 to 65% of those,

642
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:34,070
that 35,000 as suicides.

643
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:38,370
Now when I'm not saying is we don't
care about suicides. We do. However,

644
00:35:38,371 --> 00:35:42,690
when it comes to the idea and the issue
of somebody shooting at me, that's a,

645
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:45,720
that's not, it's not Jermaine.
Yeah. But then even still,

646
00:35:45,721 --> 00:35:47,670
if you want to make the argument,
well, if we had less guns,

647
00:35:47,671 --> 00:35:48,780
we'd have less suicides.

648
00:35:48,781 --> 00:35:53,310
That's also not true because our suicide
rate is on par with every other major

649
00:35:53,311 --> 00:35:56,160
country. So if it was a case
that the more guns you have,

650
00:35:56,161 --> 00:35:59,430
the more suicides we'd be
leading the charge. We don't
they where there's a will,

651
00:35:59,431 --> 00:36:01,700
there's a way. Exactly.
Right. Even tomorrow,

652
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,170
the more more famous suicides we've had,
they didn't use guns.

653
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:07,410
So we sat there number side,
which is a huge number,

654
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:12,770
65% it's huge number out of 35 36,000 so
then you have about one to 3% which are

655
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,250
justifiable homicides.
That self defense,

656
00:36:17,251 --> 00:36:21,270
that's including police shooting
criminals who are shooting at them. Right?

657
00:36:21,271 --> 00:36:23,910
And people who use guns in self defense.
Right.

658
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,170
You've got to set that aside because
that's not the issue we're trying to

659
00:36:28,171 --> 00:36:29,004
address.

660
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:34,100
So set that number side and then you
have about 5% which are accidental.

661
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:39,660
Right? Kid gets fined to gun
pull triggers. Unfortunate.
Extremely unfortunate.

662
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:40,913
However,

663
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:46,220
I believe personally half of that can
easily be addressed with more education.

664
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:51,170
So if we took the energy
that we took that we placed,

665
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:55,260
now I'm trying to vilified guns and
have national campaigns teaching people

666
00:36:55,261 --> 00:36:56,250
about gun safety,

667
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:59,880
that we'll cut that number in half
because a lot of these accidents easily

668
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:02,100
preventable. But they're just people
who have come to just don't know.

669
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:05,640
And so if we spent time
educating those people,

670
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:09,570
do we know what percentage of that
subset is getting those guns legally or

671
00:37:09,571 --> 00:37:12,150
illegally? Cause I would imagine
that a lot of it's probably illegal,

672
00:37:12,151 --> 00:37:13,890
which is why they don't know
how to use the gun in the first.

673
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,670
I'm not going to assume I have that answer
because I don't have that hard number.

674
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:22,620
Um, but, and I would, I'm, I do feel
comfortable assuming that as well. Right.

675
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,330
Um, and so if we take that, the
accidents to set that aside,

676
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,620
purely homicides,

677
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:37,710
we're looking at around
seven to 10,000 every year.

678
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,000
Right now that's a different
looking number, right.

679
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:44,550
When will be accounted for the,
all of the, the con, the con,

680
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,690
the context here with those,
those other shootings. Now,

681
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,060
the vast majority,

682
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:56,310
I'd say close to 80% that I've read in
a couple of articles of those homicides

683
00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:00,240
are happening in the inner
cities of our country.

684
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:05,280
All right? So then reason goes. All right,

685
00:38:05,281 --> 00:38:08,220
so let's look at those inner cities and
let's look at the dynamics there, right?

686
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:13,680
You have low jobs, lack of
economic opportunity, um,

687
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,920
destroyed households and a narco economy
that warrants that warrants but creates

688
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:24,330
the necessity for this type of violence.

689
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:30,480
So if we dealt with the socioeconomic
aspects of what's going on in those areas

690
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:36,530
too, we really have a gun problem, okay?

691
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,740
Just think about it. I know, I know other
communities filled with black people,

692
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:42,960
they have guns, they don't have
the same level of violence.

693
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:46,560
Cause I only say black people because
most people associate the inner city with,

694
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:47,670
with black people,
right?

695
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,930
But the reason why we had that high
level of concentration of violence,

696
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:54,120
it's because of the conditions
in those environments.

697
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,990
And then even within those communities,
there are tough.

698
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,670
The vast majority of people in
those committees are good people.

699
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,500
And it's a very minor group of people
who are creating a large number of the

700
00:39:04,501 --> 00:39:07,470
violence, right? So there's
something to be said,

701
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:12,471
do we really have a gun problem or do we
have a socioeconomic suicide problem in

702
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:16,860
this country?
Because at the end of the day,

703
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:22,790
there's 35 to 36,000 that people
assuming is all gun violence by way of

704
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:27,540
homicides, people shooting at other
people to kill them. It's not the case.

705
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:30,270
We're looking at closer to
the seven to 10,000 if that.

706
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:33,540
And so if you take those numbers and
you comparing them other countries,

707
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,733
then how does it look

708
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,370
to be continued? Yeah. Well,

709
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:41,370
I'm so glad that we finally did this
and we will definitely do this again

710
00:39:41,371 --> 00:39:42,440
because I absolutely,

711
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:46,740
this story and everything we've talked
about here is just going to continue.

712
00:39:46,741 --> 00:39:46,921
I mean,

713
00:39:46,921 --> 00:39:50,250
these are the battles that we're now
fighting on many fronts related to the

714
00:39:50,251 --> 00:39:53,870
constitution and free speech and
free expression and your ability to,

715
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:58,350
to own your life and all that stuff. And
that's all we ask is that this is this,

716
00:39:58,351 --> 00:39:59,480
let me and

717
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,430
well, I'll say one last thing. Yeah.
There are a lot of people who was like,

718
00:40:02,431 --> 00:40:04,710
why do you feel the need to carry a gun?
Why?

719
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:10,160
Like like the chances of you needing to
use that gun to protect yourself 1% and

720
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,350
the answer I have for that is this,
you may be right.

721
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,410
Sansomeana need to care to actually
use my gun to defend myself.

722
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,520
Maybe really slim,

723
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:21,990
maybe 1% but if that 1% happens,

724
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,460
it's 100% of everything.

725
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:27,960
The consequences are 100% and
that's why it's so important.

726
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,710
Yeah.
All right,

727
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:32,110
well that's how you, and to show you, you
know, you, maybe we'll do this next time.

728
00:40:32,111 --> 00:40:34,870
Maybe we'll bring you on with someone on
some of the absolute side of the issues

729
00:40:34,871 --> 00:40:38,800
on this and we'll tell him we'll have
that conversation. Sounds like a plan.

730
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:43,700
All right. For more on calling on check
them out on Twitter. Mr. Cole? No.

731
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,080
R.
