PIc. Interesting question, very simply my

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:17.090
view, we absolutely need the units to come

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.349
can not bridge the divide on its own. Itâ€™s
impossible. So the sooner the economy picks

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:24.430
up or it gets stronger, the better.
