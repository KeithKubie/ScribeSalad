they were people were very paranoid

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820
they were people were very paranoid
 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.360
they were people were very paranoid
about this I mean you can find a lot

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370
about this I mean you can find a lot
 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.729
about this I mean you can find a lot
examples of this and bodies were stolen

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739
examples of this and bodies were stolen
 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.520
examples of this and bodies were stolen
a lot and thank God they were on some

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530
a lot and thank God they were on some
 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.440
a lot and thank God they were on some
level right because think about how much

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450
level right because think about how much
 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.570
level right because think about how much
we learnt from these bodies bodies were

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580
we learnt from these bodies bodies were
 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.280
we learnt from these bodies bodies were
needed to be dissected to teach medical

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290
needed to be dissected to teach medical
 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.610
needed to be dissected to teach medical
students yeah and one of the scenes in

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620
students yeah and one of the scenes in
 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.350
students yeah and one of the scenes in
the book I talk about the dead house

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360
the book I talk about the dead house
 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.020
the book I talk about the dead house
they called it the dead house and

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030
they called it the dead house and
 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.100
they called it the dead house and
everybody had a different experience in

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110
everybody had a different experience in
 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.120
everybody had a different experience in
the dead house there's probably people

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130
the dead house there's probably people
 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.830
the dead house there's probably people
listening who've been in a dissection

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840
listening who've been in a dissection
 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.440
listening who've been in a dissection
room and you have a really vivid memory

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450
room and you have a really vivid memory
 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.210
room and you have a really vivid memory
of that it's probably bright and white

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220
of that it's probably bright and white
 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.310
of that it's probably bright and white
and clinical well these places the

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320
and clinical well these places the
 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.630
and clinical well these places the
bodies would have been bloated and

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640
bodies would have been bloated and
 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.630
bodies would have been bloated and
partly decomposed dissecting bodies was

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640
partly decomposed dissecting bodies was
 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.850
partly decomposed dissecting bodies was
dangerous because you could cut yourself

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860
dangerous because you could cut yourself
 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.110
dangerous because you could cut yourself
and you could infect yourself with

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120
and you could infect yourself with
 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.080
and you could infect yourself with
bacteria they weren't wearing gloves and

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090
bacteria they weren't wearing gloves and
 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.090
bacteria they weren't wearing gloves and
so you get examples of people cutting

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100
so you get examples of people cutting
 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.310
so you get examples of people cutting
themselves and dying within 48 hours so

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320
themselves and dying within 48 hours so
 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.819
themselves and dying within 48 hours so
going into medicine was dangerous and

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829
going into medicine was dangerous and
 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:16.060
going into medicine was dangerous and
there's a story in this book about a guy

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070
there's a story in this book about a guy
 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.940
there's a story in this book about a guy
who goes into the the dead house for the

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950
who goes into the the dead house for the
 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.849
who goes into the the dead house for the
first time and he freaks out and he sees

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859
first time and he freaks out and he sees
 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.550
first time and he freaks out and he sees
all these like mice and rat

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560
all these like mice and rat
 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.159
all these like mice and rat
and things like that eating the body and

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169
and things like that eating the body and
 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.590
and things like that eating the body and
so he jumps out the window and he runs

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600
so he jumps out the window and he runs
 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.800
so he jumps out the window and he runs
off but later he becomes accustomed to

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810
off but later he becomes accustomed to
 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.060
off but later he becomes accustomed to
it as we all become accustomed to

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070
it as we all become accustomed to
 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.980
it as we all become accustomed to
horrible things at some point and he

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990
horrible things at some point and he
 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.720
horrible things at some point and he
actually starts taking pieces of the

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730
actually starts taking pieces of the
 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.129
actually starts taking pieces of the
corpse and throwing it to the poor

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139
corpse and throwing it to the poor
 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:40.840
corpse and throwing it to the poor
little starving creatures that are on

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850
little starving creatures that are on
 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.000
little starving creatures that are on
the dead house and she's yeah so it's

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010
the dead house and she's yeah so it's
 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.770
the dead house and she's yeah so it's
kind of like you know that that horror

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780
kind of like you know that that horror
 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.750
kind of like you know that that horror
that we all experience possibly when we

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760
that we all experience possibly when we
 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.610
that we all experience possibly when we
when we were confronted with death to

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620
when we were confronted with death to
 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.220
when we were confronted with death to
accepting it as you have to as a medical

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230
accepting it as you have to as a medical
 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.800
accepting it as you have to as a medical
student if you want to go on so the dead

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810
student if you want to go on so the dead
 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.750
student if you want to go on so the dead
houses is particularly it would have

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760
houses is particularly it would have
 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.719
houses is particularly it would have
smelled dissection would have would have

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729
smelled dissection would have would have
 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:00.610
smelled dissection would have would have
been a winter sport because the bodies

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620
been a winter sport because the bodies
 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.200
been a winter sport because the bodies
wouldn't decompose as quickly you course

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210
wouldn't decompose as quickly you course
 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.430
wouldn't decompose as quickly you course
wouldn't want to be dissecting in the

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440
wouldn't want to be dissecting in the
 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.520
wouldn't want to be dissecting in the
heat of the summer did they literally

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530
heat of the summer did they literally
 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.320
heat of the summer did they literally
have seasons for dissect yeah they would

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330
have seasons for dissect yeah they would
 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.850
have seasons for dissect yeah they would
they would tend to teach students in the

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860
they would tend to teach students in the
 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.670
they would tend to teach students in the
winter so they were like winter jackets

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680
winter so they were like winter jackets
 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.890
winter so they were like winter jackets
and they would have probably because

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900
and they would have probably because
 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.870
and they would have probably because
well they had a fireplace at the end of

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880
well they had a fireplace at the end of
 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.820
well they had a fireplace at the end of
the room as well make a really stuffy

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830
the room as well make a really stuffy
 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.280
the room as well make a really stuffy
and smelly and you couldn't really

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290
and smelly and you couldn't really
 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.379
and smelly and you couldn't really
predict what a person had died from as

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389
predict what a person had died from as
 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:24.730
predict what a person had died from as
well so remember people are dying from

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740
well so remember people are dying from
 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.770
well so remember people are dying from
things like smallpox which is awful

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780
things like smallpox which is awful
 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.440
things like smallpox which is awful
yeah and this is before bass

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.450
yeah and this is before bass
 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.420
yeah and this is before bass
vaccinations this is certainly before

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430
vaccinations this is certainly before
 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.940
vaccinations this is certainly before
antibiotics and so a lot of doctors or

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950
antibiotics and so a lot of doctors or
 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.409
antibiotics and so a lot of doctors or
medical students died as a result of

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419
medical students died as a result of
 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:38.560
medical students died as a result of
going into the profession
