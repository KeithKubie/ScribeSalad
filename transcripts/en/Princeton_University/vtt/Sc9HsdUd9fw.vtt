I?m Shana Weber. I manage the Office of Sustainability
here at Princeton University. The mission

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.449
of the office is to coordinate across campus
with all different programs, from folks who

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:24.169
operate the University on a daily basis to
academic programs, student initiatives, and

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:25.169
administrators.

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:29.881
Over the last several years at Princeton,
there have been many new student groups who

00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:33.960
have formed around sustainability initiatives,
and one of the roles that the office plays

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.260
is to bring those students together, to create
a common space so that the students can actually

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.360
work together to exchange ideas. So we meet
every couple of weeks under the umbrella of

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.850
the Princeton Environmental Network, and right
now we have over a dozen student groups on

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.790
campus who are active in the group.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.999
I?m with Princeton Ecology Representatives,
and one of our projects will be the Residential

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:04.750
Education Program where we reach out to freshmen
and sort of induce a culture change that promotes

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.270
sustainability from the very beginning.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.079
We?re Greening Princeton.

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:14.049
One of the most impactful projects that we?ve
been involved with as a group is to help Dining

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:18.380
Services with their initiative to remove trays
from the dining halls, which has drastically

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.080
reduced the amount of food waste produced
by the dining halls. It?s also saved money

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.400
on water and energy costs.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.329
We?re with U-Bikes. We?re the two co-managers
of the program.

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.329
Every year, Transportation and Parking Services
picks up tons of bikes that have been abandoned

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:41.270
on campus. And we get them and we do our best
and work with the Princeton Bike Co-op to

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.680
refurbish as many of these bikes as we can
and put them in working order so that we can

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:58.859
rent them out on a semester basis to University
community members, faculty, staff and students.

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:04.399
I?m with the Farmers? Market and we are here
to promote local sustainable food on the Princeton

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:10.230
University campus. We?re hoping to now work
with the township market and sort of expand

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:14.480
offerings to students to where there?s a box
share program where students can get regular

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.321
groceries, as well as promote local organic
food on campus throughout the year, not just

00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:24.690
during the market season.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.290
My name is Justine Hausheer, and I am a sustainability
fellow. I graduated in June 2010 and I?ll

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.620
be working with the office for one year. I?ve
been working on alumni outreach for the program.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.320
We have a lot of great alumni who come through
the student groups here, so I?m working on

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.760
building a database, surveying previous alums
to keep track of all the great work that they

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.030
did for the office while they were here at
Princeton.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:51.400
Sustainability is a priority for the institution.
It?s built into our master plan. We have a

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.150
sustainability plan, which we are deep into
implementing right now. And what I see for

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:04.340
the future is all of us gaining an understanding
as a community how we can incorporate sustainability

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.840
into our daily lives, and incorporate those
principles into our daily decisions. So it?s

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.040
really a culture change effort across the
institution.
