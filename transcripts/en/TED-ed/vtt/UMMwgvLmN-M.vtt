00:00:06.605 --> 00:00:09.043
In the summer of 1976,

00:00:09.043 --> 00:00:13.996
a mysterious epidemic
suddenly struck two central African towns,

00:00:13.996 --> 00:00:16.652
killing the majority of its victims.

00:00:16.652 --> 00:00:18.391
Medical researchers suspected

00:00:18.391 --> 00:00:21.829
the deadly Marburg virus 
to be the culprit.

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:26.667
But what they saw in microscope images
was an entirely new pathogen,

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:31.323
which would be named
after the nearby Ebola river.

00:00:31.323 --> 00:00:33.225
Like yellow fever or dengue,

00:00:33.225 --> 00:00:38.677
the disease caused by the Ebola virus
is a severe type of hemorrhagic fever.

00:00:38.677 --> 00:00:41.645
It begins by attacking 
the immune system's cells

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:44.012
and neutralizing its responses,

00:00:44.012 --> 00:00:46.354
allowing the virus to proliferate.

00:00:46.354 --> 00:00:49.889
Starting anywhere from two to twenty days
after contraction,

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:52.260
initial symptoms like high temperature,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.451
aching,

00:00:53.451 --> 00:00:54.640
and sore throat

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.109
resemble those of a typical flu,

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.309
but quickly escalate to vomiting,

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.551
rashes,

00:01:00.551 --> 00:01:01.933
and diarrhea.

00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:03.432
And as the virus spreads,

00:01:03.432 --> 00:01:05.947
it invades the lymph nodes 
and vital organs,

00:01:05.947 --> 00:01:10.069
such as kidneys and liver,
causing them to lose function.

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:13.799
But the virus itself 
is not what kills Ebola victims.

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.541
Instead, the mounting cell deaths 
trigger an immune system overload,

00:01:18.541 --> 00:01:21.006
known as a cytokine storm,

00:01:21.006 --> 00:01:24.930
an explosion of immune responses
that damages blood vessels,

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.170
causing both internal and external bleeding.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.593
The excessive fluid loss 
and resulting complications

00:01:31.593 --> 00:01:36.513
can be fatal within six to sixteen days
of the first symptoms,

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:39.172
though proper care and rehydration therapy

00:01:39.172 --> 00:01:43.156
can significantly reduce 
mortality rates in patients.

00:01:43.156 --> 00:01:45.878
Fortunately, 
while Ebola is highly virulent,

00:01:45.878 --> 00:01:48.866
several factors limit its contagiousness.

00:01:48.866 --> 00:01:52.595
Unlike viruses that proliferate through
small, airborne particles,

00:01:52.595 --> 00:01:55.573
Ebola only exists in bodily fluids,

00:01:55.573 --> 00:01:56.659
such as saliva,

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:57.369
blood,

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:58.173
mucus,

00:01:58.173 --> 00:01:58.892
vomit,

00:01:58.892 --> 00:01:59.984
or feces.

00:01:59.984 --> 00:02:01.261
In order to spread,

00:02:01.261 --> 00:02:05.449
these must be transmitted from 
an infected person into another's body

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:09.273
through passageways such as the eyes,
mouth, or nose.

00:02:09.273 --> 00:02:11.113
And because the disease's severity

00:02:11.113 --> 00:02:14.274
increases directly along 
with the viral load,

00:02:14.274 --> 00:02:17.196
even an infected person 
is unlikely to be contagious

00:02:17.196 --> 00:02:19.923
until they have begun to show symptoms.

00:02:19.923 --> 00:02:23.641
While Ebola has been shown 
to survive on surfaces for several hours,

00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:27.912
and transmission through sneezing
or coughing is theoretically possible,

00:02:27.912 --> 00:02:32.272
virtually all known cases of contraction
have been through direct contact

00:02:32.272 --> 00:02:34.553
with the severely ill,

00:02:34.553 --> 00:02:37.204
with the greatest risk 
posed to medical workers

00:02:37.204 --> 00:02:40.095
and friends or relatives of the victims.

00:02:40.095 --> 00:02:42.539
This is why,
despite its horrifying effects,

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:47.155
Ebola has been far less deadly overall
than more common infections,

00:02:47.155 --> 00:02:48.295
such as measles,

00:02:48.295 --> 00:02:49.118
malaria,

00:02:49.118 --> 00:02:50.811
or even influenza.

00:02:50.811 --> 00:02:52.615
Once an outbreak has been contained,

00:02:52.615 --> 00:02:55.385
the virus does not exist 
in the human population

00:02:55.385 --> 00:02:57.721
until the next outbreak begins.

00:02:57.721 --> 00:02:59.810
But while this is undoubtedly a good thing,

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.821
it also makes Ebola difficult to study.

00:03:02.821 --> 00:03:05.839
Scientists believe fruit bats 
to be its natural carriers,

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:09.795
but just how it is transmitted to humans
remains unknown.

00:03:09.795 --> 00:03:13.322
Furthermore, many of the countries 
where Ebola outbreaks occur

00:03:13.322 --> 00:03:16.566
suffer from poor infrastructure and sanitation,

00:03:16.566 --> 00:03:18.554
which enables the disease to spread.

00:03:18.554 --> 00:03:20.157
And the poverty of these regions,

00:03:20.157 --> 00:03:23.272
combined with the relatively low amount
of overall cases

00:03:23.272 --> 00:03:28.706
means there is little economic incentive
for drug companies to invest in research.

00:03:28.706 --> 00:03:31.625
Though some experimental medicines
have shown promise,

00:03:31.625 --> 00:03:34.291
and governments are funding development
of a vaccine,

00:03:34.291 --> 00:03:35.931
as of 2014,

00:03:35.931 --> 00:03:40.074
the only widespread and effective 
solutions to an Ebola outbreak remain

00:03:40.074 --> 00:03:41.412
isolation,

00:03:41.412 --> 00:03:42.506
sanitation,

00:03:42.506 --> 00:03:44.007
and information.
