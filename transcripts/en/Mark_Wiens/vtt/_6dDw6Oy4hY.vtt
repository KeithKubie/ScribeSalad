00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.360
\f0\fs24 \cf0 I rarely even eat pad Thai in
Bangkok normally, mainly because there are

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:10.379
just so many other things to eat. But this
is a really special pad Thai restaurant, and

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:17.280
I can't wait to try this food.\
\

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.870
Pad Thai is perhaps the most widely recognized
Thai dish in the entire world, and if you're

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:28.110
in Bangkok, a visit to Pad Thai Pratu Pee
is a must. Here, pad Thai is taken extremely

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.230
seriously.\
\

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.750
Big meaty shrimp are first seared in hot oil
before handfuls of Thai dry rice noodles are

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.140
added to the large sized woks.\
\

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.470
Oil and generous spoonfuls of special tasty
sauces are tossed into the noodles as they

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:47.050
start to rehydrate over the flaming coals.
From there, it's clickity clack as the cook

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.530
works the noodles like a magician playing
with fire.\

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.510
\
Bits of tofu, and other ingredients according

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.630
to what has been ordered, are all added to
the mess of pad thai that's artfully being

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:02.040
created.\
\

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.360
When the noodles have reached a certain softness,
they're pushed to the side to make way for

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.990
eggs which are cracked into the wok and ready
to take on the brutal flames. The eggs and

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.580
noodles are mingled together in a sweet harmony
of complimentary flavors.\

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:22.580
\

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.310
When the cook feels the pad thai is ready,
the entire wok is ushered to the serving table

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.710
where the pile is divvied onto individual
plates or packed into styrofoam to-go containers.\

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.020
\
Depending on what the customer ordered, the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.020
piping hot plates of pad thai are either served
as is, or brought over to what I like to call

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.049
the grift wrapping station.\
\

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.830
It begins with a smaller sized wok that sits
over a dangerously hot bon fire. A ladle of

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.829
beaten egg is thinly layered into the wok
as it instantly cooks through. A fresh plate

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:01.329
of pad thai is then dumped into the middle
of the egg, wrapped up like a present, and

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:06.770
flopped back onto the plate. The process is
repeated one more time so each plate of pad

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.830
thai is double wrapped in smoky eggy deliciousness.\
\

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.830
Garnish it with fresh peanuts, and gotta have
my chili, gotta have a squeeze of lime when

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.560
you eat pad thai. \
\

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.560
It's wrapped in an egg, so it's like a little
gift of pad thai, that's really good, that's

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.160
awesome. It has a nice smokey flavor. Check
out the size of these meaty shrimps. \

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:03.989
\
This one is called pad Thai sen jan man goong,

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:12.530
and what it is, as you can see it's nicely
orangey red in color. The ingredient that

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:19.530
makes it this color is the head juice from
big jumbo shrimp called man goong, and I don't

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.470
even know what it's called in English. Let's
see how this tastes. It's a little bit sweet,

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.559
but you can taste that shirmpiness to it,
that's awesome. \

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:43.989
\
If you like pad thai, you definitely have

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:50.989
to check this place out when you're in Bangkok.
I just finished those two plates of pad thai

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:58.459
and I'm stuffed right now, and I think because
I ate with such enthusiasm, they gave me a

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.930
free sticker, pretty cool huh. But anyway,
if you come to Bangkok if you like pad thai,

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:21.409
this is your spot.}
