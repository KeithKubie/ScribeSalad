well more than half of all people with
 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.799
well more than half of all people with
active tuberculosis in the United States

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809
active tuberculosis in the United States
 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.020
active tuberculosis in the United States
were born outside the US now very few of

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030
were born outside the US now very few of
 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.910
were born outside the US now very few of
those people come into the United States

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920
those people come into the United States
 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.150
those people come into the United States
with active tuberculosis most of those

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160
with active tuberculosis most of those
 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.010
with active tuberculosis most of those
persons come in with a latent form of

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020
persons come in with a latent form of
 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.750
persons come in with a latent form of
tuberculosis that's not contagious

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760
tuberculosis that's not contagious
 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.359
tuberculosis that's not contagious
they're not sick we can identify those

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369
they're not sick we can identify those
 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.790
they're not sick we can identify those
people and we can treat them so it's a

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800
people and we can treat them so it's a
 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.679
people and we can treat them so it's a
very treatable condition in my view in

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689
very treatable condition in my view in
 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.500
very treatable condition in my view in
no measure is that a reason to keep

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510
no measure is that a reason to keep
 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.760
no measure is that a reason to keep
people from immigrating to the United

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770
people from immigrating to the United
 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.160
people from immigrating to the United
States persons who are coming here

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170
States persons who are coming here
 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.139
States persons who are coming here
should be screened for TB and treated if

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149
should be screened for TB and treated if
 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.389
should be screened for TB and treated if
they have it and then it won't be much

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399
they have it and then it won't be much
 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.729
they have it and then it won't be much
of a problem so I don't think it's a

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739
of a problem so I don't think it's a
 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.380
of a problem so I don't think it's a
reason to keep people out it's a very

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390
reason to keep people out it's a very
 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.260
reason to keep people out it's a very
easy mallet to beat people over the head

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270
easy mallet to beat people over the head
 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.150
easy mallet to beat people over the head
with to try to prevent immigration you

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160
with to try to prevent immigration you
 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.650
with to try to prevent immigration you
know immigrants are bad people who bring

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660
know immigrants are bad people who bring
 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.810
know immigrants are bad people who bring
diseases we've seen that before

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820
diseases we've seen that before
 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.790
diseases we've seen that before
in the United States and certainly in

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800
in the United States and certainly in
 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.380
in the United States and certainly in
the current climate there's a potential

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390
the current climate there's a potential
 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.630
the current climate there's a potential
for that again but but most persons who

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640
for that again but but most persons who
 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.509
for that again but but most persons who
come into the u.s. just have latent TB

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519
come into the u.s. just have latent TB
 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.310
come into the u.s. just have latent TB
infection as I said not contagious we

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320
infection as I said not contagious we
 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.020
infection as I said not contagious we
can identify them we can treat them and

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030
can identify them we can treat them and
 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.810
can identify them we can treat them and
they'll never get TB so I from my point

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820
they'll never get TB so I from my point
 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.520
they'll never get TB so I from my point
of view it would be really a tragedy if

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530
of view it would be really a tragedy if
 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.880
of view it would be really a tragedy if
that were used to drum up prejudice and

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890
that were used to drum up prejudice and
 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.289
that were used to drum up prejudice and
discrimination against people coming in

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299
discrimination against people coming in
 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.090
discrimination against people coming in
for perfectly legitimate reasons and

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100
for perfectly legitimate reasons and
 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.380
for perfectly legitimate reasons and
we've always depended on these people in

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390
we've always depended on these people in
 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.050
we've always depended on these people in
the United States

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060
 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.570
so people coming into United States with

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580
so people coming into United States with
 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.780
so people coming into United States with
active TB I said it's relatively

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790
active TB I said it's relatively
 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.330
active TB I said it's relatively
uncommon most of those persons don't

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340
uncommon most of those persons don't
 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.530
uncommon most of those persons don't

you have to have an x-ray in your home
 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.940
you have to have an x-ray in your home
country and it's got to show that you

don't have contagious TB before you can

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810
don't have contagious TB before you can
 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.270
don't have contagious TB before you can
come in now some people are exempt from

come in now some people are exempt from
 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.539
come in now some people are exempt from
that tourists for example don't get that

that tourists for example don't get that
 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.310
that tourists for example don't get that
kind of screening and and students often

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320
kind of screening and and students often
 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.540
kind of screening and and students often
don't get that kind of screening but

don't get that kind of screening but
 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.460
don't get that kind of screening but
people are coming here to live at least

States with active TB no in some parts

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550
States with active TB no in some parts
 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.669
States with active TB no in some parts
of the United States that is more of an

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679
of the United States that is more of an
 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.820
of the United States that is more of an
issue and that's particularly out west

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830
issue and that's particularly out west
 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.990
issue and that's particularly out west
California in the southwest where people

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000
California in the southwest where people
 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.400
California in the southwest where people
go back and forth across the border all

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410
go back and forth across the border all
 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.930
go back and forth across the border all
the time and that's not really the case

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940
the time and that's not really the case
 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.210
the time and that's not really the case
in New York because we're separated by

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220
in New York because we're separated by
 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.120
in New York because we're separated by
an ocean from most other borders but

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130
an ocean from most other borders but
 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.370
an ocean from most other borders but
California Arizona places like that it's

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380
California Arizona places like that it's
 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.750
California Arizona places like that it's
more of a problem there because people

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760
more of a problem there because people
 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.640
more of a problem there because people
go back and forth all the time and

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650
go back and forth all the time and
 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.990
go back and forth all the time and
they're I think the the solution is in

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000
they're I think the the solution is in
 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.590
they're I think the the solution is in
sort of cross border across government

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600
sort of cross border across government
 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.950
sort of cross border across government
cooperation for TB treatment
