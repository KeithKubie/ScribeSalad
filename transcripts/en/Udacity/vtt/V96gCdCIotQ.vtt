00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.969
Now, in the last exercise, we only looked

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.010
at four individual SNVs in the genome. But

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.600
now, let's imagine that we expand our comparisons

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.210
from just four SNVs, to 1 million SNVs across

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.600
the genome. Then we have a lot more

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.700
statistical power behind our numbers. The SNVs that 23

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.650
and ME uses for genome comparisons. Are spread

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.110
all over the chromosomes in the genome. The autosomes,

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.210
the sex chromosomes, and the mitochondrial chromosome. Once

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.110
the SNVs have been determined for an individual, then

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.780
we can actually determine the IBS score between

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.720
any two people sampling from a million positions in

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.540
the genome. Now you may be surprised to

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.210
find that the IBS score, if we measure over

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.110
a million SNVs, the IBS score between you and

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.200
the most distantly related person we could find around

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.060
the world. You would still have an IBS score

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.470
of about 70%. Even after looking at all these

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.820
positions, 70% of them would be identical with another

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.680
person. The person that you're most distantly related to.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.620
Now this is when we focus specifically on the

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.810
SNVs, the single-nucleotide variants, regions of the genome that

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.170
we know and expect there to be variation. Remember

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.180
the human genomes, though, are already more than 99% identical.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.540
So even though we're sampling from regions, that we

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.320
know should be different, and in general we do find

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.170
differences between humans here. Humans just aren't that different from

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.120
each other. And the IBS score between you and most

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.130
humans will be about 70% or higher. So if

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.470
the background IBS score for you and the most distantly

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.410
related person is about 70%, then I want you to

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.560
assume minimal inbreeding and tell me what you would expect

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.590
your IBS score to be between you and one of

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.930
your biological parents. About 70, 75, 85, 95, or 100%? I

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.340
want you to pick the answer that you think is

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.830
best and then tell me why in this text box here.
