00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.491
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I could draw the dimensions of Grant's new space like this. In orange we have

00:00:04.491 --> 00:00:09.177
the original layout, and these blue lines represent the addition that he wants

00:00:09.177 --> 00:00:13.700
to make, in order to get, to a total area of 300 square feet. What I'd like you

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.270
to do now, is to rewrite this equation. So that you carry out the distribution

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.726
or multiplication on the right hand side. So multiply these two polynomials

00:00:22.726 --> 00:00:27.142
together, and also combine like-terms on the right side, then write your new

00:00:27.142 --> 00:00:31.669
equation down here. Again, just simplify the right side. Leave the left side

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:32.095
alone.
