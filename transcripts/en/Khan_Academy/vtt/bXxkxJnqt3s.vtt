00:00:00.807 --> 00:00:02.070
- [Voiceover] 7 pounds of plums

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.285
make 8 rolls of fruit leather.

00:00:04.285 --> 00:00:06.133
If every batch of fruit leather requires

00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:07.820
the same amount of plums,

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.522
how many pounds of plums are required

00:00:10.522 --> 00:00:14.382
to make 20 rolls of fruit leather?

00:00:14.382 --> 00:00:17.206
So, let's set up a ratio.

00:00:17.206 --> 00:00:21.004
We need 7 pounds

00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:24.004
of plums for every 8 rolls,

00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:26.445
8 rolls of fruit leather.

00:00:26.445 --> 00:00:28.356
Now, we need to think
about how many pounds

00:00:28.356 --> 00:00:29.880
of plums we're gonna need.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.682
How many pounds of plums we're gonna need

00:00:32.682 --> 00:00:35.020
to make 20 rolls of fruit leather.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.091
20 rolls of fruit leather.

00:00:37.091 --> 00:00:37.803
Well, let's see.

00:00:37.803 --> 00:00:38.534
What have we done?

00:00:38.534 --> 00:00:41.622
To go from 8 rolls to 20 rolls,

00:00:41.622 --> 00:00:43.431
how many times do we have to,

00:00:43.431 --> 00:00:45.671
how much larger is 20 than 8?

00:00:45.671 --> 00:00:49.368
Let's see, 20 divided by
8 is 2 and four-eighths,

00:00:49.368 --> 00:00:51.096
which is 2 and a half.

00:00:51.096 --> 00:00:53.615
So, we multiplied by 2 and a half,

00:00:53.615 --> 00:00:56.337
or we have 2 and a half
times as many rolls

00:00:56.337 --> 00:00:57.983
when we go from 8 to 20.

00:00:57.983 --> 00:01:00.522
So we're going to need 2 and
a half times as many pounds

00:01:00.522 --> 00:01:02.960
to keep the ratios constant.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.642
So, times 2.5,

00:01:05.642 --> 00:01:07.938
and what's 7 times 2.5?

00:01:07.938 --> 00:01:08.791
Well, let's see.

00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:11.006
7 times 2 is 14.

00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:13.932
7 times 5 is 3.5.

00:01:13.932 --> 00:01:15.516
14 plus 3.5, this is going to be,

00:01:15.516 --> 00:01:19.458
this is going to be 17.5 pounds.

00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:21.774
And that's this choice right over here.

00:01:21.774 --> 00:01:24.032
And actually, even looking at the choices,

00:01:24.032 --> 00:01:25.807
you might have been able to get here

00:01:25.807 --> 00:01:27.127
even without doing this.

00:01:27.127 --> 00:01:29.687
Not too intensive mathematics.

00:01:29.687 --> 00:01:30.642
Because you can say, okay look,

00:01:30.642 --> 00:01:34.909
the pounds are kind of close
to the amount of leather.

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.107
But they're less than it.

00:01:36.107 --> 00:01:39.221
So, we wouldn't want 23 pounds of plums

00:01:39.221 --> 00:01:41.461
if we make 20 rolls of fruit leather.

00:01:41.461 --> 00:01:43.330
This is more than 20.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.455
And if we're making, if
we're making more rolls

00:01:47.455 --> 00:01:49.529
than the 7 pounds, than
we were able to make

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:50.624
with the 7 pounds,

00:01:50.624 --> 00:01:55.135
we're not gonna be able to
have fewer pounds there.

00:01:55.135 --> 00:01:56.597
So you could have actually
ruled out all of them

00:01:56.597 --> 00:01:59.747
just based on the logic to get to 17.5.

00:01:59.747 --> 00:02:03.079
But it's always satisfying
to do it the right way.

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.171
All right, but if you're
under time pressure,

00:02:05.171 --> 00:02:08.978
you know, deductive reasoning
isn't always a bad thing.
