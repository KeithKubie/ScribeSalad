[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:10.400
Hi, thanks for that talk.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.620
That was really, really,
really interesting.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.746
I know at the LHC, there's
been a blip at 750 GV.

00:00:17.746 --> 00:00:19.700
Do you have any idea
what that might be?

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.250
It might be supersymmetry?

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.820
So interestingly, so
I should point out,

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.370
because I work on
accelerators, I'm

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.252
not part of that
particular collaboration.

00:00:29.252 --> 00:00:31.710
So I'm not-- but I do have a
background in particle physics

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.626
and I went to a seminar
on that the other day.

00:00:33.626 --> 00:00:35.360
So I can tell you
categorically that they

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.706
don't know what it is.

00:00:36.706 --> 00:00:41.170
[LAUGHING]

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.690
Yet.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:42.431
Yet.

00:00:42.431 --> 00:00:43.930
In fact, they don't
know-- the thing

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.360
is about the statistics
of particle physics

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.810
is blips can seem to appear.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.330
And then when you get more data,
they can seem to disappear.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.996
So this is an exciting
one at the moment

00:00:53.996 --> 00:00:57.060
because it has almost kind
of something like three sigma

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.160
significance.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.920
If you've been following, three
sigma is kind of always a hint,

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.660
five sigma is
discovery, champagne.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.070
So it's not quite at
the significance level

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.086
that we need yet.

00:01:09.086 --> 00:01:10.960
So really there, we're
waiting for more data.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.810
And that should
actually be released,

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.760
those results, within the next
few weeks I think actually.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.610
So watch the news for that.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.510
It might disappear though.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.570
But let's hope something
else crops up in its place.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.850
Yeah, John do you want
to add to that, maybe?

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.787
Or ask something else?

00:01:29.787 --> 00:01:30.620
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.630
He's the expert to ask.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.300
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.800
No, no.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.600
I don't know anymore,
you said it very well.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.930
No, entirely different,
it was a wonderful talk.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:38.430
Thank you.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.310
And I'm not an expert
on accelerators,

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.790
I just get the data.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.550
So it was really good
to see how they work.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.000
Now I also am aware of people
from the high energy physics

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.690
community investing
in plasma wakefield

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.690
technologies, not only for
high energy actually but also

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:57.640
further applications.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.210
I just wondered if you
had any comments on that?

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.390
Do you think it's a runner?

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.700
Should we be worrying more
about that or is it interesting?

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.370
Worrying, no.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.850
Supporting, yes.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.650
So plasma wakefield
acceleration is

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.430
a sort of relatively
new concept where

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.970
you generate a plasma, a
much higher temperature

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.300
than this one.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.830
And inside a plasma, the
electrons and the ions

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.920
are already broken
down so it can't spark.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.800
And so that can give you a very,
very high gradient accelerating

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.539
field.

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:27.330
Now at the moment, the
status of that field

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.670
and those experiments
is that they

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.540
can generate very, very high
gradient but only over a very,

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.400
very tiny distance.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.070
So their not reaching
massive energies,

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.020
they're pretty reasonable
for the tabletop

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.950
size of the experiment.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.290
In terms of applications,
some of the things

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.090
that they will create will
be useful for applications,

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.406
especially at the sort
of low energy level.

00:02:48.406 --> 00:02:50.780
But the beams they create at
the moment to an accelerator

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.041
physicist-- [INAUDIBLE] not
going to mind if I say rubbish.

00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:58.540
They have a very large spread
of energy, they're very messy,

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.230
they're very unpredictable,
they're very irreproducible.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.392
Shot to shot there's
quite a difference.

00:03:04.392 --> 00:03:05.850
That doesn't mean
they're not going

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.320
to be really useful for
something application-wise.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.800
It may mean that
you could figure out

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.220
how to put different
sections after each other

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.390
to drive up to very,
very high energies

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.950
and learn to control that.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.000
In my particular field
of high intensity,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.930
it's not something
at the moment that we

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.270
can conceive of being
a competitor to a more

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.850
conventional type
of accelerator.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.670
But while we're
opening up the field

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.380
of different
applications, there's

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.256
certainly a place for having
very compact sources that

00:03:38.256 --> 00:03:39.880
perhaps could go on
the back of a truck

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.410
or out into the field to
widen the applicability

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.590
of the machines.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.250
Thanks.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.812
There's a gentleman there
in the white with a red tie.

00:03:50.812 --> 00:03:52.020
Just wait for the microphone.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.246
Jane, he's just there.

00:03:54.246 --> 00:03:55.584
Is it this gentleman?

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.610
I'm a med chemist.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.460
Can you explain to me one
thing that's puzzling me?

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.660
In terms of medical
applications,

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.460
specifically to
treatment of cancer.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.960
Yeah.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:14.020
A proton is, what, 1,837
times as heavy as an electron.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.240
Does that mean that a proton
beam has a disadvantage because

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:24.230
of the much higher momentum
of damaging surrounding

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.160
non-cancerous cells
compared with an electron

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.360
beam or beta rays?

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.850
How does it actually stand in
terms of medical applications--

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.590
proton versus electron.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.100
So quite the opposite, it
has quite a neat advantage.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.570
You're lucky my
PhD was designing

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.780
a machine for proton therapy,
so this is very much my area.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.750
So protons, when they go
into the body, go into water,

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.460
they have a very
different interaction

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.850
with-- as they go through,
compared to say x-rays.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.040
So if x-rays go in, they deposit
most of their dose on their way

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.700
in, and then they're dose rate
falls off as it goes deeper

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.334
into the body.

00:04:58.334 --> 00:05:01.000
And the same is actually true of
electrons because they're light

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.490
and they interact easily.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.560
The protons are heavier,
they have higher energy.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.510
They don't interact as easily.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.620
So they go in and they
don't deposit much energy,

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.430
say something like
20% of the dose.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.544
But then the great
thing about protons

00:05:13.544 --> 00:05:15.960
is they actually slow down
towards the end of their range.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.950
And that dose level goes up and
you create this peak of dose

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.490
at the very end of
the proton range.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:23.720
And then the protons stop.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.990
And we call this
shape the Bragg peak.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.450
And it's a very well
understood description

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.540
in physics of how that works.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.430
So proton beams, you can
actually deliver a higher dose

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.400
more accurately,
further into the body

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.100
without damaging
surrounding tissue.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.300
And in order to tune
the depth of that peak

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.800
and where it lands,
you just have

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.186
to change the energy
of the incoming beam.

00:05:49.186 --> 00:05:52.590
And these machines are
something like-- to get

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.630
about 25 centimeters, which
is the range of most people's

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.710
bodies, it requires about 250
Mega electron Volt protons.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.410
So the slight downside
is it requires

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.860
a much larger accelerator than
conventional radiotherapy.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.350
But it is a standard
technique now.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.630
Proton therapy has treated
more than 115,000 patients

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:11.470
around the world.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.830
And the NHS are currently
building two full body proton

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.510
therapy centers in the UK.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:21.660
They're particularly good for
childhood cases of cancer,

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.290
where you don't want
additional dose in the body

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:29.954
because that can induce later
effects later in their life.

00:06:29.954 --> 00:06:31.620
And it's particularly
good for very deep

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.210
seated and hard
to reach cancers.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.620
So we will be getting
that before long.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.120
And that's something
that also we're

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.140
trying to develop the technology
to shrink down the size

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.620
and cost of those accelerators
and improve the treatment

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.450
outcome as well.

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:47.070
Thank you.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.562
Nice question.

00:06:48.562 --> 00:06:53.830
Can resonances be controlled
by using dampening devices

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.480
and so reduce the spread of
a mix of particles in a beam?

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:58.981
Thank you.

00:06:58.981 --> 00:06:59.480
Yes.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.300
Brilliant question.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.030
Yeah, that's kind of
the next step, isn't it?

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.800
So these resonances,
I kind of only

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.050
introduced a sort of
basic form of them.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.760
But they can actually happen
in many different dimensions

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.760
with many different
interactions and there

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.625
are many different
so-called instabilities

00:07:15.625 --> 00:07:18.000
that can build up at different
points in the acceleration

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.680
cycle.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.890
Some of those we can
damp with oscillators.

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.700
So we measure the oscillations.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.170
We have a very fast
feedback system.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.570
And then some kind of dampening
system tuned to that in order

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:33.050
to damp it back down again.

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.610
The ones in the main beam
with that spread of tunes

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:39.110
that I was talking about,
unfortunately if you damp one,

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:40.240
you'll drive another.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.190
So that makes it
slightly more difficult.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:47.610
But yes, in principle
we are thinking

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.690
more about how to use, say,
high frequency dampening

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.140
systems to do that.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.060
But some of those take
a long time as well.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.960
So that's-- if you're trying to
accelerate a beam very quickly,

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.090
many cycles a second, that
can get in the way as well.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:05.060
So great question, thank you.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.211
Marcia, is there anyone
up in the gallery?

00:08:07.211 --> 00:08:08.210
Because I always forget.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:08.860
No?

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.210
There's one up there.

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:11.790
Or there's a question over here.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:14.330
Cheeky in the front, here.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:19.460
A few months ago, we had a
lecture on fusion reactors.

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:23.155
And the gentleman there was
saying that on ITER they

00:08:23.155 --> 00:08:25.490
had modified the
field so it doesn't

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:29.559
hit the outside of the toroid
by having a helical field going

00:08:29.559 --> 00:08:30.350
around the outside.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.433
And I'm wondering whether
the things you are doing

00:08:32.433 --> 00:08:35.850
has any applications
to fusion reactors?

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:36.350
Yes.

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:39.110
So we can't contain our
beam in quite the same way

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:42.320
because it's a much
higher energy beam

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.070
and it's much more precise.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.510
But interestingly, on
the other end of that,

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:48.970
there is one very
important application

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:52.500
of high intensity accelerators
related to fusion energy.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.540
In fact, it's vital
for fusion energy

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:57.920
because as these fusion
reactors operate,

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.260
they get a huge
amount of radiation

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.140
into the walls of the vessel
despite it being contained.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.100
There's a lot of
radiation hitting the side

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.700
of the wall of those vessels.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:11.510
And that causes a lot of
defamation and destruction

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:14.032
of the material that we
don't understand very well

00:09:14.032 --> 00:09:15.990
at the moment because
we've literally never had

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:20.460
a device that spat that many--
that much radiation of that

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.550
form at those
kinds of materials.

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:24.350
So there's a facility
being developed

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:28.150
called the-- it's IFMIF.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:32.521
It's the International Fusion
Materials Irradiation Facility.

00:09:32.521 --> 00:09:33.020
Yes!

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:39.770
And that's actually going
to take quite a low energy.

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:41.610
It's much, much lower
energy than the ones

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:45.020
I was talking about even,
but even higher intensity

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:48.150
of deuterons usually, because
that simulates the radiation

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:49.740
they're getting off.

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.630
And that's such a challenging
accelerator to build.

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:54.990
They're actually building--
their current project

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:58.120
is to build a prototype to even
prove that they could build

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.790
the accelerator to do that.

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.250
So then they can create
a materials and radiation

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:06.040
facility to try and understand
how the materials in a fusion

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.600
reactor are going to behave
when they're actually

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.820
in the real deal.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.570
So that itself is
an ongoing project.

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:15.429
Because it's low
energy, they face

00:10:15.429 --> 00:10:17.220
slightly different
challenges from the ones

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.360
that we do up at the
slightly higher energies.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.240
But yeah, it's a
vital thing for them

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.430
to figure out how
to do this stuff

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:27.380
is to also potentially
realize fusion energy.

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.460
Yeah.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.501
So I think this is going
to be the last question.

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:37.580
With the catastrophic
political shift that we've had

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:41.500
[INAUDIBLE], I've
got to bring it up.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.895
This is clearly a very
collaborative field

00:10:43.895 --> 00:10:45.600
of research.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.270
What's going to
happen in the future?

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:49.840
So, yeah, it is a
very collaborative

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.510
and very international
field both in Europe

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:54.770
and all around the world.

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:57.540
So I can't speak for the
future of something like CERN.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.700
CERN is a political
organization,

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.200
the UK is a member
state, so I don't

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.400
think that will be affected.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.630
However, in the
sciences generally,

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:08.350
a lot of our funding, about
10% of the UK science funding

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.740
comes from the EU at the moment.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:14.090
And so that is likely
to have a large impact.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:17.250
My institute-- I think,
some of our major projects

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:18.930
are European funded.

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:20.470
In the short term,
of course, we're

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:23.630
told those will continue
to be funded no problem.

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:26.050
But in the future, you
know, it could seriously

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:30.040
impact the progress and
especially the UK's standing.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.300
We lead a lot of these
projects at the moment,

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:36.170
and we may not be
able to in the future.

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:38.930
So I was hoping rather to get
to the end of your discourse,

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.760
maybe without that
kind of question.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.610
Someone had to throw it in.

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:47.196
An opportune moment to
actually start clapping again

00:11:47.196 --> 00:11:49.974
and [? recognize ?] Susie's
fantastic discourse.

00:11:49.974 --> 00:11:51.515
Thank you for so
much for explaining.

00:11:51.515 --> 00:11:52.014
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:52.014 --> 00:11:54.520
Thank you very much.
