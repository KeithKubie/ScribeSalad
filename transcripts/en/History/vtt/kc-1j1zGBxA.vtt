[music playing]

00:00:01.835 --> 00:00:04.170
Med checks are
today at some point.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.208
But I honestly don't
see them medically

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:11.111
pulling me due to my weight.

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:13.213
I think I went in
here heavy enough

00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:18.017
that that's probably not going
to happen, but you never know.

00:00:25.258 --> 00:00:29.462
I feel really kind of
uncomfortable in the fact

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:34.901
that I'll have to take off my
warm sweater and get weighed,

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:38.638
and I just am not
very happy about it.

00:00:38.638 --> 00:00:40.240
- All right.
- You're good.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.410
I know I've got a
long ways to go.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.678
No, I'm not just
slaying it out here.

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:48.515
I'm very vulnerable,
and all I've

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:51.284
got left is this
really hard dark push

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:53.553
through the pain
kind of time, and I

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:56.055
just want to get through it.

00:00:56.055 --> 00:01:01.895
Honestly, you know, I'm ready
to-- ready to go at this point

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:04.597
any time.

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:08.902
It's-- if this is just
a wilderness excursion,

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:11.704
just me, you know, I
left a little bit ago.

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:16.142
But I'm willing to push myself
to provide for my family.

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:28.555
[crying]

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:40.333
I miss those kids a lot.

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:43.403
Like, I can--

00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:48.808
I feel like I've got
a little bit in me

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:52.912
even without a lot of
food and all that, but--

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:56.282
[music playing]

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:02.755
Hi, babe.

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:04.257
Oh.

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:05.225
SYDNEY: Hi.

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:09.162
[weeping]

00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:10.063
You did it.

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:19.405
You did it!

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:26.346
MAN: Oh my gosh.

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:27.113
Oh.

00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:28.848
How are you feeling?

00:02:28.848 --> 00:02:32.118
Oh, I'm so happy to see you.

00:02:32.118 --> 00:02:35.388
Oh my gosh.

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:38.091
I had no idea it
would happen today.

00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:41.594
Oh, yes.
All right.

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:42.795
Who has food?

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:44.531
Who has stinking food?

00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:47.667
Which one of you guys
brought food with you?

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:48.768
Do you have food?
- Hi.

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:49.469
No.

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:50.236
Oh, you're so pretty.

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:51.704
Hi.

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:54.641
[crying]

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:59.479
We get to buy a house
and a car that doesn't

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:01.147
break down all the time.

00:03:01.147 --> 00:03:02.849
Has the car been
running OK for you guys?

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.385
- Yes.
- OK.

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:06.319
Oh, my gosh.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.387
Oh!

00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:12.625
[crying] Oh, I am so
thankful to see you.

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:13.626
Good.

00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:15.662
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:16.763
MAN: How are the kids doing?

00:03:16.763 --> 00:03:18.264
SYDNEY: They're doing good.

00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:21.100
I just thought about
you guys the whole time,

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.237
and I just thought
about, like, man--

00:03:24.237 --> 00:03:28.308
I was like, Sydney's back
home, and she's with the kids,

00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:31.344
and she doesn't have a
tap out button, you know?

00:03:31.344 --> 00:03:33.713
She can't just-- she
can't just give up,

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:36.215
so I'm not just going
to give up, you know?

00:03:36.215 --> 00:03:37.016
SYDNEY: You didn't.

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:39.953
I can't believe it.
