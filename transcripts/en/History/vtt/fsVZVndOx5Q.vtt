00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:04.404
- Right when I got back from

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:07.040
That's what my wife said,
she said I was a hot mess.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.309
I didn't want to
reintegrate into society.

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.444
I couldn't be in
crowded places anymore.

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:13.680
It made me really twitchy.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.982
I hated going to work again.

00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:17.283
Rachel?

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:19.419
That's what really made
me realize how much

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:21.221
I miss you and miss the family.

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:23.223
I think I'm healed now.

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:24.257
I think this healed me.

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:36.936
[crying]

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:39.239
I didn't even think of that.

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.273
I think this did heal me.

00:00:40.273 --> 00:00:43.510
I think this trip healed me.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.678
I was such a mess
after Vancouver Island.

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:51.017
I just didn't want life at all.

00:00:51.017 --> 00:00:53.186
I didn't want anything.

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:54.053
Now, I want it all.

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:57.690
I want it back again.

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:05.899
Since I've been
here, I've realized I

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:10.970
truly deep down need my family.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.173
It's not a superficial need.

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:15.842
I need my family to survive.

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:19.412
But I'm conflicted because
I know I could stay longer.

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:22.081
It would be torture
staying longer.

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:23.883
I want to go home.

00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:25.718
I miss my family.

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:29.055
I miss the creature
comforts in life.

00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:31.891
I'm done.

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:34.727
[beep sound]

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:35.829
Hello, this is Larry.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.630
I'm ready for you guys
to come get me, man.

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:55.882
[truck approaching]

00:01:55.882 --> 00:01:57.584
Mongolia kind of slapped
me upside the head

00:01:57.584 --> 00:02:00.954
and said, listen, you little
moron, you got a good job,

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:04.224
you got an awesome wife,
you have fantastic kids,

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:06.993
just stop moping
around and enjoy life.

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:10.430
I have just enjoyed
the experience so

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.832
much more than I did
on Vancouver Island

00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:15.201
and now I'm ready to go home.

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:17.136
And I've got fantastic
people in my life

00:02:17.136 --> 00:02:18.972
that I want to keep
close to and I don't

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:21.107
want to leave them ever again.

00:02:21.107 --> 00:02:22.542
And that's what I
learned out here.

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:30.517
I'm going to remember
what it's like to starve.

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:32.151
I'm going to remember
what it's like to not

00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:35.421
be able to talk to your
friends or talk to you wife.

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:39.392
But I'm also going to
remember the blue sky,

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:42.929
the ice crystals on the trees.

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:44.964
I'm going to remember
my fishing pole

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:48.701
and how I caught a
lot of fish on that.

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:51.337
I've gotten everything out
of this experience I can get.

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:54.407
I had the most pleasure, the
most discomfort that helped

00:02:54.407 --> 00:02:56.743
teach myself these lessons.

00:02:56.743 --> 00:03:01.347
Vancouver Island broke me down
to just a shell of a person.

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:05.218
This time I am leaving
on my own terms.

00:03:05.218 --> 00:03:07.220
It's OK to know
your limitations.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.956
And it's OK, I don't have
to push myself as hard as I

00:03:09.956 --> 00:03:11.291
pushed myself my entire life.

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:13.760
I'm starting to realize that.
