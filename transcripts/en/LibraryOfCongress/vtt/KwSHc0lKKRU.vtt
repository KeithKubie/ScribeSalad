00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.790
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.210
I'm so pleased to see you here.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.730
I'm, my David Plylar, I'm
with the Music Division

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.400
of the Library of Congress.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.040
And, I'm especially
excited about this program.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.660
It's one that I wanted to do
for a long time, every since I,

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.570
I didn't realize that we
had so many manuscripts

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.750
of Charles Griffes
in our collection.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.100
So, when I came across
them, I'd always hoped

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.880
that we'd have an opportunity

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.910
to have these pieces performed
along with several other items

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.000
in our collection including
two works by Amy Beach

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.870
and then also the Cesar Franck
Prelude, chorale et fugue.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.870
I remembered hearing
Solungga Liu's recording of,

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.170
or All Griffes Recordings,

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.690
selections of his
major piano works.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.290
And, I was really taken with it.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.630
So, she was willing to work
with me on this program

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.960
and put together something that
was really quite something,

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.260
so I think you'll be
in for a real treat

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.740
when you hear her
play starting at 2.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.410
One of the nice things about it,
it also includes what we believe

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.750
to be a world premiere
of a piano transcriptions

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.430
of Griffes' of a WC work.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.660
So, I'll say a bit
more about that soon.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.000
But, it's basically a work
that's been hidden away or,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.830
at least, unplayed in public,
we think, for about 102 years.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.590
So, just so you can get
a sense of, kind of,

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.560
the scope of our
Griffes collection,

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.600
we have two main areas where
we hold Griffes' manuscripts.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.410
One is just kind of the general
ML 96 manuscript collection.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.950
The other one is the Hineman
[assumed spelling] Collection.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.880
We have a number
of Griffes' songs

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.920
in German, some in English.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.150
He spent about four years
in Germany and so he tended

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.260
to produce those German
leader when he was in Berlin.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.440
But, there's several other works
that he produced at that time

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.300
that also have German
titles like the Fantasy

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.930
with Ephontisia [assumed
spelling] title and whatnot.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.210
We also have, so the
Hineman Collection,

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.170
which is a collection that
came to us with a number

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.050
of different manuscripts
already in it

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.920
and then also things acquired
to add to it over the years.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.400
So, part of these, of these
collections are number

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.910
of piano manuscripts
in his hand.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.920
And, the items that are

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.350
in red are manuscripts
that we all have.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.270
One little note about it is that
the Pleasure Dome of Kubla Khan,

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.210
where it says two sources, the
manuscript sources that we have

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.910
for that are not
the piano version

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.870
that you're going to hear today.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.810
They're two versions of
the orchestral version

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.260
that was done a bit
later in life.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.110
And, I'll say a bit about that
when we get to that piece.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.550
So, part of what, maybe
before I start, one thing I'd

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.850
like to know is how many

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.040
of you know Charles
Griffes' piano music?

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.970
Okay, well we have some people
who already know this music.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.920
So, I hope you're, well
like, are familiar with it

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.670
to the point where
it's something

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.570
that you're comfortable with or
enjoy listening to on the side

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.220
or something, I don't know.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.540
Lots of times, composers get
into this kind of obscurity

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.310
that they don't deserve and
their music is quite on par

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.590
with others of the
same time period.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.510
And, just for quarks of
fate, we don't know it

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.000
as well as we would like to.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.780
And, that's why it's also
a nice pleasure to be able

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.600
to present this music today.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.330
One of the main reasons
that we don't know as much

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.040
of Charles Griffes'
music is because he died

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.330
so young, at the age of 35.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.090
And, it was an unexpected
illness right at the, kind of,

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.320
pinnacle of his, well, pinnacle,

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.590
more like in a valley
right before his career was

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.990
about to take off.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:25.060
But he had produced a number
of orchestral transcriptions

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.240
of piano works that
were really taking off.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.630
So, Pierre Monteux of the Boston
City Orchestra performed the

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.510
Pleasure Dome of Kubla
Khan to rave reviews.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.340
They played it again at Carnegie
Hall a bit later in that year.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.490
And then, shortly
thereafter, he was,

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.190
that was actually the last
time that Griffes appeared

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.670
in public was at that
Carnegie Hall Concert.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.430
And then, he was too sick
to travel after that.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.370
But, shortly later, Stokowski

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.370
in Philadelphia premiered
several transcriptions

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.890
of his earlier piano works,
some of which you'll hear today.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.590
And then, those were
well received.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.040
But, he was never
able to hear them.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.920
So, it's kind of a sad story.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:14.210
But, while it is a, you know,
it's obviously not a good thing

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.260
that we lost him so young,
there's really quite a lot

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.530
to celebrate about
what he was able

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.690
to accomplish in
so short a time.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:28.350
He, and, you know, speaking
to the pianist today

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.170
about these works, and, one
thing that she really brings

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.580
out is that she doesn't feel
like he ever repeats himself.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.760
There's this element of,
while he's often described

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.400
as an impressionist, a romantic
impressionist or something

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.920
like that, he's also very much

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.280
in a Vanguard composer
for the time.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.490
And, he's always experimenting
with what he's doing.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.710
And, I think that you'll find
that, across these pieces

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.720
that we're going
to listen to today.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.230
So, we're going to just take
a kind of a quick survey.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.660
I'm going to show you, we'll
focus on the main piano works

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.750
that are going to
be performed today,

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.230
but also play you
just the openings

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.350
of a few other movements that
you're not going to hear just

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.650
so you can kind of get a sense

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.240
of the breadth that
he has to offer.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.350
Solungga also, very kindly,
allowed me to use her CD.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.890
So, this is her recording.

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.470
So, it's nice, and I have
her permissions to use it

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.450
which is always a pleasure.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:35.190
So, the pieces that, he wrote a
lot of works in his short life,

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.000
many of which are
short and small.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.700
The pianos not, that's
at the end there,

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.000
is not his firs sonata.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.140
There are a number of
others sonatas unpublished

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:50.160
and they're the, they're his
Biographer, Donna Anderson,

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.580
has been working on creating
editions of these other things.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.390
She is one of the people
who clears the edition

00:06:55.390 --> 00:07:00.710
of the Pleasure Dome of Kubla
Khan for piano in the 90s.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.790
But, these things are
not readily available

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.810
with the exception of the
Three Tone Pictures Opus 5,

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:11.400
the Fantasy Pieces Opus 6,
and the Roman Sketches Opus 7.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.640
The sonata's also
very much available.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.290
And now, since the
90s, the Pleasure Dome

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:19.510
of Kubla Khan is available.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.780
The other pieces listed
there that I'm not going

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.370
to really play anything
from, Winter Landscape,

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.300
De Profundis, and the Legend.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.140
And, there are a number of
other smaller little pieces.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.440
They're just examples
of character pieces

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.070
that are worth just
checking out on your own,

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:35.380
if you find this
music interesting.

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:42.040
One of the things I
admire about Griffes,

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:47.780
beyond just liking his music,
is that he was a very avid

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:52.000
and active and successful
transcriber of his own work.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.790
So, the Three Tone Picture, of
which we're going to hear two

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:58.540
of them during the concert, he
transcribed twice, once for Wind

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:02.090
and Harp, Winds and Harp and
then another one for kind

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:05.900
of a dec tech plus piano.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.910
So, Five Winds and Five Strings.

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.760
If you can hunt them down,

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.460
they're really worth listening
to, they're quite something

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.420
and interesting to hear.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:21.350
So, starting with the Lake at
Evening, this is, I'm just going

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:24.050
to play the opening of it so you
can get the sense of the kind

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:28.650
of placid and beautiful writing
that Griffes was known for.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:34.510
Sorry, it's not set up.

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:39.510
[ Background noise ]

00:08:39.510 --> 00:09:20.660
[ Music ]

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:25.120
So, you have to forgive me for
stopping, [inaudible] here.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:33.070
So, you know, one of the
techniques here is to keep kind

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:35.770
of a pedal point pitch going.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:37.990
The pitch changes a couple of
times throughout the piece.

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:41.770
But, you basically have this
gorgeous melody that's maybe

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:45.820
reminiscent of [Inaudible]
towards the center

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.590
of the piece which,
in turn is reminiscent

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:53.800
of Chopin Nocturne A Flat Major.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:58.050
But, the it's just kind of
a perfectly formed piece.

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:01.510
And so, I think that you'll
enjoy that as an opener.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:03.440
We're not going to hear
the Vail of Dreams.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.020
But, I also feel like you should
hear this, just the opening

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.670
of it, to see what kind
of a different type

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.170
of work this is already.

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:15.030
All the works that we're going
to hear today are composed,

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:19.090
were composed between
1910 and 1919 in terms

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:20.930
of including revisions.

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:23.160
So, it's really a short
period of his time.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.460
So, just bear that in mind

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.510
as you hear the different
varieties.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:11:07.800
[ Music ]

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.910
So, all these works
that have these kind

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:13.560
of easy going beginnings
in terms of just getting us

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.860
into the sound world play,

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.920
he tends to push the
pianist quite a bit

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.340
as the pieces progress.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:23.840
So, they, not only is there
interesting development

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.630
of the material itself but
it also is demonstrative

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:30.470
of his mastery of the
use of the keyboard.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:32.320
He was a pianist himself.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.190
And, it would've been
interesting to hear him play.

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:37.440
But, you can already hear
that this is starting to work

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.740
into a different sound world.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.540
And, it's still doing sort
of a peddle point type of,

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.390
in this case instead of a
single pitch, we're looking

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.510
at chords that are repeating.

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:50.120
[ Background noise ]

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.030
We will hear the Night Winds.

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:54.890
And, this is one where I think
it's worth taking a listen

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:59.560
to the version for winds,
strings, and piano just

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.630
because it's a kind of
interesting orchestration.

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:05.710
Here, one of the things,
and there's lots of examples

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:09.350
across the literature of
works that evoke, you know,

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:12.090
running streams and blowing
wind and stuff like that.

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:13.390
So, there, it's hard

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:15.870
to do something terribly
original along those lines,

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:19.860
especially when you're writing
already in the 20th century.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.150
But, he does something
interesting here with the way

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:25.940
that he divides up the pitches.

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:30.550
You'll notice that it's using
stacked 4ths, sometimes they're

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:31.850
in 2nds and stuff like that.

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:34.840
But, he tends to limit
the gamut of things

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.650
to still they're basically
a modified triadic kind

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:39.950
of a thing.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:42.870
And, eventually, they change,
as you can see even by the end

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.380
of that first page,
there's chromatic,

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:48.750
chromaticism is introduced
or not.

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:52.600
But, it's, what the effect
is, at least to my ear,

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:56.090
is it turns back a kind
of wind motive into,

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:58.260
it almost doesn't
matter what it's doing.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.520
You'll aurally recognize
it as the wind

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.930
that was at the beginning.

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.590
So, you might sense that
there's lots of accompaniment

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:08.830
that goes along with
the melody that arises

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.110
in that second system there.

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:13.130
But, when it returns
to that wind music,

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:14.510
you'll immediately know it.

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:16.260
And, it's because
of the pitch content

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.140
that he chose, in my opinion.

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.470
So, let's hear a
little bit of that.

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:23.430
There's also this one, we
won't play it to this point,

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:27.510
but there's a remarkable change
that happens at the end of the,

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:30.680
towards the end of the work
where he goes into E flat minor.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:34.890
And, you can see these just
kind of bare chords in the base,

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:37.720
not bare but they're
just kind of suddenly,

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.390
I think it's even marked
in stereo so they're,

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:43.550
and you still have the wind
kind of coming back above it.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:49.390
But now, it's in this context of
the settled E flat minor chords

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:54.720
which never go away even
though he moves away, kind of,

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.450
he wobbles around
a bit harmonically.

00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:03.710
So, it's a bit on
the progressive side.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:05.510
Here's the opening of that.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:35.490
[ Music ]

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:36.790
I always hate to stop.

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:38.590
But, you'll get to
hear it shortly.

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:42.820
[ Background noise ]

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:45.710
The next pieces that we're going
to represent on the program are,

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:47.680
we'll do the complete
set, I won't be,

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.390
but the pianist will be
doing, thankfully not me,

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:54.680
the Fantasy Pieces Opus 6.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:58.610
And these, these ones are
more, it's a Barcarolle,

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:00.630
a Nocturne, and a Scherzo.

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:03.390
We have a, hopefully I'm
not misremembering this but,

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:06.460
we have the Barcarolle and
the Nocturne manuscripts.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:10.430
And, originally it's, well
that's the other piece.

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:13.140
These were not always
grouped this way in terms

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.440
of what they were going to be.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:18.060
They kind of coalesced into this
when he was going to get them,

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:21.190
trying to get them published
by Schirmer, and in particular,

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:25.810
1915, 1916 this period when he
was able to convince Schirmer

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:28.730
to actually publish
his piano music.

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:32.100
They have already published,
earlier, I think it was early

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.310
as 1910, 1911 something like
that, a few of his songs,

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:37.590
they've added a few
more songs after that.

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:42.580
But, it actually took a letter
from Busoni to convince them

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:45.770
to take on his piano works.

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:47.400
And, thankfully, they
did because they're,

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:51.430
this is one of the ways we have
some good editions with these.

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:53.530
One thing I didn't
notice, but you'll find

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.920
in the program notes, once we
get them, is these descriptions

00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:00.390
that he would attach
to each of these.

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:06.160
In this case, it's a poetic,
it's actually, it's from a poem

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:11.150
by William Sharp which is also
is the poet who's pseudonymously

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:13.190
is known as Fiona Macleod.

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:19.420
So, they have some songs that
use his, her texts as well.

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:23.210
One of the things I just want
to point out about this piece,

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:25.910
and maybe I'll try to,
this is a longer work,

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:27.490
I'll see if I can
get to the right spot

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:30.010
to show you the second
part of it.

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:32.160
This one actually
really reminds of Busoni.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.970
It strikes me as something
that Busoni would do.

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:40.180
So, an Barcarolle kind of
Italianate type of music,

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:44.730
the main melody that you see
there just simply by itself,

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:47.330
if you just look at the pictures
there basically there's a whole

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:48.630
tone scale.

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:51.850
So, the E natural is
the unexpected one,

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:53.750
if we're thinking in B flat.

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:58.690
And, not to get too technical
about it or anything, but,

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:01.140
what's interesting is he turns
something that's so simple

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:07.230
and lovely into something that's
quite different which is that,

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:11.350
on the right side of your
screen, you'll see basically

00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:15.850
and A minor arpeggio's in the
base, just very straightforward.

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:17.230
And then, on the right hand,

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:21.950
you'll have this
stressed mark melody

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:23.560
that uses the same pitch set.

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:27.510
The B flat, just think of it as
an A sharp, it's just another,

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:30.370
sorry, another whole
tone grouping,

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:33.070
but in a different key.

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:34.850
So, you're not hearing,

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:36.870
well it's not really a
key, it's this whole tone.

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:41.040
But, you start to hear it as
this kind of jostling things.

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.670
But, it's a really beautiful
effect and quite something

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:48.220
as kind of just an eerie
moment in the work.

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:51.510
So, here's just a, to give us
a sense of that let's hear it.

00:17:51.510 --> 00:18:45.570
[ Music ]

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:47.870
I one to just go back and
skip to that other spot.

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:49.670
I think it's here.

00:18:49.670 --> 00:19:09.950
[ Music ]

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:11.890
So, the eyeball method
of trying to find

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:14.520
that is clearly not the
best way to do that.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.010
So, you'll hear it.

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:17.520
Just, it'll be, it'll be clear.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.630
There's just different ways
that he does it in terms

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:22.720
of the just the position
of different ideas.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.390
They're still quite recognizable
and clearly meant to be melodic

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:29.780
and accompanied in a
very traditional way.

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:32.330
But, there's some kind
of cognitive dissonance

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:36.180
that happens there between
what you expect to hear

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.270
and what you end up hearing.

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:39.950
And, that's the kind of thing

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:42.750
that I think is really
attractive

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:45.470
about his music,
one of those things.

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:49.460
I won't play this part, but,
at the, towards the end,

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.790
and there's another spot
earlier in the piece

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:56.130
where the music is very, kind
of, mixed modal type of thing.

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:58.040
You can see it gets quite big

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.670
with these large
combination scale arpeggios

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:04.490
which are really effective
piano writing there

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:06.670
on that second system
and down to the bottom.

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:11.860
But also, that section at the
top with kind of going back

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:16.330
and forth between modes
is quite effective.

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:23.690
The Notturno is another piece
that just immediately goes

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:29.070
into a different world
except that, you'll notice

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:32.090
that the pitch collections
that you'll hear

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:34.780
at the beginning share
something quite in common

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.270
with that first piece
we were looking at.

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:40.110
So, if you have the E flat,
the G, the F, and the A,

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:44.490
you're looking at another
collection there whole tones.

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:46.830
So, let's hear the
beginning of this.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:49.380
And, this is a very melodic work

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:51.090
but develops in interesting
ways.

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:52.390
And, one of the things
to listen for,

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:54.120
when you're hearing
the whole piece,

00:20:54.120 --> 00:21:00.290
is the way that Griffes morphs
the accompaniment very naturally

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:04.650
so that it gives what would
otherwise be a too simple

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:08.500
melodic idea, it gives
it lots of space to grow

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.510
and still remain
very interesting.

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:46.070
[ Music ]

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:48.350
So, you can hear, you
know, this is coming

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.190
from the Chopin Nocturne realm

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:52.620
but also very much
the Debussy realm.

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:54.610
And, particularly, actually,
there's another piece

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:57.080
on this program that
is, quite deliberately

00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:01.150
from the Debussy Nocturne
realm, speaking of Nuage,

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:04.200
the clouds were from
one of the Nocturnes.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.680
Griffes has a piece called
Clouds that he, where he draws

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.360
on some of Debussy's
ideas there.

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:14.520
I'm going a little bit fast
just to make sure we are going

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:15.820
to get through everything.

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:20.520
There's some interesting
stuff coming up as well.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:24.020
The Scherzo shows a completely
different side of Griffes.

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:25.320
So, everything we've
been hearing

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.820
so far has been pretty subdued.

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:31.760
But, the Scherzo
gets kind of ruckus.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.240
And he, eventually,
he came back to it

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.220
in 1919 and orchestrated it.

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.780
It's a nice short
orchestral piece.

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:41.750
Really would be very
good as an encore work.

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:43.550
I think I have that.

00:22:43.550 --> 00:23:23.090
[ Music ]

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:24.740
So, yeah it's a very
different world.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:29.650
And, it has a nice contrasting
trio section but still kind

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:33.430
of maintains its energy
all the way throughout it,

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:34.730
if you're thinking of a Scherzo.

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:37.980
This is that transitioning
into the trio like section.

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:42.460
And, the Roman Sketches
are another set.

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:44.540
So it's, the White
Peacock is probably one

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:46.730
of Griffes' most famous pieces.

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:49.970
I'm not sure it's kind of a mix
of what other people know it

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.310
as a piano piece or
an orchestral piece.

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:56.230
But, in that case, it's
interesting in both ways.

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:58.640
And again, because he was
such a good orchestrator,

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.640
I think it's really
worth taking a look at.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:04.160
There's some controversy
about his orchestration.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.580
But, I tend to just
admire the default

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:09.010
of whatever the composer did.

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:11.250
It's kind of worth getting at.

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:14.160
And, that controversy
comes specifically

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.970
with the Pleasure
Dome of Kubla Kahn.

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:18.740
Well, I'll just say this now,

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:20.450
since we're already
talking about it.

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:25.810
Frederick Stock Conductor made
some changes for a 1928 edition,

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:30.450
this is 8 plus years
after Griffes passed away,

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:33.250
saying that there was some
discussions that he had with him

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:38.080
about changes to the
orchestration that, presumably,

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.040
Griffes was in favor of.

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:44.120
But there's, so not
impugning, Mr. Stock on this,

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.050
but there's some doubt
as to whether they were,

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:49.970
really would've been
approved by him, had he lived.

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:53.720
So, there's the early edition
that Pier Monteux continued

00:24:53.720 --> 00:25:00.960
to use throughout his career,
and, I know that Ozawa used

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.920
that edition as well,
the early edition

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.420
where you also will hear the
other version of ride through.

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.820
But anyway, if you take a
listen to their orchestrations,

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.120
you'll see what I mean.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.340
And, there's some
hideous synchresis there.

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:13.270
But that's a good
thing, I think.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:16.870
I don't like that, if
everybody sounded the same.

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:18.170
So, in any case, we're listening

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:20.100
to the piano version not
the orchestral version.

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:23.790
And, the White Peacock
has a fairly large poem,

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:27.230
and this is actually
the largest inscription

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:29.890
that Griffes uses in this set.

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:32.900
So, just kind of
there on the side,

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.710
it's kind of a different
type of peacock

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:36.010
than you might be thinking of.

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:41.740
It's lots of use of words
like pale and not colorful.

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:45.470
It's more like a this misty
blue smoke those types

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:46.850
of things coming up.

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:50.320
And so it, definitely, to
my mind brings the idea

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.860
of color to the forefront.

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:55.760
So, this is a great example of
really excellent orchestrating

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.410
for the piano as well.

00:25:57.410 --> 00:25:59.420
So here, I feel like
Griffes is trying to kind

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:03.780
of channel a combination
of Debussy and maybe Dukas

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:08.170
as you'll hear with just the, if
you, I'll just play the opening

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:10.510
and you'll see what
I mean, maybe.

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:14.110
[ Music ]

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:15.700
Oops this side.

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.500
There we go.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:27:02.130
[ Music ]

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:03.430
Yeah so that's there.

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:05.510
[ Singing ]

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:11.110
[ Background noise ]

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:14.360
So, one of the things
that makes, I think,

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.980
Griffes different in these
kind of impressionistic types

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:21.390
of works than other say French
composers of the time is

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:25.250
that he allows harmonic sound
where it's actually mixed a bit.

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:30.900
So, you notice that the stuff
when it goes to the low F

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:35.070
that you see there at the bottom
in the middle, kind of rising,

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:39.780
arpeggio that turns into
a scale type of thing.

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.770
It's sounds to me like it's
in a different kind of world.

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:45.400
And so, he allows those
things to coexist and kind

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.760
of explores it at the same
time as opposed to just having

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.620
to have a single minded
focus harmonically.

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:52.920
Yet, they still work together.

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:57.170
So, I'm not saying that
it's not a cogent argument

00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:59.170
that he's making.

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:01.270
Night Fall, we will
not hear today.

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:03.620
But, just to give a
listen to the opening

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:08.450
and you'll see a little bit
of, not an evolution in terms

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:10.220
of it being a positive
progression, but,

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:11.990
more just where he's going

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:15.510
with that whole peddle tone
thing that we talked about.

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:58.200
[ Music ]

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:02.850
So, what he's doing here
is clearly having to have

00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:05.510
that D sharp that's going
to continue in there,

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:09.040
but the context he puts around
it, you know, all the tones

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.630
around it, the D and the
E, it's quite startling.

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:13.260
But, instead of it
being like this sort

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:15.830
of big drawing attention
to himself sort of thing,

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:17.130
everything is very quiet.

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:20.330
And, it's kept very much in
this realm of exploring color

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:24.110
and what dissonance
can mean in that realm.

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:27.140
So, it's not longer, it's
not the kind of, you know,

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:30.510
functional dissonance, in some
sense it is, but in the way

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:33.510
that you might see in
some of his earlier works.

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:37.840
[ Background noise ]

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.280
We also won't be
hearing this one,

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:43.390
the Fountain of the Acqua Paola.

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:50.200
These are all, all four of these
Roman sketches are using William

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:55.170
Sharp poems, or actually small
portions of William Sharp poems.

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:56.470
Here's just the opening of it.

00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:59.700
And, you can see what the
traditions that he's drawing on,

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:05.400
again, for water music, you
know, with, look at the,

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.210
what was available
at the time by Liszt

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:09.510
and Debussy and then Ravel.

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:48.160
[ Music ]

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.920
So, it changes character there.

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.900
But, you'll notice that
that, and this kind of,

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:55.960
even as grouped in forest here,
the sonnet groupings are three

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.690
and it's a very kind of
a recognizable thing just

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:01.620
like we had at the Night Winds
earlier, looking at that,

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:03.440
like you recognize the
wind when it comes back.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:04.800
Well, you recognize them maybe

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.210
when you're looking
back straight

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:07.940
on at the fountain
then maybe you wonder,

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:10.270
attention wonders a bit,
but then you're able

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:12.890
to reorient yourself
pretty quickly.

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:15.760
And, that's, it's a, it's
not, I'm not saying this is

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:19.360
like the most amazing water
accompaniment you can come

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.750
up with or something like
that, but, it takes skill

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:24.630
to actually do something
that's convincing like that

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:27.210
and doesn't sound hackneyed
or just like, you know,

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:29.940
like an all birdie base, like up

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:31.430
in the stratosphere,
something like that.

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:33.880
So, there's a good deal
of thought that goes

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:35.220
into those types of decisions.

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:37.510
And, it seemed to come
very naturally for Griffes.

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:42.980
[ Background noise ]

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:45.270
So, Clouds we will hear today.

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:49.000
And, this is the one that,
again, has that, a little bit

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.830
of relationship with
Nuages Debussy.

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:53.660
Let's listen to just
the opening.

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.040
You'll see what I mean.

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:58.330
But, this is, again, a case
where Griffes is really able

00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:03.510
to grasp the poetic
idea and run with it.

00:32:03.510 --> 00:33:03.310
[ Music ]

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:07.120
So, it's, you can see like, if
you're following through these

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.970
and if you're to go through
the order that they're written,

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:10.550
you see the progression, you see

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:12.660
where he's coming
from with each one.

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:14.850
But, they start to sound
like they're coming,

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:17.960
that there's a totally different
composer even though you still

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:20.220
know it's the same composer.

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:22.360
And, that's because
he's really exploring.

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:25.180
Look at the meter
of this one, 7/4.

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:34.510
He's trying things out and
there's kind of a wide scope

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:37.890
that he's willing to explore
including different types

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:42.450
of modal groupings, different
scales, other things like that.

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:47.760
So, he's, you know,
continuing to explore.

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:52.270
We get to the next one,
Pleasure Dome of Kubla Khan,

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:55.020
this is probably
his best known work,

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:57.230
especially an orchestral
version.

00:33:57.230 --> 00:34:00.850
I say that because the
piano version, strangely,

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:03.930
was not published until the
90s, as I mentioned earlier,

00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:10.300
but also wasn't performed in
public till 1984, I think,

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:13.630
in the Coolidge Auditorium
after received its premiere,

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:15.100
James Tocco performing.

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:19.650
So, it was, that's kind
of a nice connection

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:21.450
that we have here to this.

00:34:21.450 --> 00:34:24.090
But, why I said that
that's strange is

00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:29.070
because the work
started as a piano piece.

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:33.240
He, I think he began the
work, working out in 1912.

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:34.690
You'll see in the program notes

00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:36.540
where he's getting his
inspiration clearly

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:38.280
from the Coleridge poem,

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.720
but really just some
particular aspects

00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:43.930
of the Coleridge
poem, Kubla Khan.

00:34:43.930 --> 00:34:47.890
And he, so, he's working
it out on the piano,

00:34:47.890 --> 00:34:50.210
he plays it for his friends.

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:51.660
It's a different
kind of feedback.

00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:54.870
He's continually working
on it for about three years

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:57.510
or so till 1915 or so.

00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:59.950
He tends, he keeps
making improvements.

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:04.760
But, he hears from two
particular sources that may be

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:09.350
or two bits of feedback
that push him

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:10.650
to make an orchestral version.

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:13.340
And, one of those, again,
is attributed to Busoni

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:17.300
who apparently listened to the
work and then said, you know,

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.150
maybe that's an orchestral
piece.

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:20.450
And so, he took that to heart

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:23.860
and he made the orchestral
version.

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:26.730
Again, we have, we'll have the
two versions, we only have one

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:30.530
of them on display today
for space reasons, but,

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:33.000
you'll be able to see
what that looked like.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.770
And, that was still very
much a developing work.

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:38.260
But that's, again,
the piece that kind

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:40.660
of made his name just
before he passed away.

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:46.120
The piano piece itself,
though, is, I think,

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:50.160
I don't know the people
who like Griffes like it.

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:53.920
But, I think it's undervalued
in terms of its significance

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:56.030
in terms of piano writing.

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:58.570
He is really successful

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:01.230
in orchestrating
well for the piano.

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:02.790
And, that's something I
think that you'll hear

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:04.090
with this performance today.

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:07.930
And, just to give you a sense of
that, we're just going to listen

00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:11.360
to the opening of it, which
starts kind of in the depths

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:15.940
of the base and then kind
of builds out from there.

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:19.520
It's sectional in nature but it
always has this sort of return

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:26.510
to some of these ideas that are
put forward at the beginning.

00:36:26.510 --> 00:37:25.620
[ Music ]

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.300
I'm sorry to stop
it for time sake.

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:30.200
Also, we have a little bit of a
sound trouble earlier, so it'll,

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:33.890
it sounds much better
with a live piano, so,

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:36.070
you know, much fuller sound.

00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:43.310
So, this piece is interesting
for a number of reasons.

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:49.700
But, it's a particular
importance to this pianist

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:53.510
who has some Mongolian heritage.

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:57.160
And, in fact, this is a
photo that she gave me

00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:02.890
that her mother took and
put into a book, Muren Hsie,

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:07.890
and she's a well known Mongolian
poet who writes in Chinese.

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:09.770
This is from one of her books.

00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:14.480
This is actually some
of the ruins of Xanadu

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:17.300
with the summer palace
of Kublai Khan.

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.370
And, here's another
example of things.

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:22.750
So, she actually
sent these along

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:24.950
so I could include them just to
give you a little glimpse of,

00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:27.540
there's other things that you
can find on line to take a look

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:30.640
at the actually historical
Xanadu.

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:36.610
In any case, there's this
sense of expanse in this work

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:38.910
that I think comes
through very, just as well

00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:41.940
in the piano version as it
does in the orchestral version.

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:48.150
And so, it really, I think,
is something to experience,

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:49.900
if you haven't heard it before.

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:51.510
And, if you have
heard it before,

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:53.650
it's a new experience again.

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:57.330
I'm just going to play
you, oops, a little bit

00:38:57.330 --> 00:39:01.370
of one other very
significant Griffes piano work

00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:03.760
that we're not going
to hear today.

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.810
We considered the
idea of programming it

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:07.670
but it's just too much.

00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:09.760
So, we're already, the
first half, by the way,

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:12.070
is much longer than
the second half.

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:14.780
So, it's just the way
that it worked out.

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:17.350
But, I wish we could've put
the sonata in there, but,

00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:20.560
just so you can see where he was
going towards the later years,

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:25.280
1917, 1918 I'm going to play
the beginning of each movement

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:27.080
so you can get a sense of it.

00:39:27.080 --> 00:40:05.050
[ Music ]

00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:06.350
So, you can still sense

00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:09.590
that lyricism that's been
present the entire time.

00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:13.000
But, it's a much more free
lyric, lyricism when it comes

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.450
to tonality and harmonic
language.

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:18.510
Here's a little bit of
the second movement.

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:44.070
[ Music ]

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:46.480
Stop it there for time.

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:49.280
That movement Griffes
would orchestrate as well

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.040
as an orchestral
movement called,

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:52.340
I think he called it a Nocturne.

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:54.510
And the final movement.

00:40:54.510 --> 00:41:30.040
[ Background noise ]

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:32.990
I don't know if any of you
heard in there a little bit

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:36.980
of Prokofiev 7, the 7th sonata.

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:39.290
I do.

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:40.590
&gt;&gt; The last movement?

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:41.890
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:43.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:45.760
&gt;&gt; Yeah there's some
similarities there that,

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:47.640
I think, are circumstantial.

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:52.390
But then there's,
let's see, yeah,

00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:54.680
so this sonata is well
worth getting to know,

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:55.980
it's worth taking a look.

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:57.280
You can just see
he's very much moving

00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:00.600
in a more modernist trajectory.

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:03.780
The other pieces also, at
the time, were considered

00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:05.710
to be modernist as well.

00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:08.480
They really sound a bit
more familiar to us just

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.400
because we've had the
innervating century

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:14.210
to get used to those sounds.

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:17.360
Let's see, I think, yeah,
last thing I think I have

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:19.670
on here is just kind

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:21.910
of an interesting little
story about a piece.

00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:23.640
I don't have any examples of it

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:27.170
because this is the piece that's
going to be premiered today.

00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:32.420
So, this is a version
of the central movement

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:37.230
from Iberia Image for
orchestra Debussy.

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:41.370
I'm not sure what did
that, but, anyway,

00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:45.590
so this is just the cover
page of the manuscript

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:49.550
that he transcribed in 1915
after hearing the work.

00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:52.100
What's interesting is that he
didn't actually like the work

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:56.100
that much with the exception
of this one movement.

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:57.670
So, he really took to it.

00:42:57.670 --> 00:43:00.640
Then, sorry for my washed
out photo here, but,

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:06.210
you can see just that it's a
meticulously done transcription.

00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:10.420
And it's, Debussy himself did
not do a solo piano version

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:11.720
of this work.

00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:15.260
But, Duran commissioned I think
Muran and the other people

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:18.400
who have done solo
piano versions later

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:23.320
that are much easier
to play than this one.

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:27.550
However, the difficulties
are worthwhile, I think,

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:29.920
we'll see what you
think after hearing it.

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:33.100
But, almost throughout
the entire work,

00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:35.350
he keeps it separated
onto three stage just

00:43:35.350 --> 00:43:38.680
to be able to keep voices clear.

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:43.170
And so, that's one of the things
that's difficult to navigate

00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:45.150
but interesting to navigate.

00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:48.640
So, what's kind of
cool about this,

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:52.700
and I hope that maybe you can
let people know about this as a,

00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:57.080
if you find this
interesting, is that I came

00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:00.540
across that transcription, that
manuscript when I was looking

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:03.430
through just the
Griffes materials.

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:06.120
And, I noticed, it was
catalogued, but I noticed

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:09.920
in the literature it said that
the piece was no longer extant.

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:14.080
So, thought there was a
mistake, it was a mistake.

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:18.710
It in fact was extant, it
was existing right there.

00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:21.180
But, because of that,
nobody knew about it.

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:24.010
And, that's why we're
doing, Solungga was willing

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:25.930
to learn it and put it together.

00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:30.060
And so, I made this version
for her at first of the,

00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:32.760
an engraved form of it.

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.430
And, what's kind of cool
about it is we're going

00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:39.800
to put this online and probably
as an attachment on the blog

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:42.520
so that anybody who
wants to download it

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:44.740
and play it themselves
can do so.

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:47.630
So, we're hoping to do
that next week or so.

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:49.840
But, so if you want to, if
this is something you want

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:52.610
to just take a look at
yourself and play through,

available that way.

00:44:56.030 --> 00:45:00.240
Yeah. And so, I think
I'm going to stop there

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:04.340

end of my talk.

to answer if anybody has any.

right, that was my question.

Well that's a tough, I don't
know that I'm really equipped

00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:57.760
to answer that question.

00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:00.350
but, what I can say is that,
you know, that particular year

00:46:00.350 --> 00:46:04.470
that you're talking about
also had a pretty big impact

00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:07.770
on both this composer
and other composers,

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:12.520
especially Cesar Franck,
we're thinking of Tristan.

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:16.640
And the emergence of that,
basically, I mean you can start

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:22.140
to see changes in lots of
people's music that come right

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:24.480
after their first hearing
it once they've got a chance

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:26.360

And, I'm sensing
these [inaudible] sort

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:54.600
of seeing this recurrence.

00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:57.510
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think I see where
you're going with that.

00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:59.500
The, what I can say
is that, I mean,

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:01.430
really there's all
these major histories,

00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:04.880
especially literary histories
of the type of romanticism

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:07.490
that goes into these
things coming at the turn,

00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:10.980
at the end of the 18th century
going into the 19th century.

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:14.130
And, music starts to kind of
catch up with it and then kind

00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:18.130
of intermingle with it as the
century progresses in ever,

00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:21.270
you know, inventive ways.

00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:23.800
I actually don't think that
that every really stopped except

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:27.310
for in certain types, you
know, Vanguard moves away

00:47:27.310 --> 00:47:33.250
from referential types of
music or art production.

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:36.310
But, I think it's
right on to say that,

00:47:36.310 --> 00:47:38.810
especially at this time,
if you're looking at,

00:47:38.810 --> 00:47:41.160
I don't like the
term salon pieces

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:43.490
because it's a bit diminutive.

00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:46.540
But, works that are character
pieces, maybe be a better,

00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:48.910
character works for a
solo piano that have a tie

00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:54.220
to a poetic source,
which, in turn is, usually,

00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:58.340
some relation either
some love or nature,

00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:01.100
it's very much following
in that romantic path.

00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:04.830
And so, in that sense,
impressionism is romanticism.

all the isms just kind

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:09.180

that's a good observation.

00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:09.340
Have you heard his music
before or will this be?

00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:13.540
So, one thing you'll find is
that he, as the pieces progress,

00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:17.380
they tend to get more
chromatic or more,

00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:18.820
just a bigger type of sound.

00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:21.630
But, that sense of spaciousness
never goes away, I find,

00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:23.130
in most of the pieces.

00:49:23.130 --> 00:49:25.630
So, that's a very good
observation and it's definitely,

00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:29.820
there's definitely a sense of
him setting that kind of space

00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:32.780
in which that music can
take place in its best way.

00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:36.740
And it is, I think that the
unique thing about it is,

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:43.560
I mean lots of composers do that
but rarely do they do it so,

00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:45.470
with such consistency across,

00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:47.230
even though it's quite
different music in each one

00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:49.030
across this different works so.

00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:58.900
[ Inaudible ]

00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:04.140
Yeah. You know, that, a lot,
[inaudible] a good example.

00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:06.210
And then, there's, of
course, a religious component

00:50:06.210 --> 00:50:07.510
that tends to come into it.

00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:11.030
But, I think in, for me,
with lots of these kinds

00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:16.220
of musical evocations,
religiosity and any type

00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:19.670
of spiritual component
regardless of any sort

00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:22.950
of doctrinal relationship
just comes through in a way

00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:26.180
that composers think
about this music.

00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:28.230
So, I think that definitely
is a good observation

00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:29.530
that comes through.

00:50:29.530 --> 00:50:31.090
One last thing I should say is

00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:34.150
that I didn't hit the
Beach in the Franck.

00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:38.290
We had a really nice talk
earlier today by McCauley Kate

00:50:38.290 --> 00:50:40.800
and Miller about
our Beach Holdings.

00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:43.160
And, if you don't
know about those,

00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:44.980
we don't actually have
a Beach collection

00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:47.250
but we have the A.
P. Schmidt Collection

00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:51.310
or archive rather that's a,
that was her main publisher.

00:50:51.310 --> 00:50:54.910
And so, we have a number
of manuscripts and copies

00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:58.080
of manuscripts as well as
other types of manuscripts

00:50:58.080 --> 00:50:59.900
with beach at the library.

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:03.400
And, it's her sesquicentennial
celebration.

00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:06.730
She would be 150, I
think, in last September.

00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:11.090
So, if you weren't able to make
it to the talk this morning.

00:51:11.090 --> 00:51:13.580
We do encourage you, if you have
an interest in learning more

00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:14.880
about Beach, there are a lot

00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:16.470
of resources available
at the library.

00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:19.130
And, the Franck, I'm not going
to say anything about that only

00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:21.030
because it's such
a well known work.

00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:24.100
But, it's, again, one of the
great pieces that we also happen

00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:25.700
to have the manuscript for.

00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:27.550
So, that'll close
out the program.

00:51:27.550 --> 00:51:29.050
So, thank you all
so much for coming

00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:31.510
and enjoy the performance.

00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:34.040
[ Applause ]

00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:37.700

of the Library of Congress.
