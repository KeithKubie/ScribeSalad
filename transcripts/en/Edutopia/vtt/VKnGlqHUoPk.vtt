00:00:03.276 --> 00:00:05.126
&gt;&gt;What makes it School of the Future?

00:00:05.126 --> 00:00:06.896
We always say it was
founded as a school

00:00:06.896 --> 00:00:08.186
of technology twenty years ago,

00:00:08.186 --> 00:00:10.386
but that's not really
what makes us distinctive.

00:00:10.436 --> 00:00:13.426
What makes the School of the Future
is that we really put our energy

00:00:13.426 --> 00:00:17.536
and our thoughts and planning into
what are the critical thinking skills

00:00:17.576 --> 00:00:21.336
that our students need to be
successful in this global economy

00:00:21.336 --> 00:00:24.816
and that's a dynamic process,
so our dedication here is

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:26.806
about making our kids
critical thinkers,

00:00:26.806 --> 00:00:29.046
making our kids develop
their analysis skills,

00:00:29.106 --> 00:00:33.206
making them be more self reliant
and better community members.

00:00:34.486 --> 00:00:39.066
&gt;&gt;I think that what you assess
ends up being what you teach

00:00:39.596 --> 00:00:43.236
and especially in like a political
landscape such as ours right now,

00:00:43.236 --> 00:00:46.576
that's really valuing assessment, our
school has really had to figure out,

00:00:46.576 --> 00:00:49.716
how do we contextualize
this push for assessment

00:00:50.246 --> 00:00:53.016
in our school that's
always had particular values

00:00:53.016 --> 00:00:54.626
of what it means to be a good school?

00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:57.876
We think about authentic
assessment, we're trying to figure

00:00:57.876 --> 00:01:00.606
out what our kids should
be able to do,

00:01:00.606 --> 00:01:02.996
and what kind of thinking they
should be able to demonstrate.

00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.876
We want them to say,
when they're in a class,

00:01:05.876 --> 00:01:07.216
it's not just like
you're learning science.

00:01:07.486 --> 00:01:09.326
You're learning how to
think like a scientist.

00:01:09.416 --> 00:01:10.576
Or you're not learning
history, you're learning how

00:01:10.576 --> 00:01:11.586
to think like a historian.

00:01:11.586 --> 00:01:14.616
So it's really also learning
like the discipline of thinking.

00:01:15.206 --> 00:01:19.776
&gt;&gt;There's a huge difference between
thinking math and doing math.

00:01:19.776 --> 00:01:23.166
A difficulty that I deal with,
a lot of kids still think

00:01:23.496 --> 00:01:25.026
that getting the right
answer is enough.

00:01:25.136 --> 00:01:28.206
Like once you have the right answer,
you've done all that could be asked

00:01:28.246 --> 00:01:29.356
of you in a math classroom.

00:01:29.986 --> 00:01:33.426
The difference is, I want kids
to think that there's more

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:35.116
to a math class than just answers.

00:01:35.836 --> 00:01:40.726
Today, they were applying the slope
formula to a set of stairs and seeing

00:01:40.726 --> 00:01:43.286
if they were in compliance with
New York City building codes.

00:01:43.546 --> 00:01:44.426
Okay, this is the math.

00:01:44.586 --> 00:01:48.406
This is how the math connects to
the real life, and that was my goal.

00:01:48.816 --> 00:01:51.436
&gt;&gt;The thing the kids struggle
with is when they don't feel

00:01:51.436 --> 00:01:53.306
like they're making
progress at school.

00:01:53.596 --> 00:01:57.296
And so the more that we can assess
them to make them see their progress

00:01:57.326 --> 00:01:59.756
that they're making in a
way that empowers them,

00:01:59.756 --> 00:02:02.656
the better that they do academically,
and the more invested they are.

00:02:02.936 --> 00:02:05.866
So that's what I go for, is
that constant idea of investment

00:02:06.196 --> 00:02:07.566
through the assessment process.

00:02:07.936 --> 00:02:10.456
&gt;&gt;The relationship
between the students

00:02:10.456 --> 00:02:14.916
and the teachers is very
unique, in that it's like a team,

00:02:14.916 --> 00:02:18.476
where you both are
striving to learn the truth

00:02:18.556 --> 00:02:20.466
about whatever subject
you're learning about,

00:02:21.286 --> 00:02:25.136
and instead of other schools,
where sometimes it's like,

00:02:25.136 --> 00:02:27.356
the teacher's just telling
the student what to do

00:02:27.646 --> 00:02:31.826
and the student is just obeying, it's
a very collaborative environment.

00:02:33.066 --> 00:02:35.406
&gt;&gt;I would say most certainly,
the teachers are more invested

00:02:35.476 --> 00:02:37.716
in the thing that they
do because it's theirs.

00:02:37.946 --> 00:02:40.426
You know, they have a lot of
pride in their craftsmanship,

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:42.816
a lot of pride in their craft, that

00:02:42.866 --> 00:02:44.136
&gt;&gt;they definitely bring to the table,

00:02:44.136 --> 00:02:47.736
and I feel like it definitely allows
them to express themselves better,

00:02:47.736 --> 00:02:49.146
making them stronger teachers.

00:02:49.676 --> 00:02:53.546
&gt;&gt;We're really looking at assessments
to say, we don't wanna be deluded by,

00:02:53.546 --> 00:02:55.926
"Well, it looks great in the
classes and the kids look

00:02:55.926 --> 00:02:58.496
like they're getting along
and they're raising their hand

00:02:58.496 --> 00:03:00.106
and they look like they
have a pen in their hand

00:03:00.106 --> 00:03:01.516
and they're saying things."

00:03:01.826 --> 00:03:04.656
And so we use assessments to
really hold our feet to the fire

00:03:04.656 --> 00:03:06.656
to make sure that our kids
are really making the progress

00:03:06.656 --> 00:03:07.546
that they need to make.

00:03:08.526 --> 00:03:10.276
&gt;&gt;You can really teach effectively,

00:03:10.276 --> 00:03:12.306
'cause you're really thinking
like, "Who is in front of me?

00:03:12.306 --> 00:03:13.636
What do you need?"

00:03:13.636 --> 00:03:16.426
which I think is the way that
kids feel valued, 'cause they know

00:03:16.426 --> 00:03:19.196
that they're working on something
that they need to work on,

00:03:19.196 --> 00:03:21.996
and they appreciate you for it.
