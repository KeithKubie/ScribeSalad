00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:02.070
Hi.

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.050
My name is Allan.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.730
I'm from Sao Paulo, and
I co-founded Kekanto.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.090
Kekanto is a local social guide
where people can find

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.590
about places, write a review
about it, and find

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.950
recommendations, get offers,
see where their friends are

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.750
through check-ins.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.990
And we are based in Sao Paulo,
but we are also available in

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.130
Latin America, in Buenos Aires,
Chile, and Mexico.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.770
And I'm going to show a quick
demo of our website.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.580
So this is the main
page of Kekanto.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.050
I'm going to search
for churrascaria--

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.260
that means barbecue.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.560
So I'll go to the top of the
page on the search bar, type

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.720
churrascaria in Sao Paulo,
and press Enter.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.380
Then you've got all
results of all

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.690
churrascarias on Sao Paulo.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.380
On the left, you've got all
of the churrascarias.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.780
You can see where they are
on the map on the right.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.260
You can also add filters like
prices, if you want to go with

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.390
your girlfriend, if you want
to go with friends.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.930
And once you find a place that
you want, you can click here

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.460
on the place, and you've got all
the information about the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.210
churrascaria.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.250
You can get the address, the
phone number, the open hours.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.110
You can get some pictures of all
the places, write a review

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.580
and read some reviews that other
people write about it.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.580
And once you find a place that
you want, you can go to this

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.680
tab here, add your address.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.875
For example, we are at Avenida
Paulista, Sao Paulo.

00:01:37.875 --> 00:01:39.650
And then you click here,
and you've got the

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.310
directions to the place.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.510
You can also click on this tab
here and see the Street View

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.910
about this place.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.810
So this was a quick tip
about our website.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.170
If you want to go, just type in

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.750
kekanto.com on your website.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.000
And thanks for watching.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.310
What I like about Google Maps is
the customization and a lot

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.560
of documentation.
