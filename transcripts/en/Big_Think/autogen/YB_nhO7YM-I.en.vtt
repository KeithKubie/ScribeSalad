00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959
behavior we have developed algorithms
 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.679
behavior we have developed algorithms
such that we can quantify attention and

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:22.689
such that we can quantify attention and
 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:24.719
such that we can quantify attention and
engagement and how well someone's

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:24.729

you have to track all the body movements

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:30.729
you have to track all the body movements
 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:32.129
you have to track all the body movements
and so you know people when they think

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139
and so you know people when they think
 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.550
and so you know people when they think
of VR most managers they think about the

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560
of VR most managers they think about the
 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.559
of VR most managers they think about the
visual experience aspect of it but in my

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569
visual experience aspect of it but in my
 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.619
visual experience aspect of it but in my
opinion the most valuable part of this

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:40.629
opinion the most valuable part of this
 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:42.629
opinion the most valuable part of this
from an organizational standpoint is

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639
from an organizational standpoint is
 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.520
from an organizational standpoint is
actually having all this data which is

actually having all this data which is
 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.069
actually having all this data which is
the richest data in history so if we can

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030
thought leader in this area and so what
 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.110
thought leader in this area and so what
we've done for the NFL is we've built a

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120
we've done for the NFL is we've built a
 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.790
we've done for the NFL is we've built a
interview trainer so we talked earlier

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800
interview trainer so we talked earlier
 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.080
interview trainer so we talked earlier
about the flight simulator why do you

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090
about the flight simulator why do you
 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.330
about the flight simulator why do you
have a flight simulator because when we

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340
have a flight simulator because when we
 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.830
have a flight simulator because when we
teach people we encourage them to make

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840
teach people we encourage them to make
 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.570
teach people we encourage them to make
mistakes that's how you learn you make

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580
mistakes that's how you learn you make
 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.160
mistakes that's how you learn you make
mistake and you get feedback and that's

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170
mistake and you get feedback and that's
 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.620
mistake and you get feedback and that's
why we have a flight simulator

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630
why we have a flight simulator
 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.550
why we have a flight simulator
interviewing someone should be the same

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560
interviewing someone should be the same
 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.040
interviewing someone should be the same
way so when I interview someone maybe I

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050
way so when I interview someone maybe I
 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.510
way so when I interview someone maybe I
asked the wrong question I asked a

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520
asked the wrong question I asked a
 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.400
asked the wrong question I asked a
different question from person a then

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410
different question from person a then
 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.230
different question from person a then
person B based on how that person looked

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240
person B based on how that person looked
 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.030
person B based on how that person looked
or maybe I looked in the wrong way or I

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040
or maybe I looked in the wrong way or I
 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.560
or maybe I looked in the wrong way or I
leaned in in a way that was what that

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570
leaned in in a way that was what that
 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.450
leaned in in a way that was what that
was not the right the proper way and

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460
was not the right the proper way and
 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.250
was not the right the proper way and
what we've built is an interview

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260
what we've built is an interview
 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.960
what we've built is an interview
simulator which is extremely realistic

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970
simulator which is extremely realistic
 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.540
simulator which is extremely realistic
these are very photorealistic avatars

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550
these are very photorealistic avatars
 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.340
these are very photorealistic avatars
and you go through and you interview

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350
and you go through and you interview
 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.770
and you go through and you interview
people and you ask questions and we

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780
people and you ask questions and we
 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.560
people and you ask questions and we
record your movements we record your

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570
record your movements we record your
 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.630
record your movements we record your
utterances and we give you feedback and

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640
utterances and we give you feedback and
 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.610
utterances and we give you feedback and
then you repeat it and the National

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620
then you repeat it and the National
 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.770
then you repeat it and the National
Football League is using this and at a

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780
Football League is using this and at a
 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.720
Football League is using this and at a
number of places the example I'll talk

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730
number of places the example I'll talk
 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.450
number of places the example I'll talk
about is there's something called the

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460
about is there's something called the
 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.580
about is there's something called the
combine in the NFL and the combine is

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590
combine in the NFL and the combine is
 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.450
combine in the NFL and the combine is
where players go to you know tryout and

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460
where players go to you know tryout and
 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.950
where players go to you know tryout and
they don't only tryout with our athletic

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960
they don't only tryout with our athletic
 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.660
they don't only tryout with our athletic
skills they do interviews to see if

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:48.670
skills they do interviews to see if
 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:49.860
skills they do interviews to see if
they'd be a good fit

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870
they'd be a good fit
 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.260
they'd be a good fit
interpersonally on teams and there's

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270
interpersonally on teams and there's
 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.790
interpersonally on teams and there's
interviews that go on between general

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800
interviews that go on between general

managers and scouts with players and for
 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.070
managers and scouts with players and for
a couple of teams we trained their

Scouts and GM's the NFL as an
organization encouraged us to do this so

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460
organization encouraged us to do this so
 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.270
organization encouraged us to do this so
that they could be better trained on how

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280
that they could be better trained on how
 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.890
that they could be better trained on how
to do an interview

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900
to do an interview
