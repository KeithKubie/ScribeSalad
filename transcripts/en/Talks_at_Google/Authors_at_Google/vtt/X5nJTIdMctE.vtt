00:00:04.242 --> 00:00:05.200
JAMIE CASAP: All right.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.050
Welcome everyone.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.109
I think we're good to go.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:09.110
My name is Jamie Casap.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:15.160
I'm part of Google for Education
team, the global education

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.920
evangelist.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.625
I am joined here today by Woj.

00:00:18.625 --> 00:00:19.500
ESTHER WOJCICKI: Woj.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.208
JAMIE CASAP: Woj.

00:00:20.208 --> 00:00:21.320
ESTHER WOJCICKI: Woj.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.340
JAMIE CASAP: Woj.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.762
Ester Wojcicki,
who is the-- I want

00:00:24.762 --> 00:00:26.220
to make sure I get
her title right.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.720
She's the founder of the media
arts center at Palo Alto High

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.655
School where she's also, not
the co-founder, but the common--

00:00:33.655 --> 00:00:36.030
ESTHER WOJCICKI: I am the vice
chair of Creative Commons.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.910
JAMIE CASAP: Of
Creative Commons.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.160
And Esther and I
had known each other

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.090
since 2006, 2007 when you first
were involved in what we were

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.370
doing at Google for Education.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.328
So I want to start with
that, talk a little bit

00:00:49.328 --> 00:00:51.420
about the beginning
when we just kicked off

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.510
Google for Education
stuff, whether it

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.600
was Google Apps for Education
or some of the tools

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.900
that we were using.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.959
Your involvement with that
was critical because look

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:00.750
where we are today.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.910
We have 40 million
users using Google Apps.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.972
You were involved with
that at the beginning.

00:01:04.972 --> 00:01:06.930
You've been involved with
what we've been doing

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.480
in education for a long time.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.184
Talk a little bit
about that history.

00:01:10.184 --> 00:01:11.600
ESTHER WOJCICKI:
Yes, I was really

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.510
excited to be here
today first of all,

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.295
because I've been around
Google for a long time.

00:01:16.295 --> 00:01:17.670
As a matter of
fact, since Google

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.330
was a baby in Susan's garage.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.150
And so in 2006, what it
was, it was just a team,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.820
a Google for Education team.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.260
It consisted of Cristin
Frodella and me.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.160
And so what we tried
to do is figure out

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.765
like, what are we going to do
to get more teachers involved.

00:01:37.765 --> 00:01:40.870
And since being a teacher,
oh, I have some ideas.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.280
And so I went around the
country and put up these panels,

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.520
got panels, New York,
Chicago, got teachers,

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.100
brought them in, and then
try to figure out what

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.830
would be the best thing to do.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.350
And then we started the Google--
all the Google Apps, basically.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.000
So I actually was really lucky.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.980
I got to pick what
I thought would

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.530
be a good app for teachers.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.259
Only thing that got removed
was I Google got slammed.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.970
JAMIE CASAP: And we got a lot of
backlash for that at the time,

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.960
so we won't go there.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.760
So let's talk-- you've been a
teacher for 30 plus years now.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.290
ESTHER WOJCICKI: Yes, long time.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.389
JAMIE CASAP: A long time,
and you're teaching students

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:22.430
at Palo Alto High School.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.250
You've just opened
up, last year right,

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.450
the media center
at Palo Alto High.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.020
Talk a little bit about
what you do at Palo Alto.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.910
Talk a little bit about your
experience as a teacher there.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.030
And then I want to show some
slides of the new media center.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.150
But first kind of
tee it up with your

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.830
experiences as a teacher at Palo
Alto, how things have changed

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:45.872
over those last 30 years.

00:02:45.872 --> 00:02:48.455
ESTHER WOJCICKI: OK, so when I
first to Palo Alto High School,

00:02:48.455 --> 00:02:50.090
there was one small
class of students.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.220
There were 19 kids
in the program.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.280
We had a typewriter.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.690
And the kids used to
write their stories up

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.960
and then they would type
them up on a typewriter.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.190
Then I used to hand out
in class single edge razor

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.740
blades to everybody.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.480
And they would cut their
story out and then paste it up

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.990
on a paste board with hot wax.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.080
This was the way it was.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.440
And then I always got really
mad because I would say,

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.030
it's crooked.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.990
Got to get this thing straight.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.270
And after three
years of doing that,

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.470
which was quite a
challenge actually,

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.930
the program had grown.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.679
And I heard about these
things called computers.

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:30.720
I was like, oh my god,
something has to be better

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.760
than this typewriter.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.516
And so that's the
beginning of what

00:03:35.516 --> 00:03:36.640
happened with the computer.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.720
I actually discovered a Mac
in Los Altos in a small store

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.591
and I applied for a grant,
the State of California,

00:03:43.591 --> 00:03:45.340
and they told me, oh,
you'll never get it.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.350
You have no idea how
to use this device.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.250
And I agreed.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.910
I didn't have any idea.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.350
But, gutsy, I applied anyway.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.400
And somehow or other the
State got-- I don't know.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.266
Somebody made a mistake
and sent them to me.

00:04:00.266 --> 00:04:03.740
And I got seven of them
and I didn't really

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.160
know how to use them at all.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.360
And so then they were
in the back of the room,

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.210
all boxed nicely.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.090
And I had to confess
to my students

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.240
that I had no clue
what I was doing.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.930
And actually that
was the beginning

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.079
of my collaborative
teaching method,

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.860
because all my students got
super excited about this.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.910
They showed up after school,
evening, weekends and we

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.650
figured out how to
work them together.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.740
I never even knew what
the word network was,

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.970
but they showed me how to do it.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.350
We did it all together.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.090
So then for 30
years-- I probably

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.110
shouldn't give too
much detail on this.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.559
For 30 years I
was in a portable.

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:44.350
JAMIE CASAP: Right.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.830
I've been in that
portable with you.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:46.090
I've visited.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.830
ESTHER WOJCICKI: I know, a
portable, otherwise known

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.090
as a trailer, what was supposed
to be a temporary building.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.960
And then the program
kept growing.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.210
Everybody was like, what
is she doing in that class,

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.560
giving out pizza or something?

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.270
And actually the truth is,
I was giving out some pizza.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.290
But there was more
to it than that.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.270
So it grew and grew and
grew and pretty soon I

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.402
was in multiple portables
at the same time.

00:05:09.402 --> 00:05:10.860
Kind of interesting
that the school

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.830
thought that I could
supervise multiple classrooms

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.490
at the same time
from one location.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.772
JAMIE CASAP: How many
students are we talking about

00:05:16.772 --> 00:05:17.410
at this point here?

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.118
ESTHER WOJCICKI: Oh,
at this point, well,

00:05:19.118 --> 00:05:20.700
so it started with, I said, 19.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.690
At that point I had
80 in one class.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.894
So it was a ratio of one to 80.

00:05:25.894 --> 00:05:27.560
So it was a little
difficult to control.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.476
And not only that, they're
all over the place.

00:05:29.476 --> 00:05:32.880
And my method of control
was very different

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.520
than other people's
method of control.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.020
My method was, you're
going to be doing it.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.940
I'll give you the tools and
now you take over and do it.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.960
And so that's what enabled
me to have all these students

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.340
with just one teacher.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.940
And actually the
interesting thing

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.890
is like, that freedom
and responsibility

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.289
is what attracted all
those kids to my program.

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:57.830
Everybody really
thought it was food,

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.644
but really it was freedom.

00:05:59.644 --> 00:06:01.060
JAMIE CASAP: It's
food too, right?

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.770
ESTHER WOJCICKI: Well, food
and, yeah, that's true.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.350
You did have the
food when you came.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:05.940
JAMIE CASAP: It was good pizza.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.120
So the media center opened.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.950
ESTHER WOJCICKI: Oh yeah,
so then-- So fast forward

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.870
30 years, and the
school district

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.770
built this incredible
building for me,

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:22.920
25,000 square foot Media Arts
Center, Palo Alto High School.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.710
It really is shocking.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.150
Like I said, I went
from this trailer,

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.830
where actually the
roof was leaking

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.371
and a few other things like the
air conditioning didn't work,

00:06:31.371 --> 00:06:33.810
into this thing which I
would consider a palace.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.180
And you can see all
the different rooms.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.590
It's got room for
every single program

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.290
that I created over the years.

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:44.470
And there's the atrium.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.030
The reason they made
an atrium that big,

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:49.792
is because my classes
generally ran 80 kids.

00:06:49.792 --> 00:06:52.250
And the question is, what are
you going to do with 80 kids?

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.700
Well, how about packing
them into this atrium.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.020
And it turns out
that the kids prefer

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.710
to be-- they really like
to be sandwiched together

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.470
in smaller spaces.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.580
So now they're all in these--
I have three other rooms.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.320
And they sort of spread
out in those other rooms.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.552
Although yesterday, they
were all in the atrium.

00:07:09.552 --> 00:07:10.760
We have a lot of flexibility.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.190
It's great.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.690
JAMIE CASAP: And what it has
been your experience with this,

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.640
compared to being in those
trailers that you had before?

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.800
What's been your greatest
highlight from this experience?

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.710
And it's only been
open since when?

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:22.320
ESTHER WOJCICKI:
About eight months.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:22.880
JAMIE CASAP: About eight months.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.338
ESTHER WOJCICKI:
Since last August.

00:07:24.338 --> 00:07:28.210
So the greatest experience--
I mean, it's just unbelievable

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.140
how excited the students are.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.360
And one of the main
problems that we have is

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.030
get them to go home.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:36.460
Nobody wants to leave.

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.460
As a matter of fact, that
was one of the things,

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.370
it's like, it's 5 o'clock
in the afternoon or six,

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.360
how many kids are
still in the building?

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.040
Can we ask them to go home?

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.950
And they are working
collaboratively,

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:51.530
so they actually
want to stay there.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:55.830
That's just one that you just
had, that one computer lab.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:59.130
That's one of three.

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:04.020
Back in the olden
days, in that portable,

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.100
I had a computer lab that I
had to share with other people.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.430
Frequently that
computers didn't work.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.070
And not only that,
I was supposed

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:13.030
to be in that room and
the computer lab, which

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:14.821
was, of course, on the
other side of campus

00:08:14.821 --> 00:08:15.632
at the same time.

00:08:15.632 --> 00:08:17.715
JAMIE CASAP: And all your
furniture is all movable

00:08:17.715 --> 00:08:22.000
so you can create collaborative
spaces and teams can

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.240
set themselves up in different
corners of the space.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.560
ESTHER WOJCICKI: You see
those desks right there?

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.560
They move.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.030
And so kids, I can
say get into a group.

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:32.039
And they can all like, scoot
into a group in a minute.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:34.157
So I don't believe
in desks and rows.

00:08:34.157 --> 00:08:35.740
JAMIE CASAP: Are
they good for racing?

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:36.490
Can you race them?

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.143
ESTHER WOJCICKI: Well, actually
they have had some races.

00:08:39.143 --> 00:08:41.650
We've had to control
it a little bit.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:46.790
But in general, we
don't have rows.

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:48.820
We have kids working
collaboratively.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.740
That is a picture of--
that was the grand opening

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:52.750
for the building.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:56.680
It had three really amazing
people, Arianna Huffington,

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.830
and David Kelley
from the d.school.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:02.330
And Shelby Coffey from the
Newseum in Washington, DC.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.970
They had an amazing panel.

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:08.757
It was great and I'm
sorry we didn't record it,

00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:09.340
unfortunately.

00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:14.670
JAMIE CASAP: So let's talk
a little bit about what you

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:15.878
do in the Media Center right?

00:09:15.878 --> 00:09:20.420
So in education, I think one
of the reasons why you're

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.180
highlighted in what
you do is because you

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:25.870
have this unique way of
controlling your kids, which

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.750
is not to control them right?

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.340
So talk a little bit
about what you do.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:33.630
We hear a lot in education,
project-based learning,

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:34.430
blended learning.

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:37.580
What are these terms, what
do these terminologies mean?

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.750
How do you use this
in the classroom?

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:40.650
ESTHER WOJCICKI: So
blended learning,

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:43.108
I don't know how many of you
know what blended learning is,

00:09:43.108 --> 00:09:46.760
but it really is an
opportunity to give students

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.184
more control of their learning.

00:09:48.184 --> 00:09:49.600
So typical classroom--
as a matter

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.810
of fact, 80% of the
classrooms today, the teacher

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:55.790
still lectures 100% of the time.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:58.690
And so the question is,
how effective is that?

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:00.490
And the answer really
for the most part,

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:02.680
is it's not very effective.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.040
People, you know, they
daydream, they do other things.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.530
It just doesn't really work.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.030
And people learn by doing.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.630
Tom Dewey said,
many, many years ago,

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:14.630
100 years ago to be exact,
that people learn by doing,

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:17.400
but unfortunately,
education takes a long time

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.720
to figure that out.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:24.050
And so what I want my students
do and blended learning is,

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:28.370
is 50% of the time, they
are working on something

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:29.710
that's a project-based.

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:32.190
Actually in my classes
it's more than 50%,

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:36.220
but for the rest of the
nation, can they somehow

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.930
give students some opportunity
to control their learning?

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:40.320
That's the key.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.570
Because the question is even
just here, working at Google,

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:45.890
how excited would
you be about what

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:47.980
you're doing if
somebody told you

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.250
what to do 100% of the time?

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.200
Nobody likes to be bossed
around all the time.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.950
And that's what's
happening unfortunately,

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:57.130
in a lot of schools.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:59.100
JAMIE CASAP: And I
think one of things

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:02.071
that people get surprised at,
we talk about blended learning,

00:11:02.071 --> 00:11:03.570
we talk about
project0based learning

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:07.200
as having a product at the
end of your experience.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.450
And I think a lot of times
when we think about student

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:12.640
projects, we think about the
volcano with tissue paper

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:13.160
or whatever.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.140
But your students are
creating real stuff.

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.890
So I want to highlight
a couple of things,

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.700
if you can talk about
some of the things

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.400
that your students
are actually doing.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.090
ESTHER WOJCICKI: So if you just
think about the teenage years,

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:26.047
kids want to be independent.

00:11:26.047 --> 00:11:26.630
Isn't that it?

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.339
Number one, they want
to be independent.

00:11:28.339 --> 00:11:30.380
As a matter of fact, if
they see a parent coming,

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:31.920
they usually cross the street.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.000
I don't have any parents.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.380
I was born kind of under
a rock or something.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:37.440
That's typical.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.825
Most kids want to
be independent.

00:11:38.825 --> 00:11:41.158
It's not, of course, that
they don't love their parents.

00:11:41.158 --> 00:11:44.060
It's just that it's
a time in life when

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.480
they're seeking independence.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:50.040
So I try to build into that by
giving them the independence

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.317
to create these projects.

00:11:51.317 --> 00:11:52.400
And the projects are real.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.840
So this is "The Campanile."

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.550
It was founded in 1918.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:58.160
It's the student newspaper
at Palo Alto High School

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.290
and it runs 28 pages,
three sections,

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:02.830
comes out every three weeks.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.990
And it also has a
website and it also

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:08.449
how has a magazine
that goes with it.

00:12:08.449 --> 00:12:10.490
JAMIE CASAP: And they go
through the same process

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:13.910
that any news organization will
go through, editorial board,

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:14.740
editors.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:15.906
ESTHER WOJCICKI: Everything.

00:12:15.906 --> 00:12:18.070
Not only that, they
support it themselves.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.990
So one of the hardest
things for them to do

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:21.610
is to sell advertising.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:22.650
They are terrified.

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:24.030
It's kind of interesting.

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:25.500
It's very hard.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.510
But my idea is,
like I say to them,

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:29.590
no more Girl Scout Cookies.

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:31.530
You're no longer these
cute little things.

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:34.760
You're going to have to give
people value for whatever it

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.180
is they're paying for.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.450
And you also have to
learn how to do this.

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:41.240
This is American society.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.820
And so they do it.

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:43.900
So the whole thing.

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.120
This is "Verde Magazine."

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.220
I founded that in 2000.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.220
And this is "C Magazine."

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.370
It comes out with
"The Campanile."

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:54.547
So they copied it from
"The New York Times."

00:12:54.547 --> 00:12:57.130
As a matter of fact, doesn't it
look like "The New York Times"

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.490
a little bit?

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.420
And it comes out
every three weeks.

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.439
It's 28 pages,
full color glossy.

00:13:04.439 --> 00:13:05.480
JAMIE CASAP: Oops, sorry.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.521
ESTHER WOJCICKI: Go back.

00:13:06.521 --> 00:13:09.180
So this is daily.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.760
We broadcast daily
to the school.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.050
We have closed circuit.

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.640
But it's also online, so
you can see it right away.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.030
And you can see the archives.

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:19.630
The parents can see
what they're doing.

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:24.060
And this was founded in 2007.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.190
The question was, how to
get all those guys that

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:27.526
don't want to learn to write?

00:13:27.526 --> 00:13:29.400
Well, how are you going
to get them to write?

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.980
Well, the main thing they want
to do is play sports, right?

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.120
So the question is, what
are they interested in?

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.260
How about sports?

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:36.810
Let them write about each other.

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:38.180
And they loved it.

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:40.430
And so, it's a very
popular program

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:43.160
and it's a great
magazine and a website.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.010
This is "The Voice."

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:48.440
This is a website, it's daily,
updated multiple times a day.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.844
And they write about whatever
again, that's important.

00:13:51.844 --> 00:13:53.260
So one of the
things we want to do

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.170
is give them the
responsibility to know

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.130
what it is that's
important to write about.

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:00.260
That is really hard
for most teenagers.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.580
As a matter of fact, in the
beginning journalism class,

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:05.350
it takes me about 10
weeks to get them out

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:07.830
of the mode of
tell me what to do

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:10.380
to get an A. That's
all they want

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:12.840
to know, how do I get an A?

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.210
And it's a real
problem, because you

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:17.800
want to hire people
who actually think

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.270
for themselves, independent,
feel good about it,

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:21.580
willing to take a risk.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:24.290
And you don't get that if
you sit in the classroom

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:26.919
and told what to do all the
time and worry about your grade.

00:14:26.919 --> 00:14:27.710
JAMIE CASAP: Right.

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:29.460
And I think it's
important to highlight

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.680
these, because I think
most people would agree,

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.905
seeing these, you would think
that any professional publisher

00:14:35.905 --> 00:14:38.280
were producing these, when in
fact, it's your high school

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.488
students that are doing this.

00:14:39.488 --> 00:14:42.000
And I think that disconnect
between what is project-based

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.620
learning and what really
is project-based learning

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:48.170
is highlighted and
shown with the products

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:49.780
that your kids are producing.

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:50.090
ESTHER WOJCICKI: Right.

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:52.006
They make a difference
in their own community.

00:14:52.006 --> 00:14:55.700
For example, we have a program,
a teacher adviser program,

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.900
where we got rid of
the counseling system.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.830
And we have-- every teacher
has like, 60 students that they

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:03.300
act as a counselor-adviser to.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.910
That came about as a
result of an article

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:08.430
in "The Campanile" newspaper.

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:10.460
And so they know
they're empowered.

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:11.690
It makes a difference.

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:13.239
And so they're
really interested.

00:15:13.239 --> 00:15:15.780
JAMIE CASAP: And you can't get
rid of your students, can you?

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:20.430
ESTHER WOJCICKI: So this is
my class size, ratio 1 to 70.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.480
And so the question
is, do I control them?

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.250
Well, the answer
is, they control

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:27.340
each other and themselves,
based on the learning

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:30.050
and based on the
philosophy in the program.

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:33.840
And I don't have problems
with kids cutting class.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.530
As I mentioned, my
number one problem

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.770
is, can you please go home?

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:42.059
And we're happy you're here.

00:15:42.059 --> 00:15:43.600
JAMIE CASAP: But
you want to go home.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.940
ESTHER WOJCICKI: Yeah,
Mom and Dad miss you.

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.030
JAMIE CASAP: So
you wrote a book.

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:47.988
I don't know how you
found the time to do this.

00:15:47.988 --> 00:15:50.190
I'm a little jealous
and I'm curious.

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:52.440
So we'll have more conversation
about how you actually

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.037
had time put all this together.

00:15:54.037 --> 00:15:55.120
But let's talk about this.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.470
Why did you write a book?

00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:59.160
What's the message in the book?

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.979
What are you trying to
get across with this book?

00:16:01.979 --> 00:16:03.520
ESTHER WOJCICKI: So
I wrote this book

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.920
because I'm trying to spread
this idea of how you can

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:10.070
do project-based learning
that is not, as you say,

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:13.650
you know volcanoes and I
don't know missions and things

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:16.130
like that, you know,
the mission project.

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:18.970
And because this is real world.

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:20.060
This makes an impact.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:22.670
And so I wanted other
kids around the country

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:24.700
to have the same opportunity.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:29.060
Because our dropout rate in
America today is about 40%.

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.370
And these people then
don't have skills.

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:33.950
So how can you engage kids?

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:37.890
They don't have to be like super
smart Palo Alto, wealthy kids.

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:39.460
They can be any kid.

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:42.370
I think no matter what
your income level is,

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:45.350
you want to be trusted,
you want to be respected,

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.520
and you want to be
given some freedom.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.460
And so that's the goal.

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:52.547
JAMIE CASAP: Before we get
into some of meat of the-

00:16:52.547 --> 00:16:53.630
ESTHER WOJCICKI: The book?

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:55.610
JAMIE CASAP: --the
book itself, let's

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:57.710
talk a little bit about
who wrote your forward

00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:59.360
and how that came about.

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.010
ESTHER WOJCICKI: So
this is my forward.

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:03.760
It's written by James
Franco, the actor.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.920
And the reason he
wrote the forward

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.270
is, he was my student
for three years.

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:09.910
He was in this program.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:13.280
His high school was typical
of most student's high school

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.599
experiences, you know,
a little up and down.

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:19.640
And he bonded with the
program and with me

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:24.010
and he said that it was the
only place where he really

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:28.480
learned how important it was to
have a real world experience.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.350
He wrote, and his articles, he
got feedback on his articles.

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:34.840
He was kind of shocked
that anybody read them.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:38.020
And that he wasn't just
writing for some teacher, who

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:41.830
would then throws paper
into some circular file.

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:43.470
He was writing
for the real world

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:46.160
and it made a huge
impact on his life.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.260
So he has written the forward.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.230
He came back for
the grand opening.

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:55.890
And I invited some people
to come and turns out,

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:58.180
700 people came to see him.

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.550
It's a little more
than I expected.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:03.080
And he was nice
enough to do a selfie

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.594
with every single person.

00:18:05.594 --> 00:18:06.510
I couldn't believe it.

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:07.968
At the end of that
I thought he was

00:18:07.968 --> 00:18:09.480
going to faint or something.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:14.132
But he also made,
he drew or painted--

00:18:14.132 --> 00:18:15.840
I don't know if you
know, he's an artist.

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.840
He painted all these gigantic
paintings for the building.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.660
So if you come ever-- you're
all welcome, by the way.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.620
--you'll see paintings
by James Franco.

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:25.630
And he did a great job.

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:27.840
JAMIE CASAP: And he
keeps coming back, right?

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.550
There's a bunch of art pieces
that are in the Media Center.

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:33.537
Like you need to build
a bigger building just

00:18:33.537 --> 00:18:35.370
to keep his art work
that's in there, right?

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:36.810
ESTHER WOJCICKI: Well, yes.

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:40.800
He is coming back
often and actually he's

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.400
planning to come back
more often in the fall

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.950
for a special program that will
be announced a later point.

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:54.480
But I think hats off to him
for spending time and doing

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.510
this for the Palo Alto--

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:57.301
JAMIE CASAP: And also
highlighting the fact

00:18:57.301 --> 00:18:59.850
that project-based learning
had a huge impact on his life,

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:03.990
in terms of being able to
see the process of being

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:06.400
able to get feedback and
collaborating with folks

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.700
and create something.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.294
I think that had a
huge impact on him.

00:19:09.294 --> 00:19:10.210
ESTHER WOJCICKI: Huge.

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:12.293
And then also the other
thing that he writes about

00:19:12.293 --> 00:19:17.820
in this forward is how he's
now teaching a lot at UCLA

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.590
and another-- I think it's NYU.

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:25.160
And he uses this exact
model in his own teaching.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.900
So that's a part of why
he wrote the forward.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.370
JAMIE CASAP: So let's talk
about the meat of the book.

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:31.670
I think I have some slides.

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:34.780
Oh sorry, I was going to
show you the moon shot slide

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.404
here that you love so much.

00:19:36.404 --> 00:19:37.820
This is you standing
there, right?

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:39.790
ESTHER WOJCICKI: No.

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:45.836
This is a statue, fortunately,
donated by my daughter, Anne.

00:19:45.836 --> 00:19:47.860
It arrived the other
day, literally,

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:48.900
it's only a week there.

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:52.500
And boy, it's become
number one place to visit.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.650
And to be honest,
I'm not quite sure

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:59.060
what she was doing with that
statue and how I got it.

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:02.835
JAMIE CASAP: Where she get--
the things you can find on eBay.

00:20:02.835 --> 00:20:04.210
ESTHER WOJCICKI:
I have a feeling

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:05.650
that she had some
kind of a party

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:06.860
and now I've got the statute.

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:11.180
I'm not sure.

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.402
But anyway, my students
think it's great

00:20:13.402 --> 00:20:15.610
and everybody's taking their
picture with the statue.

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:17.650
So whatever, it's great.

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:19.862
JAMIE CASAP: So one of
the big themes in the book

00:20:19.862 --> 00:20:22.320
and what you're trying to get
across here is about control.

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:22.630
ESTHER WOJCICKI: Right.

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:24.810
JAMIE CASAP: And you
highlight-- and I can show you

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:26.559
some highlights here
about giving students

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:28.370
some control of their learning.

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:30.736
Talk a little bit
about what that means.

00:20:30.736 --> 00:20:32.360
You highlighted that
a lot in the book.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:33.280
What does that mean?

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.940
ESTHER WOJCICKI: So giving
students some control

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:35.564
their learning.

00:20:35.564 --> 00:20:38.650
So I think it's really
difficult for teachers

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:40.040
to give students control.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.310
Because you come out of
a school of education

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:44.200
and what happens is,
you've got this book.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.090
I'm not kidding,
they give you a book,

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:48.810
how to maintain control
in your classroom.

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:51.366
Discipline, how to maintain--
yeah, how to achieve this.

00:20:51.366 --> 00:20:53.240
JAMIE CASAP: I was going
to show some slides.

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.448
ESTHER WOJCICKI: There it is.

00:20:54.448 --> 00:20:56.010
Those are just two examples.

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:57.290
But then show the next slide.

00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:58.450
Just put this on.

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:04.770
That's just one of
150 million responses

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:07.430
you can get if you type in
control of your classroom.

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:11.060
Teachers are obsessed,
obsessed, with keeping control.

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:14.790
As matter of fact, they're--
and evaluated on the kind

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:16.325
of control they
have in the class.

00:21:16.325 --> 00:21:17.950
So somebody comes in
the class and they

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:21.320
expect everybody to be
sitting there quietly,

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:25.250
quietly interacting with a
book or with a piece of paper

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:28.540
and listening to the oracle
speak, the teacher, right?

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:32.690
And so if you want to have
project-based learning

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:34.930
and if you want to give
some students some control

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:36.640
it looks very different.

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:38.320
It looks messy.

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.260
People are talking
to each other.

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:44.470
Just like you saw those chairs
I have, they're all in groups.

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:46.420
They're not all
lined up in a row.

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.600
It's not all symmetrical.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:52.040
JAMIE CASAP: I would say that,
before The Media Center, when

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.400
somebody would want
to go visit you,

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.370
unlike a typical
classroom where you

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:59.370
knew exactly where the teacher
was, it took like 15 minutes

00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:00.040
to find you.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:03.172
Because you're somewhere in the
back working with some team.

00:22:03.172 --> 00:22:04.630
Nobody could find
you at any point,

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:07.754
because it looked
like it was chaotic.

00:22:07.754 --> 00:22:09.170
ESTHER WOJCICKI:
It looks chaotic.

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:13.650
But you know, some people ask,
so how are these kids doing?

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:17.310
Was their publication
good or how does it rank?

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:20.100
So just so you know, we
have won consistently,

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:23.240
for several years in a row,
the Gold Crown from Columbia.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.910
So it's the top of the nation.

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:26.940
So it's not like
you're giving kids

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:28.590
control and all
of a sudden, they

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:30.620
start producing
low quality stuff.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:31.862
It's just the opposite.

00:22:31.862 --> 00:22:33.320
You give them some
control and then

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.310
they feel passionate
about what they're doing

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:37.340
and then they want
to make it the best.

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:39.990
So I think that's really true.

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:42.040
And finding me in the
classroom, that's right.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.900
It was hard to find
me in the classroom.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.830
So I was certified as
something called National Board

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:49.350
Teacher, National Board
for Professional Teaching

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:50.670
Standards.

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:55.510
And they require you to
have a video of yourself.

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:58.200
Here's another
problem, teaching.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:01.660
And so you have to
stand up and lecture

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:04.560
and then they evaluate you.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.380
And then they either
certify you or don't.

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:10.000
And that was the
biggest hangup for me.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.210
I had to organize
a special day when

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:17.100
I could make them all sit
there and I could lecture

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.392
and they could all sit quietly.

00:23:18.392 --> 00:23:20.391
JAMIE CASAP: You were
pretending like you were--

00:23:20.391 --> 00:23:21.830
ESTHER WOJCICKI:
I was pretending

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:24.500
like this was my class.

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:25.870
So you see, it's embedded.

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:27.560
It's all over society.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:32.070
And so, if we can
somehow get this idea

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:35.290
across that giving people
more freedom to learn,

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:38.320
even if they're in bodies
that are younger than 18,

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.581
will make a big difference
in their learning.

00:23:40.581 --> 00:23:42.330
JAMIE CASAP: I want
to ask you a question,

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:46.490
and then as I do that, I want
to open it up for questions.

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:48.200
So if you have
questions to ask Esther,

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.450
there's a microphone up there.

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:52.144
So think about your
questions as I ask you this.

00:23:52.144 --> 00:23:54.310
And then we'll have some
dialogue with the audience,

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:55.640
because they're here.

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:56.890
ESTHER WOJCICKI: That's great.

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:58.222
That's great.

00:23:58.222 --> 00:24:00.180
JAMIE CASAP: If you're
talking to a new teacher

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:01.810
or if you're talking
to a teacher who's

00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:03.684
been a teacher for five
years, doesn't really

00:24:03.684 --> 00:24:05.370
matter, what is the moonshot?

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:07.105
What do you want
them to think about?

00:24:07.105 --> 00:24:08.730
You want them to read
your book and you

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:10.781
want them to think about
very specific things

00:24:10.781 --> 00:24:12.280
that they can do
in their classroom.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.150
What's the big takeaway from it?

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:17.574
ESTHER WOJCICKI: So the big
takeaway is like, for example,

00:24:17.574 --> 00:24:18.990
hopefully they'll
get Chromebooks.

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:22.790
We just got Chrombooks
for the school.

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:26.440
The first thing you want to
do is give them the Chromebook

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:28.810
and teach them how to search.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:30.500
And search--
where's Dan Russell?

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:31.000
He was--

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:31.590
JAMIE CASAP: There he is.

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:32.465
ESTHER WOJCICKI: Dan.

00:24:32.465 --> 00:24:32.980
Yes.

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:37.480
Thank you, Dan, because this
is the first thing that they

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.540
need to know how to do.

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:42.690
And then after that, you
give them an assignment

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:47.550
to do, for example, literally
anything, including math,

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:50.480
you know, science.

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:54.230
It's the entire curriculum
and you open it up.

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:57.070
Instead of you lecturing,
like for example,

00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:59.740
even on Romeo and
Juliet, what's the story

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:01.500
behind Romeo and Juliet?

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.920
Well, how about
you guys go online,

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.130
take a look at what
the resources are.

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:08.500
What is the story
of Romeo and Juliet?

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:10.690
You have 10 minutes
to find out and then

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:12.960
I want you to talk to
each other in a group.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:13.950
What is the story?

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:16.019
How did that come about?

00:25:16.019 --> 00:25:18.560
I'll tell you, they're going to
learn more in that 10 minutes

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.640
than they would if I
spoke for 10 minutes

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.310
and told them the story.

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:25.800
They will not remember
anything I said.

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.300
They're probably
dreaming about what

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:30.030
they could do as soon as
they get out of school.

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:33.480
So that's part of, I
think, what's going on

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.070
and what they should be doing.

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:38.590
And I think one of
the things that Google

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:43.210
could do that would be helpful--
since all these publications I

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:46.480
do, by the way, there
are all done on Docs.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.090
My hat off to the Docs team.

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:51.350
I couldn't do any of this stuff
without the collaboration.

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:54.960
They all peer edit everything.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.490
That's the way it works.

00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:59.350
And so one of the things
that would be great

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:02.350
is if somehow we could
get that message across,

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:05.960
that it's easier for
the teacher to teach

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:09.200
and more effective for
the students to learn,

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.400
if they would just
relinquish some control.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.740
And as I said, if the
blended learning model could

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:17.600
be more effective
nationwide, we might not

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.660
have that 40% dropout rate.

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:22.342
You'd have more kids
that were engaged.

00:26:22.342 --> 00:26:23.300
JAMIE CASAP: Questions.

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:24.200
What do we have?

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.200
We have Esther here.

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.084
Do we have some questions
from the audience?

00:26:28.084 --> 00:26:29.250
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:30.440
I've really enjoyed the talk.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.773
You mentioned that you believe
that the blended learning

00:26:32.773 --> 00:26:36.070
model can work in all
socioeconomic situations.

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:39.130
Do you have any examples of
maybe where blended learning

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:41.570
has been applied in the
lower socioeconomic kind

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:45.220
of neighborhoods or demographic
and the success rates?

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:46.880
ESTHER WOJCICKI:
You know, I don't

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:50.060
have-- I didn't personally
teach in any of those areas.

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:53.450
Although I can
say that last year

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:57.960
I volunteered to teach the
lowest lane at Palo Alto High

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:01.240
School, the majority of students
coming from East Palo Alto.

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.750
And it worked with them too.

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:07.870
And I was teaching
English in that program.

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:09.660
JAMIE CASAP: I can
add, the methodology

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:13.000
is being used by schools
all over the world, all

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.310
over the country.

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:17.230
There's a school in Philadelphia
called-- we could actually--

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:19.360
there's a school here
in California, High Tech

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:25.760
High, that uses project-based
learning and the zip codes

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:28.550
that kids come from are all
over the place in Southern

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:29.050
California.

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:31.633
There's a school in Philadelphia
called the Science Leadership

00:27:31.633 --> 00:27:32.624
Academy, same thing.

00:27:32.624 --> 00:27:34.040
It's an inquiry-based
high school.

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.165
It's all project-based
learning that they're doing.

00:27:36.165 --> 00:27:39.380
So the model applies even
more so, I think, sometimes

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:42.550
in socioeconomic-- poorer
socioeconomic background

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:46.030
schools because you're
putting kids together

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:48.200
that have diverse backgrounds,
diverse perspectives

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.490
and they're creating some
unusual and cool things.

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:52.406
And so you're seeing a
lot of cool things come

00:27:52.406 --> 00:27:54.530
from that in those schools.

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:57.530
ESTHER WOJCICKI: I think
it does work really well.

00:27:57.530 --> 00:28:00.910
Those kids are so used to being
told what to do all the time

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:03.240
and being bossed around,
and so their idea

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:07.580
of using tech in the classroom
is to have a worksheet online.

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:10.702
And so you'll see kids
with those computers,

00:28:10.702 --> 00:28:12.660
and you think they're
doing something creative.

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:13.579
Well, think again.

00:28:13.579 --> 00:28:14.120
They are not.

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:17.350
They're just doing that same
thing, online worksheet.

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:18.820
JAMIE CASAP: Let
me ask you about--

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:21.017
did that answer your question?

00:28:21.017 --> 00:28:21.850
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:24.391
JAMIE CASAP: So let me ask you
about professional development

00:28:24.391 --> 00:28:25.220
for teachers.

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:28.185
What do you like about
professional development?

00:28:28.185 --> 00:28:30.310
I almost didn't
want to ask that.

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:33.519
What would you change about
professional development

00:28:33.519 --> 00:28:34.060
for teachers?

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:37.625
What's wrong in
that set up system?

00:28:37.625 --> 00:28:39.000
ESTHER WOJCICKI:
Is there anybody

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.090
in here who has been a teacher?

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:44.180
So you remember what
professional development

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:45.130
is like?

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:47.560
So they bring in
some high paid guy

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.915
to speak to you at the
beginning of whatever day

00:28:50.915 --> 00:28:52.460
it is, and they speak.

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:54.940
It's a lecture-based model.

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:57.064
And then they ask you
afterward to get together

00:28:57.064 --> 00:28:59.480
in little groups and tell you
what you thought of that guy

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.100
that's spoke.

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:03.230
I would change that whole thing.

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:05.600
I mean, I would
have people actually

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:09.300
doing exactly what we
recommend in the classroom.

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.170
Teachers should
do the same thing,

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:12.600
put themselves
together in groups,

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.490
talk about issues
in their classroom,

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:18.290
find solutions, and then share.

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:20.610
It's kind of like the
unconference model.

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:23.700
You know the
unconference, like--

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:26.200
JAMIE CASAP: The unconference
model where it's self-driven

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.611
and the participants
are actually

00:29:27.611 --> 00:29:29.985
driving the conversation, as
opposed to being lectured to

00:29:29.985 --> 00:29:31.320
by someone who comes in.

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.830
ESTHER WOJCICKI:
That's right, yeah.

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:36.380
I mean I think lecture-based
works to a certain extent.

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:39.870
That's why I said, the
blended learning, 50%.

00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:42.070
OK you come lecture for 50%.

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:45.510
But then after that,
you need to stop.

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:46.160
Cut it out.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.080
JAMIE CASAP: What
skills do teachers

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:52.900
need to be able to implement
this model that they don't

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:55.995
necessarily have now or they're
not necessarily utilizing now?

00:29:55.995 --> 00:29:57.620
ESTHER WOJCICKI: I
think the main thing

00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:03.510
is they have to let go of
their fear of giving students

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:05.310
some control.

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:07.690
I mean, it looks
messy, it really does.

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:09.240
Kids will be talking
to each other.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:13.240
They might not turn
their stuff in on time.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.900
But after a short
period of that,

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.520
you're still collecting work.

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:23.000
You know, I collect
all the stuff online.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.020
And then all corrected online.

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:28.010
But if you want, you can
collected in hard copy,

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:29.790
or you can get other
kids-- you know,

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:31.470
you're still doing
the same thing.

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:32.980
The only difference
is that you're

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:35.090
giving them more control.

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:37.130
You're not dictating
to such a degree.

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:44.370
And I think that as I mentioned,
the main thing that teachers

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:46.800
are afraid of is losing
control, because that's

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.630
what you're trained to do
in a school of education.

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:52.050
And that's what your
principal comes through.

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:54.640
They have this thing
called scripted teaching.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.790
Are you familiar with
scripted teaching?

00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:58.080
Anyone know about it?

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:01.230
It's right here in
Santa Clara County.

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:05.820
Scripted teaching is basically,
they give you a textbook.

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:07.610
They give you
exactly what you're

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:09.560
supposed to say
and tell you where

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:13.360
you're supposed to be on every
single day of the school year.

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.800
And they give you the tests too.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:20.190
It's happening right now,
right here, as we speak.

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:23.230
And the question is,
how effective is that?

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:26.640
And I would say, it's
not very effective.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:31.900
Doesn't seem-- we have
600,000 jobs that go unfilled.

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:32.880
Did you know that?

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.440
JAMIE CASAP: Uh, huh.

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.439
ESTHER WOJCICKI: And the
reason they go unfilled

00:31:35.439 --> 00:31:38.200
is because they can't find
people with the right skills

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.010
to fill those jobs.

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:42.780
We're training for
a factory model.

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:48.420
And of course, as I mentioned,
in schools like in Oakland,

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:50.220
Oakland's dropout rate is 70%.

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:54.350
Did you guys know that?

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:57.780
Isn't that something
scary, I think?

00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:01.350
San Jose actually has a pretty
high dropout rate as well.

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:03.930
JAMIE CASAP: So we had some
people lining up for questions.

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:06.560
And I have some others,
but I'll start up here.

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:11.640
AUDIENCE: So could you
talk a little about blended

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.990
learning for younger age groups?

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:15.490
ESTHER WOJCICKI:
That's a good idea.

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:16.010
JAMIE CASAP: That's
a good question.

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:16.926
ESTHER WOJCICKI: Yeah.

00:32:16.926 --> 00:32:22.010
So you know, even little kids,
small kids, preschool kids,

00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:25.180
even they like to work
together with their friends.

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:28.375
They're all coming to
school to see their friends.

00:32:28.375 --> 00:32:31.000
If anybody's a teacher in here,
I don't want to disappoint you.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.180
They're not coming to see you.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:38.240
And the same thing happens
in elementary school.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.880
So you want to give
kids an opportunity

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.720
to work in a peer group.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.120
You can be more directive.

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:48.045
That's why I say even 50%,
but you can do the same thing.

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:52.390
Kids get excited about that.

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:55.140
It works in elementary
school as well.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:57.040
There are some
subjects where I think

00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:01.100
it's a little bit harder to
do it than in other subjects,

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:05.280
like for example, perhaps
science, chemistry.

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:08.910
Chemistry is so much
memorization and so forth.

00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:13.420
But you can still have kids
doing a project based on that.

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:15.312
It's a lab science.

00:33:15.312 --> 00:33:17.020
JAMIE CASAP: I think
the main point here,

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.061
and you and I have talked
about this in the past,

00:33:19.061 --> 00:33:22.670
is that school was set up
as an individual sport.

00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:25.380
But we live in a
team-based world, right?

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:29.170
And so we take kids through
this individual experience, even

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:32.890
young kids, and then we push
them out the door and we say,

00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:34.030
OK, go work with others.

00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:34.760
Good luck.

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:36.260
And we're not teaching
them that's skill set.

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:38.750
And project-based learning,
besides what they're producing,

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:42.600
is helping them create
that collaborative mindset

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.530
that we need in the work world.

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:46.210
Because what we don't
work in a factory

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:47.900
where one person's
doing one thing.

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.730
We're working in an
environment where

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:52.350
it's knowledge-based,
network-based, where we need

00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:53.530
people to collaborate more.

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:53.840
ESTHER WOJCICKI: Right.

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:55.214
JAMIE CASAP: And
in your program,

00:33:55.214 --> 00:33:57.880
kids are learning that, more
so than creating a newspaper,

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.759
they're learning how
to work with each other

00:33:59.759 --> 00:34:01.550
and how to build off
each other's strengths

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:03.540
and those types
of things as well.

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:05.706
ESTHER WOJCICKI: I think a
lot of elementary schools

00:34:05.706 --> 00:34:07.350
are already doing a lot of this.

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:09.510
There are more
into project-based

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:11.150
learning than the
high schools are.

00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:13.870
I think the problem comes in
middle school and high school,

00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:16.800
where they start to
really lecture full time.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:21.710
And especially those AP
classes, AP US History,

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:27.567
90 minutes of lecture
all the time, constant.

00:34:27.567 --> 00:34:29.650
JAMIE CASAP: For all those
AP history jobs, right?

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:30.930
ESTHER WOJCICKI: Yeah.

00:34:30.930 --> 00:34:33.175
For all those AP
history jobs, yes.

00:34:33.175 --> 00:34:35.300
AUDIENCE: I imagine
motivation, student motivation,

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:37.170
has a big effect
on blended learning

00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:38.540
and I was wondering if you
could talk about motivation

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:40.609
and whether all students
react the same way

00:34:40.609 --> 00:34:42.150
and whether that
affects performance.

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:46.060
And would you teach people that
are highly motivated or less

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:47.927
motivated the same way?

00:34:47.927 --> 00:34:50.260
ESTHER WOJCICKI: It turns out
that this blended learning

00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:51.889
motivates kids.

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:56.139
And so, I get kids that
are not at all motivated.

00:34:56.139 --> 00:34:59.570
I mean, James Franco
was one of them.

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:02.105
And this can change the
way that they-- their life.

00:35:02.105 --> 00:35:04.480
JAMIE CASAP: Because it helps
them build autonomy, right?

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.355
ESTHER WOJCICKI: It
helps them build autonomy

00:35:06.355 --> 00:35:08.820
and also they become friends
with all the other kids

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:09.550
in the class.

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:12.240
It's a big community,
in essence.

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:15.680
It ends up being an
intellectual team.

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:20.160
There are now it's about 600
kids taking media arts studies

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.410
at Palo Alto High School.

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:23.240
You can imagine the
size of that team.

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:24.170
Its huge.

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:26.520
And they all feel connected.

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:31.620
It makes a huge difference to
how they feel about themselves

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:35.420
and how they feel about being
there at Palo Alto High School.

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:36.710
JAMIE CASAP: Yes, sir.

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:39.550
AUDIENCE: So as someone
who lives with a teacher,

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:42.220
I get to hear all the complaints
about the backwardness

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:45.850
of professional development and
the factory model all the time.

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:49.690
How would you suggest
a teacher going about

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:52.840
to create the changes that
you've been able to create

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.450
in their own schools?

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:56.450
Do they get lucky
with seven computers

00:35:56.450 --> 00:36:00.460
or are there active steps
they can take to help

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:03.381
get the administration
on their side?

00:36:03.381 --> 00:36:04.880
ESTHER WOJCICKI:
Well locally, I can

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:10.480
tell you there's going to be
a film on the 28th of April.

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:14.890
And it's just coming out and
it won Sundance Film Festival,

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:19.230
called, I think it's
called "How We Succeed."

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:21.770
We can't show any
films here, but I'll

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:23.440
be happy to send a link to that.

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:25.350
It's free.

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:26.270
I would advise--

00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:28.520
JAMIE CASAP: Is this
"Most Likely to Succeed"?

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:29.870
ESTHER WOJCICKI: Oh it is
"Most Likely to Succeed."

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:31.330
JAMIE CASAP: Larry
Rosenstock at High Tech High.

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:32.579
ESTHER WOJCICKI: That's right.

00:36:32.579 --> 00:36:37.150
"Most Likely to Succeed."

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:40.530
I'm trying to arrange
most faculties around here

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:41.990
to see that film.

00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:43.130
They need to see it.

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:45.210
The administration
needs to see it.

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:47.680
Teachers need to see it.

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:50.270
It shows you how
to get it going.

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:54.030
Because a single teacher
in a school by yourself,

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:55.180
it's a real battle.

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:59.670
I mean I had a battle for years,
because I started doing this

00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:01.300
when nobody else was doing it.

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:03.770
And people thought I was wacky.

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:07.720
I guess the only ones that
didn't think I was wacky

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:10.310
were all the parents
and all the students,

00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:11.740
because the program
kept growing.

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:14.110
And they were like,
what's she doing in there?

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:16.730
Oh my god, they all look like
they're not doing anything.

00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:19.060
They're just talking.

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:21.390
But I think it's
tough for your--

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:24.000
and I hear your wife
and her problems.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.320
The PD is very difficult,
professional development

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.976
because it is mind-numbing.

00:37:29.976 --> 00:37:31.600
JAMIE CASAP: So let's
talk a little bit

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:33.720
about-- let me ask
you a question,

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.810
what you just mentioned
about the movie,

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:38.700
"Most Likely to Succeed."

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:41.960
It actually highlights--
I saw the movie.

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:44.369
ESTHER WOJCICKI: Larry
Rosenstock at High Tech High.

00:37:44.369 --> 00:37:46.410
JAMIE CASAP: It highlights
project-based learning

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:48.610
as a model and it
clearly points out

00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:50.350
that you're not covering
all the material

00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:54.760
but you're teaching kids a whole
bunch of new ways to learn.

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:57.570
One of the issues that you get
against project-based learning

00:37:57.570 --> 00:38:00.070
or one of the
naysayers, if you will,

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:01.540
against project-based
learning is,

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:03.360
we need to teach to the test.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:06.550
Assessments, talk a little
bit about assessments

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:09.770
and the negative impact that
potentially assessments have.

00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:11.440
Not to lead the witness.

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:15.500
ESTHER WOJCICKI: OK, Jamie.

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:17.880
JAMIE CASAP: But also
like how do you get around

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:20.690
that idea of you have
to teach to the test

00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:22.972
and you can't do
project-based learning.

00:38:22.972 --> 00:38:24.930
ESTHER WOJCICKI: I still
think you're teaching.

00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:26.830
That's the 50%.

00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:28.130
You know you're still doing it.

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:30.570
The only thing is, the
teaching is sticking.

00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:31.760
That's the difference.

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:34.770
So kids have a
reason why they're

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:38.560
learning all this stuff, as
opposed to just memorizing it

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.000
so they could take a test.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.330
So these kids in this program,
in the media arts program,

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:45.120
they all score at the top.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:47.630
I mean Palo Alto High
School and a lot of the kids

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:50.930
coming out of this program
are National Merit Scholars.

00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:53.400
So most schools are
happy when they have one.

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.040
I think we have 50.

00:38:55.040 --> 00:39:01.110
And it all comes because
it matters to them.

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:03.190
It's just like a
foreign language.

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:06.000
You learn something,
French or Spanish

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.470
or whatever, then you
don't practice it and then

00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:10.690
where does it go?

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:13.000
When you go to France, you
can't remember anything.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.710
So I mean this gives
them an opportunity

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:16.690
to practice every day.

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:20.670
So even if schools want to have
a six period day where there's

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:24.830
all lecture, if they could just
give them the seventh period

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:31.100
to have it for project-based
learning, that is meaningful,

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:34.770
it might make those other
six periods tolerable.

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:38.050
So I'm trying to think of
all these different methods

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:40.500
to get people to do it.

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:43.115
And that's the
purpose of the book.

00:39:43.115 --> 00:39:45.490
JAMIE CASAP: I was going to
say, they're all in the book.

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:47.073
ESTHER WOJCICKI:
It's all in the book.

00:39:47.073 --> 00:39:50.280
So the first part of the book
is the introduction of course,

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:51.120
by James Franco.

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:55.310
And then there's some
philosophy on like, why do it.

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:56.490
Why should you do it?

00:39:56.490 --> 00:40:00.600
And then followed
by chapters on apps,

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:04.740
which apps can you use in
every single subject area,

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:07.790
followed by networks
for teachers.

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:12.380
How can you personally get
support if you need support?

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:13.340
There's networks.

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:15.740
And then the last part
of it is the history

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:17.580
of technology in America.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:21.440
Like what has happened, since
we started with technology,

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:25.000
what's happened, what are the
statistics, how does it work?

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.050
And so, that's sort of how
to get it spread everywhere.

00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:32.930
Fortunately, the book
has done pretty well.

00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:36.290
So it's all over-- well,
it's sold out actually

00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:38.760
at Kepler's and
Books Incorporated

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:42.830
and we're almost ready for
the second printing on this.

00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:44.580
JAMIE CASAP: If there
was only another way

00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:48.620
to get a copy of a book
into some kind of format.

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:51.010
ESTHER WOJCICKI:
Well, so look at.

00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:53.730
This was published by
Pacific Research Institute.

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:55.820
They are a wonderful
group in San Francisco.

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:57.140
It's a think tank.

00:40:57.140 --> 00:41:00.600
And they normally don't
really publish books.

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:03.200
They publish important
papers and things

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.870
from scholars and
things like that.

00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:06.880
They're a little
shocked to be honest,

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:09.120
that this book has
already sold out,

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:12.390
and they're not quite
sure what to do.

00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:16.050
So they are planning on
doing a Kindle edition.

00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:20.540
They have never done a Kindle
edition for any book yet.

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:21.847
And so this is a first.

00:41:21.847 --> 00:41:23.180
But they promise me it's coming.

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:24.805
So yes, Jamie, it's coming.

00:41:24.805 --> 00:41:26.930
JAMIE CASAP: I've just been
giving her-- all right.

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:29.290
Yes, Tracy.

00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:32.860
AUDIENCE: So Palo Alto has seen
a rash of some mental health

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:36.630
challenges and I imagine
that in your world,

00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:38.800
in particular, as sort of
the voice of the school,

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:41.530
that you've seen a lot of how
the students are responding

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:42.030
to that.

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:46.007
And I'm curious to hear
your thoughts on both that,

00:41:46.007 --> 00:41:47.840
but how you feel like
project-based learning

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:49.530
and blended learning
has impacted

00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:52.372
the social and emotional
health of the kids as well.

00:41:52.372 --> 00:41:54.080
ESTHER WOJCICKI: That's
a great question.

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:55.663
So for those of you
that aren't aware,

00:41:55.663 --> 00:42:00.750
so Palo Alto schools,
especially Gunn High School,

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:03.550
has had a rash of suicides.

00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:06.950
And these are high
achieving students,

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:09.850
apparently did not have
a lot of the factors

00:42:09.850 --> 00:42:14.100
that people would suspect
them to be suicidal that

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:16.100
have committed suicide.

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:19.370
So we've had three in
the last four months.

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:22.460
And it's been pretty
bad, to be honest.

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:28.140
And I personally think that the
kids that were-- the factors

00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:31.780
affected those kids
were expectations

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:35.970
that are kind of embedded
from the parents or maybe

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:37.520
the grandparents.

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:40.460
And that the kids
then embed those.

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:43.000
It just becomes part
of their nature.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.930
And they feel that if they
don't meet those expectations,

00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:50.390
that they're humiliated.

00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:53.640
There's nothing worse
than humiliation,

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:57.730
especially if you
personally feel that way.

00:42:57.730 --> 00:43:01.650
And so the philosophy
of my program

00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:05.440
is that you work until
you get it right.

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.450
So I don't actually
even grade until you

00:43:07.450 --> 00:43:11.550
get an A. Kids will revise
things over and over and over.

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:13.660
I have a mastery-based system.

00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:15.950
So you can revise-- you
come into the program,

00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:19.030
you don't know how
to write, so then you

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:23.310
revise that essay or
that article 10 times.

00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:25.860
And in between each
revision, there is no grade.

00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:27.930
You only get the
grade at the end.

00:43:27.930 --> 00:43:31.630
And so I think kids need
to be given a freedom,

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:33.000
freedom like that to fail.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.920
But what happens in
a lot of the programs

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:37.092
is that you get a
grade, and then they

00:43:37.092 --> 00:43:38.716
average that grade
with the other grade

00:43:38.716 --> 00:43:40.674
and then they average
the other one at the end.

00:43:40.674 --> 00:43:44.790
You know, you can get 89.4
and you get a B, B plus.

00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:47.890
And then your parents
get mad and whatever.

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:51.240
So I think there needs to
be less emphasis on grades,

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:54.380
more emphasis on it's
OK to make a mistake.

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:56.460
It's OK to be a kid.

00:43:56.460 --> 00:44:00.700
Let's get rid of all
this high pressure stuff

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:03.920
and make them feel like it's OK.

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:06.910
So I know Gunn
High School now is

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:10.550
thinking about moving to what
is called the block schedule.

00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:13.410
So [? Powie ?] has
the block schedule.

00:44:13.410 --> 00:44:16.460
Instead of having every
period on every day, all seven

00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:20.250
periods, we go period, that's
two, four, six on one day

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:23.340
and one, three, five,
seven on another day.

00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:27.487
And then one day a week,
we have all periods.

00:44:27.487 --> 00:44:29.070
And it's interesting,
the kids are now

00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:32.400
complaining that the one
day a week for all periods

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:35.110
is too stressful.

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:36.860
And it might be because
the pressures are

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:39.060
so high to get into college.

00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:41.070
Also one other thing
I wanted to mention

00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:43.790
is that they all want to
go to Harvard, Princeton,

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:45.200
it's ridiculous.

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:47.570
So I've been giving
them stories.

00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:50.810
I just brought in Mike Honda,
Congressman Mike Honda.

00:44:50.810 --> 00:44:52.450
Do you know who he is?

00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:55.650
He's a local congressman.

00:44:55.650 --> 00:44:58.540
He did really poorly
in high school.

00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:01.610
He actually dropped
out of college.

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:06.260
In general, he was not academic
and then he did super well.

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:08.190
And now he's been
a congressman for I

00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:10.690
don't know how many years, 20
years, something like that.

00:45:10.690 --> 00:45:12.560
But it's just to give
them some perspective.

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:14.940
You don't have to go to Harvard.

00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:16.660
You know you can go
to Foothill College.

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:18.820
You can go to any
school or you don't even

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:21.940
have to go to school maybe, if
you want to do something else.

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:23.940
You need to think about
what you want to do.

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:26.480
So more teachers
have to say that.

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:28.820
Because they don't
listen to their parents

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:30.200
when they're teenagers.

00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:32.200
Sorry to shock you.

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:33.394
But anyway--

00:45:33.394 --> 00:45:35.310
JAMIE CASAP: But it's
all part of this whole--

00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:37.268
we talked a little bit
about earlier, this idea

00:45:37.268 --> 00:45:39.750
that it's an individual sport.

00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:42.740
And not only that, we make them
compete against each other,

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:43.240
right?

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:46.240
So they are competing
for grades and sometimes

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:48.830
instead of figuring out how to
collaborate, they're competing

00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:50.012
and that causes issues.

00:45:50.012 --> 00:45:51.470
ESTHER WOJCICKI:
That causes issues

00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:55.200
and especially if teacher
grades on a curve,

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:58.070
you're just grading
on an absolute scale,

00:45:58.070 --> 00:46:00.790
and certain number kids get
an A and then another B,

00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:02.970
and then they talk
about grade inflation.

00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:04.710
And then kids are
checking their phone.

00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:05.376
I'm not kidding.

00:46:05.376 --> 00:46:09.120
They check their phone
every 20 minutes.

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:10.145
I don't post grades.

00:46:10.145 --> 00:46:11.330
It's like, finished.

00:46:11.330 --> 00:46:12.440
Sorry, guys.

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:15.990
Just learn and then when you're
done doing that learning,

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:19.620
you can get an A and
then they're actually

00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:22.100
very happy about this,
to be honest, no stress.

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:23.600
JAMIE CASAP: It's
constant iteration

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:28.030
versus having some absolute time
where you get a B, like what

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:29.090
does a B mean, right?

00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:32.010
What do you do with a B
versus continuously learning

00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:32.572
to iterate.

00:46:32.572 --> 00:46:34.530
ESTHER WOJCICKI: I think
more and more programs

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:35.760
need to be like that.

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:40.230
And I think that Gunn
High School could benefit.

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:42.360
JAMIE CASAP: Well, most
high schools can benefit.

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:43.860
ESTHER WOJCICKI:
Right, most schools

00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:45.080
can benefit, not just Gunn.

00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:46.580
AUDIENCE: First, I
want to thank you

00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:49.900
for what you were just saying
about stress on the kids.

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:52.830
I have teenagers applying
to college right now.

00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:56.680
But my question is
actually about how do you

00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:59.990
apply some of this in a state
like my home state of New

00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:02.970
Mexico, where the
poverty is so great,

00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:05.555
the biggest barrier to learning
a lot of these kids face

00:47:05.555 --> 00:47:06.770
is just basic hunger.

00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:08.512
The teachers are
bringing in food

00:47:08.512 --> 00:47:10.970
to feed the students so they
can learn, that kind of stuff.

00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:13.659
How do you apply the
project-based learning

00:47:13.659 --> 00:47:15.950
to a school that can't afford
any technology whatsoever

00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:18.899
and can't even afford
to get the heat working?

00:47:18.899 --> 00:47:20.440
JAMIE CASAP: That's
a great question.

00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:21.400
ESTHER WOJCICKI: That's
a great question.

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:21.890
JAMIE CASAP: You take it.

00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:22.734
I'm not taking it.

00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:27.686
This is your show, not mine.

00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:35.190
ESTHER WOJCICKI: My
very first teaching job,

00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:39.850
I had a class full of boys
period one in the morning.

00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:43.600
And that was their number one
problem, they were hungry.

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:49.800
And I was in San Leandro and,
you know, it's a major problem.

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:53.000
It's too bad that the-- you
know, somebody in the community

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.120
has to solve the problem.

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:57.000
I solved the problem by
bringing in food every day.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.690
And then the
administration wanted

00:47:59.690 --> 00:48:02.770
to know what I had done
to make these boys learn.

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:08.340
And it was just so simple,
just food in the morning.

00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:13.360
So it's very hard to
learn when you're hungry.

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:15.950
And it's also hard to learn
when you don't have a place

00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:17.110
to live or stay.

00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:20.490
We have a lot of
homeless kids in America.

00:48:20.490 --> 00:48:22.732
JAMIE CASAP: Let's make
that we're clear here,

00:48:22.732 --> 00:48:24.690
that blended learning or
project-based learning

00:48:24.690 --> 00:48:27.460
is one component of a
giant scope of things

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:30.770
that we have to do in education
in terms of a learning model.

00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:32.530
But you asked a
great question, which

00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:36.160
I'll kind of create more
of a general question

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:39.830
around this, which is the use
of technology in education,

00:48:39.830 --> 00:48:42.660
we're seeing an increase of the
use of technology in education.

00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:45.850
Some schools can afford it,
some schools can't afford it.

00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:49.630
But more importantly, you did
not take technology and just

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:54.070
put it on top of old
learning models and do that.

00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:57.920
You actually embedded and
integrated the technology

00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:58.680
in education.

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:01.760
So a lot of times, we see
technology as this nice

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:05.400
to have, because we're adding it
on top of things, versus being

00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:09.430
a core enabling capability
to new learning models that

00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:12.010
get you to that motivation
that you want from kids.

00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:14.680
So talk about the role of
technology in education

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:18.510
then what you're seeing
good and also bad.

00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:21.770
ESTHER WOJCICKI: So good is
when it's embedded in a way

00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:24.890
that it supports the learning.

00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:28.600
It's bad when it just continues
to reinforce worksheets.

00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:33.380
And when kids are
just put on a computer

00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:37.640
nonstop for, I'm not kidding,
long periods of time,

00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:39.024
it can be for hours.

00:49:39.024 --> 00:49:40.190
JAMIE CASAP: Drill and kill.

00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:41.523
ESTHER WOJCICKI: Drill and kill.

00:49:41.523 --> 00:49:42.769
That is not a good model.

00:49:42.769 --> 00:49:44.810
And I don't know if you
know, but in Florida they

00:49:44.810 --> 00:49:48.410
have had some problems
with the tech-based schools

00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:51.530
because the kids were just
put on the computer all day,

00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:53.500
and then they didn't
learn anything.

00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:55.780
And that's one of the
other problems with MOOCs.

00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:59.980
You know MOOCs, massive
open online courses?

00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:02.560
People don't like
to learn alone.

00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:03.970
Nobody wants to learn alone.

00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:07.550
Their dropout rate is 95%.

00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:11.160
So if you put it in a
classroom where then kids

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:14.210
are talking and interacting
with each other,

00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:15.680
then they want to stay.

00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:18.710
So my question on
those is, can you do it

00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:22.856
online as opposed to in person?

00:50:22.856 --> 00:50:24.480
JAMIE CASAP: The key
message is that we

00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:27.630
have to figure out ways to
take technology and support

00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:29.765
and enable these great
learning models that

00:50:29.765 --> 00:50:31.932
are being created that you
champion and are part of.

00:50:31.932 --> 00:50:33.473
ESTHER WOJCICKI:
That's what teachers

00:50:33.473 --> 00:50:36.110
need to learn in their
professional development, how

00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:41.100
to take technology and use it
to support their teaching, not

00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:48.870
in place and just to make a huge
difference to get kids excited.

00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:54.239
I think it needs-- it makes a
huge difference for America.

00:50:54.239 --> 00:50:56.030
JAMIE CASAP: We've got
two more folks here.

00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:57.750
Let's make sure-- I want to
get everybody's questions

00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:58.740
in before we run out of time.

00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:00.114
So come up and
ask your question.

00:51:00.114 --> 00:51:02.770
AUDIENCE: Quickly, I'm
curious about your experience

00:51:02.770 --> 00:51:06.310
with how much guidance to
give the groups of kids

00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:10.650
when they break out into their
own independent assignments.

00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:13.270
Do you just give
them a task and let

00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:15.820
them completely
self-organize or do

00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:19.030
you come in after a few
minutes and give some guidance?

00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:21.540
I know from my team
working at Google,

00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:24.850
many times we're challenged
on how to collaborate together

00:51:24.850 --> 00:51:26.940
with our peers.

00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:28.850
ESTHER WOJCICKI:
That's a good question.

00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:33.380
So what I do, first, I just let
them pick their own partners,

00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:33.950
by the way.

00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:36.970
Some teachers tell
you who to be with you

00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:39.040
and then they don't
want to do that.

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:43.750
So you pick your partners
and you have your project.

00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:46.080
And then I come around
usually, and I'm like,

00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:48.530
so what did you
guys decide to do?

00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:52.450
And can you explain to me
why is this a good idea?

00:51:52.450 --> 00:51:56.410
I don't just leave them in
the infrastructure is there.

00:51:56.410 --> 00:52:00.820
It's just that I give
them more responsibility.

00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:03.720
JAMIE CASAP: And you let them
make decisions as well, right?

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:05.290
You and I have
talked about, there's

00:52:05.290 --> 00:52:08.220
been controversial articles
that the students wanted

00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:10.170
to write about and
you guide them,

00:52:10.170 --> 00:52:13.030
but you don't tell
them what to do

00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:14.620
or how to position something.

00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:16.280
You give them the
framework to do that.

00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:17.380
ESTHER WOJCICKI: 100%.

00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:20.280
If they'd be here, they
would tell you themselves

00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:23.800
that they feel so
empowered that they tell me

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:26.846
they are in charge of the
whole class, everything.

00:52:26.846 --> 00:52:27.970
Because they feel that way.

00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:30.640
But in fact, I meet
with them all the time

00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:32.350
and give them suggestions.

00:52:32.350 --> 00:52:35.920
So every day after school or
maybe at lunchtime or something

00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:37.170
like that, email.

00:52:39.730 --> 00:52:43.220
But I'm not the parent, see,
so they're not threatened by--

00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:45.830
and also I make
them as suggestions.

00:52:45.830 --> 00:52:48.420
I don't say you have to do this.

00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:51.040
I mean that is really the key.

00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:53.490
And so with groups
here at Google,

00:52:53.490 --> 00:52:55.680
I would go around and
talk to them often.

00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:59.679
I mean one thing that's great
about Google, great people.

00:52:59.679 --> 00:53:01.970
I mean I don't think I've
met a single person at Google

00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:03.250
that I wasn't impressed with.

00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:07.040
You guys are all amazing.

00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:08.830
So I'm sure that--

00:53:08.830 --> 00:53:10.570
JAMIE CASAP: We're doing OK?

00:53:10.570 --> 00:53:13.346
ESTHER WOJCICKI: Yeah, you seem
to be doing just fantastically.

00:53:13.346 --> 00:53:15.470
JAMIE CASAP: We're going
to wrap it up in a minute,

00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:17.386
so think about how you
want to close this out.

00:53:17.386 --> 00:53:21.227
One, we got- oh no, I'm talking
about the guy behind you.

00:53:21.227 --> 00:53:23.310
AUDIENCE: At least I'll
be quick with my question.

00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:24.760
Could you comment
on if there are

00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:26.926
other parts of the world,
that are already embracing

00:53:26.926 --> 00:53:28.020
this type of learning?

00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:29.760
And second, about
higher education,

00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:31.500
is this applicable to that also?

00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:34.140
ESTHER WOJCICKI: Oh, my
god, higher education, they

00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:35.362
should be doing this now.

00:53:35.362 --> 00:53:36.820
JAMIE CASAP: We
failed on that one.

00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:40.430
ESTHER WOJCICKI: Oh my
god I'm targeting K-12.

00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:44.260
But universities, I mean why
aren't they doing this now?

00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:46.070
Actually, Stanford
is working on it.

00:53:46.070 --> 00:53:48.360
I've been working with
some people at Stanford.

00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:51.530
But all universities
should be doing this.

00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:52.660
It's hard to believe.

00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:53.370
JAMIE CASAP: Any other
parts of the world?

00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:54.890
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:57.960
ESTHER WOJCICKI: So
Mexico, they ordered

00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:59.670
hundreds of these books.

00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:03.810
So I'm meeting with the
Mexican Education Minister

00:54:03.810 --> 00:54:07.120
in the end of April.

00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:10.427
And they want to
translate it to Spanish,

00:54:10.427 --> 00:54:11.510
which I think is terrific.

00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:13.840
But right now, they're
ordering them all in English.

00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:16.542
And I hope all those
teachers can read then.

00:54:16.542 --> 00:54:18.000
JAMIE CASAP: And
also, I don't know

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.400
where the person who
asked the question is.

00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:24.360
In some cases, you look at a
country like India for example,

00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:25.590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:25.590 --> 00:54:27.650
JAMIE CASAP: Even if they had
all the resources in the world

00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:29.400
to build all the schools
that they wanted,

00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:32.310
they'd still be short
anywhere between 500,000

00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:35.000
700,000 teachers that they
need to fill those classroom.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.870
So in some cases, they have
to come up with some new model

00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:41.710
to teach because the one
to 30 model isn't going

00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:43.242
to work in a place like that.

00:54:43.242 --> 00:54:44.700
ESTHER WOJCICKI:
So also actually I

00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:45.850
should just tell
you other countries

00:54:45.850 --> 00:54:46.808
that have come through.

00:54:46.808 --> 00:54:49.130
So Indonesia was just visiting.

00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:52.560
France, there have been a
lot of people from France.

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:55.100
Switzerland is interested.

00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:56.960
I'm going to be
the keynote speaker

00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:59.460
at some digital
conference in Zurich.

00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:02.370
Germany, there is
a lot of interest.

00:55:02.370 --> 00:55:05.260
And so all over
the world there's

00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:08.620
a lot of interest in all
of this that's going on.

00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:10.150
And people are trying to do it.

00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:12.160
I think they might
have harder times

00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:16.360
in some places of the world than
here, because the education is

00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:18.990
more rigid than it is here.

00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:20.970
And I've also been
invited to Korea

00:55:20.970 --> 00:55:22.875
and I think that would
be really interesting.

00:55:22.875 --> 00:55:23.630
JAMIE CASAP: That's an
interesting experience.

00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:24.630
ESTHER WOJCICKI: Oh, my god.

00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:25.270
Everybody studies.

00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:26.980
JAMIE CASAP: Everything in my
body tells me not to do this,

00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:27.940
but go ahead, James.

00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:29.529
You get the last question.

00:55:29.529 --> 00:55:30.820
AUDIENCE: A fun final question.

00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:33.990
If Susan, Janet and Anne
were going to school today,

00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:37.300
how would you approach parenting
any differently than you did

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:38.550
back when they went to school?

00:55:38.550 --> 00:55:42.430
ESTHER WOJCICKI: My god, what
a bonus question that one is.

00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:44.190
What would I do?

00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:45.690
JAMIE CASAP: You're
supposed to say,

00:55:45.690 --> 00:55:46.640
I wouldn't do
anything different.

00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:47.824
I did everything perfectly.

00:55:47.824 --> 00:55:48.740
ESTHER WOJCICKI: Yeah.

00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:50.080
I'm not sure.

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:53.030
I'm not sure about that.

00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:56.590
So a lot of people ask me,
would I control their time

00:55:56.590 --> 00:55:59.645
with technology?

00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:05.580
I think I probably
would do some control.

00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:09.960
And I would control what they
are doing online, as opposed

00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:12.580
to, I wouldn't let them
just do anything online.

00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:15.000
I would do that.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.760
People also ask me what did I
do to make them so independent?

00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:20.650
Boy they are really independent.

00:56:20.650 --> 00:56:23.610
And I think the main thing
I did is, I didn't have

00:56:23.610 --> 00:56:25.230
any help when they were small.

00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:27.970
It was just like me
and the three kids.

00:56:27.970 --> 00:56:32.490
And my husband is a high energy
physicist, professor of physics

00:56:32.490 --> 00:56:36.290
and his main interest
in life is particles.

00:56:36.290 --> 00:56:38.730
And so he spent a lot of
time thinking about those.

00:56:42.610 --> 00:56:45.320
And so, I was like, oh, my
god, what am I going to do?

00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:47.950
So what I did is
like, OK, you guys,

00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:50.200
you can walk in you
can talk a little,

00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:52.380
you're going to be on the team.

00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:54.990
You're going to be doing
a lot of stuff early.

00:56:54.990 --> 00:56:56.680
And so, that's exactly right.

00:56:56.680 --> 00:57:00.670
They all had responsibilities,
a lot of them, early.

00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:02.410
And I think that
made a difference.

00:57:02.410 --> 00:57:04.860
Poor Susan was responsible
for taking care of Janet

00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:06.520
when she was two.

00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:09.020
Wasn't really, I mean I didn't
leave her alone in the house,

00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:10.765
but you know, she
had to entertain her.

00:57:10.765 --> 00:57:11.765
JAMIE CASAP: Had a role.

00:57:11.765 --> 00:57:13.770
ESTHER WOJCICKI: She had a role.

00:57:13.770 --> 00:57:17.655
And that continued
all through school.

00:57:17.655 --> 00:57:19.780
JAMIE CASAP: Well,
unfortunately we're out of time.

00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:22.079
So hopefully we can give
Esther a round of applause.

00:57:22.079 --> 00:57:24.120
Thank you very much for
coming and talking to us.

00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:28.070
