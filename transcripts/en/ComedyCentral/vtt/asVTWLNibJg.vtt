Snapchat Guru Molly...

(tires screeching)

00:00:04.204 --> 00:00:05.038
Hawkey, here!

00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:06.238
I love myself a lot,

00:00:06.238 --> 00:00:07.373
even in the face of
crippling self-doubt,

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:08.707
and a bitch mother.

00:00:08.707 --> 00:00:10.243
To prove how much I love myself,

00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:13.079
I'm gonna hit up my favorite
date night restaurant alone.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:15.080 align:start size:97% position:3%
Because when you're
comfortable in your own skin,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.783
you can be comfortable anywhere.

00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:18.184
Let's go!

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:19.018
- How many?

00:00:19.018 --> 00:00:20.419
- Table for one.

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:22.222
Oh, no, you can leave those.

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:23.789
(both chuckling)

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.257
- Uh, may I get you
something to drink?

00:00:25.257 --> 00:00:27.526
- Oh, yes, your best house red.

00:00:27.526 --> 00:00:29.362
Oh, make that two!

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:32.532
(French dinner music)

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:34.601
Oh, thank god.

00:00:35.635 --> 00:00:37.904
Somebody's meeting me here.

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:40.706
(coughing)

00:00:40.706 --> 00:00:41.908
I've got bread throat.

00:00:41.908 --> 00:00:42.942
Bread throat!

00:00:44.143 --> 00:00:46.979 line:0%
Hey guys, well, I'm
having the best time.

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:48.948
My food just got here,

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:52.151
and lucky me, I get to eat it
with my best friend, myself.

00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:53.419
(gasps)

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:55.387
Oh my god, it's my
ex-boyfriend, Paolo.

00:00:55.387 --> 00:00:56.722
Are you kidding me right now?

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:57.923
(slams phone down)

00:00:57.923 --> 00:00:58.924
- Molly?

00:00:58.924 --> 00:00:59.926
- Oh, Paolo!

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.094
(laughing uncomfortably)

00:01:02.094 --> 00:01:04.096
What is up, my brother?

00:01:04.096 --> 00:01:05.597
- I'm just grabbing a bite to
eat with my friend, Deanna.

00:01:05.597 --> 00:01:07.600
- Oh, wow, that's fun for her!

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.134
- Yeah, it's so
healthy of you to

00:01:09.134 --> 00:01:10.602
come to our special place alone.

00:01:10.602 --> 00:01:11.804 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'm really proud of you.
- Me?

00:01:11.804 --> 00:01:14.240
Oh, no, you're hilarious.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.275
You just missed my
boyfriend, Gupta.

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:19.278
He's a doctor, so he was paged.

00:01:19.278 --> 00:01:21.581 align:start size:84% position:16%
By Olivia Munn,
who is his patient!

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:23.349
Her back is F'd, you know?

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:25.284 align:start size:84% position:16%
Anyway, I love him,
Olivia Munn loves him,

00:01:25.284 --> 00:01:26.785
so everything's great.

00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:28.588
Everything's really, really
great with me right now,

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:29.923
at this time of my life.

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:31.624 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Okay, well, it's
really good to see you.

00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:32.458
- [Molly] You too.

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:34.627
Well, that went drunk.

00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:35.861
Great, it went great.

00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:37.196
I'm drunk, though.

00:01:37.196 --> 00:01:40.032
(wheezing)

00:01:40.032 --> 00:01:41.300
Oh, you should have seen how

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.803
comfortable I was
in my own skin.

(gagging)

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:49.375 line:0%
Too spicy!
