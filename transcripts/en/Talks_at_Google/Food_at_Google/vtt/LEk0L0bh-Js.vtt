00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.540
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Hi everyone. I just want to welcome
Nathan here. A really pleasure to have him.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.230
The cookbooks are the most amazing cookbooks.
I don't even know whether to call them cookbooks

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.690
that I've ever seen in my entire life. So
Nathan, can I first start out by saying do

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:14.740
we call these cookbooks?

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.170
&gt;&gt;Nathan: I call it--

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.170
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Come on over here.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.390
&gt;&gt;Nathan: Yes. I call it a cookbook.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.390
&gt;&gt;Jeff: OK.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.960
&gt;&gt;Nathan: Now, it's in six volumes, admittedly.
But it started off in my mind as being one

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.260
volume. So I think of it as a cookbook.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.480
&gt;&gt;Jeff: OK, so cookbook's all right. Well,
you got a little presentation.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.480
&gt;&gt;Nathan: OK.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.480
&gt;&gt;Jeff: I'll talk to you after that.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.480
&gt;&gt;Nathan: Cool.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.480
&gt;&gt;Jeff: And you're welcome.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.020
&gt;&gt;Nathan: OK, well thanks. So I just wanted
to tell you a little bit about the book. There's

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:47.670
some fun facts we have on it. Six volumes,
2,438 pages, 1.1 million words. If you put

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.750
those in a single line of text, it will be
seven and a half miles long. It's not clear

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.640
why you'd want to do that, but we thought
it was a cool statistic.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.230
We took 150,000 pictures and 3,200 of them
were good enough for the book. That's actually

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:10.000
a good ratio, believe it or not. 1,522 recipes,
72 chefs from around the world gave us recipes

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.280
to use in the book. We had six research cooks,
full-time, for three years. Forty-four writers,

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.369
editors, and art staff altogether.

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.790
Forty pounds, and my favorite statistic, four
pounds of ink. When you get a book made, the

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.350
printers make a blank book. And so I said,
"Well, gee, how close is this to the real

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.030
book?" And they said, "Well, it'll be about
a half-inch thicker and four pounds heavier."

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.529
And I said, "Why?" They said, "The ink." I
said, "You're kidding me."

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:41.369
And they said, "Well, actually if you think
about it, a full page photo is about a thousandth

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.289
of an inch of ink on it. Most of our pages
have photos. A thousandth of an inch times

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:56.959
2,400." It's a thick block ink. And one of
the questions that I always get, so I'll just

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:03.669
anticipate it here is, I'm a digital guy,
why am I talking about ink at all? Why don't

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:07.020
I have it as a digital thing?

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.890
And there's two reasons. The first reason
is we made a decision about what platform

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.100
to target about two years ago. And we figured
that's what it would take to do the first

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.830
version. And two years ago, there was no iPad.
There was only Kindle. And here's one of the

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.460
pictures of the book. The Kindle version is
just pathetic 'cause it's small and it's black-and-white,

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.500
and it's not made for images.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.840
The iPad version is better, but even so, you
would have to do amazing amounts of pan and

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.470
scan and lots of work to take these very large
beautiful photos that we've done and try to

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.190
adapt them for online. Eventually, we'll do
that. But to me, the reason to do it isn't

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.700
because I wanna make a cheap version, or a
more portable version.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.440
They both have some value. It's to make a
really cool version that uses interactivity

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.370
in lots of ways. Then, pretty much, it starts
being a software project and we'll get to

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.700
it, but after the print version. The other
reason we did it, frankly, is that today,

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:11.832
paper-based book is still the best way to
get this material out to the people that are

00:03:11.832 --> 00:03:12.832
interested in it.

00:03:12.832 --> 00:03:17.770
So we did a lot of work to make sure that
the quality was very high. You can see that

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.930
the industry standard is about 175 lines.
That's considered a very good half-tone screen

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.370
for color reproduction. A really good art
book has 200.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.240
But there's no reason to have those fixed
grids anymore if you have computers. So we

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.830
used something called stochastic screening.
Stocastic screening gives you just a ridiculously

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:43.110
better-looking photo with effectively the
same printing technology. We also made sure

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.980
we had great inks. So, industry standard inks
have lots of out of gamut colors.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.020
There's colors you can take a picture of with
a digital camera that you can't possibly reproduce

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.709
in the ink. So here, you see the difference
all the gray areas in watered colors that

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:02.690
don't reproduce. The reason we obsessed about
those things is that we think the presentation

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.930
is important.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.720
If you went to the French Laundry or Manresa
or some other great restaurant and they served

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.830
you on paper plates, plastic forks, the food
would be the same but the presentation would

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:20.650
suffer. So we wanted to make sure that all
of the book was at the same quality level.

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.939
So now I'm just gonna walk through a little
bit of what's in the book. Volume one is called

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:28.750
"History and Fundamentals," and that's what
it's about.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:35.370
It's mostly material you'd never find in a
classic cookbook. But part of our idea here

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:43.560
is there's a set of techniques and recipes
and methods and knowledge that the world had

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.020
developed over the course of the last 10,
20 years, which is very hard to learn. If

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.229
you wanted to learn the techniques in the
book, you'd have to work at a restaurant like

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:53.680
El Bulli in Spain.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.389
I was there last week. Or the Fat Duck, I
was actually there this week. Actually, no,

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:06.550
it was last week. Last week. Or, early last
week. So, you have to work there for a couple

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.330
years before you would see some of the techniques
and even then you wouldn't get all of them.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.550
Some of the techniques come from food science
labs.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:18.300
They come from all over the place. But I realized
that these techniques have been developed,

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.550
but there was no good place to learn them.
There was no good place they all came together.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.319
And besides the actual techniques and the
mechanics of doing the cooking, there's lots

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:31.189
of background information. What is the history
that motivates this?

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:37.590
What's the science behind it? So, we cover
all kinds of things in there going all the

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:43.289
way back, actually, from fire, all the way
up to the history of modern cooking. We cover

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:48.889
things like--well, we've got some slides--we
cover things like the physics of food, how

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:55.409
heat moves through food, so forth. Volume
Two is called "Techniques and Equipment."

00:05:55.409 --> 00:06:00.419
And so, it takes a different view of food.
It's about, as it says, techniques and equipment.

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:06.309
And it starts with about a 200-page chapter.
So, almost a whole book, that's about traditional

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:10.969
cooking. We go through every technique in
traditional cooking. We explain how it works,

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:14.339
what are the physical principles behind it.

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:19.669
'Cause a classic recipe tells you, "Do this.
Do this. Do this." And you get a result. And

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:25.250
if you don't care why, or you don't want do
why, that's enough. But it's hard. If you

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:30.900
want to deviate from that recipe insight as
to why you're doing the things, is really

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:31.900
important.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:37.370
So, the point of this volume is to say, "Here's
the insight behind how those techniques work,"

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:44.039
so you can understand it well enough that
you can go cook in your own way, or if you're

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:49.909
not into cooking, you can do it just because
you're curious about it. People ask me often,

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:54.341
"Who is this book for? Is it for professionals?
Is it for home cooks?" And I always say it's

00:06:54.341 --> 00:06:59.780
for people who are passionate about food,
who are also curious about it. If you're not

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:04.389
curious, then I don't have much of a proposition.
If you are, I think there's some cool stuff,

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:11.770
even if you don't cook. Volume Three is called
"Animals and Plants." It takes an ingredient-oriented

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:12.819
view of cooking.

00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:17.620
And, of course, the two most important ingredients
are plants and animals. So in this chapter,

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:23.300
we go through the structure of meat. We go
through why some cuts of meat are tough and

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.960
why some are not. We go through all of the
different aspects of plants and we have lots

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.939
of recipes and techniques for dealing with
those.

00:07:31.939 --> 00:07:36.699
Some of them are classic. But mostly, we stayed
away from the classic techniques, 'cause lots

00:07:36.699 --> 00:07:40.050
of books have that, and we focused on the
really new interesting ones that lets you

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.050
do stuff you couldn't any other way.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:47.909
I should say what I think "modernist cooking"
means. And we really view it as two things.

00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:53.449
One is a style of cooking that breaks some
of the traditional rules of cooking to let

00:07:53.449 --> 00:07:58.289
you do things you couldn't do any other way.
And the second is using brand new techniques

00:07:58.289 --> 00:08:02.149
that break those rules, even if you're achieving
a traditional outcome.

00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:09.539
So some of the food in the book is wild stuff,
like you'd find at some of these restaurants,

00:08:09.539 --> 00:08:15.729
like El Bulli in Spain that may not even look
like food or it looks like Klingon food. There's

00:08:15.729 --> 00:08:21.770
other things where the outcome is totally
traditional, either traditional Western food,

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:28.050
and we also have recipes in the book from
Chinese, Japanese, Indian, and other cuisines.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:32.130
So, it doesn't matter what the outcome is
so much as how you got there. And that's what

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:39.990
we focus on. Volume Four is called "Ingredients
and Preparations." Here, we look at ingredients,

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:46.880
but ingredients other than meat versus plants.
Ingredients like thickeners. A huge part of

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.390
traditional cooking is about how to make a
sauce thick, or how to give body to a soup.

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:55.372
There's some traditional ways to do that.
There's some modern ways. Gels are another

00:08:55.372 --> 00:09:01.540
topic we cover. Now, one kind of a gel is
cheese. Cheese is a protein gel made by coagulating

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:09.270
milk. Tofu is protein gel, made by coagulating
soy milk. So, we cover those. We cover gelatin,

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:13.520
but we also cover lots of brand new kinds
of gels because chefs have found ways to use

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.750
these gels in lots of interesting fashions.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:25.260
Finally, we cover coffee and wine but in a
somewhat irreverent way. Coffee is one of

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:32.090
the great beverages, but is really given short
shrift by most chefs. And I'm from Seattle

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:36.470
and in Seattle we obsess over coffee. One
of the things I say in the book is a Michelin

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:41.400
three-star restaurant is often serves coffee
that wouldn't be fit for a Seattle street

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.470
vendor.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:47.930
And it's really true. There's a set of people
who obsess about food and will go to any length

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:52.270
to get the ultimate food. There's another
set that obsess about the ultimate coffee.

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:56.210
And pretty much, they're two different sets
of guys. And so, the point of this chapter

00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:01.960
is bring them together. We also have a chapter
on wine that takes a science-oriented view

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.500
on wine, trying to demystify it.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:10.630
Wine is almost like a secular religion. There's
a whole ceremony associated with it. There's

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:15.650
this whole notion of connoisseurship. One
of the techniques we discuss in the book is

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:17.140
something we call "hyper decanting."

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:21.780
This is where you take a bottle of wine, particularly
a younger red wine, you should all try this

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:28.560
at home, you pour it into a blender and you
hit frappe and you frappe the hell out of

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:33.430
it for 30 seconds or so. Let it calm down.
Then, pour it in. It achieves what decanting

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:37.120
achieves, but way more so. Now there's two
reasons to do this.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:41.370
One, is for a younger red wine, it makes it
much more drinkable. And in most cases, in

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:46.960
a blind taste test, we preferred the hyper
decanted to ordinary decanting it right from

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:51.260
the bottle. But the other reason we do it
is it freaks wine people out so much.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.260
[laughter]

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:56.420
Oh, my God. You go and you pour this great
bottle of wine into the blender and hit the

00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:02.530
switch and they look at you like you're a
complete lunatic. But it works.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:05.170
[laughter]

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:11.500
So, Volume Five is the first volume in the
whole book that actually looks like a cookbook.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:18.120
We've got about 1,500 recipes in the book.
The "Plated-Dish Recipes" volume takes about

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:25.180
50 recipes and goes--49, I guess--and goes
in-depth in them to give not just the main

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:30.510
thing you're cooking, but the garnishes on
the plate and in most cases, the entire rest

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:31.690
of the meal.

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:37.600
So as an example, we went nuts on barbecue
'cause I love Southern barbecue. I actually

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:42.930
competed once in World Championship of Barbecue.
And we actually won. But not due to me. I

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:48.410
was like the lowest ranking guy on the team.
So we developed nine barbecue sauces for the

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:51.690
book. And then, we developed recipes for cornbread
and baked beans.

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:59.560
Essentially, an entire barbecue meal. And
that's one of those 50 things in here. Now,

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:06.050
one of the things that we thought was a huge
value to our book was the use of cool pictures

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:12.240
to both illustrate things you couldn't otherwise
show people, and to get people excited about

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.260
concepts that might seem a little dull and
boring.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:21.510
So this is from our section on canning. And
if you have an acidic vegetable, in this case,

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:25.870
pickled vegetables, you can do what's called
"boiling water canning." And this is our photo

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:31.630
for boiling water canning. We use this idea
of a cutaway throughout the book to try to

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:37.060
illustrate the magic view of what's happening
in your food while you cook it.

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:41.660
As you can see, we not only cut the pot in
half, we cut the jars in half, too, 'cause

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:51.770
what the hell. We have lots of photos in all
kinds of ways. This is a centrifuge jar. We

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:59.850
use a lot of interesting equipment in cooking.
A centrifuge subjects the liquid to a force

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:03.870
equivalent to about 40,000 times Earth's normal
gravity.

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:07.510
That causes things to separate out. In this
case, this is a sauce we made. This is actually

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:14.330
a Hungarian goulash. It separated into eight
layers by density. Now, you might say, "Why

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:18.380
do you want to do that?" I'm sure that there's
lots of reasons.

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:24.130
You can take all kinds of food products and
spin it in these centrifuges to achieve a

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:29.200
clear consomme, or some other thing like that
that you just couldn't get any other way.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:34.200
That also brings up a question. How much of
this can you do at home? I say out of 1,500

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.780
recipes, at least half are easy to do in the
home.

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:41.121
If you're willing to buy a little bit of equipment,
but nothing too exotic, just stuff you can

00:13:41.121 --> 00:13:46.870
get at Williams Sonoma, or some other mall
cooking store, it's maybe 75 percent of the

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:53.260
book. And the last 25, good luck because that's
when you need to get liquid nitrogen dewars.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:54.260
[laughter]

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:58.770
No, seriously. We have a whole section, "Cooking
with Liquid Nitrogen." It's fantastic. Unless

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:03.180
you make stuff super cold, without making
it wet. Whereas ice, of course, doesn't let

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:08.210
you do that. And that last 25 percent, you
can do at home.

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:15.820
I do it all at home. But it's gonna require
a little bit of effort. Here's something where

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:22.670
we're using a torch to sear things. This is
pomegranate seeds. Here's another one of our

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:33.140
cutaway photos. This is a traditional pot
roast in a Dutch oven. This is enzyme-peeled

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:37.960
grapefruit. It turns out, there's an enzyme
called Peelzym.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:45.520
And you can soak citrus in it and it only
attacks a special pectin molecule that's in

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:52.360
the outer thing. So you soak it in there and
it all pulls off. But it also makes it look

00:14:52.360 --> 00:15:02.180
cool. This is potato starch in a potato. The
purple things are the actual starch granules

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:10.041
and the blue lines are the cell walls of the
potato. Here's an example spread where we

00:15:10.041 --> 00:15:11.480
show what's going on.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:16.160
This is actually the first picture I took
for the book to see if this cutaway thing

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:22.170
would work. And it kind of did. This is steaming
broccoli. So all of the little text boxes

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:27.810
around the outside explain what's going on.
What's happening with the boiling? What's

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:35.390
happening with the condensation? How is it
heating? Up in the corner, there's a box that

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:39.140
describes the difference between boiling and
steaming.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:43.890
In theory, steaming ought to have much higher
heat transfer. In practice, it actually doesn't

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:48.529
for a bunch of reasons we explain in the text.
It's actually slightly slower to steam broccoli

00:15:48.529 --> 00:15:56.090
than it is to boil it. Here's our wok cutaway.
Now, we discovered why people don't cook with

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:57.090
half a wok, here.

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:58.980
[laughter]

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:03.840
This caught fire three times while we were
doing it, because there's actually no trick

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:08.779
to this. We were cooking with a wok that was
cut in half. Now, not exactly half. We cut

00:16:08.779 --> 00:16:13.810
about a third of it off, but the oil kept
going in the fire and it would catch fire.

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:18.670
But we had this great motto: It only has to
look good for a thousandth of a second.

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:19.670
[laughter]

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:23.380
And so, a lot of these photos, people say,
"Well, what's the trick? Aren't you using

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:28.560
Photoshop?" And well, every digital photographer
uses Photoshop, but mostly the trick is willingness

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:36.690
to make a mess. Here's that same picture now
where we can zoom in and see a bunch of the

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:39.730
different text things explaining it.

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:44.070
Here's our barbecue cutaway. So those coals
are just sitting there at the edge. That's

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:47.470
really cut in half and they kept falling off,
but again, it only has to look good for a

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:52.980
thousandth of a second. What we explain here
is all of the things that go on in grilling

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.980
hamburgers. And it turns out, there's lots
of interesting dynamics.

00:16:55.980 --> 00:17:02.490
Those drops of fat that fall are crucial because
those flare-ups produce most of the characteristic

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:07.030
grilled flavor. You get a different flavor
from grilling like this than if you broil

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:10.660
it from the top, even with the same amount
of heat. The reason is, from the top you don't

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:16.170
get those fat fires happening. This is how
you cut things in half.

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:23.339
This is our machine shop. My company has a
whole laboratory where we prototype inventions

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:28.731
that we come up with. And this is our shop.
And we decided to build our kitchen laboratory,

00:17:28.731 --> 00:17:32.600
where we made the book, right around the corner
from this. So whenever we wanted to cut something

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.180
in half, we come over here.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:40.130
Here is a short video. This is a wire EDM
machine. And we've got a pot coming in. Wire

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:46.559
EDM uses very high electrical current. It
makes tiny sparks. You can see them there.

00:17:46.559 --> 00:17:51.730
The whole thing happens underwater, believe
it or not. And those tiny sparks jumping off

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:56.130
this brass wire, actually will cut any kind
of a metal or conductive surface.

00:17:56.130 --> 00:18:01.920
So you come out and voila. We have cut the
pot in half. We had other machines we would

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:08.980
use to cut glass in half or all kinds of other
things. So, there's some of the things cut

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:13.810
in half. Actually, we have two halves of one
of the best kitchens in the world. They're

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:21.120
just not together anymore. You can see with
the one pot there, a technique we used to

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.771
keep stuff in, we glue a piece of Pyrex in
front of the pot.

00:18:24.771 --> 00:18:28.640
Now that gives you a little glue line, but
there, that's where Photoshop is handy 'cause

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.460
you can photograph the other side of the pot.
When you cut it in half, you get two halves.

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:37.880
So you photograph the edge in the same position
and then you can swap it in. It's a lot like

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:41.650
a Hollywood movie where a guy flies through
the air supported by a wire, and then they

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:47.230
digitally take the wire out.

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:52.380
Here's one of our nerdier parts of the book.
This is our chapter on heat and energy. So,

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:56.990
we have partial differential equations in
the cookbook. The cookbook has the strange

00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:01.809
distinction that I wrote thousands of lines
of code to write the cookbook, 'cause we used

00:19:01.809 --> 00:19:09.160
lots of computer simulations to understand
things like heat conductivity, like the diffusion

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.160
of a brine.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:14.960
If you brine a meat, that's also run by a
diffusion equation. So, tons of code were

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:24.760
written to write this book and here's some
of the equations. Here's another example of

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:30.630
things. Suppose you've got a barbecue. Well,
as you move away from the hot surface, the

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:35.520
heat falls down, right? And if you move far
enough away, there's hardly any heat at all.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:41.920
But what does that curve actually look like?
Well, we calculated it. Most of the heat is

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:46.610
not coming from hot air there. It's coming
from infrared rays and so, you can calculate

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:52.130
how much radiation is emitted. It's important
not only for how the heat varies as you move

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:56.140
vertically, but how even is the heat as you
move side to side.

00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:00.540
And that funny horn-shaped thing is what we
call the "sweet spot." That's the zone for

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:05.309
which the side to side heat variation isn't
more than about ten percent. So, if you want

00:20:05.309 --> 00:20:12.270
the best results, that's where you should
be grilling. Here's an example of a step-by-step

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:17.170
technique. This is one for making hamburger,
believe it or not.

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:22.720
One of the philosophies we had with the book
is that any dish that is worthy of a cook's

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:28.470
attention, is worthy of refinement. So we
set out to make the ultimate hamburger. Now,

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:32.210
our idea of the ultimate hamburger may not
be yours. And you might wanna just run to

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:34.960
the In-N-Out Burger and get something really
quick and that's perfectly fine.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:42.620
But if you care about a burger, you can lavish
as much care on a burger as you could on some

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:48.100
otherwise very fancy French dish that involves
foie gras and 50 ingredients. In this case,

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:53.580
the key is a technique in how you grind the
burger. 'Cause believe it or not, the alignment

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:55.270
of the grain matters.

00:20:55.270 --> 00:21:00.460
So what we're doing here is we're trying to
align the grain so that if you see the cut-in-half

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:05.980
burger, all of those tubes of meat that get
pushed out of the grinder, are all vertical.

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:10.530
And that means when you bite it, it crumbles
better.

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:14.650
And crumbling, or being very tender, is important
in the sandwich 'cause when you pull away,

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:18.170
you don't want to pull away and leave the
burger pulled out of the rest of it. It's

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:25.580
gotta all come down directly. So here's the
close-up of the technique of how you align

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:31.980
the grain. It's very simple. But once you've
tried it both ways, this way is better.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:37.600
Here's the actual burger. It's a wonder what
you can do when you suspend gravity. Here,

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:42.420
in the book, we actually cover the recipe
for everything that you see there. The bun,

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:50.560
the sauce, the lettuce is infused with smoke
because that gives you a cool smoky thing

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:55.460
while it stays crunchy. Not only do we show
you how to grind the burger, but what mix

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:57.390
of meats to use for the burger.

00:21:57.390 --> 00:22:02.830
And we even know of a cool technique for cooking
the burger that involves liquid nitrogen.

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:07.240
Our idea of an ultimate burger is that it's
perfectly medium rare, edge to edge, but really,

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:13.690
really crispy on the outside. So we do that
by cooking it sous vide, in an unsealed bag,

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:17.720
to a medium rare. Then we put it in liquid
nitrogen for about 45 seconds.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:23.870
Then we put it into a deep fryer. Now, the
deep fryer makes the outside super crispy.

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:29.050
The point of the liquid nitrogen is that it
freezes and chills enough of the burger that

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:33.720
it doesn't overheat the inside, so you don't
get these big bands of gray. Normally, if

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:41.150
you cook something under high heat, you get
a big band of gray and we wanted to avoid

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:42.390
that.

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:54.559
Come on, you can do it. So, here's a cool
thing. We got a video camera at the lab that--let's

00:22:54.559 --> 00:23:06.630
see, oops--so this video camera shoots HD
video at 62 6,200 frames per second. So I'm

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:15.090
gonna go back, actually, and show you the
other. Whoops. Whoops. Whoops. So the first

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:23.910
one's a water balloon. And the miracle of
this 

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:29.380
is no one's told the water it's time to fall
yet.

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:35.450
The balloon itself is under tension, so it
pulls away very quickly. But the inertia of

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:39.320
the mass, so it's a little bit like when Wile
E. Coyote would run off a cliff and he wouldn't

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:46.000
fall until he looks down. So then in our gels
chapter, I decided to give a recipe for ballistics

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000
gelatin.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000
[laughter]

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.620
'Cause people see it on "CSI," or you see
it on "MythBusters." So what the hell? Why

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:57.730
not have a recipe for ballistics gelatin?
Well, if you have a high-speed camera and

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:01.840
you have a block of ballistics gelatin lying
around, pretty soon someone says, "Hey, let's

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:02.840
shoot it."

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.580
[laughter]

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:10.780
This is popcorn, so watch really closely.
Popcorn illustrates a really important principle

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:16.740
about the physics of water, which is when
water boils to steam, it expands by about

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:24.059
a factor of 1,600. So that's what's happening
here. Right now, there's a little bit of steam

00:24:24.059 --> 00:24:27.420
issuing from a fissure in the bottom. You
can watch it expand.

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:32.940
It's trying to relieve the pressure, but ultimately
it can't and so it pops. Now this is something

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:36.640
that would be better in an electronic version
of the book. So we did shoot some video for

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:42.320
it, but the sequence of pictures still works.
If you wanna make an omelet, you gotta break

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:48.340
a few eggs. So we did. And, again, this is
the kind of thing that happens when you have

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:49.679
a high-speed camera.

00:24:49.679 --> 00:24:51.730
Pretty soon everything looks like it needs
shooting.

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:57.429
[laughter]

00:24:57.429 --> 00:25:04.160
So I've got almost infinitely more material,
but I thought at this point, Jeff and I will

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.890
talk a little bit and then we can take questions.

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:13.330
&gt;&gt;Jeff: So that was really cool. Thank you.
So one thing I was asking you before you got

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:17.570
started is why didn't you use a food stylist?
And I'd love to hear your answer on that 'cause

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:18.570
I thought it was so good.

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:22.770
&gt;&gt;Nathan: So, we had two philosophies on that.
The first is that part of cooking is presenting.

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:28.929
And if you--. We thought it was our jobs,
the jobs of the cooks and everybody else,

00:25:28.929 --> 00:25:36.120
to make the food the way we wanted to see
it. And so, if we went and did that, then

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:38.950
we did our job right. We should just be able
to take the picture.

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:42.750
We shouldn't have a stylist coming to tell
us how to fake the picture and all sorts of

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:48.100
other things. But the other reason is we didn't
want our pictures to look like everybody else's

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:49.100
pictures.

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:50.100
&gt;&gt;Jeff: You don't, really.

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:55.470
&gt;&gt;Nathan: And so, when we set out to do this,
I told one of the people we were interviewing

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:59.610
for art director, I said, "Look, I wanna show
people a view of food that they've never seen

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:04.170
before." And this person is like, "How many
cookbooks are there? How many magazines are

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:05.470
there? How can you do this?"

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:09.110
Well, we found a way to do it. I don't think
we would've found that way if we just had

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:11.600
a professional food stylist do what they do.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:16.640
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Yeah, 'cause I've never seen anything
like this. It's truly amazing. Another thing,

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:21.320
when we were talking before this, you said
that this actually started out as an outline

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.880
for a 400-page book, or something like that?

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:24.880
&gt;&gt;Nathan: Six hundred.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:25.880
&gt;&gt;Jeff: OK.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:28.420
&gt;&gt;Nathan: Yeah, so about five years ago, I
realized that there were all of these techniques

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:32.690
out there, but there was no good place to
learn it. And I realized that 'cause I was

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:37.620
learning it. And I'm like, well, damn it.
I wish there was one big definitive place

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:41.100
you could go. And in many fields, there's
a textbook like that.

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:46.220
The big definitive textbook and that's where
everybody learns. There wasn't something like

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:49.770
that here. I thought, "Well, OK. Well, maybe
I'll write it." And so I wrote an outline.

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:54.500
And my first outline from four and a half
years ago is almost the same as the book we

00:26:54.500 --> 00:27:00.679
wrote. But, the page budget was 600 pages.
So, we were terrible at estimating.

00:27:00.679 --> 00:27:03.580
But this is one of those things where once
we got in, there was no turning back.

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:08.090
&gt;&gt;Jeff: And so, I tried to get your book and
obviously, it's oversold. Do you have plans

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:10.309
on publishing more?

00:27:10.309 --> 00:27:17.450
&gt;&gt;Nathan: Sure. Well, I had somebody come
up to me at an event and they said, "Well,

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:20.910
you know I just love your book. It's fantastic,
but your publisher's a complete idiot." And

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:22.860
I said, "Well, actually, I'm publishing the
book."

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:25.370
[laughter]

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:30.690
And yeah, I am an idiot. And on a bunch of
things I always say, "Look, it's the first

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:36.300
2,400-page cookbook I've ever written." And
you know something, it's the first 2,400-page

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:37.840
cookbook the world's ever written.

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:43.571
So we tried to guess what the first printing
should be. And I wanted to print 6,000. Mark,

00:27:43.571 --> 00:27:51.050
over there, j'accuse. It's his fault. He wanted
5,000 and we compromised at 6,000.

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:52.050
[laughter]

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:59.740
And yeah, it shows how much pull I have, huh?
And we did all these spreadsheets of how much

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:05.760
would it cost to warehouse them for three
years just in case, and so forth. And we actually

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:09.710
had sold the 6,000 before they even shipped.

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:14.730
So the interest in the book turned out to
be way bigger than we thought. So we've ordered

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:15.730
25,000 more.

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:16.770
&gt;&gt;Jeff: And I told you to get more.

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:22.020
&gt;&gt;Nathan: Well, I put a thing on our blog
asking, just soliciting, lots of input and

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:25.260
say, "Hey, we're trying to decide how many
to print." And so, we had a lot of people

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:29.870
make suggestions and I decided on 25,000.

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:35.180
In about six weeks, I need to make a decision
on whether I add more for this year. And the

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:39.740
big unknown there is Christmas, 'cause Christmas,
of course, you sell a whole lot more than

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:45.429
before. But usually, the way people model
that is they model that on a baseline, where

00:28:45.429 --> 00:28:50.669
you say, "OK, if this is the baseline, I'll
sell about five times more during the month

00:28:50.669 --> 00:28:52.110
of December than I would baseline."

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:58.880
What's my baseline? Is my baseline the incredible
sales we've had now, or is there just 7,000

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:04.260
or actually, we're up to about 9,000, 9,000
lunatics that want the book and that's it?

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:05.370
And we won't sell another single one.

00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:06.370
&gt;&gt;Jeff: [inaudible]

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:11.370
&gt;&gt;Nathan: OK, well good. On the way here,
I was thinking, "Boy, this is a really dumb,

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:15.090
another one of these dumb publisher moves.
I'm coming to talk to a bunch of people who

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:19.030
get three excellent meals a day provided by
you, so why should they buy a cookbook?"

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:20.030
[laughter]

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:28.590
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Speaking of fabulous meals, you mentioned
that you've eaten at the Fat Duck and El Bulli.

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:33.820
What is your favorite restaurant? Do you have
one? What's your favorite meal? Do you have

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:35.080
a favorite meal?

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:42.700
&gt;&gt;Nathan: So, I like lots of different kinds
of food. And I don't have a single favorite

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:49.799
meal. The most interesting restaurant in the
world, by far in my view, is El Bulli in Spain.

00:29:49.799 --> 00:29:55.260
I love the Fat Duck, I love lots of other
things, but El Bulli changes its menu totally

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:58.010
every year. They're only open for six months
of the year.

00:29:58.010 --> 00:30:04.669
The other six months of the year, they are
doing R&amp;D to develop new recipes. The bad

00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:10.840
news is that it's closing in June for good.
So, that's why last week, I went.

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:11.940
&gt;&gt;Jeff: So, after--

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:17.770
&gt;&gt;Nathan: This, too bad. Our kitchen laboratory
popped up, there. If it pops up again, I'll--

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:22.790
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: I heard you performed
an experiment to understand barbecue stall

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:23.790
better.

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:24.790
&gt;&gt;Nathan: Yes.

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:26.710
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: I would like to
hear you expand a little bit. It sounds like

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:27.710
you cook one--

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:28.710
&gt;&gt;Nathan: Right.

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:31.880
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: in a sous vide
container and that that heated up significantly

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:32.880
faster.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:40.010
&gt;&gt;Nathan: OK. So let me give a little background.
So, if you Google "barbecue stall," S-T-A-L-L,

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:46.220
you'll get a few links that are about a stall
that sells barbecue, like at a state fair.

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:51.350
But if you say "barbecue stall temperature,"
you'll get literally thousands of hits, because

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:54.530
one of the great mysteries of barbecue is
called "the stall."

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:59.240
And here's what happens. You cook a brisket,
or a pork shoulder or whole hog, some big

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:03.151
piece of meat, and you watch the temperature.
And initially, you put it in and the temperature

00:31:03.151 --> 00:31:09.150
increases, increases, increases, then it stalls.
And it's way below the temperature of the

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:15.880
air in the barbecue. And it stays stalled
for hours, two hours, four hours, sometimes

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.880
even more.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:21.679
Then, it starts going back up again. So, what
the hell is the stall? And these thousands

00:31:21.679 --> 00:31:26.570
of pages on the 'net are all about people
trying to explain what the stall is about.

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:31.669
And the usual explanation is that what's happening
is the collagen in the meat is being converted

00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:36.240
into gelatin and that process is what makes
tough meat tender.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:42.130
It's also what makes stock that you cook for
a long time, like veal stock, unctuous and

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:47.789
rich. And it makes it gel up if you let it
get cold. Well, that process was surely happening,

00:31:47.789 --> 00:31:53.740
but I realized there was nowhere near enough
energy in that reaction, that it could take

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:57.120
all of that heat out. And so it had to be
something else.

00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:01.630
So, I realized there's only one thing that
it could possibly be and that's the evaporation

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:07.559
of water. That in fact, what you're doing
is you are drying out your big piece of meat

00:32:07.559 --> 00:32:11.080
and it's something called evaporative cooling.
The same reason you feel cool when you get

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:15.799
out of a pool, unless it's a 100 percent humidity
outside.

00:32:15.799 --> 00:32:20.309
So in fact, what was happening is that you
would go through a long period of drying.

00:32:20.309 --> 00:32:26.511
Then as soon as the outside was dry, then
the temperature could start going back up.

00:32:26.511 --> 00:32:33.260
So to prove that, we did an experiment where
we took one brisket, cut it in half. One of

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:36.970
them, we sealed in a plastic bag, just so
there would be no evaporation.

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:40.760
You could also seal it in aluminum foil. We
tried that, too, and it doesn't make any difference.

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:46.340
And so we put them both in there. We had temperature
probes stuck all over both of them. And we

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:51.870
put them into a convection oven. That let
us control the temperature better than a real

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:56.990
barbecue. We could have also done a barbecue,
but the same thing would happen.

00:32:56.990 --> 00:33:03.840
Sure enough, the one that was uncovered stalled
for about two and a half hours and then it

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:11.970
went back up. The one which was covered up,
no stall at all. And any collagen, anything

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:17.570
like that, would be in both of them. So, we
sort of, I think definitively, showed that.

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:21.059
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: Was there more
humidity in the oven when you cooked the one

00:33:21.059 --> 00:33:22.059
that was uncovered?

00:33:22.059 --> 00:33:26.910
&gt;&gt;Nathan: So we also had a thermometer in
the oven, and what's called a wet-bulb thermometer.

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:32.230
So this measures the actual humidity. So what
happens is the humidity of the oven initially

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:37.750
goes up, then over a period of time the humidity
goes down because there's some air venting

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:39.250
out of the oven.

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:44.419
So, this is all about rates. You're gonna
evaporate from a certain rate in the meat

00:33:44.419 --> 00:33:48.860
until you get such a dry crust on the meat
that you can't evaporate at that same rate

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:52.070
anymore. Meanwhile, you have another rate,
which is the rate at which water is coming

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:56.170
out of the oven. Now one of the really funny
things about this is when you're in the middle

00:33:56.170 --> 00:34:00.610
of the stall, the traditional wisdom is slather
more sauce on.

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:05.990
But this is like trying to heat something
while you run a garden hose on it. OK? The

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:10.070
more sauce you put on, the more there is for
evaporation. So instead of stalling for two

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:13.050
hours, you can make it stall for as long as
you want it if you just kept pouring water

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:14.050
on it.

00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:16.490
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: So the take-away
I was looking for is, I use dry rub--

00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:17.490
&gt;&gt;Nathan: Yup.

00:34:17.490 --> 00:34:19.930
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: instead of sauce
when I'm cooking. Is that compatible with

00:34:19.930 --> 00:34:22.060
keeping it inside of plastic?

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:23.060
&gt;&gt;Nathan: Sure.

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.060
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: OK.

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:27.281
&gt;&gt;Nathan: Sure, but the other thing is, you
have to--. There's different things you want

00:34:27.281 --> 00:34:31.520
to achieve at different parts of cooking the
barbecue. So, our high-tech approach to barbecue

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:35.550
is we smoke. We typically put a dry rub on.

00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:40.369
Then we smoke at very low temperature. Then
we cook it sous vide. And then at the end,

00:34:40.369 --> 00:34:45.359
we'll either smoke it again to create a bark,
or crust, on the outside, or our best technique

00:34:45.359 --> 00:34:52.419
is again, liquid nitrogen and a deep fryer.
So you haven't lived until you've had liquid

00:34:52.419 --> 00:34:53.419
nitrogen, deep-fried spareribs.

00:34:53.419 --> 00:34:55.360
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Our cooks, they're just totally wondering
how we're gonna do this and how we're gonna

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.470
bring in liquid nitrogen. So one thing after
Microsoft--

00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:57.470
&gt;&gt;Nathan: Yeah.

00:34:57.470 --> 00:35:05.280
&gt;&gt;Jeff: why did you get interested in cooking
and how did you learn all this?

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.810
&gt;&gt;Nathan: So, I was interested in cooking
my whole life.

00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:08.810
&gt;&gt;Jeff: OK.

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:12.840
&gt;&gt;Nathan: When I was nine, I told my mother
I was gonna cook Thanksgiving dinner and she

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:16.840
let me. I went to the library. I got this
whole stack of books out and, by God, I cooked

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.340
Thanksgiving dinner. All by myself.

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:19.760
[laughter]

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.680
By today's standards, not so much. For a nine
year old, I think--.

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.580
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Yeah, that's pretty ambitious, I gotta
tell ya.

00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:30.599
&gt;&gt;Nathan: Well, but I'm pretty ambitious.
So after that, I was a very enthusiastic self-taught

00:35:30.599 --> 00:35:35.730
chef for many years. Finally, while I was
working at Microsoft, I decided to go to chef's

00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:39.690
school in France. So I went to Bill Gates
and I asked him if I could have a leave of

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:45.040
absence to go to chef's school. This is the
first such, and only, request he's ever gotten.

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:47.480
&gt;&gt;Jeff: What did he say? I'm just curious.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:50.930
&gt;&gt;Nathan: Well, I had enough leverage. I got
it.

00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:51.930
[laughter]

00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:56.720
But then, in order to go to the chef's school,
they wouldn't take me unless I had work experience.

00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:00.570
So I worked for one night a week at a French
restaurant in Seattle called Rover's.

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:01.570
&gt;&gt;Jeff: OK.

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:06.550
&gt;&gt;Nathan: And a very traditional French chef
ran the place. And I'd go at about noon and

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:11.400
cook all the way through the end of service
and go home. I learned a tremendous amount

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:18.080
there. In fact, when I eventually went to
chef's school, this one morning we had the

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:23.940
assignment of boning ducks. And I'd boned
a lot of ducks at this restaurant.

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:26.530
Not an admission I'd make most places, but
I boned a lot of ducks.

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:27.530
[laughter]

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:33.730
So, this morning the assignment is to do this.
And so I got out there and I start working

00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:37.830
away on the ducks. And the chef was teaching
this in French, comes out, "You, you there.

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:40.530
Where did you learn this? You know a duck
like a Frenchman."

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:41.530
[laughter]

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:44.170
&gt;&gt;Jeff: I figure that was a compliment.

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:49.610
&gt;&gt;Nathan: Yes, exactly. I figured that was
a good thing. So then, I was also always interested

00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:56.220
in technology and science. I never became
a chef professionally. And there's probably

00:36:56.220 --> 00:37:01.260
a parallel universe where I did, but instead,
I became a physicist, actually.

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:06.800
I got a PhD in Physics. I worked for Stephen
Hawking, but then took a leave of absence

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:10.950
for a summer to work on a software project.
And we started a company. And then after a

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:15.099
couple years, Microsoft bought the company
and whatever. So then, finally when I retired

00:37:15.099 --> 00:37:18.790
from Microsoft, I started cooking a lot more.
I had a lot more time to cook.

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:22.210
And that's where I really started getting
into all of the real cutting-edge techniques.

00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:30.000
Well, what's the highest technology cooking
anyone's doing? And that led to all of this.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.840
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member: [inaudible].

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.310
&gt;&gt;Nathan: Oh yeah. There's--.

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:35.310
&gt;&gt;Jeff: There it goes. So real quick, I went
onto JB Prince before--

00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:36.310
&gt;&gt;Nathan: Yup.

00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:37.609
&gt;&gt;Jeff: you came in. I was looking for a centrifuge
and they don't have one on their website.

00:37:37.609 --> 00:37:38.650
Where can I get one?

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:40.600
&gt;&gt;Nathan: You can get a centrifuge at--

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:42.600
&gt;&gt;Jeff: I'm still looking for one.

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:48.310
&gt;&gt;Nathan: laboratory supply places. But they're
used in every hospital for spinning blood--

00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:49.450
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Right.

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:56.520
&gt;&gt;Nathan: including medical tests. So there's
actually a, there's probably three places

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:59.220
in the Bay area that are used centrifuge dealers--

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:00.260
&gt;&gt;Jeff: OK.

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:03.740
&gt;&gt;Nathan: where you can get a used, reconditioned
one. You can also buy them new.

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.550
&gt;&gt;Jeff: No, Dennis.

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:06.951
&gt;&gt;Nathan: They're really cool.

00:38:06.951 --> 00:38:10.790
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Yeah, we'd love to get one. So, it
looks like we have a lot of questions.

00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:11.790
&gt;&gt;Nathan: Yup.

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:14.650
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: Yeah, my question
would be what are the top three things that

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:19.970
everybody does wrong that the average home
cook could do just slightly differently and

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:21.050
make a big difference?

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:27.360
&gt;&gt;Nathan: Well, "wrong" is a tough thing.
But I'll give you a couple quick tips. I'm

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:31.340
not saying anyone's gonna cook wrong. But
the first one is, if you're making an omelet

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:36.950
or scrambled eggs, there's a tremendous trick
to heed. If you're making a three-egg omelet

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:39.190
or scrambled egg, throw one egg white away.

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:44.960
They're cheap. So, two whole eggs, one yolk.
Enormously improves the texture. There are

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:51.140
people who add butter or cream. You can also
do that. But you get much of the same improvement

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:57.180
and texture as butter or cream just by throwing
one white away. The second thing is, it's

00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:59.250
best if you cook it under extremely low heat.

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:04.370
So we cook it in a water bath, or we cook
it in a steam oven. And we cook it to exactly

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:10.550
71 Centigrade, 165 Fahrenheit. You can vary
that a little bit depending, for scrambled

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:16.300
eggs. A little bit hotter for an omelet. And
that lets you do--. Just those two simple

00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:22.150
things, temperature control and throwing one
egg white away, totally changes omelets. So,

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:23.840
not everything but it's one trick.

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:29.230
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #3: Hi. So, question
about coffee--

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:30.230
&gt;&gt;Nathan: Yeah.

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:32.540
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #3: being from Seattle,
of course. I'm sure you experimented with

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:37.800
making the ultimate cup of coffee. What kind
of high-tech things would you recommend applying?

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:46.600
&gt;&gt;Nathan: So, in the case of coffee, there's
a whole coffee community which largely started

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:50.530
in Seattle about 20 years ago and now has
broadened out. So there's lots of cool people

00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:55.040
around the world. There's a great guy in London
doing cool coffee work. There's a fantastic

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:58.410
guy in Norway doing cool coffee work.

00:39:58.410 --> 00:40:02.260
Some of these people I've met and a lot of
them I only know over the internet. But the

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:08.280
state-of-the-art coffee techniques are all
attention to detail things. I'd love to say

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:12.421
there's a magic machine, but mostly it's super
good temperature control in the machines.

00:40:12.421 --> 00:40:16.320
There's a machine called a Synesso, made in
Seattle, which is a fantastic espresso machine.

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:23.780
La Marzocco also has a pretty cool one. The
next interesting thing after good temperature

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:33.190
control, so that means using something called
a PID--a proportional integral differential

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:37.690
temperature controller--anyway, it controls
temperature perfectly. The next thing is something

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:42.080
called pressure profiling. And that's just
now happening.

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:46.440
There's only a few machines. There's probably
no really good machine on the market yet that

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:50.530
really, in a broad way, does pressure profiling.
What that allows you to do is to say the pressure

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:55.020
you make when you make espresso. That goes
over set of--. Now, that's for espresso. Then

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:59.540
there's a half a dozen other things that I
could go into about making the ideal espresso.

00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:05.130
For regular coffee, my favorite way to make
it is something called an AeroPress. And it's

00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:12.690
like a $29 piece of plastic that you buy on
Amazon. And you know those Super Soaker kinds

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:19.400
of--? Well, it's like a Super Soaker, but
you put it over your coffee cup and you heat

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:27.420
the water to exactly 175 degrees, medium grind,
but a drip grind, not an espresso grind.

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:35.460
And there's a few other things. You wait for
30 seconds and then you plunge it. It's fantastic.

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:38.350
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #3: Thank you.

00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:40.250
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: So I had a question
about the lab you set up--

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:41.250
&gt;&gt;Nathan: Yup.

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:42.250
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: and co-authors
for the books.

00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:43.250
&gt;&gt;Nathan: Yup.

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:44.770
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: So, could you go
into how you selected these folks in the Dream

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:47.400
Team? And what are they doing now that the
book is out?

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:56.930
&gt;&gt;Nathan: So, I realized if I hadn't written
software, I never would have written this

00:41:56.930 --> 00:42:04.130
book because most books are one person's singular
vision. And that's really what defines those

00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:09.220
books. And one person can write a piece of
software, but usually the best software isn't

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:13.560
written by a single person, 'cause a), there's
only so much a single person can do.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:18.660
Usually, a small team. A really big team has
a hard time equaling the productivity of a

00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:23.859
smaller team. And so, we always wanted like,
six to ten people. It was the ideal size software

00:42:23.859 --> 00:42:28.180
team in my view. But I also wasn't afraid
of having a team like that and even having

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:31.800
a larger team of people around it because
I wasn't afraid of that.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:38.349
As soon as I realized that this book--. Scale
was an important thing for the book. If I

00:42:38.349 --> 00:42:44.170
got all of these topics together in one place,
I could really achieve something because people

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:49.040
could learn it all in one place. But if you
only have half of them, you did a little something.

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:52.270
But people still have to scramble to find
the other half.

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:57.400
So I decided at some point, "Hey, this is
gonna be a team project." So I hired a guy

00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:01.431
who'd worked at the Fat Duck. It was this
fantastic restaurant in England. Now, he'd

00:43:01.431 --> 00:43:05.810
been a chemist in a graduate student at the
University of Washington prior to that. So,

00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:11.890
he also understood science a lot. I hired
an editor. Actually, even before I decided

00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:13.480
to do the book, from "Scientific American."

00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:18.340
I made him the editor-in-chief and then we
just picked people one at a time. All the

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:22.180
photos were taken by me and my assistant.
Although, my assistant wound up taking 90

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:30.080
percent of them. And he was a guy who answered
a Craigslist ad for being my Photoshop guy.

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:33.920
Initially, I thought I only really needed
an assistant to help me with the lights and

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:36.040
to do the Photoshopping.

00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:42.440
And this guy had just come out of an art school.
He'd just finished his photography thing,

00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:48.080
so not deep experience. But thank God not
deep experience because it allowed us to develop

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:53.520
a style that was really different and unique,
which is what you see in all these pictures.

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:56.380
And what they're doing right now is most of
them still work for me.

00:43:56.380 --> 00:44:01.480
I mean, some of them are freelance. They were
graphic artists and would do this picture

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:05.490
or that picture. But most of them still work
for me and we're working on promoting the

00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:08.440
book and figuring out what we do next.

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:14.220
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #5: Hi. Thanks for
a great talk. I noticed that your tag line

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:19.990
is "a revolution in the art of cooking," and
I think it's patently obvious to everyone

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:24.180
that you've really advanced to science of
cooking in bringing all this together. How

00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:28.050
does it change the art? Obviously there's
some art in these pictures. But what do you

00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:29.050
think about that?

00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:36.980
&gt;&gt;Nathan: OK. Well, there's two answers to
that. The first is engineering underlies art.

00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:42.060
There are a bunch of masterpieces that Leonardo
da Vinci created that are lost because he

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:47.170
tried a brand new technique for the paint
and the damn paint fell off the wall.

00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:53.270
So, empowering chefs by giving them new techniques--and
there's the kitchen again--it's in a space

00:44:53.270 --> 00:45:00.609
that used to be a Harley-Davidson dealership
and service center. And then they moved. And

00:45:00.609 --> 00:45:05.109
we still get these guys that look like they
came out of a ZZ Top video coming up and saying,

00:45:05.109 --> 00:45:08.849
"Well, where do I get my Hog serviced?" I
say, "Well, they moved down the street."

00:45:08.849 --> 00:45:14.010
So, we took it and turned it into this. To
answer your question, the rest of your question,

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:21.020
part of the art comes in enabling art through
science and engineering. Part of it is we

00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:26.070
take a lot of effort in the book to discuss
cooking as art. And one of the reasons we

00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:31.880
call it "Modernist Cuisine" is we draw a lot
of parallels between modernism, which was

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:40.310
this idea that changed art and architecture
and literature, philosophy in the 19th and

00:45:40.310 --> 00:45:41.550
the 20th centuries.

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:47.560
Cooking never got its modernist period, I
argue, until now. And so, we think that in

00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:54.870
fact, this is about art. And I'd love to point
out that cooking is an art. Art is about engaging

00:45:54.870 --> 00:46:01.671
us through our emotions. And the analogy I
like best is actually to architecture because

00:46:01.671 --> 00:46:06.280
architecture is necessary. Painting and sculpture
are not quite as necessary, but you need a

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:07.670
roof over your head.

00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:13.810
And so, most buildings in the world are pretty
dull. They're warehouses and they're truly

00:46:13.810 --> 00:46:19.380
dull buildings, but they're necessary. Most
meals in the world are the same way. They're

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:26.530
not art. They're necessary because we need
food as fuel for our bodies. But in both food

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:32.859
and architecture, you can create amazing artistic
things that grab your emotions and thrill

00:46:32.859 --> 00:46:35.270
people in a way like nothing else can. So.

00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:37.780
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #5: Thanks.

00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:43.700
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #6: I was curious if
you went off at all on the tangent of nutrition,

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:44.700
so that you can talk a little bit about--

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:51.010
&gt;&gt;Nathan: Oh, we went off on so many tangents
in this book it's ridiculous. So, one of the

00:46:51.010 --> 00:46:58.960
things--. That's sea urchin on cocoa noodles.
So in our thing on heat and energy, everybody

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:05.369
knows that their various electrical appliances
draw watts. Well we put a little biography

00:47:05.369 --> 00:47:10.030
of James Watt in to explain why those things
are called watts.

00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:15.490
We have a whole chapter called "Food and Health,"
which covers nutrition, sort of. I don't mean

00:47:15.490 --> 00:47:20.660
we comprehensively cover nutrition. But we
decided to tackle a very controversial issue,

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:24.460
which is what food is good for you and what
food is not good for you. Because there's

00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:29.180
a tremendous amount of popular information
about this, this is often ascribed to medical

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:30.180
science.

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:35.760
But the actual truth of those things which
are really well-proven and those things which

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:42.010
currently there's still significant uncertainty,
that's not communicated very well. So we have

00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:47.410
a whole chapter about that and that includes
how to read, if you see a press release that

00:47:47.410 --> 00:47:50.760
say there's a risk factor is increased for
this by doing--.

00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:55.980
What does that really mean? What does a 95
percent confidence interval mean on one of

00:47:55.980 --> 00:48:00.820
those studies? So, one example is some of
the things people say are bad for you, really

00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:07.650
do seem to be bad for you. Trans fats really
do seem to be bad for you. Saturated fat in

00:48:07.650 --> 00:48:11.590
butter, actually there's very little proof.
In fact, some people would say there's no

00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:14.260
proof at all that it's bad for you.

00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:18.870
We give a tragic example in the book. There's
this study called the Nurses Study that followed

00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:25.020
the health of 86,000 nurses for 25 years.
One sub-group were the margarine eaters. And

00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:30.130
in the era, which is mostly the 1970s and
'80s, in this era, they were eating margarine

00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:32.160
because they thought it was good for you.

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:35.670
It was polyunsaturated. Then they had another
group that said, damn it, they're gonna eat

00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:43.140
butter. The margarine eaters have four times
the death rate of the butter eaters. Because

00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:47.510
in that era, although it was very well meaning
to think polyunsaturated must be better for

00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:50.010
you than saturated, there was no proof.

00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:53.380
And the way they got the polyunsaturated was
the cheapest way, which was to make trans

00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:57.920
fats. And so, this is one of these things
where a little knowledge actually can be dangerous.

00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:58.920
Yup.

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:05.712
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #7: Hello. Thank you
for your presentation. I'm a fellow physicist

00:49:05.712 --> 00:49:07.470
and you talk a lot about temperature control.

00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:08.470
&gt;&gt;Nathan: Yup.

00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:11.820
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #7: I would like it
if you could expand a little bit on the spectrum

00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:17.970
of actually the heat-producing elements in
barbecues, or kitchens, because what I don't

00:49:17.970 --> 00:49:24.470
understand when I came to the U.S. and I saw
people grilling on a flame, how does that

00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:28.150
change the spectrum? And are there benefits
to doing that?

00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:36.150
&gt;&gt;Nathan: OK. So, the simple answer to that
is no. But here's the thing. Most traditional

00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:41.630
approaches to cooking start with a very high
heat source. Originally, that was a fire.

00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:46.990
But you never want to cook the food as hot
as the fire is.

00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:52.660
OK, it would burn. The other thing is most
food is mostly water. And as a result, you

00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:56.250
can't actually make the food hotter than the
boiling point of water until you've dried

00:49:56.250 --> 00:50:02.849
out the outside at least. So a typical cooking
technique says, "I have this super high heat

00:50:02.849 --> 00:50:08.940
and then I cook with it by timing, very carefully,
how long I put it in that high heat and how

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:10.810
long I take it off."

00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:14.620
That's true whether you're cooking in a pot,
you're cooking on a grill, you're cooking

00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:21.870
on other things. The more modern approach,
which we describe in the book, just says,

00:50:21.870 --> 00:50:27.160
"No, screw it. You should cook with low temperature."
So, if you want to cook meat medium rare,

00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:31.210
that means you wanna make the meat about 130
Fahrenheit.

00:50:31.210 --> 00:50:37.691
So, the way we do that, we cook at about 132
Fahrenheit. So we use a very low temperature

00:50:37.691 --> 00:50:43.151
source. Low temperature steam or water in
a water bath. It takes longer for the heat

00:50:43.151 --> 00:50:48.320
to soak in, but never can overcook it. If
you forget it an hour, it doesn't matter.

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:49.900
If you're a little bit early, it doesn't matter
either.

00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:54.060
You're only off by a fraction of a degree.
So that's a very fundamental thing. Now, you

00:50:54.060 --> 00:51:00.200
ask about grilling. Grilling is cooking with
infrared rays. Those infrared rays mostly

00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:06.369
come over other hot things. And simply a gas
flame is a poor way to do it. That's why most

00:51:06.369 --> 00:51:10.410
good gas grills have a metal plate in there
that the flame goes on.

00:51:10.410 --> 00:51:18.160
And it's the heat from that plate that is
going on to your food. In the case of barbecue

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:23.520
coals, what looks like fire around them is
actually little particles that are being heated

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:30.339
up incandescence. And the blueness of the
flame has nothing to do with the spectrum.

00:51:30.339 --> 00:51:33.740
There is a thing where the hotter something
gets, the bluer the color is.

00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:40.020
It's nowhere near hot enough to be blue. It's
a chemical bluingness that creates that. More

00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:42.980
answer maybe than you wanted, but there you
go.

00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:48.640
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Any other questions? All right. Nathan,
anything else you'd like to say?

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:50.595
&gt;&gt;Nathan: No, I think that pretty much covers
it.

00:51:50.595 --> 00:51:54.280
&gt;&gt;Jeff: All right. Well thanks so much for
coming. Love the cookbook.

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:57.800
