Hey guys, Amy with you on DNews today talking
about that most obnoxious of habits: gum chewing.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.310
Whether you were told a gum-tree would grow
in your tummy or that swallowed gum would

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.609
stick around for seven years, pretty much
everyone was told to never swallow gum…

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:27.609
But why?

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:28.609
What would happen if you did?

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.340
So let’s start with the obvious.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.370
When we chew food, it disintegrates - that’s
because we have an enzyme in our saliva that,

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.879
along with chewing, starts breaking down food.

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.309
Then we swallow it, and proteins and enzymes
in our stomach breaks the food down further

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.179
so all the necessary nutrients are ready to
be absorbed by our intestines.

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:49.079
What isn’t absorbed is excreted as waste
along with other by-products our body wants

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.079
to get rid of.

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.539
But gum doesn’t disintegrate no matter how
much we chew it and slobber on it… it just

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.819
doesn’t start going through the digestive
process in our mouths!

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:58.379
And this isn’t a new discovery.

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.460
Archaeologists have found tooth-marked lumps
of birch bark tar dating back to the Mesolithic

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.969
period of the Stone Age.

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.840
Ancient Greek women chewed mastic to clean
their teeth and freshen their breath; Native

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.110
Americans taught colonists they could quench
their thirst by chewing a resin from spruce

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.610
trees; and in the 19th century, people chewed
sweetened paraffin wax.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.829
Until the Second World War, the base of gum
was chicle, the latex sap from the sapodilla

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:21.829
trees.

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:26.229
Modern gum uses a synthetic or natural rubber
that mimics the properties chicle… it’s

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.360
rubber mixed with sweetener and flavours that
release into your mouth when you chew it…

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.700
appetizing, eh?

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.680
So swallowing gum comes down to swallowing
rubber, which just sounds like it'd be bad

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.680
for your body!

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.829
I mean, the FDA classifies gum as a "nonnutritive
masticatory substance”!

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.299
The bad part is that gum's base - that rubber
- is not digestible; our bodies can break

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.409
down some of the sugars that give gum its
sweetness and flavour but the wad of rubber

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.120
isn’t getting broken down.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.329
On the plus side, our bodies have other ways
of getting things out; our digest tract is

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:57.700
an active place.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.560
Muscle contractions that move food through
our bodies will help the gum wad along, and

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.310
it’ll eventually come out the other end.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.520
It’s sort of like the husks of corn seeds.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.930
Our bodies can’t digest them, but they don’t
just pile up in our stomachs.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.370
If you look closely, you’ll notice you pass
those husks in a few hours or couple of days,

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.120
depending on your own digestive system.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.430
But that doesn’t mean you should make a
habit of swallowing gum.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.820
Because it doesn’t get broken down, your
body is pushing a significant mass through

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.470
your system, and if you add to that mass you
could end up with an intestinal obstruction,

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.100
basically a blockage in the one tube that
processes everything.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.400
The immediate symptoms are stomach aches and
constipation, but left untreated an obstruction

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.790
can get much worse.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.800
But this is super rare.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.900
So swallowing that one piece of gum probably
isn’t going to kill you, but still, try

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.380
not to do it.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.800
And need something to do while chewing that
gum?

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.060
Why not binge on Sex Sent Me to the ER!

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.160

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.120
We once looked into whether or not gum is
better than flossing; you can find the answer

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.120
here.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.660
What weird gum myth have you heard?
