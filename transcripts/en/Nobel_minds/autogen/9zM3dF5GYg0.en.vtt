no I both had the they had the idea that

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810
no I both had the they had the idea that
 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.869
no I both had the they had the idea that
you know I should stay in a given

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879
you know I should stay in a given
 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.089
you know I should stay in a given
University only five years and I stayed

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099
University only five years and I stayed
 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.390
University only five years and I stayed
I mean after being in Europe I went to

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400
I mean after being in Europe I went to
 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.190
I mean after being in Europe I went to
illinois and was there for five years

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200
illinois and was there for five years
 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.140
illinois and was there for five years
and I went to Columbia was there for

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150
and I went to Columbia was there for
 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.540
and I went to Columbia was there for
five years then I was at Harvard for

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550
five years then I was at Harvard for
 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.269
five years then I was at Harvard for
five years then I actually moved to

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279
five years then I actually moved to
 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.029
five years then I actually moved to
Paris and my feeling was that it was

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039
Paris and my feeling was that it was
 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.759
Paris and my feeling was that it was
very good to get a new environment to

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769
very good to get a new environment to
 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.830
very good to get a new environment to
start new problems and completely

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840
start new problems and completely
 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.979
start new problems and completely
different problems like the first five

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989
different problems like the first five
 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.729
different problems like the first five
years at the University of Illinois you

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739
years at the University of Illinois you
 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.770
years at the University of Illinois you
I mentioned I developed this equation I

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780
I mentioned I developed this equation I
 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.080
I mentioned I developed this equation I
was focused on nuclear magnetic

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090
was focused on nuclear magnetic
 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.299
was focused on nuclear magnetic
resonance which was a new technique in

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309
resonance which was a new technique in
 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.180
resonance which was a new technique in
chemistry and I felt that the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190
chemistry and I felt that the
 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.060
chemistry and I felt that the
theoretical approaches could give

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070
theoretical approaches could give
 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.400
theoretical approaches could give
insights that people didn't have because

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410
insights that people didn't have because
 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.110
insights that people didn't have because
it wasn't sort of worked out and then

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120
it wasn't sort of worked out and then
 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.569
it wasn't sort of worked out and then
when I went to Columbia I started

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579
when I went to Columbia I started
 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.229
when I went to Columbia I started
working on chemical reactions and when I

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239
working on chemical reactions and when I
 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.720
working on chemical reactions and when I
went to Harvard I started working on

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730
went to Harvard I started working on
 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.980
went to Harvard I started working on
biological systems and I think that well

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990
biological systems and I think that well
 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.929
biological systems and I think that well
as having a new environment and starting

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939
as having a new environment and starting
 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.200
as having a new environment and starting
something new makes it most likely or

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210
something new makes it most likely or
 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.750
something new makes it most likely or
more likely maybe the fair answer that

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760
more likely maybe the fair answer that
 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.480
more likely maybe the fair answer that
you'll really discover something and you

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490
you'll really discover something and you
 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.990
you'll really discover something and you
know I from any I'd get invited to go to

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000
know I from any I'd get invited to go to
 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.149
know I from any I'd get invited to go to
meetings that discuss you know what I'd

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159
meetings that discuss you know what I'd
 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.880
meetings that discuss you know what I'd
sort of stopped doing and you know and

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890
sort of stopped doing and you know and
 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.289
sort of stopped doing and you know and
the people are doing interesting things

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299
the people are doing interesting things
 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.390
the people are doing interesting things
but for me I sort of have the feeling

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400
but for me I sort of have the feeling
 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.969
but for me I sort of have the feeling
yes I know what's going on and it

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979
yes I know what's going on and it
 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.950
yes I know what's going on and it
doesn't have the same excitement of

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960
doesn't have the same excitement of
 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.859
doesn't have the same excitement of
course being a professor having students

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869
course being a professor having students
 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.080
course being a professor having students
you can still be sort of working in the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090
you can still be sort of working in the
 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.910
you can still be sort of working in the
old area so you don't sort of suddenly

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920
old area so you don't sort of suddenly
 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.530
old area so you don't sort of suddenly
stopped publishing and people wonder

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540
stopped publishing and people wonder
 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.539
stopped publishing and people wonder
what's going on while you're developing

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549
what's going on while you're developing
 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.030
what's going on while you're developing
ideas as to what they're doing is new I

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040
ideas as to what they're doing is new I
 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.120
ideas as to what they're doing is new I
think it's right if you want to continue

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130
think it's right if you want to continue
 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.850
think it's right if you want to continue
to be creative you have to go into

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860
to be creative you have to go into
 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.850
to be creative you have to go into
something that you don't understand

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860
something that you don't understand
 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.139
something that you don't understand
otherwise at least for me it isn't very

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149
otherwise at least for me it isn't very
 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.299
otherwise at least for me it isn't very
exciting
