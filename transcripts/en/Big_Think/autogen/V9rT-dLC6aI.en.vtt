you've got to fix this issue the overall
 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.390
you've got to fix this issue the overall
cost if cost growth can be reduced but

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400
cost if cost growth can be reduced but
 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.380
cost if cost growth can be reduced but
coming from 70
