00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Of course, this one here is correct.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So if we say we want to find out if a graph has a vertex cover of size 10,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
then all we need is polynomial time

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
because then this decision problem can be solved

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
in O of 2.4 to the power of 10 times N cubes time,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and the exponential factor here is no longer dependent on the input size.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So for a fixed value of K,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
vertex cover can indeed be solved in polynomial time.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Of course, the running time is not independent of the size of the input graph

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
because you still have this polynomial factor here.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Does this statement here mean that actually P=NP?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Unfortunately, it doesn't because K can take any value,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
so K can also depend on N in the general case,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
but what it does mean is that

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
if we consider any fixed value of K,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
then vertex cover becomes easy.

00:00:47.000 --> 99:59:59.000
In other words, small vertex covers are easy to find.
