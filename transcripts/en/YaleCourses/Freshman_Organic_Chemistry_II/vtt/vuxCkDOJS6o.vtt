1
00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:06.140
Why?
Why do we have nuclear files attacking things with leaving groups on them?

2
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.350
What's the orbital that makes those things reactive?
The substrate reactive,

3
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.780
not the nucleophile,
the duplicate files a high home,

4
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.760
<v 1>right?
It's a low Lumo.
So</v>

5
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.240
<v 0>what do you read?
The attack Al Kill highlights.</v>

6
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.300
It's because of the low Lumo when you attack alkenes the characteristic

7
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.280
functionality,

8
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.570
the double bond is mostly remarkable because it's a high homo,

9
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.250
right?
So we talk about electrophilic addition to double bonds.

10
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.150
So it's low lumos that are attacking double bonds like age plus.

11
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.990
But many of the reagents that do this that are classed as nuclear,

12
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.050
as electrophilic addition reagents also have,

13
00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.030
uh,
have high homos.
So they also functioned as a files.

14
00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:04.620
So the subject of the lecture today is electrophilic conditioned to double
bonds,

15
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.150
but stressing that there's also a nucleophile and that may be participating at

16
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:13.880
the same time,
that can react with the Lumo of the,
uh,

17
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.210
alkene that is the Pi Star.

18
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.420
<v 2>Okay.
First,
uh,
I wanted to suggest a problem for you to work on.</v>

19
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.340
Uh,
the pinnacle rearrangement is a neat,
uh,
rearrangement.

20
00:01:27.341 --> 00:01:31.330
Notice that the way the carbons are connected together and the product Bunac

21
00:01:31.331 --> 00:01:35.620
alone is different from the way they're connected in the starting material

22
00:01:35.621 --> 00:01:39.730
called pinnacle,
that the origin of that name is interesting.

23
00:01:39.731 --> 00:01:44.380
It's comes from a Greek word,
ancient Greek word for tablet.

24
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.840
It was coined in 1859 is a name for this compound because of the it's crystals

25
00:01:49.841 --> 00:01:53.720
where we're plates.
So,
so it was called,
uh,
uh,

26
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.550
pinnacle because of the pretty plates of the hydrate crystal.

27
00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.820
But anyhow,
see if you,

28
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.910
this'll be good exercise for you to draw a nice curved arrows that start where

29
00:02:03.911 --> 00:02:07.570
they should start and end where they should add,
uh,
to show how you do this.

30
00:02:07.571 --> 00:02:10.570
It requires several steps,
so that'll be fun for you.

31
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.121
Okay.
Now,

32
00:02:13.121 --> 00:02:18.121
last time we talked about rearrangement in particular that when you had,

33
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.660
uh,
uh,
acid reacting with the alkene,

34
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.350
you got rearrangement of the product.
So for example,

35
00:02:26.351 --> 00:02:31.351
you add the Proton to get the more stable cad ion the secondary instead of the

36
00:02:32.561 --> 00:02:36.850
primary,
but there's a more stable when still,
which is the tertiary.

37
00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:38.500
So it involves a meth.

38
00:02:38.501 --> 00:02:43.480
I'd shift that we talked about last time and the product then when you add water

39
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.540
and then lose a proton from that group is this rearranged alcohol.

40
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.250
So this could be a problem if you wanted to get the unreached arranged alcohol,

41
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.450
you couldn't do it by acid catalyzed hydration.
Okay.
All right.

42
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.270
But there's an alternative called oxy mercury [inaudible] reduction,

43
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.550
right?
So the oxy mercury station ads,

44
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.800
mercury and uh,
Ooh to the double bond,

45
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.150
but the electro file or probably the,
you know,

46
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.510
the electro file is the mercury plus two cad.
I am.

47
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.840
So one of the acetates comes off and you add the mercury and then there's a

48
00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:32.950
second reaction in this,
in this sequence.
First,
the oxy mercury nation,

49
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.520
then a reduction which avoids rearrangement.

50
00:03:36.521 --> 00:03:40.350
So it gives the alcohol that you would have expected if you hadn't been a

51
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.640
sophisticated enough to suspect rearrangement of the secondary to the tertiary

52
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.730
cad.
I am now let's think how this works and why it works.
We're here.

53
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.890
What it,
when you get a rearrangement,
when you have a proton,

54
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.760
the Proton is small and isn't able to overlap well with both carbons at the same

55
00:04:00.881 --> 00:04:05.080
time.
We talked about the fact that it gives a double minimum,
right?

56
00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:09.550
It can rearrange hydrogen with its electrons.

57
00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:14.410
Hydride can shift the same way method shifted in the rearrangement we just

58
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:19.090
talked about on the previous slide,
right?
But it goes over a barrier,

59
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:20.590
right?

60
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.590
Whereas mercury is a much larger ion and is big enough to overlap with both

61
00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:27.190
carbons at the same time.

62
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.720
So it's a single minimum instead of rearranging over a bump from one to the

63
00:04:31.721 --> 00:04:36.300
other side,
it lives near the middle.
Okay?
So as shown there,

64
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.870
now it's a why bond,
right?

65
00:04:37.871 --> 00:04:42.871
The electrons that were in the Pi bond to the carbon carbon double bond are now

66
00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:46.140
shared with the vacant orbital on the mercury cad I.

67
00:04:46.141 --> 00:04:50.070
And so it's one of those,
uh,
uh,

68
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.820
three center to electron bonds that we talked about before.
Okay?

69
00:04:54.821 --> 00:04:58.510
So now since the mercury is bonded to both carbons,

70
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.510
you can't get the rearrangement right

71
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.440
now.
Uh,
here we draw a resonance structures to,
uh,

72
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.930
to denote the bonding that we also can denote by that why upside down wide in

73
00:05:14.621 --> 00:05:18.910
this case.
Uh,
but notice that I haven't drawn it symmetrical,

74
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.130
right?
The Mercury Adam is not in the middle,
halfway between the two carbons.

75
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.990
We can have the three resonance structures on the right with mercury plus on the

76
00:05:28.991 --> 00:05:33.991
left with a primary carbon plus and on the far left with a secondary carbon

77
00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:36.334
plus,

78
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.500
but that's secondary cad ion would be thought to be more stable than the primary

79
00:05:41.501 --> 00:05:42.334
one.

80
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.700
So I won't surprise you that the best position for the mercury is not halfway

81
00:05:48.221 --> 00:05:52.510
between the carbons,
but nearer the one on the left.
So that,

82
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.980
that it's the most important presidents structure.
Right.

83
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.400
And what that means is that the cat ion that is mostly on the,
the uh,

84
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.040
the,
uh,
secondary carbon and that bond is a weaker,

85
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:11.400
the bond on the left,
the red bond shown here is stronger.
So when,

86
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.520
when the nucleophile comes in,

87
00:06:13.521 --> 00:06:16.520
in the second stage and the reaction when the water comes in,

88
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.390
it attacks that cat eye and not the other one.
If it were symmetrically bridged,

89
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.520
you would think that it could attack both of them,
right?
Maybe 50,
50,

90
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.470
but in fact that attacks that one.

91
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.960
So it gives this product that's the,
that's the,
uh,

92
00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.050
hydroxy mercury ration product,
right?

93
00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:40.640
The hydroxy mercury [inaudible] product addition to the double bond,

94
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.850
right?
That then nobody wants that.

95
00:06:43.851 --> 00:06:47.870
But you can remove the mercury by treating with the reducing agent sodium

96
00:06:47.871 --> 00:06:51.260
borohydride and it's replaced then by hydrogen.

97
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.070
So this subsequent reduction step,
uh,

98
00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:00.100
by the Bh four and ion completes Markov knockoff hydration.

99
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.670
Notice that it's the same orientation of alcohol that you would have gotten with

100
00:07:04.671 --> 00:07:05.504
h plus.

101
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.840
It's the more stable of the two cad ions that you could get as a primary account

102
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:15.950
ion or a secondary cad.
I am the,
the nucleophile Ooh,

103
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.980
went to the more substituted carbon.
Right?
So it's more common to call for,

104
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:22.910
it's the same product you'd get,

105
00:07:22.911 --> 00:07:27.230
but you suppress the rearrangement by the fact that the mercury was bonded to

106
00:07:27.231 --> 00:07:31.160
both carbons at once and didn't allow the,
the,
uh,
uh,

107
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:35.960
method to shift.
Okay.
Uh,

108
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.840
now,
uh,
this,

109
00:07:38.841 --> 00:07:43.841
this idea of bridging and unsymmetrical bridging occurs also in the addition of

110
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.680
Halogens to the double bonds,
chlorine and bromine.
These are,
uh,

111
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.490
examples from the lecture that Professor Siegel gave last year.

112
00:07:52.491 --> 00:07:56.150
So they show you the way you would write this,
uh,
quickly.

113
00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:01.660
And notice that the addition of Calori add cl and o h cl goes in this case to

114
00:08:03.891 --> 00:08:07.640
the primary carbon and Ooh,
to the,
uh,

115
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:12.200
to the more substituted carbon analogous to the way in the previous slide,

116
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:15.830
mercury went to the,
to the,
uh,
uh,
uh,

117
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:18.040
less substituted carbon and Ooh,
to the,

118
00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.240
ultimately to the more substituted carbon.

119
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:25.520
So it's Markovnikov addition.
Now,
what was the,

120
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.180
uh,
electro file?
What was it?

121
00:08:29.181 --> 00:08:33.710
The thing that added to give a carbon cat I,
and intermediate in this case here,

122
00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.980
Ooh,
came in as a nucleophile in the second step,
right?

123
00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:45.460
And then lost the Proton to it.
Water came in last,
a proton to give ohs,

124
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.210
but chlorine must've been the electro file.

125
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:55.190
That meant it was something like cl plus,
not cl minus,

126
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.950
which are usually think about.
So let's,
uh,

127
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.750
contemplate this reaction and a little more detail.

128
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.240
So here's ethylene viewed edge on and we can,
uh,

129
00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:09.900
the electrified will attack it's homo,
which looks like that.

130
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:15.330
Now the electro file is going to be chlorine.

131
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.230
Now what orbital is the Lumo of chlorine

132
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:26.220
cl two
carbon.

133
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:30.180
You got an idea,
right?
Sigma Stars.
That is it.

134
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:35.220
So let's draw the sigma star orbital.
The Lumo is sigma star.

135
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.270
So it looks like that.
Does that look good to you Arvind?

136
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:45.090
At first,
is it,
is,
is the energy match good?
Is it unusually low?

137
00:09:45.091 --> 00:09:49.220
Lumo Sigma Star of cl two.

138
00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:57.360
Ah,
it is unusually low because it's,
it's chlorine.
Big nuclear charge.

139
00:09:57.361 --> 00:10:01.500
So low energy.
But as you say,
the overlap is bad,

140
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:07.050
right?
It looks almost orthogonal.
Right?
So what could you do about that?

141
00:10:07.051 --> 00:10:09.510
How could you increase the overlap?
Do you have any idea?

142
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.040
If you were in,
if you were in nuclear file,

143
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.470
a high homo and wanted to attack that Lumo,

144
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:24.060
the sigma star of Clc l,
where would you approach from?

145
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:28.980
Would you approach the way the ethylene is doing here?
Where would you come from?

146
00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:37.440
You'd approached from one of the ends,
right,

147
00:10:37.441 --> 00:10:41.490
where you get overlap without hitting the wrong orbital.
So what,

148
00:10:41.491 --> 00:10:46.080
what do you need to do to the picture?
Right?

149
00:10:46.081 --> 00:10:49.650
You need to rotate the chlorine because you have poor overlap here.

150
00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.860
But if you rotate the chlorine and it looks just fine,

151
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:57.450
so now you can take the electrons in the homo and mix them with this Pi star or

152
00:10:57.451 --> 00:11:00.000
but all,
which means,
remember there's anti-bonding,

153
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:03.090
it's an antibiotic orbital of cl two.

154
00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:08.370
So we can draw arrows like this,
break the CLC and Oban.

155
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.840
So it looks like the nuclear filex substitution reaction at what Adam,

156
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.470
what Adam's being attacked.
If this is a nuclear filling substitution,

157
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.520
the chlorine,
it's a nuclear affiliate substitution of chlorine.
Okay?

158
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:28.080
So that's what we would get,
uh,
where,
where the,
the one,

159
00:11:28.081 --> 00:11:30.690
the chlorine plus has attacked the,
uh,

160
00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:34.350
the CC double bond and formed this three membered ring,

161
00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:37.620
still a cat ion and chlorine minus has gone away.

162
00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:42.480
It took the electrons that were in the sigma,
uh,
in the sigma orbital.

163
00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:48.330
Okay?
So there's a,
what's going on?
So there's,

164
00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:50.640
if you consider this product,

165
00:11:50.641 --> 00:11:53.560
the two different species in the product as one,

166
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:55.840
that's the homo,

167
00:11:56.110 --> 00:12:00.970
it's where the electrons have this chlorine chlorine bond went right that the

168
00:12:00.971 --> 00:12:03.730
top Arrow,
curved Arrow,
right?

169
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:10.110
And this is the Hobo minus two and that you can see is distorted,

170
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.860
but it's the Pi orbital of um,
of the,
uh,

171
00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:19.890
c c double bond mixed with the p orbital on the chlorine or some hybrid orbital

172
00:12:20.021 --> 00:12:22.750
of the chloride to form the bond in the blue region there.

173
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.830
That's where the Pi electrons went.
Okay,

174
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.440
but notice this is homo minus two.

175
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:34.950
Where is the homo and where is homo minus one of this product pair of things.

176
00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:39.730
Okay,
so let's look at it again.

177
00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:46.380
Notice that there are two chlorine chlorine bonds drawn in this three membered

178
00:12:46.511 --> 00:12:49.840
ring.
So there must be some other pair of electrons.

179
00:12:49.841 --> 00:12:53.290
It's involved if we can draw two bonds.
Okay,

180
00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:58.120
where did those other two electrons come from?
That other pair.

181
00:12:58.840 --> 00:12:59.650
Okay,

182
00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:04.650
well we had the Lumo on ethylene Pi Star and the homo on chlorine.

183
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:09.070
Now what do you think the Hobo on cl two would be

184
00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:19.903
Roy?

185
00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:26.590
So it's a p orbital on one of the chlorine's and unshared pair.
In fact,
in the,

186
00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:31.570
so we now want to chlorine nucleophile so it's that unshared pair.

187
00:13:31.571 --> 00:13:35.290
In fact,
if we want to draw the molecular orbital that has it,
uh,
the,
uh,

188
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:40.120
the high homo,
it turns out to be the analog of Pi Star.

189
00:13:40.121 --> 00:13:44.330
It's not only the,
the p orbital on the bottom,
uh,

190
00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:48.370
chlorine,
which would be a relatively high in energy,

191
00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:52.600
but it's a mixture with the p orbital of the other chlorine overlapping with it

192
00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:55.270
anti-bonding to raise the energy.

193
00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:58.660
So it's still higher in energy than it would be if it were just a single p

194
00:13:58.661 --> 00:14:03.550
orbital.
So it's this orbital here and you see it's precisely set up to form good

195
00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:04.061
overlap.

196
00:14:04.061 --> 00:14:08.560
So it's elect those electrons on the chlorine will be stabilized by the Lumo of

197
00:14:08.561 --> 00:14:13.561
the ethylene at the same time that the sigma star or a bottle of the chlorine is

198
00:14:15.071 --> 00:14:18.940
stabilizing the Pi electrons.
So it mixes both ways.

199
00:14:18.941 --> 00:14:22.980
The chlorine is both an electrified and a nucleophile.

200
00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:27.190
Two different pairs of electrons are involved and that gives the homeowner minus

201
00:14:27.191 --> 00:14:28.930
one.
Right,
which you see,

202
00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:33.190
so now we have two pairs of electrons that are,
that are,
uh,

203
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:37.210
forming those bonds and the three,
this new bonds in the three membered ring.

204
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:40.810
Right?
So we can denote that this way.

205
00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:49.930
Now,
where is the homo?

206
00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:54.080
That's just an unshared pair on the oxygen that wasn't involved in this because

207
00:14:54.081 --> 00:14:58.280
it's orthogonal to the other bonds.
It's in and out of the plane of the,
uh,

208
00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:02.930
so that's,
that's the homeless.
We've seen the,
the,
the,
uh,
the,
uh,

209
00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:08.570
uh,
homo,
the homo minus one in the home or minus to that thing.
And there's the,

210
00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:13.250
there's the Lumo,
which is the,
uh,
uh,

211
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:17.780
anti-bonding combination of the chlorine and the,
and the Pi.

212
00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.660
Okay.
So we've traced this through,

213
00:15:20.661 --> 00:15:25.661
but the crucial lesson is that there were two reactions going on that chlorine

214
00:15:26.961 --> 00:15:30.800
acting as a nucleophile as well as,
as an electrified.
So all the,

215
00:15:30.801 --> 00:15:34.940
you call it electrophilic addition and sort of imagine that it's cl plus

216
00:15:34.941 --> 00:15:36.800
attacking,
right?
In fact,

217
00:15:36.801 --> 00:15:40.790
both things are happening at the same time and two bonds are being formed.

218
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.580
Now.
What would happen next?

219
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:48.320
There's the Lumo and we have the home of the cl minus I,

220
00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.120
and that was formed at the same time.

221
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:54.350
So if those two reacted in the way shown here,

222
00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:59.930
it would be the exact reverse of what that you'd form a new bond between

223
00:15:59.931 --> 00:16:03.230
chlorine and chlorine.
You'd put electrons into this Lumo.

224
00:16:03.231 --> 00:16:06.170
This bond would break and you'd go back to the starting material,

225
00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:10.160
but there's a different arrangement that will allow you to go on from here

226
00:16:10.161 --> 00:16:11.650
toward different products,

227
00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.500
which is to move that chloride an independent eye.

228
00:16:15.501 --> 00:16:17.750
And after all down to the bottom.

229
00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.460
So now we have that chloride unshared,
pair homo,

230
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:27.670
and this Lumo and they can interact with one another like this.

231
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:30.630
<v 3>Right.</v>

232
00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:32.730
<v 2>What kind of reaction does that remind you of?</v>

233
00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.070
Did you ever see a reaction like that before?

234
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:45.070
It's like opening it up.
Oxide,
which is it an even more general sense?

235
00:16:45.071 --> 00:16:47.170
An sn two reaction,
right?

236
00:16:47.171 --> 00:16:51.190
A nucleophile attacking a Lumo,
right?

237
00:16:51.191 --> 00:16:54.010
Which is anti bonding.
And here the leaving group leaves,

238
00:16:54.011 --> 00:16:56.620
it's an attack on carbon.
Okay.

239
00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:01.200
So that then would open up the ring and give addition of two chlorines to the,

240
00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.580
to the carbon carbon double bond.

241
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:09.280
So you can think of at first as addition of cl plus and then addition of cl

242
00:17:09.281 --> 00:17:12.280
minus,
right?
It's a two step process.

243
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:18.360
But the interesting thing is that that first step involve both nucleophile and

244
00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:22.960
an electro file,
uh,
activity of the chlorine.

245
00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:28.330
So we could draw it again here.
That first step,
it makes two,

246
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:32.140
two bonds of the three membered ring wallet breaks the chlorine chlorine bond.

247
00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.250
So the red is what you normally think of as an electrified,

248
00:17:36.251 --> 00:17:40.390
all attacking the double bond,
but the blue is a nucleophile attacking.

249
00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:44.020
So it's an electrophilic addition of cl two to an alkene.

250
00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:48.760
That's both electrophilic and nuclear fillic simultaneously.
Okay.

251
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.230
Which generates this so-called chloro knee on them.

252
00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:55.830
I am this three membered ring,
a intermediate,

253
00:17:56.790 --> 00:18:01.590
which then undergoes an sn two reaction to open up and give the product.

254
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:05.520
<v 3>Now,
uh,</v>

255
00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:07.480
<v 2>I remember a,
since it's two steps,</v>

256
00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:11.800
the nucleophile in the second step doesn't have to be the chloride.

257
00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:16.840
It could be some other nuclear file.
For example,
you could do this reaction,

258
00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.490
generate that intermediate,

259
00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:22.290
but then have water come in and be the nucleophile,

260
00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:27.250
in which case the chloride would,
would go away and you'd lose the Proton.

261
00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:32.530
So you,
the product is Hcl,
that product not shown as Hcl,

262
00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:34.630
but you have the,

263
00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:36.393
<v 3>uh,</v>

264
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.910
<v 2>you have the,
uh,
compound that's called a hallow hydron.</v>

265
00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.890
Now let's look at the,
uh,

266
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:51.920
bro Ammonium ion that you get when you add br two and look at the regio

267
00:18:52.741 --> 00:18:56.820
chemistry that's involved.
So the,
you have the,

268
00:18:56.821 --> 00:19:00.800
there's three membered ring,
but it's not symmetrical.
The bromine,

269
00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:05.700
I've drawn more on the right than on the left.
Why would I draw it that way?

270
00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.970
Conor,
do you have any idea why not?
Put it in the middle,

271
00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:14.021
right?

272
00:19:14.021 --> 00:19:18.100
The more substituted carbon on the left is a better place to have a cat ion,

273
00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:23.740
right?
So you have a stronger bond on the right,
a longer weaker bond on the left.

274
00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:28.690
So it's an unsymmetrical bridged bro Ammonium Ion,
right?

275
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:32.650
And then if the bromide comes in backside at the carbon to do,

276
00:19:32.651 --> 00:19:36.630
it's sn two reaction,
right?
You get the,
the uh,

277
00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:41.140
the product that's just like the one we showed before with chlorine.

278
00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:44.410
It's a too bro means that have added in this case

279
00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:49.750
and that's,
but that's only formed in 24% yield in this case.

280
00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:53.350
What do you think the dominant product is?

281
00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:54.913
<v 3>Okay.</v>

282
00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:58.270
<v 2>Antonio,
can you see any alternative?</v>

283
00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:01.683
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

284
00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:06.170
<v 2>Well you could add to the other side,
but we've just been talking about,</v>

285
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:09.770
I mean on the right rather than on the left.
You could,
but that's,

286
00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.450
that would be not preferred.

287
00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:15.680
You might say maybe steric hindrance would help it attack from the right,

288
00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:20.120
but in fact it doesn't attack from the right because of the unsymmetrical
nature.

289
00:20:20.121 --> 00:20:23.270
The bond between bromine and carbon is stronger in the right,

290
00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:28.330
the positive charge is bigger on the left.
So that's where the bromide attacks.

291
00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:32.390
So it's not that it attacks on the right,
but there's another possibility.

292
00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:33.710
Anybody got an idea?

293
00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.860
Pardon me?
Aha.
The water can attack.

294
00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.010
So in case instead of the bromide,

295
00:20:45.011 --> 00:20:49.240
the water could come back backside the carbon and do it's trick.

296
00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.720
Right?
And 60% of the PR,
the 60% yield.

297
00:20:52.721 --> 00:20:55.120
In this case he does the Bromo hydrant.

298
00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.850
So this is a competition between forming the,

299
00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:01.960
the hallow hydrogen and forming the Dye haylight

300
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:09.220
and notice that it shows Markovnikov Riggio chemistry for the reasons we've just

301
00:21:09.221 --> 00:21:13.870
been,
uh,
just been,
uh,
detailing that the,

302
00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:18.430
that the electro file that added first was borough mean gave the more stable cad

303
00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:19.690
ion.
Right?

304
00:21:19.691 --> 00:21:24.691
Or unsymmetrical the thing that had more positive charge here and that's where

305
00:21:25.271 --> 00:21:28.990
the water,
the nucleophile ends up on the more substituted carbon.

306
00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.250
<v 3>Right.
Okay.</v>

307
00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.940
<v 2>But how do we know the eye and is bridged?</v>

308
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:38.770
The same thing would happen if we hadn't formed that second bond,
right?

309
00:21:38.771 --> 00:21:40.810
If it had just been like h plus,

310
00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:45.130
if the bromine had just attacked to give the more stable cad I rather than a

311
00:21:45.131 --> 00:21:48.280
bridged one,
how could you know that it's bridged?

312
00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:55.670
What,
what effect was there from bridging in the case of Mercury?
Yeah,
Arvin,

313
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:59.960
there'd be no rearrangement.
That's one possible.
That's one thing you can do,

314
00:21:59.961 --> 00:22:04.490
but there's another as well.
Another way of showing that.
And this,
uh,

315
00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.840
is the key to it here,
that it's stereo specific.

316
00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:13.430
If you start with the Trans or the sis to beauty,

317
00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:17.630
you get different stereo chemical dye,
bromides stereo,

318
00:22:17.631 --> 00:22:21.740
chemically different dye bromides.
But we'll look at it in another case here.

319
00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:27.460
Suppose you have a ring compound like cyclohexene and you had bromine,

320
00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:30.920
you get the borough ammonium ion,
obviously,
uh,

321
00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:34.760
both bonds and the three membered ring have to be on the same face of the six

322
00:22:34.761 --> 00:22:36.350
membered ring.
Okay.

323
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:40.370
And then when you have backside attack by the water,

324
00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:43.023
<v 3>uh,</v>

325
00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:45.410
<v 2>it must form that compound.</v>

326
00:22:45.411 --> 00:22:49.320
It can't form the Oah on the same phase as the Broccoli,
right?

327
00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:53.560
Dsn to process,
it has to be a backside,
not a front side of the TAC.

328
00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.830
So whether it's the,
a Oah and you're forming the hallow hydrant,

329
00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:02.360
or whether it's br minus and you attack the form of the dye bromide,

330
00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:07.190
in either case,
it has to be a trans product,
right?

331
00:23:07.191 --> 00:23:09.050
They have the bromine and the other,

332
00:23:09.051 --> 00:23:13.460
the nucleophile have to be on opposite sides of the ring.
So,

333
00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:18.940
so an unbridgeable c plus the nucleophile could have attacked from the top or

334
00:23:19.071 --> 00:23:22.110
the bottom if the bromine we're bridging.
So the,

335
00:23:22.111 --> 00:23:26.150
the bridging is evidenced not only by a lack of rearrangement,

336
00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:30.590
but also by the,
by the stereo chemistry of the product.

337
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:32.450
It's an anti edition.

338
00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:38.070
The reverse you notice of anti elimination that we talked about.
Uh,
uh,

339
00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:41.270
e two reactions.
Now,

340
00:23:41.271 --> 00:23:46.271
how about other kinds of reagents that can be both an file and a nucleophile at

341
00:23:46.701 --> 00:23:49.670
the same time due to things.
There are a lot of them.

342
00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:54.700
There are things called carbines.
There's a,

343
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:58.070
the reagent involved in hydro more ration,

344
00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:01.740
which are things that have a BH bond in them.
Uh,

345
00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.250
there's a thing called a carbon oid,

346
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:07.310
which involves these reagents.

347
00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:12.910
There's an oxidation which forms the three membered ring with oxygen by a per

348
00:24:13.171 --> 00:24:14.210
Roxy acid.

349
00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:19.430
There's Ozo analysis oh three to form a five membered ring initially.

350
00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:24.850
And there's this thing we referred to last time where I remember h two doesn't

351
00:24:25.401 --> 00:24:29.750
have the proper symmetry of its orbitals to add directly to a CC double bond.

352
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:32.810
But with the help of a metal that can,

353
00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:37.520
and that's another case where you have simultaneous nucleophile and electro file

354
00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:40.760
behavior.
So we're going to go through these.

355
00:24:40.761 --> 00:24:45.380
We won't get through all of them today to see how these agents work.

356
00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:49.550
And finally there's,
there's a polymerization,

357
00:24:49.551 --> 00:24:54.200
which is another topic that we'll get to that.
Okay.

358
00:24:54.201 --> 00:24:55.700
So first car beans.

359
00:24:56.060 --> 00:25:01.060
Now there was a fellow named Jack Hein who got his phd in 1950 and went to be a

360
00:25:01.161 --> 00:25:05.900
postdoctoral with Professor Bartlett,
your chemical grandfather.
Uh,

361
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:10.200
and when Bartlet spoke about this sometime,
he,

362
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:15.080
he mentioned that the project that hind decided to work on all,

363
00:25:15.081 --> 00:25:17.540
on his own,
I believe without much guidance from,

364
00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:22.670
from Bartlett as opposed to doctoral,
was the reaction of,
of uh,

365
00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:27.650
chloro methane's with hydroxide.
Now by 1950,

366
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:32.690
this was pretty old hat,
right?
Because these,
in 19,

367
00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:37.130
the reaction had been known right from the time of,
uh,
of,
uh,

368
00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:42.160
Williamson ether synthesis a hundred years earlier and all this stuff about sn

369
00:25:42.441 --> 00:25:47.360
one sn,
two e one e two at all been done in the 1920s,
thirties.

370
00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:51.170
So this was pretty old Bartlett said,
described this.

371
00:25:51.171 --> 00:25:54.350
He said it was about his earthy who research project.

372
00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:59.120
It could be appropriate for a postdoctoral but high knew what he was doing.

373
00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:03.860
He had an interesting idea.
He was talking,
he was following up on,

374
00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:07.120
he found that the reaction with hydroxide with the,

375
00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:11.630
with the chloroform is very fast.
Right?

376
00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:17.020
With methylene chloride is a w wait a second,

377
00:26:17.781 --> 00:26:21.350
I've got the first one is supposed to be ch three cl,
I'm sorry,

378
00:26:21.351 --> 00:26:22.460
I put it in there wrong.

379
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:26.990
So with methyl chloride as fast with methylene chloride,

380
00:26:26.991 --> 00:26:30.860
it slow with Carbon Tetra chloride,
it's very slow.

381
00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:35.390
Now if you were thinking of the halogens as roughly like a methyl group,

382
00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:38.750
right,
which of which there are about the same size,

383
00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:41.450
then this looks like the same.
Stearic affect you.

384
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:44.910
That was well known already in the rates of sn.
Two reactions.

385
00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:49.680
That methyl is faster than Ethel is faster than than uh,
than T.
Beautiful.

386
00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:54.810
Okay.
So that that much is,
is sensible.
What was interesting was this,

387
00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:57.390
that chloroform is fast.

388
00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:01.110
What does that suggest to you?

389
00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:06.740
We saw this before.
I just in general,
what do you want?

390
00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:10.380
It saw it before that when we were doing sn two reactions,
right?

391
00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:15.030
They had a methyl ethyl ISO propyl,

392
00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:19.290
and suddenly t butyl was very fast.
What did that suggest?

393
00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:22.740
It's suggested,
yeah,
that there's a chain,

394
00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:27.300
there's a different mechanism being involved in that reaction somehow,
right?

395
00:27:27.301 --> 00:27:31.470
Since it doesn't fall in line.
Now what's special about,

396
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.070
uh,
uh,
about that?
Well,

397
00:27:35.071 --> 00:27:38.760
he also could study the reaction with,
with,
uh,

398
00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:43.800
with this sulfur and iron,
right?
Which is a nucleophile,

399
00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:46.680
right?
Hydroxide smaller,

400
00:27:46.681 --> 00:27:50.010
better overlapped with hydrogen is a good base,
right?

401
00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:54.300
But fennel sulfide is a,
is a better,

402
00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.970
better as a nucleophile veteran bonded to carbon.

403
00:27:56.971 --> 00:28:00.150
So it's the thing that would be doing the sn two kind of reaction,

404
00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:03.540
and that is fast,
slow,
and very slow,

405
00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:06.360
which makes sense for chloroform.

406
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:10.140
So it's something about o h minus being a base,

407
00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:16.380
right?
That makes chloroform on unusual hind discovered.
Okay.

408
00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:20.310
So what it is,
is when you have a very strong base,

409
00:28:20.311 --> 00:28:24.900
like the bass from t butyl alcohol,
TB top side,

410
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:29.580
it turns out that they can extract h plus,
right?

411
00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:34.820
Because the electronegative three chlorine make the carbon anti and sufficiently

412
00:28:36.151 --> 00:28:38.370
stable that it could lose h plus.

413
00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.670
It's not as strong acid to lose age plus,

414
00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:46.370
but it's much better than having just two or only one chlorine.

415
00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:47.993
All right?

416
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:53.240
So you can do this sn two reaction that hydrogen and get the try chloro methyl

417
00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:58.530
an ion,
but then it has a good leaving group on it chloride,

418
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:00.720
right?

419
00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:05.130
So you get elimination of Hcl from a single carbon,

420
00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:08.640
right?
It's Alpha elimination.

421
00:29:08.641 --> 00:29:12.050
We talked about Beta elimination before in the two.

422
00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:17.040
He won reaction where you take hydrogen proton off from one chloride or
whatever,

423
00:29:17.041 --> 00:29:20.430
leaving group off from the adjacent one.
But this is loosely them,

424
00:29:20.431 --> 00:29:23.130
both from the same atom and it's,
uh,

425
00:29:23.131 --> 00:29:25.830
and chloroform is uniquely set up to do that.

426
00:29:25.831 --> 00:29:29.940
Obviously carbon tetrachloride can't do it because it doesn't have the proton to

427
00:29:29.941 --> 00:29:32.220
be lost.
Okay?

428
00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:38.370
So now we have this divalent carbon,
which is called the car bead,

429
00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.660
and it can come together with the,
uh,

430
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:44.530
with the Obgyn to form a cycle of propane.

431
00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:51.040
Uh,
no.
And so we're gonna try,
we're gonna analyze this in terms of the homos,

432
00:29:51.041 --> 00:29:55.330
a little bows that are involved in mixing the orbitals of the,
of the,
uh,

433
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:56.463
uh,

434
00:29:56.710 --> 00:30:00.640
the carby in the Dye chlorocarbon with ethylene.

435
00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:05.830
Okay.
So here are the,
our reagents.
We know the orbitals of ethylene.

436
00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:09.750
So here's the whole ball of Dye chlorocarbon,

437
00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:13.330
which turns out to be a bent molecule.
Right?

438
00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.440
And here's its Lumo,
the vacant p orbital.

439
00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:22.800
Now does that look well set up to react with ethylene?

440
00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:29.430
The Mix Hobo with lube oil and lube oil with Hobo?

441
00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:34.620
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

442
00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:37.860
<v 0>Noel,
what's the shape of,
uh,
of the,
uh,</v>

443
00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:42.600
of the Hobo of ethylene?
That's the thing that I liked her files usually attack.

444
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:45.300
What is it?
It's the pie.

445
00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:49.080
So it would be positive here and positive here.

446
00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:53.340
Is that well set up to mix with this Lumo?
No,

447
00:30:53.341 --> 00:30:57.390
cause the Lumos a p orbital,
a B plus on one side and minus on the other,

448
00:30:57.391 --> 00:31:01.920
they'd be orthogonal.
And the same is true.
The Lumo of the ethylene is,

449
00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:06.510
is,
would be plus here minus here.
And this one is symmetrically between,

450
00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:08.100
they would both be orthogonal,

451
00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:10.243
<v 3>right?</v>

452
00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:14.940
<v 2>So both the homeowner Lumo and the Lumo Homo pairs are orthogonal.</v>

453
00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:17.170
So it doesn't look like,
uh,

454
00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:22.050
like die chloral carbon should be able to do this to form these two bonds at

455
00:31:22.051 --> 00:31:24.180
once.
But there's a way to do it.

456
00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.900
And the person who can tell us how to do it as Arvind,

457
00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.260
<v 0>Aha.
Well rotate it,
right?</v>

458
00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:37.560
So this is actually that the three frames through the transition state,

459
00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:41.890
right?
This is just before the transition state.

460
00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:47.100
But notice the dye chloro carbon is coming in sideways rather than head on,

461
00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:52.060
right?
So the,
that,
that bond is being formed,

462
00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:56.770
the two bonds are being formed,
the pie are going here.
The,
the,
uh,

463
00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:01.660
loads of that hybrid orbital here are going into this.
So,

464
00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:04.300
so we'll watch the,
uh,
motion here,

465
00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:11.350
back up,
come forward again.

466
00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:16.540
So what happens actually as you go through the transition state is it's
rotating,

467
00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:20.770
right?
Does it start?
It starts getting overlapped with the thing.

468
00:32:20.771 --> 00:32:25.050
And then as the new bonds form,
it goes into the lower energy geometry of the,

469
00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:28.510
of the three member during which of course has the chlorine is pointing up.

470
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:37.570
<v 2>Okay.
So,
so then this is the Lumo of the,</v>

471
00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:42.620
I use dye fluorocarbon for to have fewer electrons in order to do the

472
00:32:42.621 --> 00:32:47.150
calculation.
But then,
but you see that the Lubo is the p orbital on the,

473
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:51.230
on the,
uh,
die chlorocarbon as we suspected,

474
00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:56.620
the homo is the Pi of the alkene and they overlap well and then the home,

475
00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:00.980
Oh,
is that a sp hybrid on the carbon.

476
00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:04.790
And that's well set up to overlap with the Lumo.
So again,

477
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.410
you can do both electrophilic and nuclear fillic attack at the same time,

478
00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.410
but it requires coming inside ways and rotating.

479
00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:14.750
Okay.

480
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:19.670
Now how would we know that both bonds form at once because an alternative,
yeah.

481
00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:24.310
<v 0>The mechanism would be for this thing to act as if it were a radical for one</v>

482
00:33:24.311 --> 00:33:25.570
electronic come in here,

483
00:33:25.571 --> 00:33:29.890
one electron of the Pi bond to go here and the other to go on here to give this

484
00:33:29.891 --> 00:33:31.630
dye radical intermediate,

485
00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:36.880
which then in a second step could close the bond.
Right.

486
00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:38.500
How do we know that the,

487
00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:42.880
whether there is an intermediate like this and the reaction or whether we just

488
00:33:42.881 --> 00:33:46.600
have a transition state that we just drew where both of the bonds are being

489
00:33:46.601 --> 00:33:47.500
formed at once.

490
00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:52.750
What experimental tests could one perform to see whether both bonds are being

491
00:33:52.751 --> 00:33:54.910
formed at once?
Anybody got an idea?

492
00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:57.333
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

493
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.891
<v 0>Chris,</v>

494
00:33:57.891 --> 00:34:00.830
do you have any idea of how you can tell whether two bonds are being formed at

495
00:34:00.831 --> 00:34:01.664
once?

496
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.680
<v 3>Pardon me?
Well,
do you have any idea?</v>

497
00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:16.660
<v 0>Have you ever seen an example before where you can tell that two bonds are being</v>

498
00:34:16.661 --> 00:34:17.760
formed at once and not

499
00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:23.400
<v 3>one bond at a time?
I skate out of here.</v>

500
00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:32.350
<v 0>Okay.
The rates are one way.
One tries to do things like that.</v>

501
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:36.620
<v 3>Roy Stereo,</v>

502
00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:39.890
<v 0>chemistry of the product.
Because if you have this intermediate,</v>

503
00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:44.240
if it lasts longer than about 10 to the minus 10 seconds,

504
00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:47.690
that's how long it takes a single bond to rotate

505
00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:50.680
<v 3>something like that.
Okay,</v>

506
00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:53.700
<v 0>so you've been wrote it.
This was a double bond before,</v>

507
00:34:53.701 --> 00:34:57.810
so these two methyls were cyst to one another.
Both going back into the board.

508
00:34:58.680 --> 00:34:59.400
Right.

509
00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:03.270
But if you get this thing with a single bond that it could rotate in about 10 to

510
00:35:03.271 --> 00:35:06.930
the minus 10 seconds to have this methyl coming out in front.

511
00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:11.980
The other metal still in back.
Right?
And now if that one and you,

512
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.020
you should do that if you can,
because this is less strained.

513
00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.500
Can anybody see why this one would be less strain than that one,

514
00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:22.603
<v 3>Laura?</v>

515
00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:25.560
<v 0>Right in this one,</v>

516
00:35:25.561 --> 00:35:30.561
this methyl is between this CBR too and this ch three it's Gauche to both of

517
00:35:31.771 --> 00:35:32.940
them or something like that.

518
00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:39.210
But here it's rotated to be far from the methyl,
right.
So it's,

519
00:35:39.211 --> 00:35:44.040
it's a,
it's much less strain here,
but it's not between the two groups here.

520
00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:46.590
It's between the CBR too in the hydrogen,

521
00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:49.020
although I've drawn it as if a word clips,

522
00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:50.820
<v 3>right?
Okay.</v>

523
00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:56.440
<v 0>So if this is this and it goes and doesn't rotate,</v>

524
00:35:56.500 --> 00:36:00.910
this product will be sis.
The two methyls will be on the same side of the ring,

525
00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:04.570
both going back into the board.
But if this happens,

526
00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:06.430
the product will be trans.

527
00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:12.630
So you do the reaction and you find that since starting material gives only sis

528
00:36:13.091 --> 00:36:17.800
product,
so there wasn't the opportunity for rotation,
right?

529
00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:18.671
Therefore,

530
00:36:18.671 --> 00:36:23.080
it must have formed both bonds either at the same time or within a really,

531
00:36:23.081 --> 00:36:27.970
really short period of time.
So fundamentally what you did here is time,

532
00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:31.840
how fast this could have been,
how fast this,

533
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:36.310
this closure could have been by knowing something about how rapidly things

534
00:36:36.311 --> 00:36:39.110
rotate,
right?
You know,
it must be this,

535
00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:41.860
this collapse must be faster than rotation.

536
00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:45.190
So it doesn't really prove that there's not an intermediate,

537
00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.400
but it proves that it doesn't last longer than if there is one.

538
00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.950
It doesn't last longer than 10 to the minus 10 seconds,

539
00:36:50.951 --> 00:36:53.140
which is roughly the rate at which you would rotate,

540
00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:00.700
okay?
Now the second example was hydro [inaudible] oxidation.

541
00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:04.300
So remember we said that if you had a B h Bond,

542
00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:08.010
you can add it across a double bond,
right?

543
00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:13.650
And then treat that in a second oxidation step by reacting with hydrogen

544
00:37:14.081 --> 00:37:16.540
peroxide and hydroxide.

545
00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:20.770
And that replaces br to which people don't want with Oah,

546
00:37:20.771 --> 00:37:25.510
which is a kind of compound that people do want.
Okay.

547
00:37:25.511 --> 00:37:29.740
Now,
so what we've,
what this process,
the two steps,

548
00:37:29.741 --> 00:37:34.741
hydro duration in that oxidation achieves addition of water to the CC double

549
00:37:35.441 --> 00:37:36.274
bond.

550
00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:37.763
<v 3>All right?</v>

551
00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:42.440
<v 0>Have you,
do you know any other ways to add water to a CC,
double bond,</v>

552
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:50.500
hydrogen plus and water?
That's what we,
you know,

553
00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:54.740
Eddie Hoh,
Auto Bot,
uh,
oxy,
mercury,

554
00:37:54.741 --> 00:37:58.530
aeration and reduction,
which we just talked about also forms the alcohol.

555
00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:01.230
Why do you need another way to make an alcohol?

556
00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:03.393
<v 3>Sebastian?</v>

557
00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:09.350
<v 0>Ah,
it's antinarcotic off.
Let's look at how this happens.</v>

558
00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:11.930
Okay,
so here's the Bh three,

559
00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:17.640
which is an electrified because of the vacant orbital on Boron,
right?

560
00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:21.560
And this is the motion that'll happen.
It,

561
00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:25.190
these electrons that are in the double bond go into Bond Boron.

562
00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:26.810
But at the same time,

563
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:31.670
these electrons that Bh bond and unusually high homo,

564
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:33.700
why is that an unusually hot

565
00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:39.020
<v 3>[inaudible] charges or charges?</v>

566
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:48.480
<v 0>So it's a high energy or,</v>

567
00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:52.840
but all for the same reason that bonds the chlorine or low in energy right now,

568
00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:55.000
there's not much nuclear charge on this one.

569
00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:59.380
So this nucleophile is attacking Pi Star at the same time.

570
00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:01.840
So we could again watch this,

571
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:05.690
watch the stretch and shrink as it goes toward the transition state.

572
00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:13.810
So,
so we're breaking this bond,

573
00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:17.850
forming the ch bond and for being,
uh,

574
00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:19.450
BC bond.

575
00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:22.173
<v 3>Okay.</v>

576
00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:27.620
<v 0>So,
uh,
here we've looked at,</v>

577
00:39:27.621 --> 00:39:30.320
here we're looking at the orbital so that the,
uh,

578
00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:34.940
Lubo on the Bh three is the p orbital,
the whole Hobo of the,

579
00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:38.870
of the outies as this pie,
right?

580
00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:42.530
The Hobo on the Bh three is that,
that,
uh,

581
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:47.570
Bh bond and the Lubo of the,
uh,
of the,
uh,

582
00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:48.980
of the,

583
00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:53.690
the Alkane is this thing which looks ugly.

584
00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:58.100
But the reason is that I've just started to be in the shape that would have half

585
00:39:58.101 --> 00:40:02.550
the transition state awkward started.
Okay.
So that was the transition state.

586
00:40:02.551 --> 00:40:04.680
And you can see that,
that,
uh,

587
00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:10.190
that it makes us homos and Lumos Lumos and Hobos.
Okay.

588
00:40:10.191 --> 00:40:12.890
So then this,
then the staff,

589
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:16.490
this then establishes a BC bond.

590
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:19.430
Now the particular one we are been,

591
00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:23.930
it has art and our group on the beat here,
I've drawn Bethel.

592
00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:28.580
If this had been formed by additional B h two a double bond,

593
00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:31.130
there would be another carbon here,
right?

594
00:40:31.131 --> 00:40:34.670
There would have been a double bond boron on to one end.

595
00:40:34.671 --> 00:40:39.100
Hydrogen added to the other.
Right?
But I've made it,
uh,

596
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:40.160
for simplicity,

597
00:40:40.161 --> 00:40:43.490
made it a methyl group just so we wouldn't have as much to deal with.

598
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:46.760
And now I've got to look at the second step,
the oxidation.

599
00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:50.750
So what's the Lumos is going to be involved in this reaction?

600
00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:57.190
Luke,
what do you say?

601
00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:00.713
<v 3>Okay,</v>

602
00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:05.110
<v 0>well,
if it's going to be vacant,</v>

603
00:41:05.111 --> 00:41:09.070
it's not going to be the sigma could be sick of star,
but that's not the Luma.

604
00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:10.410
There's a lower orbit.

605
00:41:10.411 --> 00:41:14.830
All the fat off the top of the rock cod.

606
00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:22.330
It's Derek,
ah,

607
00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:26.860
boron VX three from last semester and the vacant orbital onboard.

608
00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:30.220
So it has an atomic particle.
It hasn't mixed with anything.

609
00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:35.210
So the lowest orbital is the orbital lawn.
Boron.
What's the High Homo?

610
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:38.750
What's going to react?
Ab you got an idea

611
00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:40.223
<v 3>that's crazy.</v>

612
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.410
<v 0>Very well,
right?
The oxygen that has a negative charge on it.</v>

613
00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:52.210
So we can just mix those two.
Okay.
So we've got this and now there's a,

614
00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:57.250
we draw a negative charge on boron because it gained half interest in the pair

615
00:41:57.251 --> 00:42:00.640
of electrons that was on oxygen.
Okay?

616
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:03.610
And now we have an interesting uh,

617
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:08.950
rearrangement that looks a lot like sn two.
Okay.

618
00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:11.020
Where is there a low Lumo here

619
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:13.070
<v 3>in this molecule?</v>

620
00:42:18.010 --> 00:42:21.990
Linda,
you have idea
came your role?

621
00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:27.820
<v 0>Yeah,
the Sigma Star of,
Oh,
because of the high Decleor charge,
right?</v>

622
00:42:27.821 --> 00:42:31.660
Like seal two or something like that.
So low little moe here.

623
00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:33.370
Where is there a high homo

624
00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:38.170
<v 3>wells?
We've got the idea.</v>

625
00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:42.980
<v 0>When you look up this whole thing here,</v>

626
00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:46.520
what is there that tells you that there could be a high on level?

627
00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:52.760
Aha.
The negative charge.
Okay,
so,

628
00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:56.750
but that negative charge is not an unshared pair of electrodes.

629
00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:01.760
There aren't any unshared electrons on the Boron.
So what is the orbital?

630
00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:06.890
It's,
it has to be one of the sigma bonds to Boron.
For example,

631
00:43:06.891 --> 00:43:10.940
this sigma bond here.
So here we have a nuclear file,

632
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:16.070
and here we have an electrified.
Here's the Hobo Sigma stars,
the Lumo.

633
00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:20.690
Okay,
now here's the geometry of the transition state.

634
00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:26.780
You see what's happening is that the ch three is moving over,

635
00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:32.740
taking these electrons with it.
It's a meth.
I'd shift like we saw in the cad,

636
00:43:32.741 --> 00:43:37.490
I am cases,
except that that case there would be a cad ion here,

637
00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:38.750
right?

638
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:42.770
And the ch three with just electrons would shift to give a more stable cad ions.

639
00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:46.130
In this case it's because you have the o bond.

640
00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:51.290
But it's interesting to compare this transition state with the transition state

641
00:43:51.291 --> 00:43:55.940
for an sn two reaction of say,
chloride attacking methyl chloride.

642
00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:06.210
So you can see,
here's the nuclear file,
the leaving group,
here's the nucleophile,

643
00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:10.170
the leaving group,
okay.
And in fact,
if we,

644
00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:14.820
the sick,
the star cbrs being attacked here,

645
00:44:15.850 --> 00:44:20.670
alright,
get that reaction,
the sn two.
But in this case is sigma star.

646
00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:24.120
Oh,
oh.
And Sigma BC is the nuclear file.

647
00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:30.480
So you see,
it looks like the same reaction.
And in fact,

648
00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:33.750
if we,
if we go to the transition state,

649
00:44:33.751 --> 00:44:37.110
you see the thing bouncing back and forth to the transition state.

650
00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:40.200
But if we look at the orbitals,
so the transition state,

651
00:44:40.201 --> 00:44:44.970
this is the homo for sn two.
This is the home for this rearrangement.

652
00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.030
See the orbitals look almost exactly the same.

653
00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:52.890
And if you look at the lube oil for the sn two and the Lumo for this

654
00:44:52.891 --> 00:44:53.724
rearrangement,

655
00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:59.010
it's the same reaction as I said to this rearrangement is,
okay.

656
00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:04.300
So,
uh,
so this is the question then that that,

657
00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:08.400
that Sebastian is already at,
uh,
answered.

658
00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:13.710
Why do this procedure if all it does is add h and o h to c double bond.

659
00:45:13.711 --> 00:45:18.711
See how about the regio chemistry and how about the stereochemistry?

660
00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:22.980
So that initial addition ads,

661
00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:28.010
Br br is now the low Lumo in that initial edition before the rearrangement in

662
00:45:29.881 --> 00:45:33.330
the initial audition B is the electrified.

663
00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:38.600
So it adds to the less substituted carbon to make because so that you get more

664
00:45:38.611 --> 00:45:43.430
of the carpet cad I in character here and the hydride is what shifts.

665
00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:47.240
Remember,
it's the hydride,
it's B as the electro file.

666
00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:51.150
And the Bh bond with the hydride shifting is the,

667
00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:54.570
is the nucleophile.
So it goes to the more substituted center.

668
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:57.000
So whereas Markovnikov,
of course,

669
00:45:57.001 --> 00:46:00.720
knew nothing about homos and Lou bows nucleophile and electro files,

670
00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:05.040
all he knew was that the hydrogen went to the place that had the few,

671
00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:06.300
the most hydrogens.

672
00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:10.620
And the other thing went where there were the most non hydrogens,
right?

673
00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:14.810
But the other thing in this case is B,
B r two,
right?

674
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.100
Which turns out to be the electrified file,

675
00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:20.940
not the nucleophile and the other cases.
The other thing,

676
00:46:20.941 --> 00:46:25.290
not hydrogen was the nucleophile.
Now it's the electrified.
So it does,

677
00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:29.670
it gives the opposite orientation here for what mark cognitive cost probably

678
00:46:29.671 --> 00:46:34.440
would have said,
but for the same reason that explains Markovnikov addition,

679
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:38.910
right?
And now when we do the rearrangement,
well,
uh,

680
00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:43.940
what we do is put the oxygen on Boron and then have this whole art group shift

681
00:46:45.211 --> 00:46:48.700
over.
But that's a front side attack.
It's the,

682
00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:52.350
it's a sigma orbitals of the,
of,
of this,
uh,

683
00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:57.000
of this RBR bond that are doing the attacking,
right.

684
00:46:57.510 --> 00:47:02.510
So,
uh,
so it,
it's front side at that,

685
00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:06.420
that it comes,
it replaces the,
the,
the,
the,
Oh,

686
00:47:06.421 --> 00:47:09.360
replaces the Oah replaces br two.

687
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:13.560
It does not a backside situation.
Right?
So you get that.

688
00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:18.690
So it's a,
so the alcohol product is sin.

689
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:23.310
The,
the two things that have added are on the same phase,
not an opposite faces.

690
00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:27.870
Right.
And it's anti Markov off the Oah.
Now is,

691
00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:32.550
is on the opposite place or where I would go by these other mechanisms of adding

692
00:47:32.551 --> 00:47:33.131
in the alcohol.

693
00:47:33.131 --> 00:47:37.450
So this is a great boon then if you're in the synthesis business and need to

694
00:47:37.451 --> 00:47:40.060
prepare an alcohol where the Oah is on,

695
00:47:40.061 --> 00:47:44.800
the more substitute is on the less substituted carbon.
So it's anti Markovnikov.

696
00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:48.430
So you contrast that with acid catalyzed hydration,

697
00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:53.410
which would give this cat it,
right?
Which is,
who are part of this alcohol,

698
00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:55.620
which is the Markov knockoff product.

699
00:47:56.050 --> 00:48:00.130
How about the stereo chemistry in this place was that sister was,

700
00:48:00.131 --> 00:48:04.280
it said edition or anti edition at the age and a Ooh,

701
00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:06.730
come in on the same face or opposite faces.

702
00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:11.973
<v 3>Cassey</v>

703
00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:18.473
can't hear.

704
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:24.230
<v 0>You can't tell here.
Right?
Because there are two H's.
So it's a,</v>

705
00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:28.440
it's a clear choice.
In this case,
when it was anti mark called off,

706
00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:32.150
one is Marcotte Macarthur.
The age goes where there are already ages.

707
00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:33.890
There's going to be this ambiguity.

708
00:48:33.891 --> 00:48:37.870
Unless you did what but a deuter deuterium in,

709
00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:42.560
then you could tell that it is sin.
Okay?
But it appears random.

710
00:48:43.330 --> 00:48:47.720
Oh,
oh no.
Pardon me.
Not only appears random,
if you did it with deuterium,

711
00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:52.910
you would find that it is random because you generate a cat eye and intermediate

712
00:48:52.911 --> 00:48:55.640
here when you add protons first.
Right?

713
00:48:55.850 --> 00:49:00.440
And that could be attacked from either side.
Right?
So it sin here,

714
00:49:00.441 --> 00:49:03.290
but random down here.
And that's enough for today.
