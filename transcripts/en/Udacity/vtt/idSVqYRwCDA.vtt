00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.630
So with that, with that notion of a concept as functions or as mappings from

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:12.020
objects to membership in a set we have a particular target concept. And the

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.180
only difference between a target concept and

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.530
the general notion of concept is that

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.390
the target concept is the thing we're

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.540
trying to find. It's the actual answer. All

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.670
right? So, a function that determines whether something is a car

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.130
or not, or male or not, is the target concept. Now

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.860
this is actually important, right, because we could say that. We

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.440
have this notion in our head of things that are cars

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.520
or things that are males, or thing, or people who are

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.180
credit worthy but unless we actually have it written down somewhere

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.610
we don't know whether it's right or wrong. So there is

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.610
some target concept we're trying to get of all the concepts

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.870
that might map pictures or people to true and false.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.650
&gt;&gt; Okay, so if you trying to teach me what tallness is so

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.480
you have this kind of concept in mind of these, these things are

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.660
tall and these things are not tall. So you're going to have to

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.480
somehow convey that to me. So how are you going to teach me?

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.170
&gt;&gt; So that's exactly the, well that's what comes up

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.770
with the rest of these things that we're defining here.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.800
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.320
&gt;&gt; So let me tell you what the next four things

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.150
are then you can tell me whether that answers your question.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.610
&gt;&gt; Got it.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.760
&gt;&gt; How about that? OK, so we've got a notion

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.840
of instances, input, we've got a notion of concepts. Which

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.300
take input and maps into some kind of output. And

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.870
we've got some target concepts, some specific function from

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.010
particular idea that we're trying to find, we're trying to

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.630
represent. But out of what? So that's where the hypothesis

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.120
comes in. And in fact I think it's better to

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:40.320
say hypothesis class. So that's the set of all concepts

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.310
that you're willing to entertain. So it's

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.440
all the functions I'm willing to think about.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.020
&gt;&gt; So why wouldn't it just be all possible functions?

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.940
&gt;&gt; It could be all possible functions

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.250
and that's a perfectly reasonable hypothesis class. The

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.480
problem with that is that if it is all possible functions it may be very, very

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.960
hard for you to figure out which function is

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.300
the right one given finite data. So when

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.550
we actually go over decision trees next I think it will be kind of clear why

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.169
you need to pick a specific hypothesis class.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.970
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.270
&gt;&gt; So let's return to that in a little

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.900
bit but it's an excellent question. So, conceptually in the

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.400
back of your head until we, we come to

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.390
specific examples, you can think of hypothesis class as simply

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.550
being all possible functions in the world. On the

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.130
other hand, even so far just the classification learning, we

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.770
already know that we're restricting ourselves to a subset of

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.620
all possible functions in the world, because all possible functions

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.570
in the world includes things like x squared, and that's regeression.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.970
And we've already said, we're not doing regression. We're doing classification.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.890
So already hypothesis classes all functions we care about and maybe

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.430
it's all classification functions. So we've already picked a subset. So we

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.940
got all these incidences, got all these concepts, we want to

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.870
find a, a particular concept and we've got this set of

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.220
functions we're willing to look at. So how are we going

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.630
to determine what the right answer is. So if you try to

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.910
answer Micheal's question that we do that in machine learning is with

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.550
a sample or another name for which I prefer is a training set.
