00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.660
Let's do a survey about
how we would measure

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:07.510
the volume of fluids
under US customary units.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.941
So the smallest volume of
fluid that you'll hear people

00:00:09.941 --> 00:00:12.190
talk about-- and this will
often be in cooking recipes

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:18.310
or something like this--
you'll talk about a teaspoon.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.130
And most of us have
teaspoons that are roughly

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.490
the size of a teaspoon in
our cupboards someplace.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.370
So this recipe might call
for a teaspoon of sugar,

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.152
or a teaspoon of salt,
or a teaspoon of oil.

00:00:30.152 --> 00:00:31.610
And you've seen
what it looks like.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.318
But those are the
smaller spoons that you

00:00:33.318 --> 00:00:36.980
might have in your cabinets
in your kitchen at home.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.780
So this might be a
teaspoon right over here.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.322
Now, if you were to take
3 teaspoons together,

00:00:42.322 --> 00:00:44.280
you have something else
that you would probably

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.310
have in your cabinets.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.850
So if we multiply
this volume, so

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.042
let's say this right
over here is a teaspoon.

00:00:50.042 --> 00:00:52.250
This right over here is a
teaspoon of some substance.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.530
If you multiply that by 3,
then you get to the tablespoon.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.300
So 3 teaspoons
equal 1 tablespoon.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.910
So a tablespoon's going
to be a little bit bigger.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.594
So a tablespoon
might look like this.

00:01:08.594 --> 00:01:10.760
These tend to be about the
size of the larger spoons

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.500
that you have in your
cupboard, so a tablespoon,

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.320
just like that.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.180
So if you have 3 times the
fluid, you get to a tablespoon.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.100
Now, if you take 2
tablespoons, put them together,

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.030
then you get to the ounce.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.280
And I have to be careful here.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.675
You get to the fluid ounce.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.340
And the US customary units, they
aren't designed to be super,

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.440
super clear.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.740
Because you also have the
ounce as a measure of weight.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.110
You have the ounce that
is a measure of weight,

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.570
which is equal to
1/16 of a pound.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.920
And now you have a fluid
ounce, which you could either

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.804
view as 2 tablespoons or,
as we'll see, 1/8 of a cup.

00:01:54.804 --> 00:01:57.220
Now, you might say, well, why
are they both called ounces?

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.210
What's the relationship
between the two?

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.670
Well, there is somewhat of a
relationship between the two.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.020
If you took a little bit
over an ounce of water,

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.820
so a weight of ounce
of water, slightly

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.600
over an ounce of
water, that volume

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.830
is going to be
about a fluid ounce.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.740
An ounce of water in
weight and a fluid ounce

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.040
of water in volume are
very, very, very close,

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.990
although they aren't
exactly the same thing.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.970
Now, if you think about,
what would you measure here?

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.970
We already talked about recipes,
and teaspoon, tablespoon,

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:36.780
fluid ounce.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.940
You might be thinking
about how much medicine

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.080
maybe someone might take.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.913
Maybe they need to take
2 tablespoons, which

00:02:41.913 --> 00:02:43.680
would be equivalent
to a fluid ounce.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.980
Now, if you take 8 fluid ounces
and put them together-- so let

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.704
me draw a fluid ounce here
just so we still have drawings.

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:53.370
So you could imagine
some medicines have

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.170
a little cap on the top that
you could put the medicine in.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.590
So if you do 2
tablespoons in it,

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.140
maybe that will
be a fluid ounce.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.165
Now, if you take 8 fluid
ounces then you get to a cup.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.640
And many of us have
this in our kitchens.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.160
We have a measuring cup that
will measure exactly a cup.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.470
And you might have a
recipe for pancakes

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.110
that say, hey, put a
cup of flour in there.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.580
And also a lot of the cups
that you have in your house

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.660
might be around might be
around the size of a cup.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.690
If you look at,
say, a can of soda

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.760
that you're probably
familiar with, a can of soda,

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.130
the typical can of soda,
is 12 ounces, not 8 ounces.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.930
So a typical can of soda
is a cup and a half.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.240
We see that a cup
is 8 fluid ounces.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.010
A typical can of soda
is 12 fluid ounces.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.630
So it is equivalent
to a cup and a half.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.180
Let me make sure this looks
like a can of some kind.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.170
So if this was 12 ounces,
this is 1 and 1/2 cups.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.820
But it gets you a sense of
how much fluid volume a cup

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.350
actually is.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:16.589
Now, if we were to take 2 cups,
now you're dealing with a pint.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:20.550
And so you might
have seen pints.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.720
Sometimes they're in
these small cartons.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.202
So a pint might look something
like this in a carton.

00:04:28.202 --> 00:04:29.410
That looks more like a house.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.270
But I think, hopefully,
you get the picture

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.460
that this is intended to
be a carton of some kind.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.110
So you have something like that.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.150
And so the pint, it's 2 cups.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.160
And so let's say this is
the fluid inside of it.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.618
Let's say this was transparent,
and you might see it there.

00:04:42.618 --> 00:04:44.830
Or if you have a
very large mug, that

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.180
might be the size
of a pint, so if you

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.000
have a very large mug like this.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.310
So my best attempt at
drawing a large mug,

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.510
this might be roughly
equal to a pint.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.170
So let me put some
fluid in here.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.990
So there you go.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.250
There's my large mug.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.550
It's got a pint.

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:13.960
Now, if you take 2 pints, now
you are dealing with a quart.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.520
And you might have
found yourself

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.150
going to your local
convenience store

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.340
and buying a quart of milk.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:26.370
A quart of milk, those are kind
of those longer but still kind

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.560
of skinny looking-- so it
might look something like this.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.300
I'm trying to draw a
carton of a quart of milk.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.960
And then finally, if you were
to take 4 quarts together,

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.330
you get to a gallon.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.490
So you take 4 quarts
together-- so times 4--

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.940
you get to a gallon.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.747
So we're most familiar
with a gallon of milk.

00:05:56.747 --> 00:05:58.580
So let me see if I can
draw a gallon of milk

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.180
here, my best attempt.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.320
Well, I'm sure someone could
draw a better gallon of milk

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.820
here.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.780
But at least in the
US, it tends to be

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.490
one of the most typical
ways that they sell milk.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.710
And it has, oftentimes, a
little red or orange thing

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.940
right on top there,
so a gallon of milk.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.480
So just to review things,
right here, I just

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.400
multiplied from the smaller
unit to the larger one.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.330
But if you want to think about
everything in terms of ounces,

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.980
that's one way to
think about it.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:34.120
A cup right over here
is equal to 8 ounces.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.870
8 ounces is equal to a cup.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.990
If you multiply that by 2,
then you get to 16 ounces

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.470
is equal to a pint.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.270
If you multiply that by
2, you get 32 ounces.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.000
32 ounces is equal to a quart.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.770
And if you multiply
that times 4,

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.760
you get 30 times
4 is 120, plus 8.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:04.590
You get 128 ounces per gallon.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.040
And so next time you go buy
something in the supermarket,

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.580
I encourage you to look at
how it's being measured.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.650
And you'll see that oftentimes
you might buy a quart of milk,

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.620
but they'll also say that
this is a 32-ounce container.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:20.191
And in this context, they're
talking about fluid ounces.
