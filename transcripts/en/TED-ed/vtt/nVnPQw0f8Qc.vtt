00:00:15.287 --> 00:00:18.577
I don't know about you, but

00:00:18.577 --> 00:00:21.436
I'm trying to get this beach body,

00:00:21.436 --> 00:00:23.380
that P90X,

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.434
Brad Pitt,

00:00:25.434 --> 00:00:27.395
Bradley Cooper,

00:00:27.395 --> 00:00:29.431
Tyrese,

00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:31.907
Trey Songz,

00:00:31.907 --> 00:00:34.841
Matthew McConaughey

00:00:34.841 --> 00:00:36.070
beach body!

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.140
I'm trying to sweat in front of everybody.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.573
Word.

00:00:38.573 --> 00:00:42.130
And get that shorty with them Angelina Jolie lips

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.554
to lick my torso,

00:00:43.554 --> 00:00:45.966
get me looking like a wet chocolate.

00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:48.500
Look at my biceps.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.532
They're kind of puny.

00:00:50.532 --> 00:00:52.164
They're kind of chunky.

00:00:52.164 --> 00:00:53.789
But I've been working on them.

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.057
We can be models.

00:00:55.057 --> 00:00:57.661
I could take off my shirt mad sexy.

00:00:57.661 --> 00:00:58.956
I could stare at a camera intensely

00:00:58.956 --> 00:01:01.398
for 37 seconds straight and not blink.

00:01:01.398 --> 00:01:03.301
I could bathe in baby oil.

00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:05.134
I could run on the beach in slow motion.

00:01:05.134 --> 00:01:10.474
I could cat walk down a runway in zebra panties.

00:01:10.474 --> 00:01:12.960
I can't do that.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.074
Having a slow metabolism ruins everything.

00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:16.931
All my friends will be in tank tops,

00:01:16.931 --> 00:01:17.898
and I'll be in a hoodie.

00:01:17.898 --> 00:01:19.933
I'm good at zipping up my insecurities,

00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:21.469
thinking I could sweat them out.

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:23.703
I'm trying to get this beach body!

00:01:23.703 --> 00:01:24.838
I'm too skinny.

00:01:24.838 --> 00:01:27.642
I guzzle junk food like my mouth's a garbage chute,

00:01:27.642 --> 00:01:30.489
but my intestines are allergic to trans fat.

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:32.245
I want to be a flexing horse leg,

00:01:32.245 --> 00:01:35.078
galloping beach sand into a red carpet,

00:01:35.078 --> 00:01:36.750
customized for me

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.218
to strut the shore side

00:01:38.218 --> 00:01:40.351
like a centaur on a conveyor belt.

00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:42.656
I'm trying to get this beach body,

00:01:42.656 --> 00:01:44.798
but there is salvation in snack closets,

00:01:44.798 --> 00:01:46.327
on licked plates of seconds,

00:01:46.327 --> 00:01:48.526
at the bottom of a pint of ice cream.

00:01:48.526 --> 00:01:51.396
I use Haagen Dazs as a morphine cylinder

00:01:51.396 --> 00:01:55.269
because she said my arms weren't strong enough to carry her.

00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:56.870
I think I'm weak.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.538
I think I'm fat.

00:01:58.538 --> 00:01:59.826
I think I'm ugly.

00:01:59.826 --> 00:02:02.067
The beach is no place for a whale like me,

00:02:02.067 --> 00:02:04.878
for a mini van with its tank on E.

00:02:04.878 --> 00:02:06.848
I want to be Baywatch bareable,

00:02:06.848 --> 00:02:10.560
broken, bottle-cut, have you seen my muscles

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.192
and my scars?

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.503
You smell that?

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:18.497
That's macho moisture.

00:02:18.497 --> 00:02:20.735
My hour-long work out routine consists of

00:02:20.735 --> 00:02:22.837
5 minutes of push-ups on my bedroom floor,

00:02:22.837 --> 00:02:25.673
a denial mirror repelling my lanky limbs;

00:02:25.673 --> 00:02:28.641
5 minutes of keeping my chin high over the bar of self doubt;

00:02:28.641 --> 00:02:31.178
10 minutes placing 100 pounds of failure on my chest

00:02:31.178 --> 00:02:33.014
so it becomes the elephant in the room;

00:02:33.014 --> 00:02:34.343
10 minutes jogging with ghosts

00:02:34.343 --> 00:02:36.130
chuckling at my chunky thighs,

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.184
and I'll smile,

00:02:37.184 --> 00:02:40.359
knowing I'll soon be able to fit in my old butt pants;

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.588
30 minutes thinking sweat is a masculinity cloak.

00:02:43.588 --> 00:02:46.660
And I'm weary from trying to work out my irrational fears,

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.662
drown them in a puddle of perspiration,

00:02:48.662 --> 00:02:52.175
shove the imperfections I should be proud of under water:

00:02:52.175 --> 00:02:53.833
my gap-tooth smile,

00:02:53.833 --> 00:02:54.799
my frizzy hair,

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:55.935
my funny shaped head,

00:02:55.935 --> 00:02:57.972
the extra weight that kept me grounded,

00:02:57.972 --> 00:02:59.484
the missing pounds that make me

00:02:59.484 --> 00:03:02.138
a kite flailing free through the wind,

00:03:02.138 --> 00:03:04.444
not bound by muscle.

00:03:04.444 --> 00:03:05.711
So, yes,

00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:08.065
I'm trying to get this beach body,

00:03:08.065 --> 00:03:09.540
that Channing Tatum,

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.483
David Beckham,

00:03:10.483 --> 00:03:14.459
LL Cool J

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.781
beach body!

00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:18.523
But we're tired

00:03:18.523 --> 00:03:20.194
and exhausted

00:03:20.194 --> 00:03:23.659
from trying to be something we're not.
