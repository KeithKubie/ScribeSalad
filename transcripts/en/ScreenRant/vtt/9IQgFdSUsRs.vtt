10 Shocking Movie Mistakes That Slipped Into
The Final Film

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.770
Like any other line of work, mistakes are
made in the world of movie-making.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.690
However, unlike most other lines of work,
movie-making allows for the rectification

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.640
of said mistakes without any harm being done,
thanks to the people behind the movies having

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.340
the ability to reshoot and reproduce any scenes
in which mistakes are made.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.570
That being said, some mistakes actually occur
without anyone realising - and that means

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.180
they can end up being included in the finished
production.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.560
In this video, we'll take a look at some examples
of that happening.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.020
Here are ten shocking movie mistakes that
slipped into the final film.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.379
Zootopia
2016's Zootopia has quickly cemented itself

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.820
as one of the greatest animated movies of
all time - and its box office return of more

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.910
than $1 billion is well and truly justified
- but it certainly isn't without its flaws

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.679
(mostly in the form of continuity errors).In
fact, it's littered with mistakes, one of

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:55.030
which occurs when the black panther Manchas
turns savage and chases Judy and Nick through

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.030
the forest.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.489
Judy clearly drops her walkie talkie and it
falls quite a long way below where she's running.

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.640
However, a few moments later, it's inexplicably
reattached to her belt - and we don't believe

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.040
she can just call it back to her like Thor
does with Mjolnir!

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.980
Deadpool
The awesome Deadpool movie featured Ryan Reynolds

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.050
starring as the titular Marvel anti-hero,
who is known for his amazing ability to heal

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.390
from almost any injury very quickly - but,
if the movie is to be believed, his costume

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.890
has that same ability too!Of course, it doesn't
really, but in Deadpool's epic climactic fight

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.770
with Ed Skrein's Ajax, the Merc with a Mouth
gets stabbed in the head.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.430
Not only does his head heal fairly quickly,
but the resulting hole in his mask also miraculously

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.340
disappears once the knife is removed from
the wound.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.480
I could really use some clothes like that...

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.850
Jurassic Park
Jurassic Park is one of the most iconic movies

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:48.850
ever made.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.890
The 1993 offering brought dinosaurs to life
in a way no movie ever had before it - using

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.670
almost entirely practical effects to do so
- and that resulted in some fantastic scenes,

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.800
as well as some glaring mistakes.In the scene
in which the velociraptors enter the kitchen

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.920
in the visitor's centre, where Lex and Tim
are terrified and hiding, as the first raptor

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.450
makes its way through the door, you can clearly
see a member of the animatronics team's hand

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.670
reaching out to steady the creature's tail.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.020
Way to spoil the illusion, douchebag!

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.910
Avatar
The highest-grossing movie of all time by

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.090
quite a large margin, you'd be forgiven for
thinking that 2009's Avatar was the perfect

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.090
movie.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.290
It is, in fact, far from it, as it contains
a surprisingly high number of mistakes.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.859
In this instance, the mistake we're referring
to happens when Giovanni Ribisi's Parker Selfridge

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:35.859
- the corporate administrator for the RDA
mining operation in the movie - is practising

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:38.420
his putting in one of the RDA's control rooms.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.020
He has 3 golf balls and is shown putting one
of them - but the other two spontaneously

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.810
change from being close to each other, to
then being apart, to then being close to each

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.000
other again.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.049
Frozen
Frozen is nothing short of a phenomenon.

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.730
The success and popularity of the 2013 movie
is unprecedented and it remains the highest-grossing

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.290
animated movie of all time to this day.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.580
But it had some glaring errors in it.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.450
When Anna enters the art gallery singing "For
the First Time in Forever", there's a wide

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.370
shot of the room that shows that there are
no seats in there.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.420
However, when she starts jumping in front
of paintings and posing, she leaps off a seat

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.299
to do so - a seat that clearly appeared out
of thin air, as it wasn't there just seconds

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:18.829
before.

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.730
Titanic
Titanic is the second-highest grossing movie

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.659
of all time and is generally perceived as
being a cinematic masterpiece.

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:30.469
The acting was first class, as was the directing
of James Cameron, and the intricate set designs

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:34.970
were unbelievably high in detail, but there
were some major flaws in the movie.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.720
A prime example comes in the form of inconsistencies
in the design of the ship itself.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.650
Take the front of the ship, for example.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.670
The gaps in the railings change sizes, the
deck anchor characteristics change dramatically,

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.900
and the very front point of the ship changes
its shape - and that doesn't even come close

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.689
to covering all mistakes of that nature.

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:58.689
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope
Back when George Lucas first decided to make

00:03:58.689 --> 00:03:59.689
Star Wars, he had absolutely no idea just
how big the movie - and indeed the whole franchise

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:00.689
- would become.

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:01.689
As a result, he probably wasn't quite as careful
as he otherwise would've been when it came

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:02.689
to the movie's minor details.

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:03.689
Consequently, the original 1977 film is littered
with mistakes.

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:06.989
One such mistake occurs when Obi-Wan and Luke
enter the Mos Eisley Spaceport and trick the

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:13.190
Storm Troopers into letting them in by using
the force.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.350
One particular Storm Trooper, who is standing
behind their vehicle, suddenly disappears

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.350
in an instant.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.500
He's there in one shot and completely gone
in the next.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:29.080
Given that we don't believe he possessed magical
powers, that's an error.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.840
The Goonies
Ah The Goonies - so quintessentially 80s and

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.919
a throwback to the years when kids could still
be kids.

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.770
But enough of all that mushy, sentimental
nostalgic stuff, we're here to point out a

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.470
silly mistake that occurred before the movie
had even properly started.During the opening

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.590
credits, when we're introduced to Jonathan
Ke Huy Quan's Data, the young inventor is

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.500
seen testing out a new gadget.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.050
He fires a sucker at a trash can - which is
full of trash - and is inadvertently dragged

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.530
towards it before falling in.

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.580
However, when he falls in, it has suddenly
become empty.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.530
Self-emptying trash cans?!

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.509
Whatever next?

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:08.780
Despicable Me
One of the finest animated movies to ever

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.900
hit cinemas, 2010's Despicable Me contains
a plethora of memorable scenes - one of which

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.169
takes place in an amusement park, when Gru
is reluctantly persuaded into going there

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:19.460
by his adoptive daughters.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.520
A mistake occurs in this particular scene
when Gru and the girls ride on a roller coaster.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.800
When Gru gets onto the roller coaster, the
cart he gets in clearly has a pink safety

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.930
bar on it.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.740
However, when he exits the cart after the
ride has come to an end, the safety bar has

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.520
completely disappeared.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.470
Unless he tore it off in sheer terror during
the ride, that wasn't meant to be the case.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.680
Captain America: Civil War
The highest-grossing movie of 2016 so far,

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.860
even Captain America: Civil War contained
a number of mistakes - and one of them came

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.330
courtesy of the usually-so-meticulous Robert
Downey Jr.In the scene in which the Avengers

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.490
first speak to the United States Secretary
of State, Thaddeus Ross, Downey Jr's Tony

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.130
Stark alternates between wearing a wedding
ring and not wearing a wedding ring.

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.909
Downey Jr. is, of course, married in real
life, but Tony Stark isn't married in the

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:10.909
MCU, so this obviously comes courtesy of some
rare absent-mindedness on the part of the

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:12.479
Oscar-nominated actor.

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:14.349
Bad Robert!

movie mistakes that slipped into the final
