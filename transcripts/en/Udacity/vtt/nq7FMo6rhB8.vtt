00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.072
How about some very simple vision.

00:00:02.072 --> 00:00:04.820
Real so
we're not using a depth sensor anymore.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.730
And this is about as simple a vision as,
as you can imagine.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.820
So this is work that was
done by Frank Dellaert.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.100
Who's a professor now at Georgia Tech,
in our robotics and vision group.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.530
But in 1997,
he was like six years old it looks like.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.780
No that's not Frank,
that's some kid at the museum.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.900
Frank, Frank was doing
his PhD at the time.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.150
He did something very cool, they said
you know, we've got this ceiling and

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.190
this ceiling has lights in it.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.750
If we had a map of the lights
we should eventually be

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.300
able to figure out where we are by just
do we see light or don't we see light?

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.210
And the way that works is you had
a robot with a little camera that just

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.940
looked up, all right,
here's that little square.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.140
And it would just see,

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.950
did I see something bright,
medium, or sort of dark?

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.040
Right?
It would, it could just

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.260
get a small number of sensor values,
or you could think of it as just

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.110
taking the total value as saying
about how bright is that spot?

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.400
Now to do that what I have to be able
to do is given being anywhere in here,

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:13.010
I have to know what is the probability
of getting that brightness in the image.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.260
So, that's what this shows here.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.940
That, if this was
actually the brightness,

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.420
this is the probability of
the brightness that I would see.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.173
So the idea being if, if this is
the actual brightness of the state x of

00:01:26.173 --> 00:01:30.690
the position, then this is the,
the likelihood of, of what I would see.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.900
So for example,
suppose I'm under a light, okay?

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.960
So typically what I see is
this brightish patch here, and

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.970
this map is the likelihood of
getting that bright measurement at

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.430
these locations, and, and by the way in
this map, the black are the high points.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.690
So you see each one of these lights?

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.200
So if I was actually under the lights,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.860
the likelihood of seeing
something bright is high.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.490
Otherwise, the likelihood of
seeing something bright is low.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.230
Sort of near a light, I'm going to see
the, tend to see these gray things.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.110
And when I'm far away from a light,
I'm going to see mostly darkness.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.910
So those are, are p of z's given x.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.430
And then, here's the thing running,
And it's a little hard to see,

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.040
you see all these red dots going?

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.390
And what's happening is the robot is
actually following this red line.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.060
And it comes in, and it goes down.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.890
And you'll notice, after a little while,
it knows exactly where it is.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.370
Now it's going to turn off to the,
to the right over here somewhere.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.120
And you see.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.280
If it hangs out in a dark area for a
while, it's uncertainty grows because it

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.760
doesn't know exactly where it's moving
in that dark, in that dark area, okay?

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.680
So you're watching it and
it's doing some cool stuff.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.500
What's interesting is, so
we have this map of the thing.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.750
We can compare two things.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.170
The robot knows the commands
that it gave to its wheels.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.860
Okay?

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.070
So it knows how far it thinks it went.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.830
It also knows how much
it thinks it turned.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.380
You guys have an odometer in your car?

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.650
The odometer measures distance.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.450
Odometry is when you measure how you

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.110
think you move based upon
how your wheels turned.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.470
If we plot on this map where
the robot thinks it went based upon

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.140
it's wheels turning, we see something
that looks like this, okay?

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.080
And the reason we know that that's wrong

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.460
Is that these are areas that
it can't actually go through.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.000
And you see it gets, sort of, right,
but then it, sort of, gets a little

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.470
confused, and it's going through parts
that it cant' actually go through.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.040
When we add vision, and
why do I say add vision?

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.500
Well, we still use the odometry
as the deterministic part.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.780
Make him jump for that thing, right?

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.820
So, the odometry says, well,
you moved a foot to the right.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:48.420
Okay?

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.210
So, we add that.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.820
That's our prediction part, so
we still use the odometry, but

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.860
then the measurement from
the vision improves our result.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.890
Okay?
And that gets us the much better result.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.590
And this is using essentially a camera
just looking at a little area and

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.680
saying am I bright or am I dark or
how, how bright is it and

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.470
I have a map of the ceiling.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.450
So it's pretty cool.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.015
Well done, Frank.
