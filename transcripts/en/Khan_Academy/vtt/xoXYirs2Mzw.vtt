00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.290
Tracy is putting out
decorative bowls of potpourri

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.970
in each room of the
hotel where she works.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.210
She wants to fill each bowl
with 1/5 of a can of potpourri.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.460
If Tracy has 4 cans of
potpourri, in how many rooms

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.440
can she place a
bowl of potpourri?

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.960
So she has 4 cans, and
she wants to divide this 4

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.544
cans into groups
of 1/5 of a can.

00:00:25.544 --> 00:00:27.210
So if you have 4 of
something and you're

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.376
trying to divide it into
groups of a certain amount,

00:00:29.376 --> 00:00:32.280
you would divide by
that amount per group.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.780
So you want to divide 4 by 1/5.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.650
You want to divide 4 cans of
potpourri into groups of 1/5.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.480
So let's visualize this.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.430
Let me draw one can of
potpourri right over here.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.565
So one can of potpourri can
clearly be cut up into 5/5.

00:00:55.565 --> 00:00:56.690
We have it right over here.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.640
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.660
So 1 can of potpourri
can fill 5 bowls

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.740
if you put 1/5 in each bowl.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.570
Now, we have 4 cans.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.280
So let me paste these.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.050
So 2, 3, and 4.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.020
So how many total bowls of
potpourri can Tracy fill?

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.370
Well, she's got 4 cans.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.635
So this is going to
be equal to-- let

00:01:27.635 --> 00:01:29.580
me do this is the right
color-- this is going

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.500
to be equal to, once
again, she has 4 cans.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.070
And then for each
of those cans, she

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.920
can fill 5 bowls of potpourri
because each bowl only

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.080
requires a 1/5 of those cans.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.440
So this is going to be the
same thing as 4 times 5.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.570
Or we can even write
this as 4 times 5 over 1.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.720
5 is the same
thing as 5/1, which

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.030
is the same thing
as 4 times 5, which,

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.220
of course, is equal to 20.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.800
She can fill 20 cans-- or I
should say, with her 4 cans,

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.440
she can fill 20
bowls of potpourri.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.190
Now, just as a
review here, we've

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.420
already seen that
dividing by a number

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.910
is equal to multiplying
by its reciprocal.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.410
And we see that right over here.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.670
Dividing by 1/5
is the same thing

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.130
as multiplying by the
reciprocal of 1/5, which is 5/1.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.662
So she could fill up
20 bowls of potpourri.
