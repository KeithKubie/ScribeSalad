00:00:03.952 --> 00:00:06.290
- Good afternoon, and
welcome to Radcliffe.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.280
My name is Janet Rich-Edwards,
and I am an epidemiologist,

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.890
and also the Life Sciences
Adviser to the Radcliffe

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.660
Institute for Advanced Study.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.460
And we are so pleased
to see you here.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:17.960
I'm excited.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.560
We had to move this
talk from a smaller room

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.280
into this auditorium to
accommodate your interest.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.906
This talk is one of several
in a series on epidemics.

00:00:30.906 --> 00:00:32.530
I hope you were with
us back in October

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.010
when we did a day-long event.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.530
But in addition
to today's talk, I

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.220
want to let you know that there
are cards in the back that

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.320
include the dates of our final
two lectures in the series,

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.190
including one on Obesity:
It's More Complex

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.890
Than You Think --on
March 27, and then,

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.480
another one on the
Alzheimer's Enigma:

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.200
the Cause Of the Dementia
Epidemic, on April 23rd.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.040
Today, I have the pleasure
of introducing Abdul El-Sayed

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.910
to you.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.560
He's the former
health commissioner

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.209
of the city of Detroit.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:07.880
He has a medical degree
from Columbia University,

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.790
and was a Rhodes Scholar
at Oxford, where he earned

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.800
his doctorate in Public Health.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.780
He is a native Michigander
who grew up in metro Detroit.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.535
As many of you know,
he's running for Governor

00:01:20.535 --> 00:01:22.160
for the state of
Michigan, and launched

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.640
his gubernatorial
campaign after witnessing

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.010
the systematic failures in
Flint and across the state.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.650
He left his position as
an assistant professor

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.690
in Columbia's Department
of Epidemiology

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.430
to return to Michigan.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.410
He became the youngest
health official

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.500
in a major American city when
Mayor Mike Duggan appointed

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.210
Abdul to rebuild
Detroit's health

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.180
department after
it was privatized

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.310
during the city's bankruptcy.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.860
As Health Commissioner, he
was responsible for the health

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.220
and safety of over
670,000 Detroiters.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.160
He worked tirelessly to ensure
government accountability

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.740
and transparency
to promote health

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.620
and to reduce
cross-generational poverty.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.170
And today's lecture
will deal with that--

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.680
The Epidemic of Poverty:
The Government Imperative.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.998
Please join me in
welcoming Abdul El-Sayed.

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:14.866
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.780
- All right, good afternoon.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.550
So you've got to forgive me.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.170
As a politician now,
the town hall style just

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.090
never leaves you, so--

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.840
good afternoon.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.340
Thank you.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.690
Hey.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.550
It is an honor and a
privilege to be here today.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.102
To Dr. Rich-Edwards
and the conveners,

00:02:41.102 --> 00:02:42.560
I really appreciate
the opportunity

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.230
to speak, and to
talk about an issue

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.980
that I believe animates
much of our work for people

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.090
who are oriented to solving the
challenge of human suffering.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.700
I started my career as a
physician and epidemiologist.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.520
I'm now running for governor.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.552
And to just sort of
orient you as to why--

00:03:02.552 --> 00:03:04.790
you know, I was never
supposed to run for office.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.680
In fact, the first time anybody
with any degree of knowledge

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.330
of the political
process suggested

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.920
that I should run
for governor, it

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.030
was at my college commencement.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.390
I was the valedictorian
of my class

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.596
at the University of
Michigan, and I was selected

00:03:19.596 --> 00:03:20.720
to give the student speech.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.870
Now, the speaker that anybody,
including my own parents

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.530
actually came to listen to
was President Bill Clinton.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.930
And I got to give
my student speech,

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.560
and President Clinton
gave his actual speech,

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.230
and he was so kind as to
mention my speech in his speech.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.640
Now, it was the first time my
Egyptian immigrant father ever

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.717
mentioned anything related
to pride and my name

00:03:42.717 --> 00:03:44.300
in the same sentence,
which was great.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.690
But after the speech, President
Clinton sort of sought me out.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.270
And he turned me
around and said,

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.112
son, why are you
going to med school?

00:03:57.112 --> 00:03:58.570
That is not a
question that anybody

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.460
asks a graduating senior who's
going to medical school, right.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.270
And I just looked
at him for a minute.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.340
The first thing
that came to my mind

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.110
was, well, President
Clinton, we're brown.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.174
That's what we do.

00:04:09.174 --> 00:04:10.476
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.040
But I told him, look, I love
people, and I love science,

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.589
and I think that this is the
way that I want to serve.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.089
And he said, you
know, son, you have

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:20.589
a real gift for
communicating, and I

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:23.960
hope that, someday, you might
consider running for office.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.140
And I couldn't help
it, but the first thing

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.570
that came to my
mind was, I don't

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.760
know if you saw my
first name, but there

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.720
are 11 letters in that name,
and that's just the first name.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.170
This is not in the cards
for someone like me.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.870
He said, well,
look, I understand.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.220
I get it.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.980
But I hope that,
someday, you'll consider.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.610
And to explain why I'm
ultimately doing this thing

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.150
has everything to do with the
life of a 3-year-old little boy

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.490
whom I had the
privilege of serving

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.770
when I was Health Commissioner
in the city of Detroit.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.890
His name was Demaryius
He was the fourth child

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.240
of a 21-year-old mom.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.420
He met his father, probably,
about four times in his life,

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.970
because his dad's in jail.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.280
But before I tell you
how I met Demaryius,

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.580
I want to share with you the
context within which I met him.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.080
I grew up in a
family that was built

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.640
by Mohamed El-Sayed and Jackie
Johnson, now Jackie El-Sayed.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.650
And Mohamed El-Sayed
is the eldest

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.650
of six born to a
vegetable salesman

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.900
and the smartest,
wisest woman I've

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.030
ever met in my life,
who is my grandmother,

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.370
[? Sohad, ?] who never got
to spend a day in school.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.780
She was illiterate.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.940
They raised their six
kids, of the eight

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.940
that she gave birth to,
in a one-bedroom apartment

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.700
overlooking the fish market
where my grandfather sold

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.590
vegetables every day.

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.437
And my dad knew
that, if he was going

00:05:41.437 --> 00:05:43.520
to walk a path that was
any different than the one

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.410
that his father
had walked, that he

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.720
was going to have to build
that path for himself

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.560
with an education.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.760
And by all means, he did.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.950
He had the opportunity,
when he finally

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.230
graduated from his
undergraduate program

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.750
in engineering, to
pick one of two places

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.490
that he was going
to immigrate to.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.280
It was either going to be
Bairoit, Germany, or Detroit,

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.010
Michigan.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.540
My dad has an affinity for
the sound, roit, it seems.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.400
But the only two similarities
between Detroit and Bairoit

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.650
is that they're both places
where people make cars,

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.450
and they both end
in the sound, roit.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.740
And so my dad was somebody
who did his homework.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.406
And when he did his
homework, he learned

00:06:18.406 --> 00:06:21.200
about a Detroit that was in
the United States of America.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.600
And he made the decision to
come to this country because

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.660
of the ideals upon which
the country was founded.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.690
Now, my stepmother, who raised
me from the age of three,

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.030
could not come from
different circumstances.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.877
She was born and
raised in a place

00:06:33.877 --> 00:06:35.210
called Gratiot County, Michigan.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.210
So you're going to pardon
my Michigan-ness here,

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.590
but Gratiot County's just here.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.310
And her family has been
in this part of the world

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.440
since before the
Revolutionary War.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.946
She can draw her lineage
to Abigail Adams,

00:06:48.946 --> 00:06:51.320
which is just funny, because
my younger brother's name is

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.130
Osama.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.380
So he's, like, the only blue
blood Osama in the world.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.520
And so I got to grow up in
this incredible, multi-ethnic,

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.880
multi-faith,
multi-context family.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.700
And my summers would have
me getting on an airplane,

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.644
going off to
Alexandria, Egypt, where

00:07:09.644 --> 00:07:11.810
I'd hang out with my
grandparents, aunts and uncles,

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:12.710
and cousins.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.420
And then I'd come back, in
the middle of the summer,

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.086
to a place called
Montcalm County, where

00:07:16.086 --> 00:07:20.090
my family has had a cottage on
a lake for the past 90 years.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.950
And I'd hang out with the other
side, and my grandparents,

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.260
aunts and uncles, and cousins.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.830
And I came to
appreciate some things.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:31.250
When your grandmother
kisses you on the forehead,

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.350
or tells you you should
eat a little bit more,

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:36.560
or calls you an idiot,
it's with the same love,

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.380
regardless if it's
your grandmother who

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.510
raised six kids, never
got to go to school,

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.970
in Alexandria, Egypt,
or your grandmother who

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.420
raised three kids and is a nurse
in Gratiot County, Michigan.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:52.400
And I came to appreciate that
the things that make us human,

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.130
that bind us in who
we are, tend to be

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.582
far bigger than the things
that differentiate us,

00:07:57.582 --> 00:07:59.540
despite the fact that,
if you were to introduce

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.600
my grandmother [? Sohad ?]
to my grandmother Judy,

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:07.050
and share with them the fact
that they share a grandchild,

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:08.720
that would have
blown their minds.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.540
And that's the blessing
of having grown up

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.070
in this country.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:16.080
Now, my father grew
up in a market.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.802
And so he has this real
affinity for outdoor markets.

00:08:18.802 --> 00:08:20.510
And there's this
incredible market called

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:21.760
the Eastern Market in Detroit.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.390
Anybody ever been there before?

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.949
All right, so if you ever go to
Detroit, tell him I sent you.

00:08:25.949 --> 00:08:26.990
You got to go over there.

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:29.270
There's the guy who
sells mushrooms--

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:33.650
the kind that you eat
--and they're fantastic.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:39.409
And so we used to drive from
the suburb just north of Detroit

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:41.690
into the city to
Detroit most Saturdays.

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:46.326
And one of the things that
struck me during my childhood--

00:08:46.326 --> 00:08:48.200
I think when you're the
most perceptive about

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.560
the world --is that
the difference in life

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.250
opportunities and expectations
that we would drive in that 30

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.880
minutes was the same
as it would take me

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.560
eight hours to cross when
I'd go off to Alexandria.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:07.190
And that, to me, was the
framing for everything

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.830
I was interested in
throughout my education.

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:14.150
Why is it that you can travel 30
minutes and 10 years difference

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:17.890
in life expectancy in these
United States of America?

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:21.150
So I knew that I loved people.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:22.830
And my parents are
both engineers,

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.220
so I knew I loved science.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:27.300
And I thought, I wanted to do
something about that chasm,

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:31.290
that 30-minute/10-year
life expectancy chasm.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:35.190
And that ultimately
led to the opportunity

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:38.490
to study biology and politics
at the University of Michigan.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:39.529
I went off to Oxford.

00:09:39.529 --> 00:09:41.820
I was a Rhodes scholar, and
did a PhD in public health,

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.440
and then went to medical school.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.570
And, in my last year
of medical school,

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:48.510
I came to appreciate that
the clinical world that I

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.364
had thought I wanted
to inhabit was not

00:09:50.364 --> 00:09:51.780
going to be the
one that was going

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:54.090
to equip me with
the set of tools

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:57.090
to be able to solve
that difference.

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:58.620
Studying biology
and politics, one

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.036
of the more interesting things
that you come to appreciate

00:10:01.036 --> 00:10:03.920
is that, actually, these
systems are quite similar.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.500
If of biology is a set of
rules by which our cells make

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.980
complex decisions about scarce
resources in our bodies,

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:14.880
politics is just a set of rules
by which our communities make

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.240
complex decisions about
scarce resources in society.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.340
And if you want to understand
why people get sick,

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.350
we spend a lot of time
focused on the biology,

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.680
the odd decisions that
cells sometimes make.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:30.060
But we don't focus as much on
the decisions that communities

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.420
sometimes make, and the ways
in which those decisions

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:37.590
ultimately pattern access
to all the means of health

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:38.800
and disease--

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.530
a good job that pays
a living wage, that

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:42.510
puts a good roof
over someone's head,

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:45.344
puts clean air in their lungs,
clean water in their cups,

00:10:45.344 --> 00:10:47.010
allows them to walk
in their communities

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:50.280
without being victimized by
either a neighbor or the state

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.000
itself.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.500
Those are the things
that ultimately

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.090
pattern health and disease.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.910
That is what differentiates
the experience

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:59.280
that I got to grow up
in from the experience

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.320
that so many live in
the city of Detroit.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.410
And so I spent the first
couple of years of my career

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.740
as an academic doing
research around trying

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:12.177
to understand how we think
about policy relevant to health

00:11:12.177 --> 00:11:14.260
disparities, and realized
pretty quickly that most

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.020
of the people around me were
a lot smarter than I was,

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.720
and that my best skill set
was probably more navigating

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.000
the bureaucracy, which a
lot of my academic friends

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.610
found so difficult, but
that seemed so much more

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:27.670
native to me, and realized
that it was probably my curtain

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:30.010
call on an academic career.

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:32.440
And I knew that I wanted
it to be about solving,

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.170
hands-on, that chasm.

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:38.200
And so I got that opportunity
when, by happenstance,

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.600
a friend of mine started working
with the Mayor of Detroit.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.785
And I had called him up, we
were planning to do lunch,

00:11:44.785 --> 00:11:47.260
and on a whim, I
brought a couple of CVs.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.120
Two weeks later, I'm
having a conversation

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.330
with the Mayor of Detroit
about public health in Detroit.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.306
And a month later,
I'm walking in

00:11:55.306 --> 00:11:56.680
to the Detroit
Health Department,

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.280
as Health Commissioner, to
rebuild a Health Department

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.280
that had been shut down.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.600
Now, let me tell you the story
of public health in Detroit.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:09.780
Detroit first had a health
department beginning in 1827.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:13.210
And, in 2012, the
city went bankrupt,

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:15.010
and they made the
decision to shut down

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:18.280
their 185-year-old
Health Department.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.530
This, in a city with a
higher infant mortality

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.290
rate than my father's
native Egypt,

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:26.020
in a city where our children
face triple the probability

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.640
of being hospitalized
for asthma,

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.060
quadruple the probability
of being exposed to lead,

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.530
than the state average.

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:34.660
They shut down their
health department.

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:38.570
I was hired in 2015 to rebuild
that Health Department.

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:41.830
Now, I didn't quite appreciate
what I was walking into.

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:44.650
When we started, we
had five city employees

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:48.100
and 85 contractors in the back
of the building in Detroit

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.170
where people go to pay
their parking tickets.

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:53.380
So, first day of work, I know
I look a little bit young.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:56.150
And, at that point,
I was 30 years old.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.230
So I grew my beard
out a little bit more.

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:00.300
I put on my big boy
suit and my big boy tie.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.140
Walking in, first day,
you're the commissioner.

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:04.660
You're going to commission.

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.640
Nobody ever tells
you what that means.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.110
But you're going
to do it anyway.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:11.050
And this guy walks up
to me from the right.

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:13.272
Hey, you, you work here?

00:13:13.272 --> 00:13:14.980
I looked at him for
a minute, I was like,

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.540
all right, the commissioner.

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:17.780
Yes, I do work here.

00:13:20.412 --> 00:13:21.120
He's like, great.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.637
Can you take my parking
ticket in for me.

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:25.470
I was like, no, sir.

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:27.244
I'm the-- I'm the
Health Commissioner.

00:13:27.244 --> 00:13:28.410
He looks at me for a minute.

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:32.270
He's like, why are you walking
to the parking building?

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:33.110
I look at him.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:35.318
I was like, you know what,
I'm actually asking myself

00:13:35.318 --> 00:13:36.860
the same question.

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:38.000
So we got his ticket paid.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.150
Problem solved.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:42.740
First three weeks of work--

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:45.140
you've got to imagine the
circumstance that I'm in.

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:48.410
My job is ostensibly to provide
basic public health goods

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:51.800
and services for 700,000 people
who have been systematically

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.100
marginalized by every single
level of government intended

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.630
to serve them.

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:59.120
And I didn't even
know where to begin.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.120
I knew everything I could
know about the theory

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.350
of public health.

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:05.630
I'd gone to different
graduate schools

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:07.550
to learn what public health is.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:09.830
And I still didn't have
an operational definition

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:12.500
that would actually
help me to do my job.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:15.690
And that's when I got
to meet Demaryius.

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:18.950
So Demaryius, I met him when
I was touring our vaccination

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:20.700
clinic.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.867
And this kid walks in with
about as much charisma

00:14:23.867 --> 00:14:24.950
as you can imagine, right.

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:27.033
This 3-year-old little
kid, just got this saunter,

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:28.190
this swagger about himself.

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:30.680
I was like, this kid,
I need some of that.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.010
And he just had these
big brown eyes, and just,

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:36.410
this personality
that lit up the room.

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:39.117
And when his mom figured out
who I was, and introduced me

00:14:39.117 --> 00:14:41.450
to him-- you know, I've been
introduced to a fair number

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:42.241
of three-year-olds.

00:14:42.241 --> 00:14:44.990
And usually the way it goes is
that the parent will say, hey,

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:45.860
meet this person.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.601
And the three-year-old will
look at you just enough

00:14:48.601 --> 00:14:50.600
to realize they don't
know who you are, and then

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.790
bury their face back into
their parents, right.

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:53.760
Kid didn't do that.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.974
Looks me right in the eye,
shakes my hand, gives me a hug,

00:14:56.974 --> 00:14:57.890
walks back to his mom.

00:14:57.890 --> 00:14:59.000
I was looking at this kid.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.460
I was like, this kid is
either the most rational

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.050
or the most confident
three-year-old

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:05.210
I've ever met in my life.

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:08.810
And, in that moment, I
couldn't help but contrast

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:13.070
his confidence to the
set of circumstances

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:14.111
in which he's living.

00:15:14.111 --> 00:15:16.360
I already told you about the
public health statistics.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.430
But just, probabilistically,
if this kid

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:22.100
graduates from his decrepit,
underfunded public school

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:25.640
system in the city of
Detroit, his probability

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.040
of winding up in jail
remains statistically higher

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.390
than it does of
winding up in college.

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:33.740
And I realized that,
for me, the definition

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:35.300
of public health
that mattered most

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:41.020
was, that which gave this child
a justification for the kind

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:45.070
of confidence that he and
any other child of his age

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:48.010
should have in the life that
he or she is going to live.

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:50.080
That is the work of
government, fundamentally,

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.940
is that we have to
be about justifying

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:54.070
that kind of confidence,
that kind of swagger,

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:57.010
that kind of believe in yourself
and the world in which you live

00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:58.720
that you, in fact,
if you do your work,

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.720
will have access to the kinds of
opportunities that you deserve.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.110
And that's what led us to
thinking about our Health

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:08.680
Department, and setting
ourselves a vision and a thesis

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.150
for how it was
that we were going

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:12.190
to rebuild this department.

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:14.170
We rebuilt Detroit's
Health Department

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:15.910
around the goal of
leveraging health

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:18.280
to disrupt
intergenerational poverty.

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:21.490
Because, if you think about
what the epidemic of poverty is,

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:24.370
that boy is patient zero.

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:28.150
And if we're not optimizing
around his experience,

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:29.650
and the experiences
of the people

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:32.200
that make his life
what it is, then we're

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.880
missing the point entirely.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.730
So often, in government, it's
easy to think in abstract,

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:39.310
to talk about tackling
one problem or the other

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:41.070
without actually
optimizing around

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:43.720
the lived experience
of the people who

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.000
we are intended to serve.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.510
And so, for us, we identified
a set of critical outcomes

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:55.100
that we saw as being a part
of the cycle of poverty.

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.190
Teen pregnancy.

00:16:57.190 --> 00:17:00.430
16% of all births in
the city of Detroit

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:02.650
are unintended to a teen mother.

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:07.540
And if a young woman gets
pregnant without intending

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:09.490
to before graduating
high school,

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:13.180
her probability of dropping
out is about 50%, one in two.

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:18.440
Infant mortality.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.569
Our infant mortality rate
in the City of Detroit

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:22.609
is higher than my
father's native Egypt.

00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:25.849
It is the highest of any
big city in the country.

00:17:25.849 --> 00:17:29.360
And we set our goal to
address infant mortality,

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.570
because, if a child
is in a position where

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:34.520
the probability
of death is high,

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:39.790
that kid already starts their
life behind everyone else.

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:40.810
Lead poisoning.

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:43.600
We all know the
biophysics of lead,

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.690
and what it does to a
young, developing mind.

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:49.420
And so it doesn't matter what
you do around the investment

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:52.510
if you've already poisoned
that mind and its ability

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:55.240
to move, and leverage,
and make sense

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.900
of information and knowledge.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:58.680
Vision deficits.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.290
If you can't see what's
happening on the school board,

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:04.460
it doesn't matter what's
happening on the school board.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:05.570
Asthma.

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:08.540
A child with
persistent asthma is

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:12.870
likely to miss a day of
school every two weeks--

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:15.080
any sort of persistent asthma.

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.870
And if you're talking about
moderate-to-severe persistent

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:19.890
asthma, you're talking
about a day every week.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:23.180
Imagine trying to learn when
you're missing a day every week

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.172
because you can't breathe.

00:18:25.172 --> 00:18:27.130
And instead of spending
a day in the classroom,

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:30.840
you're spending a day
in the emergency room.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:31.870
Misnutrition.

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:36.510
We find this brutal paradox
among low-income children,

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:38.124
disproportionately
children of color,

00:18:38.124 --> 00:18:39.540
in communities
like Detroit, where

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.509
they have too much of
the macronutrients that

00:18:42.509 --> 00:18:44.550
build the guts, and too
few of the micronutrients

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:45.659
that build the brain.

00:18:45.659 --> 00:18:47.700
And so it's not even that
it's just malnutrition,

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.050
it's about the wrong nutrition.

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:50.880
It's misnutrition.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.000
And then, finally,
elderly isolation.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.530
And one would say, well, if
you're focused on children,

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:56.575
why elderly isolation?

00:18:56.575 --> 00:18:58.950
Well, the single best thing
you can do for a young person

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:01.470
is give them access
to an older person who

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.270
cares about their life.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:05.687
And too many of our seniors
in places like Detroit

00:19:05.687 --> 00:19:07.770
fundamentally can't get
around, because of the way

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:09.420
that we've built our city.

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.100
And I want to share
with you just four

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.834
of the projects that we
kicked off to try and disrupt

00:19:14.834 --> 00:19:16.500
this cycle of
intergenerational poverty,

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.470
break down the barriers
that kids like Demaryius

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:22.470
had to being able to learn and
earn in Detroit, like we would

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:25.205
want for any child, anywhere.

00:19:25.205 --> 00:19:26.580
Around infant
mortality, we built

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:29.100
a program called Sister
Friends with the idea

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:32.250
that so many women who are
caring for the first time

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:34.140
don't have high-quality
mentorship,

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.870
and are not connected to
the resources that do exist.

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:39.750
And a lot of that has to do
with the brutal geography

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:41.100
of the city of Detroit.

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:45.450
So much of the attention is paid
to eight square miles of 138.

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:48.630
And so many of the people
live in those other 130.

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:51.420
And so folks don't have access
to those kinds of resources,

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:53.460
both as a function of
knowledge, and also,

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:55.230
as a function of geography.

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.810
And so, if you're able to
equip a young woman who's

00:19:57.810 --> 00:19:59.880
carrying for the
first time with access

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.610
to a mentor who's not
going to judge her,

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:05.040
and is able to empower
her just by being there,

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.890
and also because that
person can connect her

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:10.530
to the resources that
exist in the city,

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:12.750
then you have a chance
of being able to reduce

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:14.460
the probability
of pre-term birth,

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.970
and ultimately,
infant mortality.

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:22.620
Around teen pregnancy,
we know that so much

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.920
of the unwanted pregnancy
burden in Detroit

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.020
is a function of lack
of access to very

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.330
basic pre-conception
family planning services.

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:34.470
We have one Planned Parenthood
clinic serving 700,000 people

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:35.490
in the city of Detroit.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:37.420
And it's right in midtown.

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:39.930
Are you guys familiar
with Shinola watches?

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:42.790
It's walking distance
from Shinola.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:46.654
And so think about where
the burden of need is,

00:20:46.654 --> 00:20:48.070
and we're not
serving that burden.

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:50.280
So what we wanted to
do was provide access

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.770
to pre-conception
family planning services

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:56.660
in the neighborhoods in which
young women live, learn, pray,

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:57.600
and play.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.850
And so we wanted to
put them in contexts

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:02.770
that were discreet, that we're
not going to be stigmatized.

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:05.460
So, for example, if you were
able to put such a clinic

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:08.640
in a rec center, it's possible
that a woman could just as

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.700
easily be walking in to have a
conversation about controlling

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.190
her fertility as she could
to be playing basketball.

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:17.250
And so we wanted to provide
these services in the places

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:20.090
that people actually are.

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:22.700
When it came to asthma,
so much of the burden

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:26.150
of asthma in Detroit is driven
by the poor quality of air

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:29.450
that we have in a
highly-industrial city.

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:31.190
Corporations that
pollute have had

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:33.800
their way, with both
state and city government,

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.510
for the past several decades.

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:37.580
We built an environmental
justice practice

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:39.650
to stand up against
these polluters when--

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:43.040
Marathon Petroleum, that has a
refinery in southwest Detroit,

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:47.720
the most polluted
zip code in Detroit

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.882
and in the state
of Michigan --we

00:21:49.882 --> 00:21:51.840
were able to organize
with the local community.

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.970
The Michigan Department
of Environmental Quality,

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:55.920
who is supposed to
regulate on these issues,

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.750
was set to OK the deal.

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:00.330
And we organized,
and we stood up.

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:02.340
And together, the
voice of the community

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:05.839
was able to force Marathon
Petroleum to reduce

00:22:05.839 --> 00:22:08.130
their emissions, when they
had wanted to increase them,

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:11.700
investing $10 billion
to clean up their act.

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.650
We did the same
thing when it came

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:19.180
to uncovered piles of petroleum
coke on the Detroit riverfront.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.690
We were able to
force that operator

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:23.280
to cover their piles
up if they wanted

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:27.600
to store these piles that
release fugitive dust,

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.880
and ultimately get into
the lungs of our children.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:39.750
When it came to the issue
of water and lead poisoning,

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:42.000
we had built a program
called the Lead Safe Detroit.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.310
Now, let tell you what
Lead Safe Detroit was.

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:47.340
We were in a situation
where so many of our kids

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:49.890
that had been tested
positive for lead poisoning

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:51.222
would fall through the cracks.

00:22:51.222 --> 00:22:53.430
We weren't able to move all
of the goods and services

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:55.440
that we could offer
these kids to these kids,

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.630
because there was no system of
actually managing the cases.

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:01.290
And so we would convene
a meeting, every month,

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:04.680
where we would sit with all of
the agencies that touch lead,

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:08.670
together, and case manage every
single case of lead poisoning,

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:11.142
to make sure that every child
had access to everything

00:23:11.142 --> 00:23:11.850
that they needed.

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:13.410
But there were
circumstances that

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:15.120
reminded us that we
weren't doing enough

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.260
to prevent in the first place.

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:20.940
And so I had just finished
inspecting city schools

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:23.250
when I heard about the
Flint water crisis.

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:24.690
Our teachers in Detroit--

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:26.730
some of the most
courageous public servants

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:30.360
you can talk about, who are
doing the impossible every day

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.707
in communities where
they are under-resourced

00:23:32.707 --> 00:23:35.040
and without the means of being
able to just basically do

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:38.760
their job --they had
conducted a sick-out,

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:42.630
because their buildings
were not meeting code.

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:46.590
And so, as a city, we
inspected every single school

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:47.730
in the school district.

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:49.396
I personally inspected
a couple of them.

00:23:49.396 --> 00:23:50.940
I want you to imagine,
with me, this.

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:54.330
Imagine you're walking into
a first grade classroom.

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:55.570
It's 11:00 AM.

00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:57.840
It's about February 1st.

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:01.350
And the first thing that
you see is a first grader

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:02.400
wearing their coats.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.577
It's 11:00 AM.

00:24:03.577 --> 00:24:05.160
And the minute you
walk into the room,

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:08.730
you feel the chill, kind of
like when you walk outside.

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:10.200
And you realize
that those kids go

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.870
to school in that circumstance
almost every single day,

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:15.540
because the boilers in
their buildings don't work.

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:17.580
And then you start
looking around the room,

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:20.190
and you see, in the
corner, a dead mouse.

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:21.750
Now, not just any dead mouse.

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:22.899
The mouse didn't just die.

00:24:22.899 --> 00:24:24.690
The mouse is literally
in a state of decay,

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:27.444
suggesting it's
been there for days.

00:24:27.444 --> 00:24:29.110
And then you walk out
of that classroom,

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:30.693
and you're walking
by the gym, and you

00:24:30.693 --> 00:24:32.230
smell the smell of mold.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:34.397
And you look inside, and
you see the gym floor

00:24:34.397 --> 00:24:35.980
buckling because of
the amount of mold

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:38.110
growing underneath that floor.

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:39.610
These are the
circumstances in which

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:40.960
kids go to school in Detroit.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.890
And we realized that,
given those circumstances,

00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:46.390
it was possible
that our kids could

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:49.810
be exposed to the same lead we
were hearing about in Flint,

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:51.760
in the single place
where we systematically

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:55.520
concentrate most of our
kids, most of the day,

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.226
most of the year.

00:24:57.226 --> 00:24:58.600
And so we put
together a protocol

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.300
to have every single school,
day care, and Head Start tested

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:04.330
for lead in the water, tested
all 360 buildings in six

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:06.400
months, and created a
protocol that is now

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:09.160
model practice nationwide.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:15.060
Now you think about the
circumstances of a life.

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.270
And I shared with you
some of the work that we

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:19.410
did at the Health Department.

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:24.080
And if our goal is to tackle
this epidemic of poverty,

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.150
then focusing on
health is certainly

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:28.430
one approach to doing that.

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:31.354
But you and I well know
that the responsibility

00:25:31.354 --> 00:25:33.770
of addressing poverty goes
well beyond the kinds of things

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:35.780
that you can do in
the Health Department.

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:39.080
And I came to appreciate that.

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:42.590
And frankly, the
hard roof of being

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:46.820
able to work as a public servant
in appointed office, when

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:49.070
I took on my Mayor on
issues that he didn't want

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:50.450
to pay attention to.

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:53.360
The city of Detroit
shuts down 18,000 homes

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.410
from having water
every single year.

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:56.522
Now, it shouldn't.

00:25:56.522 --> 00:25:58.730
I don't know how many of
you are public health people

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:01.280
or doctors, but you
all would probably

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.860
agree with me that
something that comprises

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:06.560
70% of your body, the
lack thereof is probably

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.802
a public health issue, right.

00:26:09.802 --> 00:26:11.260
It seems like it
should make sense.

00:26:14.007 --> 00:26:16.090
And the city didn't want
to move on it, because it

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:17.870
didn't make financial sense.

00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:20.260
And so we're raising the
cost of water on people

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:22.570
without being able
to actually empower

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:23.780
them to pay their bills.

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:25.439
And they face shutoffs.

00:26:25.439 --> 00:26:26.980
I came to appreciate
how serious that

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:29.320
was when I was personally
visiting a house where

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.330
a woman had lost a baby.

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:33.709
And I asked her if I
could use her restroom,

00:26:33.709 --> 00:26:36.250
and I went to use the restroom,
only to appreciate that there

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:37.330
was no water in the restroom.

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:38.955
Instead, there were
a couple of bottles

00:26:38.955 --> 00:26:40.540
lined up next to the sink.

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:44.767
And I saw the baby
bath, and the bottles

00:26:44.767 --> 00:26:45.850
lined up to the baby bath.

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:47.440
And I asked her, you
don't have water, do you?

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:47.981
She said, no.

00:26:47.981 --> 00:26:49.620
I said, how long
haven't you had water?

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:51.920
She said, a couple of months.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.449
Imagine trying to bathe your
child with bottled water

00:26:54.449 --> 00:26:56.240
because you don't have
water in your house,

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:59.660
because you're paying
hundreds of dollars

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:02.420
a month simply to pay for
something that, frankly, should

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:03.890
be a human right.

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:06.540
These are the circumstances
in a place like Detroit.

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:08.165
And if you don't pay
attention to that,

00:27:08.165 --> 00:27:10.880
there's no way you're going
to interrupt real poverty.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.010
And then you have
challenges relating

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:14.210
to housing in the city.

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:17.120
Our biggest monument program
in the city of Detroit

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.620
was a demolitions
program, the idea

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:21.530
being that if you demolish
homes that are no longer being

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:24.490
used, that that will raise the
value of all the other homes.

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:25.596
And, in theory, it works.

00:27:25.596 --> 00:27:26.720
Here's the problem, though.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:31.370
If you're demolishing housing
that was built before 1978,

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:35.470
the probability that there
is lead in the walls is 100%.

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:37.700
And if you don't
take precautions

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:43.450
around how you do this, around
following the kind of protocol

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:45.977
that will protect
from fugitive dust,

00:27:45.977 --> 00:27:47.560
there's a high
probability that you're

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:50.950
going to release a cloud
of lead dust into the air.

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:54.490
We did an analysis
on this very issue.

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:58.240
We found that the
probability that a child who

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.820
lived within 400 feet
of a demolition--

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.970
of that child testing positive
--was about 30% higher.

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:06.750
And if they lived
within 200 feet,

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:09.879
it was 60% higher, the
dose-response relationship.

00:28:09.879 --> 00:28:12.170
It's about as good as you
get in epidemiologic studies.

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:14.960
And, you know, what was
the Mayor's response?

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:17.390
Well, I need a third opinion.

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:19.617
Well, you know, before
I did this job for you,

00:28:19.617 --> 00:28:21.200
I literally did this
kind of research.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.550
That was my job.

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:26.480
And this kind of assessment,
this kind of study,

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:29.250
it's about as
ironclad as you get.

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:33.030
And no attention paid, because
it wasn't politically feasible.

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:35.280
And so, in that moment, I
came to very much appreciate

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:38.790
that the responsibility of
tackling the kind of poverty

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:41.790
that we wanted to address,
the epidemic of poverty,

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:44.310
required us to be
able to set the agenda

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:47.700
around the circumstances in
which that little boy lives.

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.502
I want you to think about his
user experience for a second.

00:28:50.502 --> 00:28:51.960
I want you to think
about his life.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.650
Put yourself in his shoes, and
he's walking through his life.

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:57.600
He lives in a home
that was built

00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.510
before 1978 that
his mother rents

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:02.620
from a predatory landlord.

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.920
He pays the same kinds
of rates that people

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:07.140
like me paid in
downtown Detroit,

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:09.475
simply because they
prey off the fact

00:29:09.475 --> 00:29:11.850
that a lot of those other
folks, because of credit score,

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:14.250
can't compete for
that kind of housing.

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:15.660
In Detroit, if
you own your home,

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:17.700
there's a 36%
probability that you

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:20.700
are going to lose that home,
not to mortgage foreclosure,

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:22.781
but to tax foreclosure.

00:29:22.781 --> 00:29:23.280
Why?

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.310
Because we're assessing
homes and about 50%

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:28.980
plus the rate of the
value of the home.

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.560
Imagine having to pay 50%
of the value of your home

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:34.080
every year in taxes.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:38.930
36% default, and they're
kicked out of their homes.

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:40.910
And then you think
about the circumstances

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:42.260
of his mother's work.

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:45.050
She works two jobs
just to be able to pay

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:48.710
a basic income to be
able to put good food

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:50.920
on the table for her kids.

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:51.810
Two jobs.

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:52.310
Why?

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:55.520
Because you can't actually
afford the cost of that rental

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:58.880
and the cost of that food
on minimum wage working

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.140
40 hours a week.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:01.640
You think about his
grandmother, who

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:03.740
provides most of the childcare.

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:05.840
Well, she has
Medicaid and Medicare,

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:09.230
but the problem is that the
way that we incentivize doctors

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:11.930
means that there aren't doctors
in the community in which she

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:13.020
lives.

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:17.610
And there's questionably
reliable public transportation.

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:20.207
You have to wait about
an hour to take a bus.

00:30:20.207 --> 00:30:22.290
And then for her to get
to the nearest clinic that

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:24.210
would see her for
her heart failure,

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:25.620
she'd have to take two buses.

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:26.970
That means one transfer.

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:27.810
That means the
whole trip is going

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:29.393
to take her 2 and
1/2 hours, and she's

00:30:29.393 --> 00:30:31.840
got four kids to care for.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.020
So instead, she winds up
in and out of the hospital,

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:38.720
because she exacerbates
every month.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.530
You think about
that boy's father.

00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:43.840
Man's in jail-- third time.

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:48.990
Never even accused
of a violent crime.

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:51.810
We incarcerate 11% more people
in the state of Michigan

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:53.665
than the national average.

00:30:53.665 --> 00:30:55.290
We have a system of
policing that seems

00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:57.390
to want to police
on top of people

00:30:57.390 --> 00:30:59.300
rather than police with people.

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:03.780
We are way better at violating
people's bodies for petty crime

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:07.380
than we are in policing the
violations of their bodies

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:08.910
for serious crime.

00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:12.960
The probability of closing
a murder in Detroit

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.750
is extremely low,
and yet the cops

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:17.940
will pick on you
just because you

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:21.300
look a particular kind of way.

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:23.430
And then you think about
the air that boy breathes,

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:27.000
and it's polluted by
folks like Marathon.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.182
You think about the water he may
or may not have in his house.

00:31:31.182 --> 00:31:32.640
You think about
the school district

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:35.220
he's going to go to that's
been under receivership

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:37.680
from the state for
the past seven years,

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:40.290
that has proceeded,
despite only having

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:42.330
to do the work of
reducing that debt,

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:46.000
has doubled the debt over
the past seven years.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.760
And meanwhile, you
have a corporate system

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:54.250
of charter schools that
have eaten up the children

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:56.437
from public schools.

00:31:56.437 --> 00:31:58.270
And so those public
schools are hemorrhaging

00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:01.270
to these for-profit corporations
that take our tax dollars

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:03.080
and put them in
their back pocket.

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.038
Thank you, Betsy DeVos.

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:09.170
You think about the
fact that we don't

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:11.480
have reliable mass
transportation in Detroit

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:12.090
anywhere.

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:14.840
And if you have a
car, the probability

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.750
is, in Detroit, because we have
a legal system of redlining,

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:20.900
that you're going to pay upwards
of $500 to $1,000 a month just

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:22.070
for your car insurance.

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:24.770
So 50% of Detroiters do what's
called driving dirty, meaning

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:26.430
that they don't have insurance.

00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:28.490
So that forces you to
do something illegal,

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:32.150
simply because if you're black,
or you live in a particular zip

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:34.040
code, or you haven't
completed high school,

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.800
or your credit score
is below 600, well,

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.170
you're going to pay a lot
more for your car insurance.

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:41.840
The tragic irony of the
Motor City is that about 25%

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:45.470
of Detroiters don't have
a car in a city that

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:48.330
was built around the car.

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:51.230
And so, to be able to address
the circumstances of that boy's

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:53.960
life, if we are honest about
trying to actually address

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.780
this epidemic of poverty, it
forces us to pay attention

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:58.310
to those issues.

00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:02.036
Our campaign just put out
a 45-page urban agenda.

00:33:02.036 --> 00:33:03.410
And in that agenda,
we're talking

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:06.080
about how it is that we
solve that foreclosure

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.580
epidemic in the
city of Detroit, how

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:10.010
it is that we create something
as simple as a Renter's

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:11.600
Bill of Rights.

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.030
We're talking about
the fact that water--

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:15.740
the basic amount
that a family of four

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:18.447
needs, to be able to drink, to
clean, to cook, and to bathe

00:33:18.447 --> 00:33:19.280
--should be a right.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.250
It should be free.

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:23.770
We're talking about how it is
that we actually incentivize

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:29.470
real mass transit, and we bar
the predatory auto insurance

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:32.290
industry from being able
to charge differentially

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:35.140
based on where you live, or
based on what your education

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:36.810
level is.

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:39.510
We're talking about what
it means to actually build

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:41.850
a Michigan Department of
Environmental Quality that's

00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:44.910
focused on environmental
justice as an end,

00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:47.790
rather than being run by
a former oil executive,

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:49.960
as it is today.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:53.680
We're talking about real
criminal justice reform--

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:57.056
policing with communities,
rather than upon communities,

00:33:57.056 --> 00:33:58.930
making sure that the
leadership of our police

00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:04.420
is not somebody who calls people
who are peacefully protesting--

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:09.489
young black men, just
for taking a knee

00:34:09.489 --> 00:34:12.880
--calling them degenerates
and ungrateful,

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:14.560
people who represent
the communities

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.780
that they are meant
to police, and have

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:20.230
experience in those
communities, where we're not

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:21.699
throwing the book
at people simply

00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:24.670
for possessing a
drug that ought to be

00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:29.044
legal in the first place,
where, if you go to jail,

00:34:29.044 --> 00:34:31.460
that jail is going to be a
place where you're going to get

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:34.219
access to the education that we
failed to give you when you are

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:37.265
in our public school system,
and that once you get out,

00:34:37.265 --> 00:34:39.889
people aren't going to ask about
your experience of having been

00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:42.760
in jail.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:47.710
We're talking about being able
to build the kind of Michigan

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:51.370
where we are empowering
people like that little boy

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:55.190
to be the means of growth
in the first place.

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:56.960
That has to be the
way that we tackle

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:59.060
this epidemic of poverty.

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:00.350
Systems matter.

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:01.850
Oftentimes, you
know, politicians

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:04.266
like me will stand up and just
give you a bunch of issues.

00:35:04.266 --> 00:35:05.210
Systems matter.

00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:06.920
They reinforce themselves.

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:10.140
And they are directed in
particular directions.

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:13.640
And if we're not willing
to direct our system of how

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:15.800
we govern in a
place like Michigan

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:19.340
around empowering that little
boy to be the means of what

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:21.390
the future looks like,
then we're failing him,

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:22.910
and we're failing ourselves.

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:25.460
And that is the
focus of how we ought

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:29.570
to be able to move policy
that actually does address

00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:31.110
this epidemic of poverty.

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:36.230
Now, I want to end
on a couple of notes.

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:39.950
Recently, Amazon-- you
know, the big corporation

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:43.395
that we all click
and save --Amazon

00:35:43.395 --> 00:35:45.770
announced that they wanted to
have a second headquarters,

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:47.270
and there was this big
sweepstakes about where

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:48.350
they were going to go.

00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:49.760
And the City of
Detroit and also,

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:53.780
actually, the City of Grand
Rapids both put in proposals.

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:57.200
And neither Detroit nor Grand
Rapids made their top-20 list.

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.360
And everybody in
Michigan was really upset

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:00.499
about this whole thing.

00:36:00.499 --> 00:36:01.290
Here's the problem.

00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:03.320
I think we're asking
the wrong question.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.840
The question should
not be why does Amazon

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.220
choose not to come to Detroit?

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:09.920
The question has to be
how do we empower people

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.860
like that little
boy, Demaryius, to be

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:15.590
the people who start the
Amazons of the future in Detroit

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:17.330
in the first place.

00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:19.100
Because unless we're
willing to invest

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:22.140
in people, and the places
in which they live,

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:25.430
learn, work, and
play, then we're

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:27.080
missing the point
about what it means

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:30.500
to grow the kind of just,
equitable, sustainable future

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:33.520
that we want for a
state like Michigan.

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.870
I also say this.

00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:36.880
Politics is very personal.

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.980
And anybody who
tells you otherwise

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:42.660
either has the privilege
of never having

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:45.910
to have been locked out,
or doesn't have the empathy

00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:47.770
to appreciate what
that might feel like.

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:49.345
Politics is deeply personal.

00:36:49.345 --> 00:36:52.466
And for me, I just
recently had a reminder

00:36:52.466 --> 00:36:53.590
of just how personal it is.

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:56.170
My partner Sarah,
about 10 weeks ago,

00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:58.420
gave birth to our
first baby girl.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:00.640
And this little
girl is going to be

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:05.440
this ethnically half-Egyptian,
ethnically half-Indian,

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:10.610
100% American, Muslim,
soon to be woman-- sooner

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:13.280
than I'd like to admit.

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.640
And I think about the world
that she's growing up in.

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:18.264
Every night, I get to come home,
and I get to put her to sleep.

00:37:18.264 --> 00:37:21.730
And in that moment, I
get to look in her eyes.

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:24.650
And I feel things.

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:27.170
And the things
that I want to feel

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:29.840
are the assuredness that
the world in which I'm

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:32.270
raising her is a world that
is going to support her

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:34.380
like I hope to support
her, empower her

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:36.470
like I hope to empower
her, to love her

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:38.240
like I hope to love her.

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:41.520
And I don't feel that.

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:44.470
And so many people don't
feel that right now.

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:48.850
But I can't help but contrast
my little girl Emmalee

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:53.290
to Demaryius, and my experience
putting my little girl

00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:56.920
to sleep every night, to
what Demaryius's mom must

00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:00.560
feel when she walks in
and sees him sleeping.

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:04.070
And the work that we
have to do comes down to

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:07.270
whether or not we are willing
to live our aspirations.

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:09.230
Now, I told you about
my dad at the outset.

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:11.090
My dad is somebody
who does his homework,

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:14.360
and he learned about a society
built on a set of ideals.

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:18.680
And I had those ideals very
vividly illustrated in my mind

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:21.610
by my public school
civics teacher.

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:23.120
This woman named Miss Rayburn.

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:25.220
She had this rare
gift among educators.

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:28.610
She was the kind of person
who could go into your mind

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:31.700
and put together
a set of concepts.

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:34.550
It was as if you
were just there.

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:36.110
And I remember
feeling like I was

00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:37.940
with the framers
of the Constitution

00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:41.150
when they made a decision to
make our society about ideals

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:42.860
instead of identities.

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:44.270
And among those
ideals is the one

00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:47.150
that I know my dad took a
bet on back in 1978 when

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:49.100
he chose to come here.

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:51.470
We hold these truths
to be self-evident

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:54.590
that all people
are created equal.

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:57.110
And in that world,
should we choose

00:38:57.110 --> 00:39:00.080
to reach out and
grasp that aspiration,

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:02.240
that world is the world
where my daughter has

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:04.940
no obstacles, but even
more important than that,

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:08.990
that boy, Demaryius, has
no obstacles, either.

00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:10.640
And we have to ask
ourselves how far we

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.530
are away from that
world, and whether

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:15.322
or not we're willing to do
the work of getting there.

00:39:15.322 --> 00:39:17.880
Now, the work of getting
there will require us, yes,

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:19.760
to have smart policy solutions.

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:20.570
Fine.

00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:22.310
But more importantly,
it will require

00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:26.680
us to stand up to
the institutions that

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:29.020
have created the world as it
stands in the first place.

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:31.360
The thing about politics
is that it doesn't really

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:33.670
exist without conflict.

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:36.460
So many people want a politics
where you're not actually

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:37.730
standing up against anything.

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:39.070
Everybody kind of agrees.

00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:40.810
Well, in rooms like
this, we all kind of

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:43.420
can agree, because,
by definition, we're

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:45.360
the people who've won.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.580
And the question becomes,
are we willing to stand up

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:49.920
on a set of things, and
against a set of others.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.420
Are we willing to
have conversations

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:54.015
that say, no, you can't
actually close the door

00:39:54.015 --> 00:39:55.140
on certain kinds of people.

00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:58.270
You cannot erect the kind of
institutions that hold people

00:39:58.270 --> 00:39:58.770
down.

00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:02.810
You cannot continue to eat at
a particular corporate trough

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:05.440
if you want to actually
serve the public.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.600
Are we willing to call that out?

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:10.570
Are we willing to have the
courage of a set of convictions

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:12.940
about the aspirations that
are supposed to animate

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:16.040
our society in the first place?

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:18.230
That's not to say that we
can't aspire to a world

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:20.771
where we all get
there, but that getting

00:40:20.771 --> 00:40:23.270
there means that the folks who
say that certain people don't

00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:26.084
belong, and certain people
can't be a part of the solution,

00:40:26.084 --> 00:40:27.500
and certain people
can't be a part

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:29.541
of the world we want to
build, well, those folks,

00:40:29.541 --> 00:40:31.354
they have to be sidelined.

00:40:31.354 --> 00:40:33.520
And it means being willing
to do the work of saying,

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:34.720
those ideas are broken.

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:37.060
They don't work anymore.

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:42.751
And I'll tell you, I've always
believed that light drives out

00:40:42.751 --> 00:40:43.250
darkness.

00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:45.260
It's the only thing that can.

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.630
And the thing about
light is, usually, it's

00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:51.750
the willingness to just be in
a moment where it's hard to be.

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:57.360
And one of the things I've come
to appreciate is that so many

00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:01.910
of the people who have been told
that the circumstances in which

00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:05.600
they live are a function
of others, right, so many

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:07.160
of those folks,
when you sit down

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:09.470
and you're willing to
actually be with them,

00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:11.930
and you're willing to hold
a conversation with them,

00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:14.920
you're willing to dignify
them for real people,

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:18.646
you're willing to appreciate
the pain that they have,

00:41:18.646 --> 00:41:21.020
and you're willing to articulate
a future that says that,

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:23.390
actually, when we come together
as people who have been locked

00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:25.320
out in different ways
for different reasons,

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:27.569
when we come together around
a politics that brings us

00:41:27.569 --> 00:41:28.910
together, that in fact,

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:31.910
the world can be the kind of
place where all of us succeed,

00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:33.980
all of our children
have the kind of future

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.500
we would dream of for them.

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:38.690
And that's going to mean
being willing to take

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:42.080
on institutions,
and to ask ourselves

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:45.080
what role we play in
perpetuating institutions,

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:48.230
and what role we can play
standing against institutions

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:49.105
when they're wrong.

00:41:49.105 --> 00:41:51.688
The thing about institutions is
that they're usually populated

00:41:51.688 --> 00:41:52.850
with good people, right.

00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:56.600
Almost everybody in institutions
is a good guy, a good person.

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:58.172
They don't mean wrong.

00:41:58.172 --> 00:41:59.630
The problem is that
the institution

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:01.500
enforces a certain way forward.

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:04.970
And so, for us, it's about
coming together and standing up

00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:07.640
within the institutions
that we live in,

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:10.490
and deciding that we won't just
be validated by whether or not

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:12.910
those institutions tell
us that we're good,

00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:15.260
and give us gold
stars, but that we're

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:17.990
willing to stand up on a
set of ideals and values

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:21.230
that we believe in to drive the
institutions in the directions

00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:24.440
that they need to go.

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:29.750
And I know one thing
about this country

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:35.720
is that the people here, we have
a unique capacity to correct.

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:38.570
See, the thing about the
idea of a more perfect union

00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:41.000
is it implies two
mutually exclusive ideals

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.970
at the same time, which is
itself fundamentally human--

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:48.830
A, that you're not perfect to
begin with, because otherwise

00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:52.590
you couldn't be more perfect,
but B, that you aspire

00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:56.000
to perfection even still.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.500
And so, in a moment like
this, where the politics look

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:04.890
so broken and we
are so frustrated,

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:08.880
I believe that if we're willing
to aspire to that thing,

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.950
we're willing to
have conversations

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:13.480
with the people who
animate institutions,

00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:17.460
we're willing to ask ourselves
what our ideals really are

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:20.600
and what they imply
for who we ought to be,

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:24.150
we're willing to stand
firm on those ideals,

00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:28.630
we're willing to grab hands
with unlikely partners,

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:30.996
and we're willing
to walk forward,

00:43:30.996 --> 00:43:34.340
that that world of ours,
that more perfect union,

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:35.786
that we can get there.

00:43:35.786 --> 00:43:37.160
And I look forward
to partnership

00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:38.600
as we walk that path together.

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:39.330
Thank you.

00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:43.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:57.460
- I wish I lived in Michigan.

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:08.330
So we have, I think, about
15 minutes for questions.

00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:10.990
So I'd encourage you
to come up to the mic,

00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:14.300
tell us who you are,
and state your question.

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:18.520
And thank you very much.

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:20.130
- My name is Ned Bacon.

00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:23.040
Thank you so much for, really,
an inspirational speech.

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:25.410
And I commend you
for your ability

00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:30.090
to tell stories that make
all of this very real.

00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:33.360
I've worked in institutions,
I've worked in businesses,

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:37.080
and I'm sure you've encountered
the same problem, which

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:41.700
is that, whether it's Harvard or
whether it's a big corporation,

00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:44.730
the need for
resources always seems

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:48.690
to exceed the resources
that are available.

00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:53.850
And I like the
discussion of ideals.

00:44:53.850 --> 00:44:57.510
How do you get the
resources in place--

00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:59.250
because these problems
you've described

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:04.435
are so big and so broad, and
there's a need-- so how do you

00:45:04.435 --> 00:45:05.310
address that problem?

00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:05.770
- Yeah.

00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:06.894
Thank you for the question.

00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:11.220
You know, one of
the first things

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:12.750
I was ever told
about a budget is

00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:15.840
that it is a manifestation
of your ideals

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:17.340
and your values, right.

00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:20.700
Because your ideals mean nothing
in infinite resource space.

00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:22.320
You can do anything, right.

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:24.390
But the question becomes,
when your resources

00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:28.890
are finite, what do you spend
those resources on, and why?

00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:34.200
And I do agree that we have
deep resource constraints,

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:36.000
but we also have deep
resource constraints

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.480
within the context of the
ideals that we've already

00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:43.140
sort of seemed to bake in to
what we spend our money on.

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:45.330
So we live in a
country right now

00:45:45.330 --> 00:45:49.440
where we spend 46% of the
world's military expenditure--

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:51.330
the world's expenditure.

00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:52.560
And I get it.

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:54.910
It is hard knock
world out there.

00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:57.240
And yes, you have
to defend yourself.

00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:02.520
But 46% of the world's
military expenditure.

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:04.970
And when people talk about
things like universal health

00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:07.440
care, they say, well, it's
going to be so expensive.

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:10.200
So yeah, it is going to
be kind of expensive,

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.090
but the question
becomes, is it what

00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:14.640
we're willing to spend
our money on vis-a-vis

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:17.650
all of the other things we
already spend our money on.

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:20.100
And I think the
responsibility, obviously,

00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:22.369
is to be working
toward situations where

00:46:22.369 --> 00:46:24.660
your solutions are non-zero
sum, where you can actually

00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:27.540
generate more out of
what you choose to do.

00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:29.014
But I will also
say that it's going

00:46:29.014 --> 00:46:30.930
to mean making hard
decisions about the things

00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:32.790
that we already
spend on, and why.

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:36.240
And this is what I meant when I
said that it means standing up

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:37.950
against certain things.

00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:41.100
And I wish we could have
everything, and have our cake

00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:43.650
and eat it, too, but that's
not the world that we live in.

00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:45.191
And the world we
live in is one where

00:46:45.191 --> 00:46:47.220
we have to toggle against
different viewpoints

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:49.796
and different perspectives
on what is a value.

00:46:49.796 --> 00:46:52.170
And we have to ask ourselves
whether or not what we spend

00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:55.440
is consistent with what
our values purportedly are.

00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:57.990
And then, we have to be willing
to do the work of elevating

00:46:57.990 --> 00:47:01.240
the people who speak on behalf
of alternative viewpoints,

00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:01.740
right.

00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:06.330
I mean, I'm here
talking to you today.

00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:08.520
I really wish you could
just meet Demaryius.

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:11.100
I wish he could be here
talking for himself,

00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:14.460
because, if he was, the
question of whether or not he's

00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:15.930
worth it--

00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:20.920
the investments are worth it --I
think that would be answered.

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:23.670
And I think that's what we
have to be about doing, right.

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:25.860
Places like this
in particular are

00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:28.800
uniquely good at shaping
the kind of conversation

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.570
that we have, about
dictating what is

00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:32.350
of value and what is important.

00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:36.420
And when we marginalize
people like Demaryius,

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:38.970
and the people who
live in communities

00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:41.806
like his all over the country--

00:47:41.806 --> 00:47:43.680
I mean, this could just
as easily be Roxbury,

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:47.880
right --it's a lot easier to
continue to make the decisions

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:49.410
as we continue to make them.

00:47:49.410 --> 00:47:51.510
And I want us to
have a conversation

00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:53.940
where we are shedding
light on what

00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:56.400
the alternative uses
of our money look like,

00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:59.460
and what the fallacies of the
current uses of our money look

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:01.710
like.

00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:08.726
- Amelia [? Kohn. ?] You laid
out an inspiring program--

00:48:08.726 --> 00:48:12.880
a inspiring electoral
proposal, basically.

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:15.080
So my question is--

00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:16.300
I have two concerns.

00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:20.860
And one is that your
program is somewhat narrowly

00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:25.940
urban-oriented, and also it
has a narrow class basis.

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:28.540
So what is the
demographic situation,

00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:31.420
because you're running for
governor of Michigan, right.

00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:32.660
So I wonder how you--

00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:34.360
I assume you've
thought that through,

00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:35.572
but you haven't addressed it.

00:48:35.572 --> 00:48:37.030
And the other is,
how are you going

00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:45.130
to realize this ambitious,
very humane program given

00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:48.060
the federal context in
which you'll be working?

00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:48.560
- Yeah.

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:49.726
Thank you for your question.

00:48:49.726 --> 00:48:50.900
I really appreciate it.

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:55.370
So I focused, today, on what
was ultimately our urban agenda.

00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:58.140
We will be rolling out a rural
agenda in the next three weeks.

00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:01.130
And the reason I chose to
focus on the urban agenda today

00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:04.310
is because it comes out
of my work in Detroit,

00:49:04.310 --> 00:49:07.160
and is educated by
that experience.

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:09.050
I'll tell you this, though.

00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:12.170
I took a bet on the fact
that the kinds of challenges

00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:15.080
that people in urban communities
and people in rural communities

00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:18.860
face tend to actually be
more similar than we're

00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:19.970
allowed to see.

00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:24.020
And that inability to
look beyond the curtain

00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:30.350
has been driven, in large part,
by the goals and the agendas

00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:32.600
of politicians who benefit
tremendously from dividing

00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:34.100
these two groups of people.

00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:38.990
I also say that, when
you talk to folks

00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:41.780
who don't suffer
that kind of poverty,

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:45.710
one of the big challenges
that many of us face

00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:49.400
is, why has the world
become so insecure.

00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:52.490
And there's a lot of
conversation about neo-populism

00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:53.720
in this moment.

00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:59.900
And a lot of that is driven by
the manifestations of stories

00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:02.840
told to people about
why they no longer have

00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:05.300
what they used to have.

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:06.800
And then the question
becomes, well,

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:09.133
what do we do to make sure
that people don't lack access

00:50:09.133 --> 00:50:11.080
to those things in the future.

00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:14.290
It's easy, I think, in this
moment of time where we get

00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:15.730
hyper-segregated--

00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:18.910
by race certainly, but also
by socioeconomic position

00:50:18.910 --> 00:50:23.080
--to assume that the
lives that others lead

00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:25.300
have no implication for our own.

00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:28.270
And I think that's a very
dangerous assumption.

00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:30.844
It's a dangerous assumption
because it hurts people.

00:50:30.844 --> 00:50:33.010
But it's also a dangerous
assumption because it just

00:50:33.010 --> 00:50:33.968
fundamentally not true.

00:50:33.968 --> 00:50:36.022
We all live in the same world.

00:50:36.022 --> 00:50:38.230
And, you know, when I speak
on the coasts, sometimes,

00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:40.930
about the situation in
the middle of the country,

00:50:40.930 --> 00:50:43.950
I often get very well-meaning
questions about, well,

00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:45.425
why did people go for Trump?

00:50:45.425 --> 00:50:47.550
I'll tell you, my own uncle
voted for Donald Trump.

00:50:47.550 --> 00:50:50.476
He is a guy who drove
truck his whole life.

00:50:50.476 --> 00:50:51.850
And I mean, he
was somebody who--

00:50:51.850 --> 00:50:53.350
I'll tell you, he was
the most fun uncle.

00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:55.810
He was the guy who took us
snowmobiling in the winters,

00:50:55.810 --> 00:50:57.520
took us water skiing
in the summers,

00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:59.853
introduced me to mustard
pretzel, which, if you've never

00:50:59.853 --> 00:51:02.290
had one, is delicious,
and, you know,

00:51:02.290 --> 00:51:05.080
went as far as to learn how
to prepare venison halal so

00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:06.430
that my family could eat it.

00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:11.080
He's not motivated by any
anti-Muslim animus at all.

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:14.860
But he lost his business in
2008 when the economy went bust.

00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:17.260
He was told by the
Democratic establishment

00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:18.800
that the economy is back.

00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:20.950
Well, it's back if you're
a trader on Wall Street.

00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:23.350
It's not back if you're
my uncle in the middle

00:51:23.350 --> 00:51:24.550
of the state of Michigan.

00:51:24.550 --> 00:51:26.170
And so, for him,
he felt like he was

00:51:26.170 --> 00:51:28.300
between somebody who
was kind of crazy,

00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:30.820
but was speaking right
to him, and somebody

00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:33.280
who seemed not to care about
people like him at all.

00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:35.860
And he made what was,
within the boundedness

00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:38.330
of his information, a
pretty rational decision.

00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:41.500
You've got to imagine I
was quite surprised, right.

00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:43.452
And I confronted him about it.

00:51:43.452 --> 00:51:45.160
You know, I'll never
forget what he said.

00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:47.440
You vote in your best
interest, and I vote in mine.

00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:49.330
And it's time for us
to be able to have

00:51:49.330 --> 00:51:53.230
a conversation,
across these bounds,

00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:56.470
about what drives people's
decision-making, and about

00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:58.390
the facts and realities
of those lives.

00:51:58.390 --> 00:52:01.180
Because if we don't
pay attention to them,

00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:05.110
we risk not only tearing
apart our social fabric,

00:52:05.110 --> 00:52:08.382
but allowing people to live
in unnecessary suffering--

00:52:08.382 --> 00:52:10.090
the kind of suffering
that we could solve

00:52:10.090 --> 00:52:11.800
if we're willing to get it
right about where we allocate

00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:12.300
our funding.

00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:18.630
- Hi, my name is Nikhil Patel.

00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:20.755
I'm actually a student here
at the Business School,

00:52:20.755 --> 00:52:22.680
and, coincidentally,
I'm also actually going

00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:25.054
to go work in Detroit this
summer, in the Mayor's office.

00:52:25.054 --> 00:52:27.780
So it's exciting and
encouraging to hear this.

00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:30.640
My question to you is regarding
your comment about Amazon.

00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:33.300
So you mentioned how there
is a state of the world where

00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:36.330
you invest in making it
so that, in Detroit, there

00:52:36.330 --> 00:52:37.782
could be the next Amazon.

00:52:37.782 --> 00:52:39.240
If you were governor,
how would you

00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:42.270
balance that versus the
very real possibility

00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:46.470
that cities like Boston, or
San Francisco, or even Austin

00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:49.110
already have business
momentum, and if we

00:52:49.110 --> 00:52:52.174
take too long to build that
business momentum in Detroit--

00:52:52.174 --> 00:52:54.090
or even in the state of
Michigan --then you're

00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:55.930
going to lose that
battle over and over.

00:52:55.930 --> 00:52:58.500
So, how would you
prioritize getting companies

00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:00.900
to come first, and
then investing,

00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:02.320
or the other way around.

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:04.980
- It's a great question I'll
tell you this, right, all three

00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:07.860
of those cities that you
named, they have a really

00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:10.380
strong startup culture, right.

00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:13.530
And, if you're a startup,
you want two things:

00:53:13.530 --> 00:53:15.970
you want talent and capital.

00:53:15.970 --> 00:53:17.470
Agreed?

00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:18.460
Here's the problem.

00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:20.770
In Michigan, we have played
by an economic script that

00:53:20.770 --> 00:53:22.690
says that we actually
have no capacity

00:53:22.690 --> 00:53:27.260
to generate our own businesses--
organic, growing businesses.

00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:29.050
And so the best
thing that we can do

00:53:29.050 --> 00:53:32.662
is provide ridiculous tax
subsidies to huge corporations

00:53:32.662 --> 00:53:34.120
to come and bring
jobs that we know

00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:36.619
are going to get offshored or
automated within the next five

00:53:36.619 --> 00:53:39.940
years anyway, and then when
those jobs that we promised

00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:41.980
go away and they're
still getting subsidized,

00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:44.722
well, we've got to go
back to the drawing board.

00:53:44.722 --> 00:53:45.430
So what do we do?

00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:46.960
We do the same thing again.

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:48.793
And then you're left
in a circumstance where

00:53:48.793 --> 00:53:51.340
you no longer have the revenue
to be able to invest in people

00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:54.790
and infrastructure, and you
have a couple of corporations

00:53:54.790 --> 00:53:56.710
that run highly-automated
factories

00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:59.080
in random parts of your state.

00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:02.200
What's lost is the ability
to actually attract

00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:03.730
talent and capital.

00:54:03.730 --> 00:54:05.650
So, to me, I would
much rather start

00:54:05.650 --> 00:54:08.740
investing in our talent and
our infrastructure, which,

00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:10.960
if you talk to any business
leader in the world,

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:12.501
they will tell you,
the things that I

00:54:12.501 --> 00:54:16.427
want are highly-talented skill
set and skilled workforce,

00:54:16.427 --> 00:54:18.010
and really great
infrastructure that's

00:54:18.010 --> 00:54:19.210
not going to let me down.

00:54:19.210 --> 00:54:21.126
You do those things, I'm
a lot more interested

00:54:21.126 --> 00:54:22.270
in coming to where you are.

00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:25.480
And right now, we're so
beholden to our dependency

00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:27.340
on these huge
corporations, and we're

00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:30.040
so at a loss for the
ability to actually

00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:31.644
invest in people
and infrastructure,

00:54:31.644 --> 00:54:34.060
that we're stuck doing the
same thing over and over again.

00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:35.020
Do you see what I mean?

00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:36.760
And so, you know, part
of the question is, like,

00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:38.950
well, if you're losing the
game, do you just give up,

00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:40.350
or do you just start
playing the game better?

00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:41.980
Well, you start playing
the game better, right.

00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:44.630
And so, in Michigan, we have to
start playing the game better.

00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:46.213
That means, to me,
a couple of things.

00:54:46.213 --> 00:54:48.490
Number one, it means really
believing in our ability

00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:51.770
to build a small business,
startup-oriented kind

00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:52.270
of economy.

00:54:52.270 --> 00:54:54.040
People want to come
to Detroit if we're

00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:55.750
able to incentivize
them to come.

00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:56.740
That means, when
they come, they know

00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:58.210
they're going to have
an awesome workforce,

00:54:58.210 --> 00:54:59.350
and they've got
great infrastructure.

00:54:59.350 --> 00:55:01.504
And infrastructure also
means the kinds of things

00:55:01.504 --> 00:55:02.920
that you-- as a
young person who's

00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:04.503
making a decision
about where you want

00:55:04.503 --> 00:55:08.320
to build your life --the kind of
lifestyle that you want, right.

00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:10.150
Unfortunately, in
Michigan, almost all

00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:12.490
of the housing we have is
single-family units, right,

00:55:12.490 --> 00:55:14.781
in random neighborhoods, that
young people don't really

00:55:14.781 --> 00:55:16.000
want to live in anymore.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.830
And so unless
we're able to build

00:55:17.830 --> 00:55:21.890
around trying to attract the
people who are going to build

00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:23.890
the economy of the future,
and more importantly,

00:55:23.890 --> 00:55:26.080
invest in our people
in Michigan, right--

00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:26.992
that little boy.

00:55:26.992 --> 00:55:28.950
So he's the kind of person
who goes to college,

00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:31.202
stays in Michigan, builds a
great startup that becomes

00:55:31.202 --> 00:55:32.410
a billion dollar corporation.

00:55:32.410 --> 00:55:33.285
I'd love to see that.

00:55:33.285 --> 00:55:34.170
See what I mean?

00:55:34.170 --> 00:55:36.280
And so it's about making
those investments,

00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:38.500
strategically, now,
and recognizing

00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:39.950
that the short-term
incentive sets

00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:44.500
that most politicians and most
corporations are beholden to

00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:47.110
are only going to allow us to
swirl further and further down

00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:48.460
the toilet bowl, right.

00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:50.440
And, at some point,
you gotta rethink it.

00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:53.530
I was sitting with the Crane's
Detroit Business Editorial

00:55:53.530 --> 00:55:54.030
Board--

00:55:54.030 --> 00:55:57.370
they're like the business
magazine for Detroit companies

00:55:57.370 --> 00:55:59.286
--and articulated
this vision to them.

00:55:59.286 --> 00:56:01.286
And they're like, well,
that's a 50-year vision.

00:56:01.286 --> 00:56:02.987
I was like, yeah.

00:56:02.987 --> 00:56:04.362
He's like, well,
you're not going

00:56:04.362 --> 00:56:06.153
to be able to accomplish
it in eight years.

00:56:06.153 --> 00:56:07.450
I was like, yeah, I agree.

00:56:07.450 --> 00:56:10.690
But the question-- the
question to me has to be,

00:56:10.690 --> 00:56:13.060
how do I make the Michigan
where my daughter chooses

00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:16.030
to raise her kids, and her kids
choose to raise their kids,

00:56:16.030 --> 00:56:19.576
not how do I make myself
look good for four years,

00:56:19.576 --> 00:56:20.950
so everybody pats
me on the back,

00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:23.050
and then we're all right
down where we were.

00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:25.240
We need leadership that's
thinking on a 50-year

00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:26.737
to 100-year time horizon.

00:56:26.737 --> 00:56:28.278
That's what all
leadership should be.

00:56:28.278 --> 00:56:30.618
[CLAPPING]

00:56:34.704 --> 00:56:35.620
- Thank you very much.

00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:38.100
This has been a refreshing talk.

00:56:38.100 --> 00:56:41.780
I guess my question,
as I think about this,

00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:44.120
is as I think it was
Frederick Douglass said,

00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:46.130
power never cedes anything
without a struggle.

00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:48.080
Never has; never will.

00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:52.870
And it looks like the
corporations and the people who

00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:56.440
want tax cuts for the rich
and so forth really have

00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:58.510
a pretty loaded deck right now.

00:56:58.510 --> 00:57:02.214
So how can we help citizens
who have been shamed,

00:57:02.214 --> 00:57:04.255
who feel like it's their
fault that they're poor,

00:57:04.255 --> 00:57:06.730
or they're not getting
educated, to feel

00:57:06.730 --> 00:57:12.720
like they can unite and
stand up to Citizens United?

00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:15.730
- Thank you for the question.

00:57:15.730 --> 00:57:18.300
The caustic influence
that corporate money

00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:20.590
has had on our politics--

00:57:20.590 --> 00:57:23.524
I mean, I don't even think
the full story has been told.

00:57:23.524 --> 00:57:25.440
You know, just as somebody
running for office,

00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:26.710
I don't take corporate money.

00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:29.670
So even without taking
corporate money,

00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:31.296
I know I'm going to
be vastly outspent,

00:57:31.296 --> 00:57:32.795
both in the primary
and the general,

00:57:32.795 --> 00:57:34.190
by people who do
take that money.

00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:38.880
And I still spend 60% of my
time raising money, right.

00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:42.430
And that just is a complete
waste of time, honestly--

00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:44.460
a complete waste of time.

00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:46.740
It's not going to make
me any better because I

00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:50.670
spend five hours on the phone
asking people for money, right.

00:57:50.670 --> 00:57:53.012
That's the state of
running for office.

00:57:53.012 --> 00:57:55.470
It's a big reason why a lot of
folks who are well-qualified

00:57:55.470 --> 00:57:57.255
don't, because it
just-- it sucks.

00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:05.880
And so the question becomes
how do we reverse that?

00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:07.950
I think a couple
of things, right.

00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:10.896
Number one, we have to
center those conversations.

00:58:10.896 --> 00:58:12.270
I thought the
point that you made

00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:16.590
about Frederick Douglass's quote
and power struggle matters.

00:58:16.590 --> 00:58:18.450
We have to center
the voices of people

00:58:18.450 --> 00:58:21.090
who suffer in the
conversations that we have.

00:58:21.090 --> 00:58:24.780
And we have to recognize that
the challenges that they face

00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:27.750
have nothing to do
with circumstances

00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:28.710
of their own making.

00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:30.840
They have everything
to do with structures

00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:35.430
that have created a very easy
way for money to follow money,

00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:36.210
right.

00:58:36.210 --> 00:58:38.850
And we've allowed the
biggest institutions

00:58:38.850 --> 00:58:41.812
in our society to not
just corrupt our economics

00:58:41.812 --> 00:58:43.270
and create this
kind of inequality,

00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:45.180
but corrupt our politics
as well by being

00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:48.390
able to reach over and control,
right, via access to money,

00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:49.840
the kinds of people who run.

00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:52.860
So, aside from centering
those voices, which

00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:54.784
I think is probably the
most important thing,

00:58:54.784 --> 00:58:56.700
we also have to think,
I think, systematically

00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:59.340
about how it operates, right.

00:58:59.340 --> 00:59:00.930
One of the
frustrations that I've

00:59:00.930 --> 00:59:02.910
had with the way the
Democrats have operated

00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:04.680
over the past several
years is that we've

00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:06.990
forgotten that the real
action is local, right.

00:59:06.990 --> 00:59:09.300
And everybody is focused
on the presidency

00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:10.890
and federal elections,
but we forget

00:59:10.890 --> 00:59:12.865
that real action is local.

00:59:12.865 --> 00:59:14.490
And I don't mean to
make this partisan,

00:59:14.490 --> 00:59:17.140
so Republicans, probably
did the same thing.

00:59:17.140 --> 00:59:18.870
But they actually didn't.

00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:21.660
Republicans knew exactly
where the action was.

00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:25.200
And so we're about
two state legislatures

00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:29.040
away from the possibility
for, nationwide,

00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:31.890
Republicans to host a
Constitutional Convention,

00:59:31.890 --> 00:59:33.745
and ratify changes
in the Constitution.

00:59:33.745 --> 00:59:35.640
I want you to think
about that means.

00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:39.720
So focusing local is critical.

00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:43.920
Gerrymandering is probably the
most important local governance

00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:45.931
issue, aside from
money in politics.

00:59:45.931 --> 00:59:48.180
And I think there's been a
lot of really great headway

00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:50.762
in the courts, and a lot
of really great headway

00:59:50.762 --> 00:59:52.470
that citizens' groups
have come together.

00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:54.928
In Michigan, there's a group
called Voters Not Politicians.

00:59:54.928 --> 00:59:58.500
They got 400,000 signatures in
a matter of, like, three months

00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:01.510
to get a ballot proposal
on our 2018 ballot

01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:04.587
so that people can
actually vote on

01:00:04.587 --> 01:00:06.420
nonpartisan independent
redistricting, which

01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:07.800
is amazing.

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.600
But those kinds of
efforts matter a lot,

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:11.580
and that's where this
needs to be fought.

01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:15.280
And then, in terms
of money in politics,

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:17.340
I also think that this
is a local fight, right.

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:22.080
Overturning Citizens United
is a much hairier process

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:23.340
at the federal level.

01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:27.780
But what we can do is focus
on state-level legislation

01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:32.040
that at least sunshines, and
if not sunshines, ideally, gets

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.210
that money out of politics.

01:00:33.210 --> 01:00:36.000
I'll tell you, in my race
alone, any individual

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.440
can spend $6,800 on the race.

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:45.160
A couple can do $13,600, and
a corporation can do $68,000,

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:46.440
and all that's above board.

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:48.730
That's not even including
Super PACs, right.

01:00:48.730 --> 01:00:53.550
We just passed, at the state
level, a policy proposal,

01:00:53.550 --> 01:00:57.120
or a body of bills,
now law, that they call

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.770
Citizens United on steroids.

01:00:58.770 --> 01:01:00.830
It basically makes it
state law, in Michigan,

01:01:00.830 --> 01:01:06.930
that there is no actual
limitation on what

01:01:06.930 --> 01:01:09.270
a corporation can
give to a Super PAC,

01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:11.370
through dark money
and soft money means.

01:01:11.370 --> 01:01:13.770
But focusing locally
to try and undo that,

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:16.240
or to block it where it
happens, I think, is critical.

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.532
And then, the final thing
I'll say is get out and vote.

01:01:18.532 --> 01:01:20.531
I mean, this is the crazy
thing about it, right.

01:01:20.531 --> 01:01:22.127
30%-- I mean,
probably in this room,

01:01:22.127 --> 01:01:24.210
you're talking about most
of you get out and vote,

01:01:24.210 --> 01:01:27.870
but 30% in any given election
actually come out to vote.

01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:30.630
If everybody voted,
politics in Michigan

01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:33.420
and in the United States would
look substantially different.

01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:37.080
And the work of getting
people out and getting them

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:38.130
to the ballots--

01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:38.950
that matters.

01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:41.394
That's the only thing that
does matter in the end, right.

01:01:41.394 --> 01:01:42.810
And I think a lot
of the attention

01:01:42.810 --> 01:01:44.775
has to be paid around
getting out the vote,

01:01:44.775 --> 01:01:48.120
and getting communities out
to vote, which also means

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:51.120
thinking differently about the
kinds of people who run, right.

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:51.960
You know, one of
the things that's

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:53.376
been really
interesting in my race

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:55.825
is that people like
me don't usually run.

01:01:55.825 --> 01:01:57.450
And when I say, like
me, I mean like me

01:01:57.450 --> 01:01:59.790
in a lot of different
ways-- young,

01:01:59.790 --> 01:02:02.610
you know, ethnic minority,
religious minority,

01:02:02.610 --> 01:02:06.410
somebody who has a professional
skill set outside of law

01:02:06.410 --> 01:02:07.410
--those folks don't run.

01:02:07.410 --> 01:02:11.280
And I think that we
need to be empowering

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:15.210
different kinds of
candidates, because they're

01:02:15.210 --> 01:02:18.610
able to speak to the
electorate in different ways.

01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:20.610
And I think we start to
see a lot more movement

01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:22.980
in that electorate when
people actually see themselves

01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:26.170
in their politicians.

01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:29.400
- Hello, my name is Omar
[? Al-Hawari. ?] My parents are

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.920
Egyptian immigrants, and I
am a dual degree student here

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:34.560
at the Harvard Kennedy School
and the University of Michigan

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:35.520
Law School.

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:36.300
- Go blue.

01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:37.130
- Go blue.

01:02:37.130 --> 01:02:38.550
Well, I thank you for your time.

01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:40.841
So many of us here on campus
and across the country who

01:02:40.841 --> 01:02:43.000
are young Muslim Americans
are looking up to you.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.510
When we read articles like,
Abdul El-Sayed, great guy,

01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:48.100
not-so-great name.

01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:49.950
Many of us are
left wondering how

01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:52.410
a person like you is both
navigating about the media

01:02:52.410 --> 01:02:54.060
internal to Michigan,
and establishment

01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:55.320
politics in the state.

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:56.390
Yeah.

01:02:56.390 --> 01:03:00.321
I-- I like my name.

01:03:00.321 --> 01:03:02.205
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:02.652 --> 01:03:04.860
I'll tell you a funny story
about how I became Abdul.

01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:07.110
So, my whole name is
actually Abdulrahman,

01:03:07.110 --> 01:03:10.200
which is as about
as intimidating

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:12.690
as it sounds in English.

01:03:12.690 --> 01:03:16.140
And my parents got divorced
right after they had me,

01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:17.640
and both remarried.

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.530
I was raised by my
father and my stepmom.

01:03:19.530 --> 01:03:23.010
And 1989 rolls around, and I'm
about to start kindergarten.

01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:25.770
And my stepmom looks
at my dad and is like,

01:03:25.770 --> 01:03:30.560
the kid's not going to make
it a day with that name.

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:33.970
So they sort of cast about
looking for a new thing.

01:03:33.970 --> 01:03:37.980
And it turns out that
1989, in September,

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:41.080
guess who's topping the charts.

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:43.290
(SINGING) Straight
up now, baby--

01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:45.490
it's Paula Abdul
with "Straight Up."

01:03:45.490 --> 01:03:47.890
And so, at that point, they're
like, this is his name.

01:03:47.890 --> 01:03:49.556
It's going to be Abdul
from here on out.

01:03:49.556 --> 01:03:51.050
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:51.050 --> 01:03:54.605
And I told you about my
little brother Osama.

01:03:54.605 --> 01:03:56.230
My parents were--
you know, they didn't

01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:57.271
want to mess it up twice.

01:03:57.271 --> 01:04:00.250
So eight years later, he's
being born, and they're like,

01:04:00.250 --> 01:04:02.140
we're going to give
him a really easy name.

01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:04.140
It's Sam with O on the
front, and A on the back.

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:05.450
What could go wrong?

01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:08.500
So they're kind of 0 for 2
on boys' names at this point.

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:11.900
My sister got [? Samia, ?]
which is a good name.

01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:13.150
And Osama is a good name, too.

01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:14.649
And [INAUDIBLE] is
a good name, too.

01:04:14.649 --> 01:04:21.610
But look, I've grown up
with the rare privilege

01:04:21.610 --> 01:04:26.200
of being able to cross
different worlds of experience

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:28.870
pretty seamlessly, just
because of who my family was.

01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:31.450
And a lot of folks
who either don't

01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:35.470
know Muslims or Muslims
who haven't spent

01:04:35.470 --> 01:04:38.560
time outside of the
Muslim community,

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:40.027
don't understand--
like honestly,

01:04:40.027 --> 01:04:41.860
in their gut --don't
understand how somebody

01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:43.396
like me could walk
into a community

01:04:43.396 --> 01:04:44.770
where people
haven't met Muslims,

01:04:44.770 --> 01:04:45.950
and just have a conversation.

01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:46.990
Here's the thing
about it, though.

01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:47.810
You just do it.

01:04:47.810 --> 01:04:49.480
It's not that hard, right.

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:52.000
And the thing about it is
that, as a Muslim community,

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.820
we center so much
the Muslim thing.

01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:58.690
And it becomes-- we have antenna
that pick up stories about it.

01:04:58.690 --> 01:05:01.540
And so it becomes the thing
that we're all conscious about.

01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:05.690
And I've known enough, because
of my life growing up with my,

01:05:05.690 --> 01:05:08.825
you know, white American
family, that people

01:05:08.825 --> 01:05:09.700
don't care that much.

01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:10.660
They just don't.

01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:13.035
If you make it a thing, they're
going to make it a thing.

01:05:13.035 --> 01:05:15.010
But if you don't,
then they don't care.

01:05:15.010 --> 01:05:17.530
And I've found
that Michiganders--

01:05:17.530 --> 01:05:20.260
they actually don't
really care how you pray.

01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:21.835
They care what you pray for.

01:05:21.835 --> 01:05:24.070
And you know, and for me,
I know what I pray for.

01:05:24.070 --> 01:05:25.210
I pray for my little girl.

01:05:25.210 --> 01:05:26.050
I pray for my wife.

01:05:26.050 --> 01:05:26.924
I pray for my family.

01:05:26.924 --> 01:05:28.150
I pray for my parents.

01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:30.569
I pray for the University
of Michigan football team.

01:05:30.569 --> 01:05:32.110
Those are the things
that I pray for.

01:05:32.110 --> 01:05:34.856
And those tend to be the things
that most Michiganders pray

01:05:34.856 --> 01:05:36.480
for, if they know
what's good for them.

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.980
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:43.720
And so, I knew that if you're
willing to stand in and have

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:46.490
a conversation-- not
ignoring your faith,

01:05:46.490 --> 01:05:48.659
right, but also not
making it about your faith

01:05:48.659 --> 01:05:50.950
--but just having a conversation
about what you believe

01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:53.050
to be what's in the best
interest of all of us,

01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:55.990
people are quite receptive.

01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:58.916
And you know, the
interesting thing about it

01:05:58.916 --> 01:06:00.790
is that there are going
to be some people who

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:01.915
hate me because I'm Muslim.

01:06:01.915 --> 01:06:04.120
Trust me, I know about that.

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:07.060
But they were never going to
vote for a Democrat anyway.

01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:09.250
And I'm not going
to make my life

01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:13.270
decisions about who fears me
out of their own bigotry, right.

01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:17.494
And for them, you know,
we don't respond to that.

01:06:17.494 --> 01:06:18.910
And the reason we
don't respond is

01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:21.790
because, for me, the
best way to get back

01:06:21.790 --> 01:06:24.250
is to force them to deal
with the cognitive dissonance

01:06:24.250 --> 01:06:26.260
of, after having eight
years of my leadership,

01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:27.760
that they have to
deal with the fact

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:29.468
their life's actually
a little bit better

01:06:29.468 --> 01:06:31.810
because of a guy named
Abdul El-Sayed, right.

01:06:31.810 --> 01:06:36.130
And so, you know, I think
for a lot of us, in a moment

01:06:36.130 --> 01:06:38.560
like this, it's
really easy to look

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:41.590
at the barriers in front
of us without paying

01:06:41.590 --> 01:06:44.500
as much attention to the
opportunities in front of us.

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:46.510
And, you know, for
whatever privilege

01:06:46.510 --> 01:06:49.370
that I have or don't have--

01:06:49.370 --> 01:06:51.850
would this be easier if
my name was Andy Smith?

01:06:51.850 --> 01:06:52.615
Probably.

01:06:52.615 --> 01:06:53.620
But here's the thing.

01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:56.457
I also get to be the
first person to do this.

01:06:56.457 --> 01:06:57.790
I mean, that's a real privilege.

01:06:57.790 --> 01:07:00.250
And I also know that,
for so many people

01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:02.560
who have never seen
themselves in a politician,

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:05.290
that I know what it was like to
watch Barack Hussein Obama get

01:07:05.290 --> 01:07:08.500
elected and be like, that guy
is kind of like me, right.

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:10.675
He may or may not be Muslim.

01:07:10.675 --> 01:07:13.050
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:20.320
The funny thing is, if you ever
want something to laugh at,

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:22.180
if you go look at
some of the sort

01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:25.390
of like, alt-right, white
supremacist blogs about me,

01:07:25.390 --> 01:07:28.030
they're like, he's like Barack
Obama, but openly Muslim.

01:07:28.030 --> 01:07:29.830
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:32.202 --> 01:07:33.910
I was like, thank you
for the comparison.

01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:34.930
I'll take it, every day.

01:07:34.930 --> 01:07:39.030
But I'm pretty sure Barack
Hussein Obama is not Muslim.

01:07:39.030 --> 01:07:41.410
The funny thing about it
is Keith Ellison is Muslim,

01:07:41.410 --> 01:07:43.159
but they're like, yeah,
his name is Keith.

01:07:43.159 --> 01:07:44.980
I mean, come on.

01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:48.290
So all of that is to say there
there's a real responsibility,

01:07:48.290 --> 01:07:52.240
I think, to focus on what we can
do rather than what we can't.

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:55.060
And, you know, in
places of privilege

01:07:55.060 --> 01:07:58.390
oftentimes the
underprivileged focus a lot

01:07:58.390 --> 01:08:01.990
on the lack of privilege rather
than recognizing that, in fact,

01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:04.090
privilege comes
with responsibility.

01:08:04.090 --> 01:08:05.800
And the responsibility
of being the first

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:07.649
is that you do it, right.

01:08:07.649 --> 01:08:09.940
And if you're so focused on
what's in front of you that

01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:11.787
stops you from
doing it, you won't.

01:08:11.787 --> 01:08:12.870
I mean, you look back at--

01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:14.350
I mean the crazy
thing about this

01:08:14.350 --> 01:08:18.220
is that, looking back at the
real leaders in our history,

01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:22.210
people like Martin Luther King,
he was assassinated at 39.

01:08:22.210 --> 01:08:25.870
Everything he accomplished,
he did before he was was 40.

01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:28.359
And I'm pretty sure,
most of the time,

01:08:28.359 --> 01:08:32.399
he didn't complain
about why it was unfair.

01:08:32.399 --> 01:08:34.810
Why it was unfair
was obvious, right.

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:36.460
What he was focused
on was what he

01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:38.501
was going to do to make
it more fair for somebody

01:08:38.501 --> 01:08:39.880
who came after him, right.

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:47.649
And I think, for those of us
who feel sometimes locked out,

01:08:47.649 --> 01:08:49.750
the job is to unlock the door.

01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:51.269
I mean, obviously,
that's the job.

01:08:51.269 --> 01:08:53.560
Don't sit there and be upset
because the door's locked.

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:55.726
You got the opportunity to
be the one with the pick.

01:08:55.726 --> 01:08:56.770
So we'll pick it, right.

01:08:56.770 --> 01:08:58.149
Or the one with the shoulders
that will break down

01:08:58.149 --> 01:08:58.838
the door, right.

01:08:58.838 --> 01:08:59.337
[CLAPPING]

01:08:59.337 --> 01:09:00.738
- Thank you very much.

01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:04.649
- Hi.

01:09:04.649 --> 01:09:05.910
My name's Kim Yannon.

01:09:05.910 --> 01:09:08.729
I'm currently doing some Public
Health, Health Care Delivery

01:09:08.729 --> 01:09:09.979
research at MIT.

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:12.359
Recent graduate of
Michigan State University,

01:09:12.359 --> 01:09:14.520
actually, so go green.

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:17.399
Go white.

01:09:17.399 --> 01:09:21.149
So-- and in the wake of
things that have been going

01:09:21.149 --> 01:09:23.340
on at Michigan
State University--

01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:24.990
the heartbreaking,
heartbreaking,

01:09:24.990 --> 01:09:27.569
heartbreaking failure
of the institution

01:09:27.569 --> 01:09:32.040
to address the Larry
Nassar crisis --I'm really

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:36.149
on board with the things you've
been saying about standing firm

01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:40.109
with our ideals against
institutions that have

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:44.520
blatantly disregarded some
of the most vulnerable people

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:48.500
that they're charged with
protecting and taking care of.

01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:52.920
So, speaking to your
public health record,

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:54.570
you mentioned, kind
of, the phrase,

01:09:54.570 --> 01:09:56.320
like, forming
unlikely partnerships,

01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:59.770
which is actually a really big
buzz phrase in public health.

01:09:59.770 --> 01:10:02.180
In fact, the Harvard Chan
School of Public Health

01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:04.200
just hosted the
Surgeon General, who

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:05.670
used a similar
phrase when he was

01:10:05.670 --> 01:10:07.760
talking about his prerogatives.

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:09.180
So can you speak
a little bit more

01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:14.280
to exactly how maybe reaching
out to an unlikely partner who

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:19.450
may have a lot of disagreements,
in terms of other values,

01:10:19.450 --> 01:10:22.230
interests, maybe even
political affiliations,

01:10:22.230 --> 01:10:24.960
and how do you identify
those partners.

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:30.780
How do you kind of
incentivize, like,

01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:34.200
an alignment of values, and
laying out, like, OK, this

01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:36.300
is valuable to you,
too, and really getting

01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:37.800
on the same page with that.

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:38.940
- Thank you.

01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:40.890
So first, I just
have to say that

01:10:40.890 --> 01:10:46.590
the massive failure at MSU--

01:10:46.590 --> 01:10:49.710
I hate to say it, it's just
one of the most heartbreaking

01:10:49.710 --> 01:10:53.760
things that I watched develop.

01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:57.750
And you think about the courage
of those women to come up

01:10:57.750 --> 01:11:00.990
and to say their truth.

01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:04.590
I just think that we need
more courage like that.

01:11:04.590 --> 01:11:06.660
And the other side of
this that often gets

01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:09.810
missed in the
conversation about MSU,

01:11:09.810 --> 01:11:12.270
and frankly, the conversation
about the Me Too movement,

01:11:12.270 --> 01:11:13.890
is the culpability
and responsibility

01:11:13.890 --> 01:11:19.530
of men to reach out and to
be a part of breaking down

01:11:19.530 --> 01:11:22.950
a culture of sexual violence
and toxic masculinity

01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:25.620
that we've allowed to
pervade our institutions

01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:28.140
and our culture for
far too long now.

01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:31.800
And if this is not a wake
up call for men to stand up

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:37.647
and to speak about these issues,
and to engage on these issues,

01:11:37.647 --> 01:11:38.730
I don't know what will be.

01:11:38.730 --> 01:11:43.020
And my hope is that men, as
a function of the courage

01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:45.870
of women to stand up and
call this what it is,

01:11:45.870 --> 01:11:49.830
will be willing to take this and
do the work that they uniquely

01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:53.410
can do around being able
to call this out everywhere

01:11:53.410 --> 01:11:54.390
we see it, right.

01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:57.990
You know, this concept
of locker room talk

01:11:57.990 --> 01:12:03.410
came out of the President's
piss poor attempt

01:12:03.410 --> 01:12:08.270
to try and justify the things
that he said about women.

01:12:08.270 --> 01:12:09.890
But locker room talk
is a real thing.

01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:13.520
And if we're not willing to have
a conversation with a young man

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:16.580
who's talking about
objectifying a woman,

01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:19.520
then the question becomes,
did we enable something?

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:21.770
And I think that's where the
locus of the conversation

01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:23.120
needs to go.

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:27.557
So about unlikely partnerships.

01:12:27.557 --> 01:12:30.140
One of the things that, I think,
is really important for folks

01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:32.720
who aspire to leadership
to remind themselves

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:35.090
is that leadership is
not just about finding

01:12:35.090 --> 01:12:36.260
the world as it is.

01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:40.320
It's about creating the world
as you believe it should be.

01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:44.960
And, oftentimes, it means
being very vocal and honest

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:47.540
about the values that
animate your work,

01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:50.304
and then watching as
people will align to what

01:12:50.304 --> 01:12:51.470
you're talking about, right.

01:12:51.470 --> 01:12:54.171
Great political
leadership is not just--

01:12:54.171 --> 01:12:56.420
we'll say effective political
leadership --is not just

01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:59.460
about being able to find what
people are talking about.

01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:01.460
It's about being
able to dictate,

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:03.620
in some way, what the
conversation ought

01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:05.070
to be able to move forward.

01:13:05.070 --> 01:13:07.160
And I'll use a very bad
example of this just

01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:08.930
to see how effective it was.

01:13:08.930 --> 01:13:10.850
Polling showed that
immigration was not

01:13:10.850 --> 01:13:12.380
even on the top-10
list of issues

01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:14.510
going into the 2016 election.

01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:17.180
But the current person
who is president now

01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:19.700
was able to make
that an issue, right.

01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:20.630
Build the wall.

01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:22.730
It's a solution
to a non-problem.

01:13:22.730 --> 01:13:25.220
But, by making a solution
to a non-problem,

01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:26.560
he turned it into a problem.

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:27.600
Does that makes sense?

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:30.500
And we have to remind
ourselves that, as leaders, we

01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:33.320
have the ability to move
the public conversation,

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:35.990
not just to find the
conversation where it is.

01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:38.030
And what that means is
that, when people see you

01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:42.590
as being a credible believer in
the things that you care about,

01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:45.080
they'll sometimes
find you in ways

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:46.770
that you wouldn't have expected.

01:13:46.770 --> 01:13:49.144
One of the things that I
learned at the Health Department

01:13:49.144 --> 01:13:51.590
was exactly this, was
when we were trying

01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:54.800
to move on certain issues,
we found that, oftentimes,

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:57.560
some of the small business
organizations in southwest

01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:59.810
Detroit, when we were
advocating against Marathon,

01:13:59.810 --> 01:14:01.201
they were our
biggest supporters.

01:14:01.201 --> 01:14:01.700
Why?

01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:05.090
Because they have to live
in that world where the air

01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:06.399
is so poisoned.

01:14:06.399 --> 01:14:07.940
They wouldn't be
the natural partner.

01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:09.680
But because you're
standing up on something,

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:11.410
they're saying, you know,
that's an issue for me, too.

01:14:11.410 --> 01:14:12.560
And I'm going to
be a part of this.

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:14.540
Even though, traditionally,
they're saying, well,

01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:15.680
why are you regulating
on business?

01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:16.670
Why are you telling
business what to do,

01:14:16.670 --> 01:14:18.294
et cetera, et cetera,
et cetera, right.

01:14:18.294 --> 01:14:22.880
And so I think it's about, more
than anything else, believing

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:24.710
in the values that
you bring forward,

01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:27.320
and the actions that
those values necessitate,

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:29.570
and then being
willing to touch hands

01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:32.600
with people who sometimes
might come out of the woodwork,

01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:33.290
right.

01:14:33.290 --> 01:14:34.664
And then the other
thing about it

01:14:34.664 --> 01:14:36.830
is being willing
to say that there

01:14:36.830 --> 01:14:39.770
is no such thing as an enemy.

01:14:39.770 --> 01:14:42.860
There is such a thing as
opposing the wrong action

01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:44.750
in a particular moment.

01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:46.370
And the willingness
to say, we're

01:14:46.370 --> 01:14:49.640
going to be about
values, rather than being

01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:54.500
about traditional enemy
versus friend alliances,

01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:56.666
allows you then to be very
thoughtful about being

01:14:56.666 --> 01:14:58.790
able to pick partnerships
across the various things

01:14:58.790 --> 01:15:01.467
that you work on, because you
are credible on the issues

01:15:01.467 --> 01:15:02.300
that you care about.

01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:03.830
I think, more than
anything else,

01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:05.270
people look for
partners that are

01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:07.250
firm on what they believe in.

01:15:07.250 --> 01:15:09.690
Because they don't
want to be shown,

01:15:09.690 --> 01:15:13.550
you know, for being unable
to move the world the way

01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:14.700
they want to move it.

01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:16.725
So being able to say,
this is what I believe in,

01:15:16.725 --> 01:15:19.100
this is how I believe in it,
and this how I fight for it.

01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:21.950
Keep a big smile on my face, and
we're going to move forward--

01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:23.450
you'll find that people
come out of the woodwork

01:15:23.450 --> 01:15:25.259
and will want to work
with you on things,

01:15:25.259 --> 01:15:27.050
and in partnerships
you would never expect.

01:15:27.050 --> 01:15:29.990
And I think it's being
firm on what you believe,

01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:32.484
driving forward on the
action that necessitates,

01:15:32.484 --> 01:15:34.400
and then being willing
to partner with anybody

01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:36.899
and everybody who wants to get
that thing done-- recognizing

01:15:36.899 --> 01:15:40.040
that in the next iteration,
you might not be partners.

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:42.790
But hey, that's
the world, right.

01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:45.124
- Thank you

01:15:45.124 --> 01:15:46.670
- Hey, I'm Amanda Markovitz.

01:15:46.670 --> 01:15:48.560
I'm a doctoral student
in epidemiology

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:50.060
and a former Michigander.

01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:50.660
- All right.

01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:51.920
You want to come back?

01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:53.789
We need epidemiologists.

01:15:53.789 --> 01:15:54.830
- Yeah, I had a question.

01:15:54.830 --> 01:15:57.170
So, you know, we talk a
lot about the disconnect

01:15:57.170 --> 01:15:58.790
between science and politics.

01:15:58.790 --> 01:16:01.555
And I'm so glad that
you're bridging that gap,

01:16:01.555 --> 01:16:03.680
and especially that you're
talking about statistics

01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:05.420
in a way that reaches
people, and talking

01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:07.820
about these stories
and anecdotes that

01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:09.120
really matter to people.

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:13.010
And I wonder if you have other
lessons for us scientists that

01:16:13.010 --> 01:16:15.950
are trying to communicate
with our communities-- maybe

01:16:15.950 --> 01:16:18.830
not running for Governor, but
on a smaller level --and ways

01:16:18.830 --> 01:16:20.080
that we can do a better job.

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:20.960
- Yeah.

01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:22.760
So first of all, do it.

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:25.940
You know, a lot of scientists--

01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:28.080
the incentives that
exist in academia

01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:31.107
sometimes preclude
well-meaning scientists

01:16:31.107 --> 01:16:33.690
who want their work to move the
public conversation from doing

01:16:33.690 --> 01:16:36.967
it, because it's
not what's rewarded.

01:16:36.967 --> 01:16:39.300
And I honestly think that's
a big problem with academia,

01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:41.430
and one of the things we
all need to fix, right.

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:42.240
Let's be clear.

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:45.120
If your work is not actually
moving the public conversation,

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:47.880
then what's it moving--
especially in epi,

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:49.470
especially when so
much of what we do

01:16:49.470 --> 01:16:56.310
is about misaligned actions
of institutions, right.

01:16:56.310 --> 01:16:59.572
So be the courageous one in the
institution who communicates,

01:16:59.572 --> 01:17:00.780
who gets your work out there.

01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:03.600
Don't just write the paper,
write the op-ed, right.

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:04.620
That's number one.

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:10.830
Number two, oftentimes
the difference

01:17:10.830 --> 01:17:14.850
in the ways that scientists
communicate versus policy

01:17:14.850 --> 01:17:17.530
people communicate
allow the conversations

01:17:17.530 --> 01:17:18.780
to miss each other in the air.

01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:22.620
So scientists always ask,
what's not known, right.

01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:24.420
That's the question:
what's not known?

01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:28.230
And then, how do I get to making
a known out of an unknown.

01:17:28.230 --> 01:17:30.480
Right, that's like
the push for science.

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:32.670
Policy people
aren't asking what's

01:17:32.670 --> 01:17:34.896
not known, they're
asking, what are

01:17:34.896 --> 01:17:36.270
the implications
of what is known

01:17:36.270 --> 01:17:37.555
for what I can do right now?

01:17:37.555 --> 01:17:38.840
Do you see what I mean.

01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:41.424
And I think it's on both of them
to be able to translate well,

01:17:41.424 --> 01:17:43.631
right, because most of the
time, if you have a policy

01:17:43.631 --> 01:17:45.480
person who's not
trained in science,

01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:48.236
they're always asking why the
scientist keeps putting caveats

01:17:48.236 --> 01:17:49.360
behind what they're saying.

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:53.160
Because most science would
be like, this is the--

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:56.730
my work's suggesting-- like
last paragraph of every paper,

01:17:56.730 --> 01:18:00.510
right --this work suggests
that opportunities

01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:02.050
for future research
look like this.

01:18:02.050 --> 01:18:04.830
You're like, no no no, what
does this mean for the world?

01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:06.780
And a lot of
scientists will always

01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:09.670
caveat what they
tell you they think

01:18:09.670 --> 01:18:13.950
should happen based on the best,
most rigorous work out there.

01:18:13.950 --> 01:18:15.450
And if scientists
themselves who are

01:18:15.450 --> 01:18:16.810
doing the best,
most rigorous work

01:18:16.810 --> 01:18:19.309
aren't willing to give you a
firm answer, then at some point

01:18:19.309 --> 01:18:21.790
you're like, meh,
nobody knows anything.

01:18:21.790 --> 01:18:22.690
I'm serious.

01:18:22.690 --> 01:18:25.150
And so part of what scientists
need to be able to do

01:18:25.150 --> 01:18:27.880
is speak like policy
people do, which is to say,

01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:30.320
of the current
opportunities that exist,

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:32.792
this is the one
that would create

01:18:32.792 --> 01:18:34.750
x outcome that you are
interested in maximizing

01:18:34.750 --> 01:18:35.458
your policymaker.

01:18:35.458 --> 01:18:36.520
See what I mean?

01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:38.770
So being able to
speak that language.

01:18:38.770 --> 01:18:42.760
And then, one of the
interesting thing things

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:46.210
that I've come to
appreciate about science

01:18:46.210 --> 01:18:53.190
is that we often get
so focused on methods,

01:18:53.190 --> 01:18:57.210
and the way of knowing, and
the epistemology of the thing

01:18:57.210 --> 01:19:01.960
that we get sidetracked from
issues that actually matter,

01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:04.340
and actually change
facts on the ground.

01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:06.640
And I would encourage
any young scientist

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:11.440
who wants their work to shape
the public conversation--

01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:14.740
or even more importantly,
public policy --to ask,

01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:17.320
every question that
you ask as a scientist,

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:20.110
ask yourself what the policy
analog of this should be.

01:19:20.110 --> 01:19:21.736
What does this suggest
about the world.

01:19:21.736 --> 01:19:23.776
And if you don't have a
good answer, that's fine.

01:19:23.776 --> 01:19:24.700
You don't have to yet.

01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:28.547
But remember, policymakers are
constantly making decisions.

01:19:28.547 --> 01:19:30.880
We don't have the luxury of
waiting for future research.

01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:32.004
Do you see what I'm saying?

01:19:32.004 --> 01:19:34.690
And so if you recognize
that to be the case,

01:19:34.690 --> 01:19:38.512
and you know that your
work can animate something,

01:19:38.512 --> 01:19:39.970
then I think it is
a responsibility

01:19:39.970 --> 01:19:42.400
to stand up and say, I know.

01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:45.940
I'll say this, as a
professor, I always

01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:48.940
knew that my PhD students
were ready to graduate

01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:53.286
when they could comfortably
say, I don't know.

01:19:53.286 --> 01:19:54.910
Because I think the
exercise of getting

01:19:54.910 --> 01:19:58.690
a PhD is becoming comfortable
with the vastness of knowledge,

01:19:58.690 --> 01:20:00.940
and what you actually don't
know about that knowledge,

01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:03.190
right, what are the
bounds of your expertise.

01:20:03.190 --> 01:20:06.250
And the problem with
that is that most people

01:20:06.250 --> 01:20:07.730
don't think that way.

01:20:07.730 --> 01:20:09.790
Most people, and the
nature of ignorance,

01:20:09.790 --> 01:20:12.160
is to claim knowledge, and
the nature of knowledge

01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:14.660
is to claim ignorance.

01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:15.282
Right.

01:20:15.282 --> 01:20:16.740
And if you think
about it that way,

01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:20.120
that's why we have a bunch of
really ignorant policymakers

01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:25.130
making decisions, and scientists
being like, I'm not sure.

01:20:25.130 --> 01:20:26.780
And so when you
recognize that that's

01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:29.210
just the social pressure
behind what you do,

01:20:29.210 --> 01:20:31.820
there's a responsibility to
be able to step up and say,

01:20:31.820 --> 01:20:32.630
actually, I do--

01:20:32.630 --> 01:20:38.350
I know a lot more than you do,
and to call it how you see it.

01:20:38.350 --> 01:20:40.362
Truth has a moral
implication to it.

01:20:40.362 --> 01:20:42.070
And the last thing
I'll say on this issue

01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:45.670
is that we have sort
of devoided science

01:20:45.670 --> 01:20:49.090
from the moral
imperative for truth.

01:20:49.090 --> 01:20:51.950
And if we believe
something to be true,

01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:53.710
then it has actionable
responsibility

01:20:53.710 --> 01:20:55.120
that comes with it.

01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:58.570
And our failure to action
to make that actionable--

01:20:58.570 --> 01:21:00.220
that carries more weight.

01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:02.470
And I think there
is a responsibility

01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:05.650
for the community to come
to grips with the fact

01:21:05.650 --> 01:21:08.530
that we don't want to be
doing science in a vacuum--

01:21:08.530 --> 01:21:10.570
because we're not doing
science in a vacuum.

01:21:10.570 --> 01:21:13.900
And the world right now, when
it comes to good information,

01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:15.141
can feel a lot like a vacuum.

01:21:15.141 --> 01:21:17.140
So if you're doing the
work that fills the void,

01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:20.142
then be a part of pushing that
work out in the world right.

01:21:20.142 --> 01:21:22.600
So thank you for the question,
and you know, for all of you

01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:25.030
guys who are really pushing
the public conversation

01:21:25.030 --> 01:21:27.711
to be more rigorous and more
scientifically-oriented.

01:21:27.711 --> 01:21:28.210
Thank you.

01:21:28.210 --> 01:21:30.820
But keep doing it, because
again, the people who

01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:34.180
don't know tend to speak the
loudest, and the people who do

01:21:34.180 --> 01:21:35.895
tend to be the quietest, so--

01:21:35.895 --> 01:21:37.835
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:21:37.835 --> 01:21:43.155
[APPLAUSE]

01:21:43.155 --> 01:21:43.655
I

01:21:43.655 --> 01:21:48.990
- Want to thank Dr. El-Sayed
for inspiration for us voters,

01:21:48.990 --> 01:21:51.030
for activists, for scientists.

01:21:51.030 --> 01:21:53.780
That was really phenomenal.
