virtue of occupying certain roles the
most important example of this position

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269
most important example of this position
 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:45.900
most important example of this position
in the history of religion and the

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910
in the history of religion and the
 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.530
in the history of religion and the
philosophy has been Confucianism the

third direction is the direction that I

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970
third direction is the direction that I
 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.789
third direction is the direction that I
call in this book the religion of the

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799
call in this book the religion of the
 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:59.410
call in this book the religion of the
future the struggle with the world it

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420
future the struggle with the world it
 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.190
future the struggle with the world it
tells us that there is a trajectory of

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200
tells us that there is a trajectory of
 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.330
tells us that there is a trajectory of
ascent by which through changes in how

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340
ascent by which through changes in how
 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.030
ascent by which through changes in how
we live and in how we organize society

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040
we live and in how we organize society
 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.539
we live and in how we organize society
we can rise to a greater life and share

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549
we can rise to a greater life and share
 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.039
we can rise to a greater life and share
in the attributes that we ascribe to God

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049
in the attributes that we ascribe to God
 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.370
in the attributes that we ascribe to God
and thus this ascent requires a struggle

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380
and thus this ascent requires a struggle
 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.560
and thus this ascent requires a struggle
and so I call it the struggle with the

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570
and so I call it the struggle with the
 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:27.030
and so I call it the struggle with the
world

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040
