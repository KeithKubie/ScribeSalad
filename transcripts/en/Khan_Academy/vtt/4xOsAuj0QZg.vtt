00:00:00.358 --> 00:00:02.512
- [Voiceover] In the video
on competitive inhibition,

00:00:02.512 --> 00:00:06.189
we saw that competitive inhibition
is all about a substrate

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:09.135
or a potential substrate,
an inhibitor competing

00:00:09.135 --> 00:00:10.259
for the enzyme.

00:00:10.415 --> 00:00:12.880
And whoever gets there
first, gets the enzyme.

00:00:12.887 --> 00:00:15.080
If the inhibitor gets there first,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.397
then the substrate isn't able to bind,

00:00:17.397 --> 00:00:19.814
and of course no reaction is catalyzed.

00:00:19.814 --> 00:00:22.110
If the substrate is
able to get there first,

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.142
then the inhibitor isn't able to bind,

00:00:24.142 --> 00:00:27.108
and the reaction does get catalyzed.

00:00:27.108 --> 00:00:28.612
Now the inhibitor and the substrate,

00:00:28.612 --> 00:00:31.761
they both might compete
for the active site,

00:00:31.761 --> 00:00:33.508
if we're talking about
competitive inhibition.

00:00:33.508 --> 00:00:36.454
But you also have allosteric
competitive inhibition.

00:00:36.454 --> 00:00:38.587
Where they're still trying
to compete for the enzyme,

00:00:38.587 --> 00:00:40.761
whoever gets there first, gets the enzyme.

00:00:40.761 --> 00:00:43.240
But the inhibitor doesn't necessarily bind

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.714
at the active site, they
bind at an allosteric site.

00:00:46.714 --> 00:00:48.136
But it's the same idea.

00:00:48.136 --> 00:00:50.026
If the inhibitor gets
to the allosteric site

00:00:50.026 --> 00:00:52.992
before the substrate
gets to the active site,

00:00:52.992 --> 00:00:55.247
then the confirmation
of the protein changes,

00:00:55.247 --> 00:00:57.909
so that the active site, you
know it changes a little bit,

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.013
something like let me
draw in that same color,

00:01:02.013 --> 00:01:03.902
the confirmation of the
protein changes a little bit.

00:01:03.902 --> 00:01:08.760
And then the actual intended
substrate isn't able to bind.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.791
If the intended substrate binds,

00:01:10.791 --> 00:01:12.803
then that changes the
confirmation a little bit

00:01:12.803 --> 00:01:15.302
at the allosteric site,
and then the inhibitor

00:01:15.302 --> 00:01:16.765
isn't able to bind.

00:01:16.765 --> 00:01:18.573
So if that's competitive
inhibition, where there's like

00:01:18.573 --> 00:01:20.787
who gets to the enzyme first,

00:01:20.787 --> 00:01:23.652
what is non-competitive
inhibition all about?

00:01:23.652 --> 00:01:25.365
Well let's draw that.

00:01:25.928 --> 00:01:28.148
So, non-competitive inhibition.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.300
So, non-competitive inhibition.

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:39.134
And the big picture here is that

00:01:39.134 --> 00:01:41.531
they can both bind.

00:01:41.531 --> 00:01:44.213
Whether one binds to the
enzyme doesn't affect

00:01:44.213 --> 00:01:45.838
whether the other binds.

00:01:45.838 --> 00:01:47.450
So let's talk about it a little bit.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.497
So, this is my enzyme.

00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:54.453
That's my enzyme, right over there.

00:01:54.453 --> 00:01:57.622
And what we have happening, of course,

00:01:57.622 --> 00:02:01.868
is if the substrate's able
to get to the active site,

00:02:01.868 --> 00:02:04.794
then of course the reaction
is going to be catalyzed.

00:02:04.794 --> 00:02:07.354
And we saw that up here.

00:02:07.354 --> 00:02:09.853
Substrate binds to the active site,

00:02:09.853 --> 00:02:11.560
and then the reaction is catalyzed,

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.429
in this case the substrate got broken up

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:16.334
into two other molecules.

00:02:16.334 --> 00:02:18.345
But in non-competitive inhibition,

00:02:18.345 --> 00:02:20.499
what happens is a substrate can bind,

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:23.831
and so can an inhibitor.

00:02:23.831 --> 00:02:26.980
And the inhibitor can bind
at an allosteric site,

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.272
so this is our inhibitor right over here.

00:02:30.272 --> 00:02:32.994
The inhibitor can bind
at an allosteric site,

00:02:32.994 --> 00:02:34.335
and when they're both bound,

00:02:34.335 --> 00:02:36.773
notice they're not
competing for the enzyme,

00:02:36.773 --> 00:02:38.276
they both can be on the enzyme.

00:02:38.276 --> 00:02:41.324
This character can bind
to the enzyme whether

00:02:41.324 --> 00:02:43.092
or not the substrate is there.

00:02:43.092 --> 00:02:44.900
But if this guy binds to the enzyme,

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.871
the substrate can still
bind to the enzyme,

00:02:46.871 --> 00:02:49.634
but now the reaction
isn't going to proceed.

00:02:49.634 --> 00:02:52.884
So now the reaction is
going to look like this:

00:02:52.884 --> 00:02:57.253
so now there's not going to be a reaction.

00:02:57.253 --> 00:03:01.478
If this happens, the only
option is that they both unbind.

00:03:01.478 --> 00:03:04.018
So now this character is just going

00:03:04.018 --> 00:03:05.420
to leave the active site.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.687
No reaction has been catalyzed.

00:03:09.687 --> 00:03:12.734
So, it just prevented
anything from happening.

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:16.188
And maybe this guy leaves as well.

00:03:16.188 --> 00:03:18.484
And the way I showed this
non-competitive inhibition,

00:03:18.484 --> 00:03:20.455
I showed it happening
at an allosteric site,

00:03:20.455 --> 00:03:23.766
the inhibitor attaching
at an allosteric site,

00:03:23.766 --> 00:03:25.717
but it actually doesn't even
have to be the same case

00:03:25.717 --> 00:03:27.464
as long as it does not prevent,

00:03:27.464 --> 00:03:31.649
it can actually bind close
to or even at the active site

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:33.579
as long as it does not
prevent the substrate

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.245
from binding to the active site.

00:03:35.245 --> 00:03:38.055
So you can even have
a situation like this:

00:03:43.933 --> 00:03:45.091
this is the one that's typically given

00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:47.001
for non-competitive
inhibition where you have

00:03:47.001 --> 00:03:48.972
the inhibitor binding
at an allosteric site,

00:03:48.972 --> 00:03:51.674
but the idea here is that both of them

00:03:51.674 --> 00:03:53.949
can bind to the enzyme.

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:55.392
If one of them binds first,

00:03:55.392 --> 00:03:56.773
then the other one can still bind.

00:03:56.773 --> 00:03:59.496
If the substrate binds first,

00:03:59.496 --> 00:04:01.975
then the inhibitor can still bind.

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:03.376
If the inhibitor binds first,

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:05.063
then the substrate can still bind.

00:04:05.063 --> 00:04:10.063
But, the reaction is not
going to be catalyzed.

00:04:11.422 --> 00:04:14.734
But you can even have a situation

00:04:14.734 --> 00:04:17.598
where the inhibitor and the substrate

00:04:17.598 --> 00:04:21.093
can both bind in or
around the active site.

00:04:21.093 --> 00:04:25.603
So that's the inhibitor, and
then this is our substrate,

00:04:25.603 --> 00:04:27.411
this is the substrate.

00:04:27.411 --> 00:04:30.500
But once again, this reaction
is not going to occur.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.060
We have non-competitive inhibition.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.868
They're not competing for the thing,

00:04:34.868 --> 00:04:37.184
they can both bind to
it, whether they can bind

00:04:37.184 --> 00:04:39.012
isn't dependent on whether
the other one is bound,

00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:42.324
but if the inhibitor is there
then it's not going to allow

00:04:42.324 --> 00:04:46.286
the reaction to actually be catalyzed.

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.013
As opposed to competitive inhibition,

00:04:48.013 --> 00:04:49.496
whoever gets to the enzyme first,

00:04:49.496 --> 00:04:51.446
gets the enzyme.

00:04:51.446 --> 00:04:52.795
Hopefully that clarifies things.
