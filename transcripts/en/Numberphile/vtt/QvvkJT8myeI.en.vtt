00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
[Tony]: I thought we'd have a look at some of the shortest papers

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.500
that have ever been written.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.960
One of the sort of most famous ones was this one here

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.620
by Lander and Parkin.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.180
Which you can literally see, look how short it is!

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.780
There's virtually nothing there. But the content's really good

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.790
because it actually disproves a very long-standing conjecture

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.000
that had held for hundreds of years.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.120
[Brady]: So now we're just disproving with an actual example?

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.360
[Tony]: Exactly, they were just proving the Euler conjecture, and what is the Euler conjecture?

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.970
Well it's kind of related to Fermat's Last Theorem.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.730
Fermat's theorem, what does it say?

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.600
You've got two numbers, a1 to the k plus a2 to the k equals b to the k.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.900
And basically it says there are no integers solutions for k greater than two. Okay, that's Fermat's Last Theorem.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.492
Euler's conjecture was a generalization of this.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.320
Basically, you just take n of these guys, and again, now you're saying,

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.400
Euler conjecture would be there are no integer solutions for k greater than n.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.820
No integer solutions for k greater than n, so of course,

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.040
Fermat's Last Theorem is the case of n equals two.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.460
This is the general case, right?

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.180
But this is not true, right? This paper proves it.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.240
Basically, in this example, n is four, but k is five.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.873
Disproven, there you go.

00:01:10.873 --> 00:01:13.420
So, in a nutshell, it disproves it.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.350
But this doesn't have the record anymore. I don't know if it ever did have the record.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.961
It's sort of a classic short paper that achieves quite a lot.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.260
The record is, I think, currently held by this paper,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.540
by your friend, John Conway, and somebody called Alex Sofer,

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.909
I think it is, I think that's how you pronounce it.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.720
Okay, so they ask a question in the title,

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.850
so I think that's a bit of a cheat.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.720
And then, so they're basically asking about

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.590
how many equilateral triangles you need to cover an equilateral triangle of a given size.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.906
Basically, the paper just says n squared plus two can, and then it has a picture of their solution.

00:01:43.961 --> 00:01:45.993
So it's kind of got two words in it, right?

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.467
They had the following question, right?

00:01:47.467 --> 00:01:49.890
So you take an equilateral triangle

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.640
and you imagine it's got a length of side n,

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.273
and then you could ask, well, how many triangles of side one,

00:01:57.603 --> 00:02:00.420
you know, so unit side triangles, equilateral triangles,

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.740
do I need to to fill it, to cover it?

00:02:03.196 --> 00:02:07.910
You know the answer. It turns out to be n squared, it's quite easy to see that.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:08.840
Show you by example.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:17.579
If you've got side two, so we've got side two, we can fill it with four equilateral triangles, like that.

00:02:17.711 --> 00:02:21.860
So, these have all got side one and four of them fill the equilateral triangle you started with.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.480
[BRADY]: Which is two squared. 
[TONY]: Which is two squared exactly, right?

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.970
And it generalizes and the answer is n squared for one of side n.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.630
Okay, so what these guys want to know is

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.852
what if we make it a little bit bigger than n?

00:02:32.935 --> 00:02:37.401
Not n plus one but just a little bit bigger than n,
so n plus epsilon.

00:02:37.492 --> 00:02:38.870
How many do you need then?

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.100
Okay, so you might think,

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.440
"I know I'm going to need more than n squared."

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.990
Because n squared would cover the original one, right?

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.168
So I'm gonna need more than, so you're going to need at least n squared plus one.

00:02:49.533 --> 00:02:52.076
So they were asking, well can you do it with n squared plus one?

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:53.930
And they didn't actually answer the question.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.160
They say actually you need n squared plus two.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.390
How do they show that?

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:04.370
Well, what you do is you sort of stop it at n minus one.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.285
So you draw, consider n minus one there.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.833
Okay and then you've got a little bit there of one plus epsilon.

00:03:13.968 --> 00:03:15.996
So you've got a little of one plus epsilon bit there.

00:03:16.413 --> 00:03:21.596
Now this thing, this big thing in here,

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:25.689
is going to need n minus one squared to fill it. ok ?

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.340
Now, what they do is they say

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.358
right, what I need to fill this little bit left over here?

00:03:30.726 --> 00:03:35.706
Well, the way they do it is you know this has got length 
n plus epsilon that way.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.000
Okay, so you squeeze in.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.960
you're not going to cover these edges

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.150
with n edges of the triangle, right?

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.942
you're going to need at least n plus one.

00:03:47.203 --> 00:03:50.278
Okay, so you squeeze in n plus one of them.

00:03:50.928 --> 00:03:53.610
Like so.

00:03:56.052 --> 00:03:57.080
[BRADY]: Maybe overlapping.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.570
[TONY]: They definitely have to overlap, right?

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.356
Because this is n plus epsilon, so it's n plus a tiny bit.

00:04:01.596 --> 00:04:04.866
And you're going to squeeze it n plus one of them, so they're definitely gonna overlap,

00:04:05.053 --> 00:04:06.991
So you get n plus one of them there.

00:04:07.753 --> 00:04:11.029
Okay and you fill in the top bits.

00:04:11.763 --> 00:04:15.030
To fill in the top bits so on and so forth,

00:04:15.273 --> 00:04:16.775
you need another n,

00:04:17.554 --> 00:04:18.760
and then you can do it.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.160
So how much have you got total now?

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.568
In total you've got n minus one squared plus n plus n plus one.

00:04:27.693 --> 00:04:31.088
Okay you work out what that is, this is...

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.471
n squared minus 2n plus one plus 2n plus one,

00:04:37.728 --> 00:04:40.024
which is n squared plus two.

00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:43.280
[BRADY]: The extra bit you need could be less than two, they're just showing it's--

00:04:43.558 --> 00:04:46.573
[TONY]: Yes, so that's just what I think about it. I don't think they even answered the question.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.830
The question is can n squared plus one unit equilateral triangles

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.450
cover an equilateral triangle of side n plus epsilon?

00:04:54.128 --> 00:04:58.264
They don't say yes or no, they just say n squaredplus 2 can.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.650
Maybe they could have just said "maybe" (laughs).

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.786
I don't know, they don't answer the question!

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:05.220
If you look in other fields there are shorter ones there.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.000
I mean, I found some others.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.560
There's this one.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.220
It's not maths, but in the applied behavior analysis,

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.010
it's "the unsuccessful self-treatment of a case of writer's block".

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.610
Of course, there's nothing there.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.240
There's another one: comprehensive overview of chemical-free consumer products.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.848
This is in a chemistry journal,

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:25.871
and there aren't any.

00:05:26.111 --> 00:05:28.210
Actually, this didn't just didn't appear in the journal.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.930
They didn't publish it, but they did include it for amusement purposes.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.650
There's plenty of short papers out there.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.780
There's also short abstracts.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.730
That's another thing you can you can look at.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.390
This is one that caught my attention.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:42.180
This is a physics one.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.928
Can the apparent superluminal neutrino speeds be explained as a quantum weak measurement?

00:05:47.673 --> 00:05:52.110
There's a classic thing in, you know, within academia,

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.942
that if your title has a question mark at the end of it,

00:05:54.942 --> 00:05:56.960
then the answer is probably not.

00:05:57.137 --> 00:05:59.558
And indeed their abstract is "Probably not."

00:05:59.749 --> 00:06:01.280
I would actually say definitely not,

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.090
because we now know that there are no faster-than-light neutrinos,

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.100
that that was just a screwed-up experiment.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.500
There's an even shorter abstract there.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.810
There's another one with a question.

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.460
Is the sequence of earthquakes in southern California with aftershocks removed Poissonian?

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.361
So this is a mixture of maths and, I guess, geography.

00:06:18.883 --> 00:06:20.800
But the answer isn't "probably not", it's "Yes"!

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.598
So that sort of goes against the usual rules of the game.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.560
But this is all just a bit of fun, right?

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.149
But I think what's more, what would be better is like,

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.360
it's not so much how short the paper is

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.580
but, in a way, impact per word.

00:06:36.827 --> 00:06:39.314
So short paper that achieved a lot.

00:06:39.697 --> 00:06:42.450
Okay now I, this is clearly open for debate,

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.820
but i think that the candidate for this

00:06:44.973 --> 00:06:48.770
is this bad boy by the beautiful mind, John Nash.

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.060
So this is a very, very short paper,

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.980
which it starts there and it finishes there.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:59.029
Okay, so it's a page long and this basically started off game theory.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.580
This is really one of the main papers 
underlying economics.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.560
He basically ultimately won the Nobel Prize for economics for this paper

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.940
and other ideas related to it.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.640
So I think in terms of impact per word

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.240
this is probably the winner.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.680
John Nash's thesis is famously short as well.

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:16.950
I've got a copy of his thesis here.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:20.280
Non-cooperative, of course, it's about game theory, 
Non-cooperative Games.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:25.020
It's only like 26 pages long.
It's like wow, you know what I mean?

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.020
This thesis won a Nobel Prize and it's 26 pages long.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.640
There's a bit of an urban myth.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.820
If you do a maths degree, as I did,

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.960
there's an urban myth that goes around the students

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.020
is to, there's this part, this PhD thesis

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.740
that someone did once and it's like a page long

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:47.840
and it proved some result from, 
that hadn't been known for hundreds of years,

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.900
and it just did it in one page and there you go, bang,
PhD thesis came out.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:58.140
I think that is a myth but I would love it if somebody found it out that it wasn't.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.560
I've had a little digging around and I don't think it is.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:04.130
I think in terms of short theses, big impact,

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:07.390
you'd do well to be good ol' John Nash.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.260
[Brady]: This episode has been supported by audible.com,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.760
and if you've got some reading to catch up on,

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.800
an audiobook is a great way to do it.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:18.030
Among Audible's vast collection of titles

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.890
is the acclaimed book A Beautiful Mind,

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:23.260
the biography of John Nash, 
who we've just been discussing.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:24.840
It's written by Sylvia Nasar.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.420
Or if biographies aren't your thing,
 but you still want something

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:28.520
with a bit of a math twist,

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.840
I also highly recommend The Humans, a novel by Matt Haig,

00:08:32.849 --> 00:08:35.409
and one of my favorite stories of the last few years.

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:39.200
But whatever the sort of thing you like, I can guarantee Audible is going to have it.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.520
And you can also get started with a free 30-day trial

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.120
by going to audible.com/numberphile.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.000
They've got a great store, a cool app,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.840
really excellent features like Whispersync for voice so you can synchronize your audiobook on Kindle

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.360
without losing your place.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.840
And if you do give that free 30-day trial a go,

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.800
make sure you use the address audible.com/numberphile

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:07.280
just so they know you came from the channel here.
