00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.220
This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Pacifico Beer.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.799
Sharks: they’re the predators of the sea,
but are they as dangerous as everyone thinks?

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.080
We’ve got a list of animals way deadlier
than sharks - and some of them, may surprise

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.670
you.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:21.970
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and I’d
be lying if I said I wasn’t petrified of

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.970
sharks.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.140
With their tiny, beady eyes and layers upon
layers of sharp teeth.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.140
They’re terrifying!

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.480
But you know what - in the grand scheme of
animals that can kill you, sharks are actually

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.770
quite low on the list.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.060
Only a handful of the over 375 different shark
species are known for attacking humans, and

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.050
while the world sees anywhere from 50-70 shark
attacks every year, less than 20 of those

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.350
are actual fatalities.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.300
So clearly, sharks are getting a bad rap.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.120
There are animals out there that are way cuter,
and kill way more people every year.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.190
Elephants, for example, kill almost 500 people
a year - which makes them 10 times more dangerous

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.190
than sharks.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.730
And the fact that they’re the largest land
mammal, means they can easily crush someone

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:01.730
with their weight.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.940
They’re also known to exhibit unpredictable
behaviors, and attack people without warning

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.180
- especially during reproductive season.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.040
The same goes for Hippos - another adorable
animal that seems harmless, but is actually

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.290
super deadly.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.690
They’re responsible for about 2,900 deaths
every year, killing more people in Africa

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.260
than any other large animal.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.610
They’re a naturally aggressive - and territorial
- species, and you might not think it, but

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.210
they can run up to 20 mph - faster than a
human, with jaws that open 4 feet wide and

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.290
clamp down like a sledgehammer.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.780
They could literally chase down a baby and
eat it!

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.040
Which is ironic, cause baby hippos are one
of the cutest things on earth.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.090
Not so cute, are crocodiles - but they’re
still deadlier than sharks!

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.920
They’re the largest reptile in the world,
with the largest bite force ever measured

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.670
- up to 3,700 lbs of pressure per square inch.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.610
People have literally been eaten alive by
crocodiles (EWWW), and while the American

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.220
ones aren’t really known for their aggressiveness
- there are certain species in Africa and

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.119
Asia, like Nile and saltwater crocodiles,
respectively, that attack up to 1,000 people

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:03.119
every year.

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.159
Which begs the question: WHY DO PEOPLE STILL
GO IN LAKES AND RIVERS?

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.659
NOTHING GOOD CAN COME OF THAT.

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.530
You have no idea what’s in there!

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.530
Snails, for example?

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.090
Those seem pretty harmless, right?

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.090
NOPE!

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.450
Freshwater snails kill up to 200,000 people
a year, thanks to Schistosomiasis - a parasitic

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.640
worm that snails release into fresh bodies
of water.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.030
Anyone who comes into contact with that water,
especially in poorer nations, can contract

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.030
it.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.060
And once it gets into your veins, it makes
its way to your urinary tract and intestines,

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.170
laying eggs and causing lifelong problems,
including death.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.420
It may only kill 200,000 people a year - but
some reports say it affects nearly 240 million

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.980
people worldwide.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.170
Making it one of the world’s most deadly
parasitic diseases, second only to…malaria.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.170
That’s right.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.910
Of all the animals in the world, mosquitos
are BY FAR the deadliest.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.560
These little guys infect over 500 million
people every year, killing almost a million

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.560
worldwide.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.230
It’s the Plasmodium parasite that lives
in the saliva of mosquitos, and travels into

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.290
your bloodstream after you get bitten.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.160
The classic symptom is repeated cycles of
shivering cold, followed by intense sweating

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.160
and fever.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.319
And if left untreated, it can lead to neurological
symptoms, respiratory illness, and death.

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.819
It’s estimated that a child dies every 1
minute due to malaria, in Africa alone.

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.170
I’ll bet sharks don’t seem quite as bad
now, huh?

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.170
I mean yeah, they might look scary - but at
least you know you can avoid them, by just

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.360
not going in the ocean.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.150
And that’s more than I can say for mosquitos:
nature’s tiny silent killers.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.590
Hopefully, none of this has scared you out
of any travel plans you may have - but if

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.310
it has, no need to worry!

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.150
With Pacifico’s new campaign, you can now
travel the world from the comfort of your

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.150
home computer.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.240
Underneath every Pacifico bottle cap, you’ll
find GPS coordinates to one of 21 amazing

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.489
locations throughout Baja, Mexico, and the
U.S. west coast.

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.080
So the next time you crack one open, just
hit up DiscoverPacifico.com on your desktop

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.840
computer or mobile phone, enter the GPS coordinates,
and from there, you can watch a 1-2 minute

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.430
video highlighting what makes each of those
spots truly incredible.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.819
In the meantime, let us know what animal you’re
most afraid - whether it’s sharks, ostriches,

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.480
or maybe even... humans?

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.340
That is a valid answer!

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.470
Just leave your responses in the comments
below - and as always, thank you guys for

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.650
watching!
