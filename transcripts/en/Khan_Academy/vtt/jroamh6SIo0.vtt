00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.330
So let's get some practice
simplifying polynomials,

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.830
especially in the
case where we have

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.150
more than one
variable over here.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.720
So I have 4x squared y
minus 3x squared minus 2y.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.010
So that entire expression
plus the entire expression

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:20.560
8xy minus 3x squared
plus 2x squared y plus 4.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.830
So the first thing
that jumps out at me

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.410
is that I'm just adding this
expression to this expression.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.620
So to a large degree, these
parentheses don't matter.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:34.710
So I can just rewrite it as
4x squared y minus 3x squared

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:43.080
minus 2y plus 8xy minus
3x squared plus 2x squared

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.050
y plus 4.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.940
Now we can try to group
similar terms or like terms.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.060
So let's think about
what we have over here.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.900
So this first term right
here is a 4x squared y.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.760
So can I add this to any
of the other terms here?

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.151
Do we have any other
x squared y terms?

00:01:03.151 --> 00:01:04.650
Well, sure, this
one right over here

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.640
is another x squared y term.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.380
If I have 4 of
something-- in this case,

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.360
I have 4x squared y's and
I add 2x squared y's to it,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.720
how many x squared
y's do I now have?

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:24.990
Well, 4 plus 2-- I now
have 6x squared y's.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.560
Now let's move on to this term.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.590
So I have negative 3x squareds.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.050
Do I have any more x
squareds in this expression

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.590
right over here?

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.210
Well, sure, I have another
negative 3x squared.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.710
So if I have negative
3 of something

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.140
and then I have another negative
3, I end up with negative 6

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.890
of that thing.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.900
So it's negative 6x squared.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.830
Now let's think about
this negative 2y term.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.340
Are there any other
y's over here?

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.380
Well, it doesn't
look like there are.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.570
This is an 8xy.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.200
This is a 4.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.830
There's no just y's.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.660
So I can't really
add that to anything.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.370
So I'll just rewrite
it, negative 2y.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.030
And then 8xy--
well, once again, it

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.940
doesn't seem like that can
be added to anything else.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.320
So let's just write
that over again.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.220
And then finally, we just
have the constant term plus 4.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.520
And it pretty much
looks like we're done.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.430
We have simplified
this as much as we can.
