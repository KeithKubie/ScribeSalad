00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Why would be much more frightened to be this guy than him,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
a 12-volt car battery certainly scares him more than a 1.5,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
this TNT seems like it's going to do a lot more damage in it's explosion and this was a burns,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and this is certainly more intimidating than this.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Now, it's not always the case. What's more frightening has greater potential energy.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But in each of these situations, potential energy could somehow be converted into kinetic energy.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
If this rock would have fall, it would gain motions, speed as it fell to the ground.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
If this dynamite will explode, the shards will go flying off in all directions.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
If this bow were released, the arrow would fly through the air at high speed.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This one is a little harder to see, but if I were to connect the wire between these two terminals,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
we actually get the motion of what's called electrons through the wire,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
likewise here but more motion here.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This idea of energy transforming between potential energy and kinetic energy and even back again

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
is one that is fundamental to physics, and I hope that by the end of this unit,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
you'll be seeing everyday occurrences in terms of their energy transformations.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Now, all of these cases exhibited a different type of potential energy.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
This, we will call gravitational potential energy,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
burning and combustion and explosion is an example of chemical potential energy

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
as is the battery, and a bone arrow is an example of elastic potential energy.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
In this unit, we're going to focus on making calculations with gravitational potential energy

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and the problems that we didn't talk about elastic.

00:01:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Keep watching to learn how to use this incredible physics tool.
