00:00:10.867 --> 00:00:16.166
So I joined the Oklahoma
State Police Department in 1974.

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:19.800
When I retired in 2008, I was
at home watching The Young

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.233
and the Restless on the TV when
my wife came through there,

00:00:22.233 --> 00:00:24.066
and she said, you will
find something to do.

00:00:38.433 --> 00:00:41.000
Back in the 1800s, you
got caught the cattle,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.700
what happened?

00:00:42.867 --> 00:00:44.333
They'd find a rope
and they'd find a tree

00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:47.133
and they'd stamp your
ticket right there.

00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.100
Hey, what you got, man?

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.066
The rancher called me.

00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:53.066
He had yesterday
morning about 10

00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:54.734
steers that were in his corral.

00:00:54.734 --> 00:00:57.867
And when he got here yesterday
afternoon, they were gone.

00:00:57.867 --> 00:00:59.867
Cattle [inaudible] really
lucrative for the people

00:00:59.867 --> 00:01:01.600
who steal these cattle.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.233
If I steal your TV that
you spent $2000 for,

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:08.233
I maybe get $50 for it.

00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:10.834
But the cattle aren't like that.

00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:14.767
If I steal your cow, I can
take that cow to a stock market

00:01:14.767 --> 00:01:19.066
and it's going to bring
$1,200, $1,500 a head.

00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:20.900
It's quick money, if
you don't get caught.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.233
These tracks right here
looks they've got out.

00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:25.633
We want to stop this
kind of thing happening.

00:01:25.633 --> 00:01:27.533
But what these
guys, when we arrest

00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:29.300
these people when
they're stealing cattle,

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.300
it is not uncommon anymore.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.600
We hear it every day.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.166
The reason why is because
of their addictions to meth.
